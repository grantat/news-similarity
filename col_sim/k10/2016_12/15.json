    "text": "Babies Exposed to Zika Virus in First Trimester More Likely to Have Birth Defects, Study Says By Gillian Mohney Dec 14, 2016, 1:49 PM ET 0 Shares Play Mario Tama/Getty Images WATCH Babies Exposed to Zika Virus in 1st Trimester More Likely to Have Birth Defects, Study Says 0 Shares Email A first of its kind study of U.S.-born babies exposed to the Zika virus shows higher rates of birth defects for those exposed in the first trimester of pregnancy. The study, published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) is the first time researchers have tried to estimate the likelihood of birth defects, particularly brain abnormalities and microcephaly , developing in a fetus if a pregnant woman is infected with the Zika virus. The highest rates of birth defects appeared to occur when the pregnant women had the virus in the first trimester. In 85 women who had Zika symptoms or exposure to the virus in the first trimester, 11 percent of the infants had birth defects. Overall, six percent of infants born to women in the U.S. who were exposed to the Zika virus were found to have birth defects. \"These data highlight the critical importance of primary prevention as recommended by the current CDC guidelines,\" the authors wrote . Without the presence of Zika virus, microcephaly occurs in a range between two babies per 10,000 live births, or .0002 percent, and 12 babies per 10,000 live births, or .0012 percent, in the Unites States, according to the CDC. In this study of preliminary data, researchers from various public health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed information on pregnant women likely exposed to the Zika virus in the U.S. and all territories, except Puerto Rico, which is monitored separately. They identified 442 women, with an average age of 28, who were likely exposed to the Zika virus and who had completed pregnancies between December 2015 and September 2016. Of the 442 completed pregnancies, the researchers determined 26 infants had signs of birth defects, or approximately six percent. This included five fetuses that were found to have birth defects after the pregnancy ended via miscarriage, termination or still birth. \"The more you learn about his virus the nastier it gets,\" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told ABC News today. Twenty-two of the affected infants had brain abnormalities or microcephaly, a defect characterized by an abnormally small head. The four other affected infants had signs of other birth defects including eye and hearing abnormalities. Since the majority of people infected with the virus do not exhibit symptoms and tests to detect the disease in antibodies are not always clear, researchers followed women who were likely exposed to the virus either by traveling to areas where the virus was spreading via mosquitoes or via sexual transmission with an infected person. Schaffner said the study gives further evidence that any pregnant woman exposed to the virus should be monitored for a long after giving birth since some birth defects may not be evidence immediately after birth. \"Any baby born to a woman with Zika,\" Schaffner said, \"should be followed very, very carefully after birth even if they don't have microcephaly.\" As this is one of the first studies to estimate the percentage risk of developing birth defects from the Zika virus, researchers called their findings \"preliminary\" and called for further long-term study. In an accompanying editorial Dr. William Muller and Dr. Emily Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago , said even the preliminary findings can help doctors make decisions about patients exposed to the virus. 0 Shares ",

DEC. 14, 2016 By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve The Fed\u2019s economic outlook was essentially unchanged from the last round of forecasts in September. Fed officials continued to predict the economy would expand at an annual rate of about 2 percent for the next few years. They expect little further decline in the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.6 percent in November. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to reach 2 percent \u2014 the pace the Fed regards as healthy \u2014 and then stay there. It is a Goldilocks forecast. Not too hot, not too cold \u2014 just right. Fed officials predicted they would raise the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate a little more quickly in the coming years, reaching 2.1 percent by the end of 2018. In September they had predicted that it would reach 1.9 percent by the end of 2018 . The new projections, however, still reflected a significantly slower pace of increase than Fed officials predicted last December, when they expected the benchmark rate to reach 3.3 percent by the end of 2018 . Advertisement Continue reading the main story The combination of steady growth and faster rate increases implies that Fed officials expect to offset a modest increase in fiscal stimulus. The November elections have complicated the Fed\u2019s outlook. Republicans will control the White House and both chambers of Congress next year, setting the stage for significant changes in fiscal policy after years of gridlock. Mr. Trump has promised to increase economic growth through measures like tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The Fed has said that it expected to slowly increase its benchmark rate so long as the economy continues its own slow-and-steady expansion. If Republicans succeed in invigorating economic growth, however, the Fed is likely to raise rates more quickly . The greater the stimulus, the faster interest rates are likely to rise. Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works. \u201cYour expectation should depend very little on what you think that the F.O.M.C. is thinking and very much on your view of Trump policies and their macro effects,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on the Fed. As James Carville regularly reminded the other Clinton on the campaign trail: It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d The economy, for now, keeps plodding along. Steady job growth has reduced the unemployment rate to 4.6 percent, a level the Fed considers healthy. A little unemployment is natural as people move among jobs and businesses open and close. Several Fed districts reported emerging labor shortages in the central bank\u2019s latest compilation of economic reports, published in November . In the Philadelphia district, construction workers are hard to find. Atlanta reported a shortage of nurses; Kansas City, truck drivers; in Dallas, tech workers. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have said they see some signs of stronger wage growth. Inflation, too, has picked up a little in recent months. Yet both wages and inflation continue to rise more slowly than the Fed wants. Some economists argue that the Fed should wait until inflation strengthens before raising rates, to test whether a stronger economy would convince some people sidelined during the downturn to start looking for jobs. That would expand the labor force. Unemployment remains particularly high among minorities. That view, however, has found little support among Fed officials, who worry that interest rates will have to be raised more quickly if the central bank waits too long, increasing the chances that it would end up pushing the economy into recession. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cApparently Fed officials think the economy is growing too quickly,\u201d said Ady Barkan, the director of Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups that is pressing the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign. \u201cI doubt you can find many other Americans who share that opinion. And it\u2019s a strange conclusion to draw in the wake of an election that was so heavily impacted by voters\u2019 economic discontent.\u201d ",

While it was not the first time Duterte appeared to admit to murder, this was the first time he'd done so as president. And it outraged critics of his country's bloody war of drugs, which has left at least 4,500 Filipinos dead in the last five months. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte reviews honor guards during a departure ceremony at the Manila International Airport in Pasay City, south of Manila, Philippines, 13 December 2016. Duterte will visit Cambodia to boost bilateral ties, then he will pay a vitist to Singapore, which he stated are preparations for the Philippine chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2017. MARK R. CRISTINO / EPA \"By boasting about the blood on his own hands, President Duterte will further embolden police and vigilantes to blatantly violate laws and carry out more extrajudicial executions without fear of being held to account,\" Amnesty International said Wednesday. \"President Duterte should be fulfilling his obligations by ordering investigations into these killings and bringing those responsible to justice, not claiming a part in them.\" Earlier, Duterte's justice minister Vitaliano Aguirre II appeared to walk back his boss' controversial claim, saying the president \"exaggerated\" and that if he did kill anybody it \"must have been forced.\" But it was this kind of incendiary language about killing criminals that endeared Duterte to crime-weary Filipinos. During the 20 years he was mayor of Davao City, Duterte was nicknamed \"the death squad mayor\" after teams of hit men began rubbing out the city's drug dealers and addicts. He denied any role in the vigilante action but he praised the killings. Duterte made the killing admission in a speech Monday to a group of businessmen. \"In Davao, I used to do it personally,\" Duterte said. \"Just to show the guys that, if I can do it, why can't you?\" \"And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also. I was really looking for a confrontation so I could kill.\" Duterte also told the group he would not be bullied into stopping the harsh crackdown on criminals in light of criticism from President Obama or human rights groups. \"Sorry, I am not about to do that,\" he said. Duterte then appeared to double down on his claims while on a state visit Tuesday to Cambodia, according the Manila Times . This picture taken on October 29, 2016 shows police officers investigating a crime scene where two alleged drug dealers were gunned down by unidentified men in Manila.                                  Business has never been busier for undertaker Alejandro Ormeneta but, after five months on the frontlines of the Philippines' brutal drug war, he just wants the killings to stop. NOEL CELIS / AFP - Getty Images I (would) sometimes go along with them. If you say I shot someone, maybe I did. I was closing my eyes because I am scared of firing a gun,\" said Duterte. Back in 2015, Duterte admitted killing at least three men in Davao City suspected of kidnapping and rape. He was elected president the next year. Corky Siemaszko ",

Apparently, we are vastly ill-prepared to deal with it, according to Dr. Joseph Nuth, a prominent researcher with NASA\u2019s \u00a0Goddard Space Flight Center.\u00a0 Nuth was speaking at a meeting with nuclear scientists in San Francisco Monday when he made headlines for saying that \u201cthe biggest problem, basically, is there\u2019s not a hell of a lot we can do about it at the moment,\u201d when discussing the possibility of a civilization-ending asteroid or comet smashing into the planet , The Guardian reports.\u00a0 The researcher\u2019s bleak prediction came at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Nuth noted that, while these kinds of cataclysmic collisions are rare in Earth\u2019s history, they aren\u2019t unprecedented.\u00a0 \u201cBut on the other hand, they are the extinction-level events, things like dinosaur killers , they\u2019re 50 to 60 million years apart, essentially,\u201d The Guardian reports him as saying. \u201cYou could say, of course, we\u2019re due, but it\u2019s a random course at that point.\u201d Nuth noted that our planet had a \u201cclose encounter\u201d in 1996 when a comet whirred into Jupiter. Astronomers captured images of another such impact on Jupiter earlier this year. And one of our nearest planetary neighbors experienced a relatively close call in 2014, when a comet came \u201cwithin spitting distance of Mars .\u201d What makes that especially scary is that the comet was only discovered a mere 22 months before it buzzed the Red Planet. If that had been Earth, 22 months would would not be nearly enough time to prepare, Nuth stressed.\u00a0 Nuth said he has suggested that NASA build an \u201cinterceptor rocket\u201d that could be stationed at the agency\u2019s new planetary defense office. A ready-to-launch rocket that could be deployed within a year\u2019s notice \u201ccould mitigate the possibility of a sneaky asteroid coming in from a place that\u2019s hard to observe, like from the sun,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Of course, this kind of mission would require Congressional \u00a0approval, Nuth added; it\u2019s not just something NASA could do on its own. NASA created a Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) earlier this year to coordinate efforts to track so-called near-Earth objects \u2014 asteroids and comets that could cross into our cosmic neighborhood. The space agency estimates that it has spotted about 90 percent or more of the near-Earth objects larger than a kilometer in size. These would be the potentially catastrophic objects that science fiction often warns about. Smaller objects still pose a threat as well, and Nuth said\u00a0 Earthlings \u00a0have to be vigilant about these potential threats. So, how could we defend against these objects? At the talk, The Guardian reports Dr. Cathy Piesko of the Los Alamos National Laboratory said our options could include deploying \u201ca kinetic impactor\u201d \u2014 which she described as \u201cbasically a giant cannonball\u201d \u2014 or perhaps a nuclear warhead.\u00a0 But both would come with serious risks, and it would take years of preparation to figure out how to do it right. \u201cWe are very carefully doing our homework before finals week,\u201d Plesko said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be doing our calculations before something is coming. We need to have this work done.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Yahoo announced a new data breach. It's time to update passwords, but also beware phishing emails. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 12 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 Yahoo user? Be ready to refresh your account passwords. But beware: this is prime time for scammers to prey. The Internet company said late Wednesday as many as 1 billion user accounts may have been compromised in a breach that took place in September 2013. That comes on top of a breach involving as many as 500 million Yahoo users that the company reported in September. Yahoo is reaching out to users, advising them to change passwords and upgrade their security. It's also sending possibly affected users email. Look carefully.\u00a0Not all emails that look like they come from Yahoo are legit. Phishing emails from crooks masquerading as Yahoo may asks users to click on links. Yahoo's won't. They also won't contain attachments and never request users'\u00a0personal information, the company says. \"If an email you receive about these issues prompts you to click on a link, download an attachment, or asks you for information, the email was not sent by Yahoo and may be an attempt to steal your personal information. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from such suspicious emails,\" the company said. The company has posted examples of what that email looks like on its site . Change passwords, security questions Yahoo is advising users to change their passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts in which they used the same or similar information as with their\u00a0Yahoo account. Users should also consider enabling two-step authentication on their Yahoo accounts, to provide an extra and very strong level of security. This form of verification sends\u00a0a text message or call\u00a0to the user's\u00a0phone\u00a0with a code as a second verification step. The code which must be typed in\u00a0before the account can be opened. Instructions on how to enable two-step authentication in Yahoo are on its website. Review non-Yahoo accounts In addition, users need to think about passwords and security questions from\u00a0other accounts on which they gave the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account and possibly change them as well. Once hackers have access to ID and password information for one system, they routinely try the same combination against multiple other platforms to see which ones work, an easily automated process. Careful of clicking Users should avoid\u00a0clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails that claim to be updates from Yahoo or others about the breach. Yahoo is not sending such emails, it said. Hackers often use news of big breaches to conduct \"phishing\" campaigns, sending official-looking emails that make it seem as if Yahoo or other legitimate services are asking them to supply information or click through to a link to repair any damage\u00a0\u2014 something legitimate services will not do. How not to get duped by email phishing scams When in doubt, call or email the company that appears to be sending the message separately, don't go through the email you've been sent. Finally, all users should review their online accounts\u00a0for suspicious activity. That includes banks, credit card companies and\u00a0hotel and airline loyalty programs. 12 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hPoAAY ",

    "text": "Trump Names Rick Perry as Pick for Energy Secretary By Devin Dwyer Dec 14, 2016, 9:28 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Rick Perry: In A Minute 0 Shares President-elect Donald Trump named former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as his choice for secretary of energy in a statement this morning. Praising Perry's gubernatorial experience, Trump said Perry would \"do an amazing job\" in his new role. \"As the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy,\" Trump said in a statement released by his transition team. Perry said in a statement that he was \"humbled\" by Trump's trust in him. \"As the former governor of the nation's largest energy producing state, I know American energy is critical to our economy and our security. I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the development, stewardship and regulation of our energy resources, safeguarding our nuclear arsenal and promoting an American energy policy that creates jobs and puts America first.\" This newly expressed mutual admiration comes nearly a year and a half after a contentious primary season in which Perry and Trump ran against each other. Perry was one of the first in the 2016 race to attack Trump, calling him a \"cancer on conservatism.\" If confirmed by the Senate, Perry will lead the federal agency he said he wanted to eliminate but couldn't name in a famous \"oops\" moment during a 2011 GOP primary debate.

    "text": "Ryan Zinke could be on tap to head the Interior Department \u2014 and that has environmentalists worried Ryan Zinke Richard Drew / Associated Press Rep. Ryan Zinke arrives in Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 12, 2016. Rep. Ryan Zinke arrives in Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 12, 2016. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) William Yardley Contact Reporter Long before Ryan Zinke trained elite Navy Seals, served in Congress or became Donald Trump \u2019s likely choice for secretary of Interior, he was a boy who swam and caught crayfish in the Whitefish River in his native Montana. When it came time to choose his Eagle Scout project, he stopped playing in the river and started studying it. \u201cIt was the first time I ever looked at the environment with a critical eye,\u201d he wrote in his memoir, published last month, \u201cAmerican Commander.\u201d \u201cThe project I chose was to follow the banks of the river and look at the sources of any pollution or runoff\u2026. I took pictures of the railroad\u2019s oil holding ponds and looked at how the ponds of oil would overflow into the river. I looked at the storm drains dumping in the river, took soil samples, and proposed solutions to the degree a young student could. \u201cWhen an old logger downstream was mowing his lawn and caused a spark, which caused the river to catch on fire, I knew the source. The project promoted a lifetime of conservation values.\u201d Yet the depth of those conservation values has come into serious question since Zinke, a former Montana state lawmaker serving his first term in the House, entered politics. This week, environmental groups have expressed alarm at the prospect\u00a0of him\u00a0presiding over Interior, an agency with powerful sway over the fate of America\u2019s public lands, at a time when Trump has said he plans to roll back regulations in order to unleash a wave of fossil-fuel energy production. In an interview on Wednesday, Zinke would not\u00a0confirm that Trump had offered him the position or that he had accepted it, but he did say he\u00a0expected to make an announcement on Thursday and he discussed changes he wanted to see in the management of public lands as well as his view that\u00a0climate change science is \u201cunsettled.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re asked by the president to serve, it\u2019s awfully hard to say no, and I\u2019m loyal,\u201d Zinke\u00a0said. Under the current secretary, Sally Jewell , Interior has been at the center of President Obama \u2019s efforts to combat climate change. The agency employs 70,000 people and manages millions of acres of federal land, most of them\u00a0in the West. It includes the National Park Service,\u00a0the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees management of the drought-stricken Colorado River and the nation\u2019s largest reservoir, Lake Mead. The role of secretary has traditionally been filled by Westerners versed in the region\u2019s heated debates over land use.\u00a0 Zinke\u00a0says he believes\u00a0in \u201cmultiple uses\u201d for public lands and preserving them for posterity, yet what he has said and how he has voted have been\u00a0hard to reconcile at times, according to many conservation groups.

Ryan Zinke speaks with a supporter in Billings, Mont., as he campaigns for reelection to a second term as the state's sole representative in the U.S. House on Oct. 20, 2016. (Matt Brown / Associated Press) \u201cCongressman Ryan Zinke has been all over the map on public lands,\u201d Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Western Priorities, wrote on Tuesday. Rokala cited a pledge Zinke signed in 2012 to \u201clegally and administratively oppose\u201d federal agencies and \u201crestore the rightful powers over the land to the state and private ownership,\u201d an idea fiercely opposed by conservationists. This year, she noted, Zinke voted for a bill that would have transferred control of millions of acres of national forest lands to states. However, he also resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention because the party platform supported transferring some public lands to states. The League of Conservation Voters has given Zinke a 3% lifetime score. While Zinke has supported preserving the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is viewed as sacrosanct by many conservationists, he has also opposed a new rule to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas methane during energy production on public land and a moratorium on new coal leasing. He praised\u00a0a preliminary federal study that said\u00a0hydraulic fracturing to produce oil and gas did not cause systemic damage to drinking water \u2014\u00a0but that finding was reversed in a final report this week. In his memoir, co-written with Scott McEwen, who also co-wrote the bestselling \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d Zinke, 55, praised Theodore Roosevelt for setting aside land under the Antiquities Act and \u201cwrestling 230 million acres away from timber and railroad interests and placing the land under federal protection.\u201d But Zinke also wrote that\u00a0Roosevelt has been misrepresented over the last century, saying\u00a0that \u201cmultiple use has come under fire as special interest groups have misused policy to successfully block resource management, reduce public access, and even lock out local communities from being part of the land use process.\u201d He has been critical of certain logging restrictions,\u00a0road closures and bans on mountain biking\u00a0in some areas. Zinke, who received an undergraduate degree in geology from the University of Oregon in 1984, has questioned the broad scientific consensus that climate change is happening and that humans are largely the cause of it. In the interview on Wednesday, he said, \u201cThe climate is changing, I don\u2019t think you can deny that. But climate has always changed.\u201d Describing himself as \u201ca former geologist,\u201d he first said, \u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0think there\u2019s any question that man has had an influence\u201d on climate change. Later, he\u00a0said that influence was \u201clikely,\u201d but\u00a0that \u201cwhat that influence is, exactly, is still under scrutiny.\u201d\u00a0 He was critical of Obama administration policies that require projects on public lands to be assessed for their potential climate impacts. \u201cIn this next administration, there will be a review of job-killing regulation that is not based on sound science,\u201d he said. Zinke said that he supported the National Environmental Policy Act, which some conservatives criticize as too restrictive, and that he wanted to see major improvements in infrastructure and employee morale in the National Park Service. He said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that our parks are world class.\u201d After college, Zinke\u00a0spent 23 years in the Navy SEALs, rising to become a commander before leaving the service in 2008. He was elected to the state Senate in 2008 and to Congress in 2014. The front of his campaign bus featured the symbol of the Navy SEALs. The logo on his congressional website calls him \u201cCommander,\u201d not Congressman. His policies shifted rightward as he moved from the state legislature to Congress. In\u00a0his 2014 campaign for Congress, he called Hillary Clinton \"the real enemy\" and \"the Antichrist.\" \"A lot of what a military officer does is not just leading troops in combat,\" Zinke told The Times that year. \"It's also doing budgets. It's solving complex problems. If you can sit down with warlords, you can certainly sit down with different parties and folks with different interests and come out with an amenable solution.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rick Perry was picked to run the Department of Energy , cutting down dead trees is the new Gold Rush happening in California , Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade is coming back , and the National Film Registry\u2019s Class of 2016 has arrived .

    "text": "\u201cReckless disregard for data security will not be tolerated,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement . It also found Ashley Madison created fake female profiles to entice male users. In some instances, the attorney general said, it used portions of the profile photographs of actual users who had not had account activity within the previous year as the photographs in the fake profiles that it created. The website - whose slogan was \u201cLife is short. Have an affair\u201d - is marketed to people looking for extramarital relationships. It once purported to have about 39 million members. Husbands and wives across the world were confronted with their partners\u2019 extramarital affairs after the catastrophic leak spewed electronic evidence of infidelity across the internet. The hacking triggered extortion crimes and led to unconfirmed reports of suicides. Forums such as Reddit, a user-powered news and discussion site, carried stories of anguished husbands and wives confronting their partners after finding their data among the massive dump of information. The New York attorney general\u2019s office said the settlement with the company is for $17.5 million but said the remainder of the $17.5 million payment is suspended based on Ruby\u2019s inability to pay. It\u2019s unclear why the company couldn\u2019t afford to pay the entire settlement. In addition to monetary penalties, the attorney general\u2019s office said Ruby agreed to cease engaging in certain deceptive practices, to not create fake profiles, and to implement a stronger data security program. \u201cThis case represents one of the largest data breaches that the FTC has investigated to date, implicating 36 million individuals worldwide,\u201d FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said. \u201cThe global settlement requires AshleyMadison.com to implement a range of more robust data security practices that will better-protect its users\u2019 personal information from criminal hackers going forward.\u201d Vermont Attorney General William H. Sorrell said in a statement that creating fake profiles and selling services that are not delivered is unacceptable behavior for any dating website. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement closes an important chapter on the company\u2019s past and reinforces our commitment to operating with integrity,\u201d Rob Segal, newly appointed CEO of Ruby, said in a statement.

(Photo: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports) 42 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE The NBA and National Basketball Players Association reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement, the two sides announced Wednesday. The new seven-year deal ensures labor peace through the 2023-24 season and a run of 13 consecutive years without a lockout. Credit goes to the league and players for striking an agreement six months before it became a serious issue in late June. Of course, it\u2019s easier to reach a deal when money isn\u2019t a contentious sticking point, like it was during the 2011 lockout. In order to give both sides enough time to review the terms of the agreement and vote to ratify, the parties have agreed to extend the mutual deadline to opt out of the existing CBA from Dec. 15, 2016, to Jan. 13, 2017. Ratification requires a simple majority from owners and simple majority from players. Here are the key details: The split of basketball-related income (BRI) with remain an approximate 51%-49% split in favor of player, and an expanded definition of BRI is expected to benefit players and owners financially. Players are expected to receive $1.5 billion more next season than they did in first season (2011-12) of previous deal. Rookie scale salaries, veteran minimum salaries and certain free-agent salary exceptions, including the mid-level exception, will increase. The entry age for the NBA draft will remain 19, and U.S. players must also be one year removed from high school to enter the draft. The preseason will be shortened, and the regular season will be longer in an effort to further reduce the number of back-to-back games and four games in five nights that teams play. The players\u2019 union will handle negotiations with companies for a player-likeness in licensing agreements, just as it is for the NFL, MLB and NHL. For the past three decades, the NBA handled those negotiations, and it was a 50-50 split. The NBA is expected to work with the union in those player-likeness negotiations. The NBA will remain in control of trademarks/logos and team name licensing rights.\u00a0 New CBA includes domestic violence policy focused on education, resources, support, treatment and counseling.

Joshua Samuel Aaron, who had been living in Moscow, is charged in connection with the 2014 hack that exposed the records of more than 83 million JPMorgan Chase customers. The FBI, the Secret Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission all sought the 32-year-old Aaron's capture on 16 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, computer hacking, identity theft and several related conspiracy charges, federal prosecutors said. Authorities have called the scheme \"securities fraud on cyber-steroids.\" Play October 2014: JPMorgan Chase Reveals Scale of Data Breach 1:17 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161215005047if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/337336387691\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Aaron \u2014 who agreed to return to the United States to face the charges at a hearing Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan \u2014 was arrested Wednesday as soon as he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, federal authorities said. Almost immediately, the word \"CAPTURED\" was slapped on to Aaron's FBI wanted poster. Aaron's two alleged co-conspirators \u2014 Israeli citizens Gery Shalon, the alleged ringleader, and Ziv Orenstein \u2014 were extradited to the United States from Israel in June. In a statement Wednesday, Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, described their alleged operation as \"hacking as a business model.\" Joshua Samuel Aaron, a k a 'Mike Shields,' in his FBI wanted poster, which was updated Wednesday. FBI According to a superseding federal indictment filed late last year, Aaron \u2014 using the alias \"Mike Shields\" \u2014 was the U.S. coordinator and public face of an operation that snatched the personal data of more than 100 million people at 12 major financial institutions from 2012 to 2015. According to the indictment, many of the victims were investors who were scammed out of millions of dollars because of fraudulently inflated stock prices. But, separately, financial institutions also lost millions of more dollars via penalties for fraudulent charges to credit and debit cards that the ring allegedly used, the indictment said. By far, the hacking ring's biggest score was at JPMorgan Chase, where the three men allegedly obtained the data of more than 83 million customers in the summer of 2014, according to the FBI. JPMorgan Chase later told the Securities and Exchange Commission that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, birthdates and Social Security numbers were all stolen. Play ",

By David Filipov December 14 at 3:01 PM Follow @davidfilipov MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladi\u00admir Putin is winning.\u00a0For now.\u00a0 The Russian leader\u00a0is winning because the\u00a0post-Cold War order he has railed against has been thrown into chaos, and the Kremlin\u2019s fingerprints are widely seen to be all over it.\u00a0 A year ago, Russia faced a united Europe, an expanded NATO alliance, a paucity of geopolitical allies and the possibility of four more years of poor relations with the United States under a Hillary Clinton presidency. Today,\u00a0Putin\u2019s military contingent in Syria just helped the government essentially retake Aleppo. The CIA has concluded that his hackers worked to help elect Donald Trump, who has dismissed commitments to Europe and touted better ties with Russia. [ CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House ] President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) In Washington, London, Berlin and Paris, Soviet-style propaganda is back. It\u2019s been thoroughly updated, though, and comes packaged as fake news, cyberattacks and WikiLeaks. Whether or not the\u00a0Kremlin\u00a0is guilty of doing all the things Western accusers say it is, Russia is now considered a master purveyor of geopolitical disorder. And that, for Putin, is a win. \u201cOf course the Kremlin likes the fact of such an atmosphere of chaos,\u201d Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Putin adviser, said in a recent interview. \u201cBecause we are traders of chaos. We sell it, and the more chaos there is in the world, the better it is for the Kremlin.\u201d\u00a0 But Putin\u2019s successes, if that is what they are, are\u00a0tactical and temporary, said Fiona Hill, a Brookings Institution scholar and co-author of a biography of the Russian leader. For years, Putin has been the world\u2019s leader in geopolitical disruption, and the United States under President Obama has been a predictable force and therefore an easy target, she said. If Putin really did contribute to Trump\u2019s victory, he may just have handed his crown over to his biggest rival. \u201cThe land of unpredictability and surprise is the land that Putin and the Kremlin have inhabited for the last part of the last 10 years,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re not alone. Trump is going to be the great disrupter.\u201d In the long run, Russia needs the United States to be, if not a friend and a partner, then a neutralized, inward-looking force, she said: \u201cNo one knows if Trump is going to make it that.\u201d Putin has consistently spoken about the need for\u00a0modern Russia to have friends.\u00a0Unlike during the Cold War, Russia is not trying to transform the world order with its own ideology. Russia does not need world revolution. It needs to parlay its status as a master of disruption into a magnet for business partners.\u00a0\u00a0 [ Putin wants revenge and respect, and hacking the U.S. is his way of getting it ] In this sense, Trump\u2019s victory is \u201ca tactical victory for Putin,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center, but also \u201cone that comes with exaggerated expectations\u201d because of the inability to predict what a Trump presidency will bring.\u00a0\u201cIn some sense, it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Kolesnikov said. Case in point: Trump\u2019s choice of ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson, whose ties to Russia include major oil deals and a 2013 Order of Friendship award, as secretary of state. Some Russian officials have had trouble hiding their satisfaction with a choice that appears to showcase Russia\u2019s newfound influence. \u201cOne can assert with more certainty that it is the attitude toward Russia that has become one of decisive factors in the final choice in favor of the businessman from ExxonMobil, who has such obvious ties and interests with respect to our country, [and who is] an opponent of the anti-Russian sanctions,\u201d said Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the Committee on International Affairs in the upper house of the Russian parliament. Translation: Winning. The trouble with all this Russian gamesmanship, Pavlovsky said, is that it is making enemies among people with long memories. And that is the paradox at the heart of the Putin worldview. Russia\u2019s leaders may enjoy watching the West chase its tail looking for clues of Kremlin meddling, but Moscow does not want to shoulder the blame.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact that there are people who are convinced that Russia acted on behalf of Donald Trump is frightening,\u201d one senior Russian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, said Tuesday. \u201cIn the long run it could be very dangerous for people to think that Russia may interfere with other people\u2019s elections.\u201d This explains the considerable efforts on the part of Putin and his aides to temper their enthusiasm for the new administration, at least in public. Consider Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s choice of Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely illogical to make any forecasts, not to mention to cherish some dreams, that everything will all of a sudden change instantly and everything that couldn\u2019t gain traction and was barely moving will suddenly follow some amazingly successful scenario,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cWe are sober enough and realize that this won\u2019t happen.\u201d Similarly, Putin and his aides repeatedly and vehemently deny allegations of interference in the Brexit vote, as well as the\u00a0U.S. intelligence accusation\u00a0that\u00a0the Russian government helped provide WikiLeaks with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign staff. They also deny any intention to interfere in upcoming German elections. [ U.S. accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections ] Putin dismissed the U.S. allegations as \u201c hysteria \u201d intended \u201conly to distract the attention of the American people from the substance of what hackers had put out.\u201d On Wednesday, Peskov called the charges \u201cmyths, bedtime stories and boogeymen\u201d and suggested that unsuccessful politicians in the West are trying to blame Moscow for their failures.\u00a0\u00a0 The allegations have not hurt Putin\u2019s approval rating at home, which jumped from 81\u00a0percent in June to 86\u00a0percent in November, according to the Moscow-based\u00a0 Levada Analytical Center . Every time accusations of campaign interference fly, the Kremlin charges hypocrisy (American advisers helped Boris Yeltsin win reelection in 1996). And it has brought up another good old tool, denying it all \u2014 sanctions, hacking suspicions, the international sports doping scandal \u2014 as Russophobia. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou all know that we have encountered attempts to pressure us from abroad over these last years,\u201d Putin said in his annual address to parliament this month. \u201cThey have used every means, from spreading myths about Russian aggression, propaganda and meddling in others\u2019 elections to persecuting our athletes, including our Paralympic athletes.\u201d The approach seems to be working. A poll published in November by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Levada Center found that only 23\u00a0percent of Russians say they have a positive view of the United States.\u00a0 Winning.\u00a0 \u201cThe majority of Russians doesn\u2019t even believe in the doping affair, not to mention this interference in the American elections,\u201d Kolesnikov said. And many who believe it appreciate \u201cthe image of Putin as a strong, cunning man.\u201d \u201cThis is a win-win strategy for the Russian president,\u201d he said. At least for now.\u00a0\u00a0 Natalya Abbakumova contributed to this report. \u00a0Read more ",

By Jim Tankersley December 14 at 5:21 PM Follow @jimtankersley An interest rate hike will affect anyone with a home mortgage, car loan, savings account or money in the stock market. Here's what it means for your wallet. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in a year and signaled that rates could continue to rise next year more quickly than officials had expected. The increase was unanimous and modest, raising the Fed\u2019s key interest rate by a quarter point, from a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent to a range of 0.5 to 0.75 percent. It reflects Fed officials' confidence in the strengthening of the U.S. economy and what officials see as budding signs of higher inflation. But unlike corporate executives and stock traders, Fed officials do not appear to be anticipating a massive growth boost next year from economic policies implemented by President-elect Donald Trump, but\u00a0they appear set to raise rates faster if those policies were to cause an overheating in the economy. [ How a Fed rate hike could affect your wallet ] Markets were slightly up immediately after the announcement, but they started to dive\u00a0about an hour later, after Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen concluded\u00a0a news conference about the rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.6 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid\u00a00.8 percent, and the Nasdaq tech index was down 0.5 percent. Yellen told reporters that she and the Federal Open Market Committee were \u201crecognizing the considerable progress the economy has made\u201d toward full employment and an inflation target of 2 percent. She indicated that she did not see much need for a large, deficit-financed boost from federal fiscal policy, either tax cuts or spending increases. \u201cI would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment,\u201d Yellen said. She then added that she was not trying to advise Trump and Congress on fiscal issues. [ The eternal mystique of Goldman Sachs ] Economic projections also released by the\u00a0central bank indicate that the Fed now expects the economy to grow 1.9 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017.\u00a0The projections show that the group expects the Fed to increase rates three times in 2017, to a rate of 1.4 percent by year's end. Its September projections signaled only two expected hikes next year. Analysts have warned that if Trump and Congress agree to slash tax rates and increase spending in areas such as infrastructure the Fed could be forced to raise rates faster than expected to counter rising prices. Yellen highlighted uncertainty over those policies at her news conference but said some Fed officials had tried to incorporate expected fiscal changes in their forecasts. Since Trump\u2019s election, markets have jumped \u2014 with the Dow closing in on a record-breaking 20,000\u00a0\u2014 and long-term rates and the dollar have increased. [ Trump Treasury pick vows to curtail Wall Street regulations ] Several analysts said the Fed was right to take that approach to the new administration\u2019s policies. \u201cThe Fed will likely be in wait-and-see mode, given this substantial policy uncertainty,\u201d said Doug Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, \u201cand we view this prudency a virtue.\u201d Much of the Fed statement released Wednesday was unchanged from November, when the Fed declined to raise rates, choosing \u201cto wait for some further evidence of continued progress\u201d toward maximum employment in the economy and a target inflation rate of 2 percent. Officials said Wednesday, as they said a month ago, that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced\u201d \u2014 meaning growth is as likely to speed up as it is to slow down. Fed officials now judge the overall inflation rate to be 1.5 percent, up from 1.3 percent in September, but still well below target. They judge core inflation, which excludes volatile commodities such as gasoline prices, to be 1.7 percent. [ Donald Trump still does not understand the unemployment rate ] In the statement, officials said that \u201cinflation has increased since earlier this year,\u201d a change from November, when the statement said that \u201cinflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year.\u201d Officials also said that measures of inflation compensation \u201chave moved up considerably but remain low.\u201d\u00a0Last month, the word \u201cconsiderably\u201d did not appear in that line. The Fed's decision drew criticism from some liberal economists who want rates to stay as low as possible to further boost employment while inflation remains below target. \u201cThe Fed's action today was unwelcome but not unexpected. Still huge economic risks and little evidence of an inflation problem\u201d economist and former treasury secretary Larry Summers\u00a0wrote in a tweet. Yellen, in her news conference, said she does not favor running a \u201chigh-pressure economy\u201d where inflation might overshoot its target. \u201cI do want to make clear,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I have not recommended running a hot economy as some sort of experiment.\u201d The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point Dec. 14 and signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017 as the Trump administration takes over with promises to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation. (Reuters) The central bank last raised rates at its December meeting a year ago, its first step toward moving\u00a0the Fed from what economists call the zero-lower bound \u2014 meaning interest rates hovering around zero percent. Trump has promised to cut taxes for individuals and corporations and to boost infrastructure spending by as much as $1 trillion through tax credits that his team says will pay for themselves. Although\u00a0Trump praised the Fed chair during his campaign, saying he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Yellen, he was mostly critical. Accusing Yellen and the Fed\u00a0of keeping rates low to help President Obama, Trump said in September:\u00a0\u201cI think she is very political, and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself.\u201d Yellen's term ends in early 2018. Asked about whether she would leave her post when the president-elect takes office, the Fed chair said: \u201cI do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven\u2019t made any decision about the future.\u201d Analysts did not expect Fed officials to change their forecasts of future increases this month based on an expectation of what Trump and Congress might do. \u201cWe very much doubt that FOMC members want to be accused of seeking to influence Congress and the new administration,\u201d analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote this week, \u201cgiven how unpopular the Fed is already with Republican politicians.\u201d business ",

AP Tom Hanks played real-life pilot hero Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger in 'Sully.' (Photo: Warner Bros.) The Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations announced Wednesday morning featured a few whopping surprises. The union representing movie and TV\u00a0actors nominated\u00a0Emily Blunt for the critically toasted The Girl on a Train\u00a0and the cast of the arthouse drama Captain Fantastic for acting awards. But in each category, there was at least one shocking oversight. Here are the biggest snubs in the\u00a0SAG Awards, which will be given out\u00a0Jan.\u00a029 (TNT and TBS, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT): Tom Hanks,\u00a0Sully:\u00a0Yes, Tom Hanks' best actor oversight \u00a0for Sully was the story of\u00a0Monday's Golden Globe nominations. But the beloved actor, who proudly showed his SAG card when he won for\u00a0Forrest Gump at the first-ever SAG Awards in 1995, suffered a second big blow at the hands of\u00a0his fellow actors. \"Being shut out here does not bode well for his Oscar chances,\" says Erik\u00a0Davis, managing editor of the\u00a0movie site Fandango.com. Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton star in 'Loving.' \u00a0(Photo: Ben Rothstein) Loving:\u00a0Ruth Negga and Joel \u00a0Edgerton\u00a0have received raves and Oscar contender status for their roles as an interracial couple in Jeff Nichols' civil rights romance\u00a0Loving.\u00a0However, both actors and the cast were shut out of the SAG nominations. Full list: Who got nominated for a SAG Award? Cast of La La Land:\u00a0Both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling received SAG acting nominations for director Damien Chazelle's musical comedy\u00a0La La Land.\u00a0However, the Oscar front-runner lost out in the best-cast category, the SAG equivalent of best picture. Meanwhile, fellow Oscar contenders Moonlight and Manchester By the Sea\u00a0made the cut, along with Hidden Figures, Captain Fantastic and Fences. Martin Scorsese's as-yet unseen 'Silence' was shut out of both Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. \u00a0(Photo: Kerry Brown) Silence:\u00a0Martin Scorsese's recently completed passion project Silence, starring Andrew Garfield,\u00a0Adam Driver and Liam Neeson\u00a0as\u00a0priests in 17th-century Japan, suffered from a lack of screening opportunities. With few voters for early awards shows able to see the film, it missed out on Golden Globe nominations Monday,\u00a0followed by a complete shutout for SAG\u00a0Awards. \"It's not that the film doesn't deserve nominations\u00a0\u2014 it does,\" Davis says. \"The problem is it debuted so late.\" Annette Bening,\u00a020th Century Women:\u00a0Bening has been an awards front-runner for her emotional\u00a0performance as a strong single mother in writer/director Mike Mills' coming-of-age drama, receiving Critics' Choice and Golden Globe nominations. But the actress and film struck out\u00a0in the SAGs. 'Manchester By the Sea' sails with 4 SAG Awards nominations Evan Rachel Wood,\u00a0Westworld: Thandie Newton received a best actress nomination for her android brothel worker role in HBO's critically acclaimed series\u00a0Westworld, but droid centerpiece Wood was overlooked in the same category. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins missed out for his role as the enigmatic founder of the theme park. Michael Shannon,\u00a0Nocturnal Animals: \u00a0Aaron Taylor-Johnson took a surprise Golden Globe\u00a0acting nomination for his role in Tom Ford's second feature film. But Nocturnal Animals was denied at the SAGs, including Michael Shannon, an awards favorite\u00a0for his role as detective Bobby Andes. Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell on FX's 'The Americans.' \u00a0(Photo: Patrick Harbron, FX) The Americans:\u00a0The FX series broke through its Emmy nomination curse this fall and earned Golden Globe\u00a0acting nominations for stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys. But the Russian spies living in America received nothing at the\u00a0SAG Awards, as the drama was shut out. Jessica Chastain,\u00a0Miss Sloane: \u00a0As a sought-after Washington lobbyist seeking gun control legislation, Chastain has earned rave reviews, awards front-runner status\u00a0and a Golden Globe nomination. But director John Madden's\u00a0Miss Sloane and Chastain were voted down by SAG. ",

The donkeys made a run for it, albeit more of a slow trot, when Mount Laurel officers arrived on the scene Saturday. The officers yelled and used to a patrol car to corral the animals during the slow pursuit. True to their stubbornness, police say the donkeys did not bray their address. But, the officers managed to return the animals, unharmed, to the enclosure from which they escaped. 0 Shares ",

President-elect Donald Trump meets with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower in New York on Wednesday. From left are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Trump. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Evan Halper and David Pierson Contact Reporters It wasn\u2019t so much a reckoning as a reboot. The nation\u2019s top tech executives couldn\u2019t know what to expect when they headed to Trump Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday for what President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0transition team had billed as an innovation \u201csummit.\u201d They had reason to fear an ambush. But if Trump holds grudges against Silicon Valley for the way that many of its denizens maligned and ridiculed him at every step of the presidential campaign, he worked hard not to let them show. If Trump\u2019s opening comments were any indication, this was no repeat of that ill-fated meeting he\u00a0called with broadcast and cable TV news executives days after the election, during which he mostly dressed them down. If any grudges were in the air, they were over who was not in the 25th floor meeting room Wednesday. Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News : \u201cOh, I would certainly implement that \u2014 absolutely.\" On Tuesday, hundreds of members of the technology industry... When asked a year ago on the campaign trail whether he thought that the United States should create a database of Muslims in the country, Donald Trump said in an interview with NBC News : \u201cOh, I would certainly implement that \u2014 absolutely.\" On Tuesday, hundreds of members of the technology industry... (Tracey Lien and Melissa Etehad) Trump\u2019s favorite social media platform, Twitter, was absent, for example. Politico attributed it to retribution for the company refusing during the campaign to abide Trump\u2019s request to generate a #CrookedHillary emoji. Twitter\u2019s refusal to create a digital running stick figure holding a money bag is a grievance that his director of digital advertising aired on Medium a few weeks ago. Trump representatives denied that was why Twitter was left out of the high-tech confab. They said Twitter didn\u2019t make the cut because it wasn\u2019t a big enough company. It has a market capitalization of about $13.8 billion, less than half that of Tesla , which  was included in the meeting. \u00a0Trump himself boasted at the top of the meeting about the deluge of requests to attend. \u201cI won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had, asking to come to this meeting,\u201d Trump said. He looked to Pay Pal co-founder Peter Thiel , an eccentric billionaire who was among the lone tech giants to back Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 and who now is seen by many tech executives as a potential lifeline in the new administration \u2014 as he sent out invitations. \u201cPeter would sort of say, \u2018You know, that company's too small.\u2019\u201d Those executives that did make the cut, Trump declared, led \u201cmonster companies.\u201d They included\u00a0 Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Elon Musk of Tesla, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. \u201cI'm here to help you folks do well,\u201d Trump said, before taking credit for the bump in the stock market that followed his election. \u201cAnd you're doing well right now and I'm very honored by the bounce. They're all talking about the bounce. So right now everybody in this room has to like me \u2014 at least a little bit.\u201d It was the get-along side of Trump on full display. The meeting was to be a symbol of an administration that would not hew to ideology but the best ideas. Trump\u2019s representatives spent the hours leading up to the meeting talking to the press about how good Trump is at listening,\u00a0even to the people who despise him. Plenty of folks back in Silicon Valley weren\u2019t buying it. The executives who flew to New York found themselves confronted with letters, petitions and public scoldings from colleagues who reminded them that Trump has yet to disavow any parts of his agenda that most appalled Silicon Valley during the election. \u201cNow, more than ever, tech leaders must stand up for human dignity, and examine their role in public discourse,\u201d EBay founder Pierre Omidyar wrote as he retweeted an article that pilloried tech leaders for going to Trump Tower. Nearly two dozen advocacy groups, including Amnesty International USA and Democracy for America, demanded to know why most of the companies at the meeting are refusing to pledge not to help Trump build any type of registry for Muslims, as he suggested during the campaign. More than 640 tech workers, many of them from firms represented at the Trump Tower meeting, vowed to undermine any \u201ccreation of databases of identifying information for the United States government to target individuals based on race, religion, or national origin.\u201d Reports from inside the meeting room suggest that the tech leaders did not heed the call for confrontation. Amazon  Chief Executive Bezos, whose ownership of the Washington Post made him an occasional focus of Trump\u2019s ire during the campaign, declared the meeting \u201cvery productive.\u201d \u201cI shared my view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country,\u201d Bezos said in a statement. Earlier in the day, Trump added Uber CEO\u00a0Travis Kalanick and Tesla\u2019s Musk to his business advisory council, which previously had only one representative from the tech industry:\u00a0Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM. Both Kalanick and Musk were bitter critics of Trump during the race. Kalanick said last year that he\u2019d move to China if Trump won the election. Musk had called Trump \u201cnot the right guy\u201d for the presidency in a November interview with CNBC. The Tesla leader\u2019s companies are heavily invested in green energy, setting him up for a possible clash with Trump over climate change policy and subsidies for renewables. But Musk can be a nimble political player, building strategic relationships with others who share many of Trump\u2019s views, such as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). Trump showered the group with praise. And before reporters were ushered out of the room, he made a point of assuaging the tech leaders\u2019 concerns about his threats to slap tariffs on companies that manufacture their products abroad, as most big Silicon Valley firms do. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders,\u201d Trump told them. \u201cThere's nobody like you in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cThere's nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along \u2026 we're going to be there for you. And you'll call my people, you'll call me. It doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here.\u201d Halper reported from Washington and Pierson from Los Angeles.\u00a0 Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, the chairs of Google parent company Alphabet Inc. Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, and Tesla's Elon Musk were among the attendees. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, Trump children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., and Wilbur Ross, Trump's selection to head the Commerce Department, also attended the meeting. Related: Execs Worth a Whopping $3 Trillion Just Walked into Trump Tower Executives exited the meeting with mostly smiles but uninterested in speaking to media gathered in the Trump Tower lobby. Many of the top Silicon Valley executives seated around the table supported Democrat Hillary Clinton during the contentious presidential race, a fact Trump hinted at at the outset of the meeting. \"They're all talking about the bounce so everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit,\" Trump said, referring to the stock market. \"And we're going to have that bounce continue and perhaps even more importantly we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation.\" During the campaign, Trump clashed with a number of the companies represented Wednesday. His most notable attacks were directed at Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post. The Post was one of a number of media targets, including NBC News, Trump called out for what he perceived as unfair coverage of his campaign. Bezos told CNBC in a statement that the meeting was \"very productive.\" \"I found today's meeting with the President-elect, his transition team, and tech leaders to be very productive. I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech\u2014agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing\u2014everywhere,\" Bezos said. Related: Team Trump Has Bad Blood With Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Notably absent the meeting was a representative from Twitter, whose platform Trump utilized before, during and after the campaign. \"The conference table was only so big,\" RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer said on MSNBC after the meeting. \"There was a lot of companies if you go down the list of the top tech companies, I guarantee you, you'll find additional ones there. This was not an intentional slight.\" \"There are only so many people that can actually sit around a conference table. It was packed,\" he added. It's the latest in what has already been an eventful week of meetings at Trump Tower. Rapper Kanye West, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and NFL greats Ray Lewis and Jim Brown were among the notable non-politicians to meet with Trump in recent days. Andrew Rafferty ",

Lise Cox was at work and had no direct role in the death of the 13-year-old boy Monday. But the prosecutor's office says she failed to properly store the gun and was aware that her grandsons knew where to find the weapon. The victim, Emarjae Watkins, was shot in the back by another boy and died. The 58-year-old Cox heard the charges in court Wednesday. A not-guilty plea was entered by the judge. She didn't have a lawyer at the arraignment. A 13-year-old boy accused of firing the gun is being charged in juvenile court. 0 Shares ",

The government says President-elect Donald Trump must divest all financial interests in his splashy new Washington hotel or be in breach of his lease the moment he becomes president next month, House Democrats said Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) Joseph Tanfani Contact Reporter Of all his worldwide business ventures, Donald Trump \u2019s new luxury hotel in Washington , just a few blocks from the White House , is among\u00a0his proudest jewels. During the campaign, he bragged about his work on the hotel and\u00a0plugged the business at news conferences. \u201cWith the notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted piece of real estate in Washington, D.C., the best location,\u201d Trump said at\u00a0the grand opening in October. But as he prepares to take office, the Trump International Hotel\u00a0in the historic Old Post Office building has become the most obvious example of the potential conflicts posed by Trump\u2019s worldwide holdings. Trump leases the building from the federal General Services Administration, one of the agencies that will be under his control, meaning that he would be, in effect, his landlord\u2019s boss. The tricky position the hotel project has created for the\u00a0GSA became apparent on Wednesday, when congressional Democrats released a letter that quoted a senior agency official as confirming that the GSA believes Trump must sell his interest in the project or be in violation of a clause in the lease that\u00a0says that no federal elected official can be a part of the deal. The ban on ownership by elected officials is a standard part of GSA leases. The\u00a0agency \u201creads this provision as we do, which is a categorical ban on the president of the United States or any other elected official having any financial interest in this lease,\u201d the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote. To fix the conflict, Trump would have to divest himself of his ownership. Turning over the hotel\u2019s management to his children would not be good enough, the Democrats\u2019\u00a0letter said, citing a briefing by Michael Gelber, a career GSA employee who\u2019s now deputy commissioner in charge of building services. Tribune news services Donald Trump 's new luxury hotel in Washington, D.C., has been attracting foreign envoys, special interest groups \u2014 and a bit of controversy. One of the latest groups to book the hotel is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank whose big donors gathered there Tuesday night for a speech... Donald Trump 's new luxury hotel in Washington, D.C., has been attracting foreign envoys, special interest groups \u2014 and a bit of controversy. One of the latest groups to book the hotel is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank whose big donors gathered there Tuesday night for a speech... (Tribune news services) But the GSA quickly walked that back Wednesday, saying it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to announce that Trump had to divest himself of his holdings. \u201cIn fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the president-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized, and he has assumed office,\u201d the agency said in a statement. The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, insisted that the GSA\u2019s\u00a0interpretation of the lease provision was clear \u2014\u00a0even if it technically won\u2019t be a problem until Trump is sworn in. \u201cWe stand 100% behind our letter,\u201d he said. Transition officials on Wednesday wouldn\u2019t answer questions about the GSA lease. Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said that Trump would make sure \u201cthere\u2019s a clear split\u00a0between his business\u00a0and his ability to focus on the country.\u201d But doing that is\u00a0not easy, he said. Donald Trump announced late Monday night that he would hand over control of his businesses to his adult sons before his inauguration and vowed that the companies would make \"no new deals\" while he is in office. In a pair of tweets sent after 11 p.m., Trump wrote: \"Even though I... President-elect Donald Trump announced late Monday night that he would hand over control of his businesses to his adult sons before his inauguration and vowed that the companies would make \"no new deals\" while he is in office. In a pair of tweets sent after 11 p.m., Trump wrote: \"Even though I... (Elise Viebeck) \u201cThe hotel is just a shiny object the Democrats are going after today,\u201d Spicer said on CNN. \u201cBut there are several of these highly iconic properties that are around the world that he is going to have to sit down and go through the same process.\u201d With more than 500 partnerships and corporations and projects in countries including India, Turkey, Scotland and Dubai, Trump\u2019s family business poses an\u00a0 unprecedented nest of potential conflicts between his financial interests and his duties as president. \u201cEvery part of Mr. Trump\u2019s unresolved business conflicts touch on his government role,\u201d said Norm Eisen, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as chief ethics lawyer for President Obama. \u201cIt affects domestic policy, foreign policy. It\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Eisen and other experts\u00a0have said Trump should resolve the problems by selling off his businesses and placing the proceeds in a blind trust. Trump has not given any indication that he will do that, writing on Twitter this week\u00a0that he planned to\u00a0turn the business over to his sons and that they would not do any new deals while he is\u00a0in office. \u201cPrior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world,\u201d he tweeted on Nov. 21. \u201cOnly the crooked media makes this a big deal!\u201d The Office of Government Ethics has also been weighing\u00a0the issues\u00a0presented by Trump\u2019s sprawling interests. In response to questions posed by Senate Democrats, the office this week wrote that Trump could not eliminate conflicts by handing over control of his company to his children. Such an arrangement also wouldn\u2019t qualify as a blind trust, the ethics office said. Trump won\u2019t be required to file another financial disclosure form until May 2018, the agency noted, although other presidents have done so the first May after they took office. Also on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization\u00a0said the company would remove the Trump name from a hotel project in Rio de Janeiro that\u00a0has run into delays and been caught up in a fraud investigation. The development was first reported by the Washington Post. \u201cUnfortunately, the developers of the Rio de Janeiro hotel are significantly behind on the completion of the property, and their vision for the hotel no longer aligns with the Trump Hotels brand,\u201d a statement said. Trump was supposed to have announced his plan to deal with his businesses on Thursday, but earlier this week\u00a0he\u00a0put off any announcement\u00a0until January. In the briefing to Congress on the hotel lease, Gelber said that the GSA had\u00a0brought up conflict concerns with the Trump transition team, but so far had not heard back. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, has been the main contact for the agency, Democrats said in their\u00a0letter. The letter also quoted the GSA official as saying that the agency\u2019s\u00a0contracting officials are independent and \u201cwould not change their positions based on political influence.\u201d The hotel presents more than one potential conflict for the president-elect. To finance the construction, Trump obtained a $170-million loan from Deutsche Bank, which also holds loans on his Doral golf course in Florida and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. The Justice Department has sought $14 billion from Deutsche to settle a fraud case involving mortgage-backed securities; Deutsche has been fighting to reduce the payment. The Deutsche bank loans are among several of Trump\u2019s debts that involve potential conflicts.\u00a0 ",

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Dec 14, 2016 7:54 PM EST The judgment of the federal government\u2019s procurement arm is that Donald Trump will be in breach of the lease contract on his newest hotel in downtown Washington as soon as he takes office on Jan. 20, House Democrats said Wednesay. Unless he divests all financial interests, including managerial control and ownership, upon taking office, Mr. Trump will violate the contract, House Democrats said a top official at the General Services Administration (GSA) told them. In a letter to the GSA Wednesday obtained by CBS News, four Democrats, including Goverment Reform and Oversight ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland noted they had received a briefing on Dec. 8 from deputy GSA commissioner Michael Gelberg in which he \u201cconfirmed repeatedly\u201d a \u201ccategorical ban on the President of the United States or any other elected official having any financial interest in this lease, or taking any financial benefit from it.\u201d Why Donald Trump chose Rex Tillerson for secretary of state In the letter to the GSA administrator, Democrats said Gelberg told them that the provision is included in many GSA leases to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d and protect the interests of the American people. After the release of the letter, GSA released its own statement saying, \u201cGSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the President-elect to divest of his financial interests.\u201d GSA said that no determination would be completed until Mr. Trump finalizes his business arrangements and he assumes the presidency. It will not send a letter warning Mr. Trump to \u201ccure\u201d the problem until and if a breach occurs, a Democratic aide clarified. Questions surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s business and real-estate empires have intensified since he won the election. Critics cite the Trump International Hotel--formerly the Old Post Office Building--as one of several conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump originally said he\u2019d announce the details of his separation from his businesses during a Dec. 15th press conference, but this week he postponed the media event until January. He has, however, pledged that his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, who are expected to run his businesses, will refrain from making \u201cnew deals\u201d during his presidency. Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2016 According to the letter, Gelber also told the Democratic lawmakers that if Mr. Trump didn\u2019t fully divest himself of financial interests in the hotel lease agreement, he would contacted by GSA and be given 30 days to respond. No specifics yet on how president-elect plans to leave Trump Organization \u201cIf the breach is not resolve satisfactorily, GSA would then normally bring the matter before the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals,\u201d the letter read. Ivanka Trump was also mentioned in the letter. Pointing out that she is Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter, a transition team official and a lessee under the hotel contract, Democrats said in the letter, \u201cThe conflicts of interest are obvious.\u201d Gelber said that GSA had contacted the transition team \u201cto convey concerns about how to handle the breach of the hotel lease.\u201d\u00a0 House Democrats concluded the letter with a request to obtain nearly half-a-dozen unredacted documents from the GSA with a deadline of Dec. 20, so that they can continue their investigation.

USA TODAY Sports NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaks to reporters after the NFL football owners meeting in Irving, Texas on Wednesday. (Photo: LM Otero, AP) IRVING, Texas \u2014 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league didn\u2019t follow up on the New York Giants\u2019 complaint about the Pittsburgh Steelers using underinflated footballs in a Dec. 4 game after determining that officials properly followed protocol for testing and handling the balls. And Goodell\u2019s explanation for dismissing the Giants\u2019 assessment that the balls were below the permissible psi \u2014 like the speed with which the NFL closed its inquiry \u2014 will probably cause more angst among New England Patriots fans still steamed over the Deflategate saga. \u201cWhat you do is you test the balls before the game, and the officials always maintain control of those footballs from that point on,\u201d Goodell told reporters at the NFL meetings Wednesday. \u201cWe went back. We checked with the officials to make sure they checked the proper inflation. They did that. The balls were retained in their control throughout the game from that point on. So\u00a0the protocols were followed all the way.\u201d Giants, Steelers agree report of underinflated footballs 'much ado about nothing' Asked whether the balls were examined further, given the Giants' equipment staff tested them on the sideline and determined they were not inflated to the minimum standard, Goodell said: \u201cBut that\u2019s why you don\u2019t rely on somebody else testing them. They\u2019re using a different device. Somebody else is testing them. They have to be tested by the officials who use the same device to make sure there\u2019s accuracy in that.\u201d Discrepancies over which of two gauges referee Walt Anderson used to test footballs before the AFC Championship Game in 2015 was one of the core issues raised by the Patriots and other skeptics of the Wells Report, which contained the results of a multi-million-dollar investigation that led to harsh penalties for the Patriots and star quarterback Tom Brady. The website the Patriots launched to dissect the case, WellsReportInContext.com, expounds at length on the subject, saying in part: \u201cDespite Mr. Anderson\u2019s \u2018best recollection\u2019 that he used the Logo gauge pre-game, the NFL\u2019s lawyers rejected it. To determine PSI changes from pre-game to halftime, one would have to use the same gauge at halftime that was used by Referee Anderson pre-game, since gauges vary from each other in accuracy. The Logo gauge, at halftime, did not show as much PSI loss as did the Non-Logo gauge, so knowing which gauge was actually used before the game is critical.\u201d Roger Goodell: No viable stadium plan on table for Oakland, San Diego Each team\u2019s offense is allowed to use its own footballs during a game. According to the NFL football operations website: \u201cEach team must deliver at least 12 official Wilson NFL footballs, brushed and wiped down by the equipment manager, to the officials\u2019 locker room 135 minutes before kickoff. The referee verifies that they are all properly inflated.\u201d FOX Sports first reported Sunday morning that the Giants tested two of the Steelers\u2019 footballs during a 24-14 loss at Pittsburgh in Week 13 and alerted the league that the balls were under-inflated. Within an hour, the NFL responded with a statement that said procedures were followed, there were no chain-of-command issues, all footballs were in compliance, and the Giants never filed a formal complaint with the league office. Goodell acknowledged Wednesday that the Giants raised the issue during the game after takeaways by players who wanted to keep the balls and brought them to the sideline. But neither team followed up nor did the league, \u201cbecause we were comfortable (that)\u00a0the protocols were followed,\u201d Goodell said. ",

(Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staff Contact Reporter With overnight temperatures dropping well below zero, the National Weather Service has issued a wind chill advisory for Wednesday night through Thursday morning. The advisory is in effect from 9 p.m. Wednesday until 10 a.m. Thursday. The weather service said wind chills could reach close to minus 30 in some areas, especially west and northwest of Chicago. It warned people could suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. A winter weather advisory was also in effect because of the possibility of blowing and drifting snow making travel hazardous in most counties surrounding Chicago, not including Cook County. By Wednesday evening, dozens of private schools and some area public school districts had cancelled classes. For updated school closings, check the Emergency Closing Center \u00a0website. The brunt of the arctic front hit the Chicago area early Tuesday, when the high for the day -- 22 degrees -- was reached at 2 a.m.\u00a0 Temperatures dropped steeply during the day and hit minus 12 at Aurora Airport early Wednesday, according to the weather service. Wednesday\u2019s high reached 19 degrees at O'Hare Airport, dropping to 6 degrees, with a wind chill of 13 below zero, by 9 p.m. The high Thursday is expected to be zero to 5, with gusty west winds driving the wind chill to minus 30. The cold will ease Friday with a high around 20, but a winter storm could dump as much as 7 inches Friday afternoon through Saturday, the weather service said.\u00a0 It would be the third weekend in a row that the Chicago area has been hit by a winter storm with accumulating snow. The warming continues Saturday, with a high near 30.\u00a0 The snow could change to freezing rain, with accumulation of ice a concern, the weather service said.

Yahoo says more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in 2013. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Tracey Lien Contact Reporter Yahoo said Wednesday that hackers stole data that could be connected to more than 1\u00a0billion accounts \u2014\u00a0believed to be the most users affected in a single breach. The Sunnyvale, Calif., tech firm said the breach probably occurred in August 2013\u00a0and is not linked to a hack disclosed in September that affected some 500 million user accounts.\u00a0 Chief information and security officer Bob Lord wrote on the Yahoo blog that\u00a0the company became aware of the\u00a0breach in November when law enforcement officials provided the company with files that a third-party claimed contained Yahoo user data. \u201cWe analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data,\u201d Lord said. \u201cBased on further analysis of this data \u2026 we believe an unauthorized third party \u2026 stole data associated with more than one billion accounts.\" Lord said the company had not yet identified the party responsible for the theft. User data that may have been stolen includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted and unencrypted security questions and answers, among other details. The investigation so far suggests hackers did not obtain credit card or bank account information. \"We\u2019ve taken steps to secure user accounts, and we are working closely with law enforcement,\u201d Yahoo said in a prepared statement. The company has reached out to users it believes were affected by the breach and is urging them to change their passwords. Given that the breach occurred three years ago, resetting users\u2019 passwords might be too little too late, according to security experts. \u201cThe real issue now is that these passwords\u00a0will be used to breach thousands of other websites unrelated to Yahoo,\u201d\u00a0said Shuman Ghosemajumder, chief technology officer of Shape Security, who used to head Google's trust and safety product teams.\u00a0\"Until users change their passwords [on other sites], those accounts may continue to be accessible to cybercriminals.\u201d The latest breach is yet another setback for the tech firm, whose sale to Verizon was already on shaky ground earlier this year when it disclosed the previous\u00a0breach affecting 500 million user accounts -- itself the largest in the history of data breaches. That breach occurred in 2014 and went undetected by the tech firm for nearly two years. This latest hack, which might affect twice the number of\u00a0accounts, would take the cake, though. \u201cThis is a massive issue,\u201d said Jo Webber, chief executive of security firm Spirion. \u201cMost companies that don\u2019t have the resources of Yahoo will find a breach in less than a year. Why did it take Yahoo three years?\u201d Verizon had agreed to pay $4.83 billion to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business in July, and was made aware of the 2014\u00a0data breach only after the deal had been signed. The company said at the time that it had reason to believe the breach had \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on the deal. On Wednesday, Verizon said it \u201cwill evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation [and]\u00a0we will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.\u201d Security experts said they\u2019d be surprised if the Verizon deal went through unscathed, though, because the scale of the breaches could be an enormous liability to any company that acquires Yahoo. The Internet company is already the subject of class-action lawsuits resulting from the breach it announced in September.\u00a0 If any of the user accounts were in Europe, the company could be subject to tough European penalties, too, Webber said. And while Verizon mulls over how to proceed with its\u00a0Yahoo purchase, security experts such as George Avetisov, CEO of biometrics security firm HYPR, suggest Internet users consider their next steps as well. \u201cThe only solution is to think back: as a Yahoo user, did you ever use your password anywhere else? Avetisov said. \u201cIt would be prudent to change everything. tracey.lien@latimes.com Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rick Perry was picked to run the Department of Energy , cutting down dead trees is the new Gold Rush happening in California , Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade is coming back , and the National Film Registry\u2019s Class of 2016 has arrived .

    "text": "Commander given reprimand for returning cop who fatally shot 2 to street duties amid investigation Officer Robert Rialmo Rachael Levy / Chicago Tribune Officer Robert Rialmo was returned to street duty while a probe was underway into his fatal shooting of two people in 2015. Officer Robert Rialmo was returned to street duty while a probe was underway into his fatal shooting of two people in 2015. (Rachael Levy / Chicago Tribune) Dan Hinkel Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Chicago Police Department issued a written reprimand last week to a high-ranking officer responsible for returning a patrolman to the street before the city finished investigating his fatal shooting of two people, a spokesman said Wednesday. Though the punishment is among the lightest possible, department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said it was both significant and rare for a command-level officer \u2014 Jefferson Park district Cmdr. William Looney in this case \u2014 to be reprimanded for the move. The Tribune revealed last month that the department had returned Officer Robert Rialmo to the street for several months over the summer and fall while the investigation continued into his shooting last December of Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and Bettie Jones, 55, an innocent bystander. Rialmo was removed from desk duty and detailed to a citywide unit that intervened in potentially violent situations despite the fact that he had filed an unorthodox lawsuit against the department alleging that he shot the two in part because of poor training. At the time, Guglielmi blamed a \"careless administrative oversight\" at the Northwest Side district for Rialmo's assignment to the unit. On Wednesday, Guglielmi said the reprimand letter to Looney comes with no financial consequences or mandatory time off. Still, Guglielmi said, the letter shows the department is taking accountability seriously. \"A formal reprimand is significant, especially when you're a commander and in the exempt ranks of the Police Department,\" he said. But Basileios Foutris, an attorney for LeGrier's father, said sending Rialmo back to the street was egregious and the discipline insulting to his client. \"It's nothing more than a slap on the wrist,\" he said. Looney declined to comment. (Dan Hinkel) Recent Tribune reports have shown the city's police disciplinary system to be slow and prone to clearing officers or levying light punishments following investigations that have sometimes been shoddy or superficial. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has made strengthening police discipline a pillar of his plans to reform the department in the year since the release of video of Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times. But the handling of discipline has continued to trouble the department. Just this week, the Tribune revealed that the department's Bureau of Internal Affairs didn't finish a disciplinary investigation started in 2004 against an officer who later fatally shot two people. Sgt. John Poulos was never disciplined as a result of an investigation into his possible ownership stake in an Old Town bar. Multiple sources told the Tribune the investigation could have led to Poulos' firing. Last month, Poulos shot and killed 19-year-old Kajuan Raye. Poulos also fatally shot a suspected burglar while off-duty in 2013. Tribune coverage: The Quintonio LeGrier, Bettie Jones shootings Read more stories In both cases, Poulos told investigators he thought the men were armed, but no weapon was found, according to department officials and Independent Police Review Authority records. IPRA cleared him of wrongdoing in the 2013 shooting; the investigation into Raye's shooting is ongoing. In Rialmo's case, the officer said he shot LeGrier outside his family's West Side home after the 19-year-old swung an aluminum baseball bat at him. But Jones, a neighbor, was standing nearby and was also killed. After the shooting, Rialmo gave differing accounts of LeGrier's actions, police reports show. Rialmo was put on indefinite desk duty as the city investigated the shooting. In July, however, he was detailed to the citywide summer mobile unit created by Superintendent Eddie Johnson to tamp down gang conflicts and violence at parks and beaches in a year that has seen homicides reach levels unseen in two decades. Officers for the unit were drawn from the city's 22 districts, and Rialmo \u2014 hired in 2012 \u2014 was picked because of his low seniority, Gugliemi said. Notifications did not go up the chain of command, Guglielmi said, and department officials transferred Rialmo back to desk duty in late October after learning he was on the street. Guglielmi said the department has adopted a policy that internal affairs must sign off on personnel transfers in addition to the patrol division. Rialmo and the city face a lawsuit over the shooting of Jones and LeGrier, but the officer also took the rare step of suing the city, claiming he shot the two in part because he was inadequately trained. Rialmo's attorney, Joel Brodsky, has alleged in court filings that the department pulled Rialmo from the street in retaliation because the officer hired his own lawyer and sued the department. ",

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Michigan Republican Party chair, speaks before a Republican presidential primary debate in Detroit in March. Carlos Osorio/AP Michigan GOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel is in line to lead the Republican National Committee. President-elect Donald Trump announced McDaniel's appointment on Wednesday as the RNC deputy chair. That puts her in place to succeed outgoing Chairman Reince Priebus, whom Trump has already tapped as his White House chief of staff. A supporter of Trump's during the primary, McDaniel not only oversaw a critical state that helped Trump pull off his upset win but is also the niece of Mitt Romney. The 2012 GOP presidential nominee was a vocal opponent of Trump's during the primary, but he later walked back his criticism as he made a failed pitch to become secretary of state. \"I'm excited to have a highly effective leader in Ronna McDaniel as RNC Deputy Chair and I look forward to her serving as the Party's Chairman in 2017,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in Michigan, and I know she will bring the same passion to the Republican National Committee.\" Article continues after sponsorship McDaniel has led the Michigan GOP since February 2015 and helped turn the state red for the first time since 1988. Trump praised her efforts last week at a stop in Michigan on his \"thank you\" tour, telling her and the crowd, \"I was very impressed with you. She didn't sleep for six months.\" The choice of McDaniel is also seen as a victory by Priebus, who reportedly preferred her over Nick Ayers. Some Trump loyalists were pushing for Ayers, an aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to get the job. In the same statement, Priebus called her \"an outstanding fundraiser, and her ability to drive support for our mission of electing Republicans up and down the ballot gives me full confidence that she will be able to continue building on the RNC's success and organizational strength as we head into important elections in 2017 and 2018.\" Trump also appointed his Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik, to be deputy co-chairman. Both are expected to be voted on next month at the RNC's winter meeting, but typically RNC members respect the wishes of an incoming or sitting president. So with Priebus' exit, McDaniel would be the new leader of the RNC with Paduchik as her No. 2. ",

The boy, identified as Joshua J. Demarast of Greenwich, New York, a seventh-grader at Greenwich Junior-Senior High School, ventured on Tuesday afternoon to an area in the town where snow is frequently dumped, Greenwich Police Chief George Bell said. While he was playing there, the boy became trapped, Bell said. Demarast and a friend of his were playing at the dumping site, digging tunnels, when a truck dropped off snow it had plowed, Bell told ABC News today, adding that the snow was then pushed over onto the boys without the driver's knowing that they were there. Buried alive, the two boys remained trapped under the snow for hours as police and rescue workers struggled to free them Tuesday evening, police said. Police received a call for two missing boys around 5 p.m., and a K-9 unit was employed, police said. A dog located a sled the boys took with them, and the digging began. Demarast was found unresponsive under the snow and died shortly after 10 p.m., police said. Bell said that he spoke to the survivor of the tragedy this morning and that the boy was recovering from the incident. Demarast's family suffered two deaths on Tuesday, according to Bell, who said the boy's grandmother also passed away, at around 3 p.m. \"His family is dealing with both losses,\" Bell said. Mark Fish, the superintendent of Greenwich Central School District, described Demarast at a news conference today as a good student who was well liked and loved the outdoors. Fish, speaking to ABC News today, described his district as \"small and rural\" and a \"place where everybody knows just about everybody.\" Counselors were made available to students in the wake of the tragedy, he said, and after-school programs were canceled because they didn't feel appropriate, given the shock surrounding Demarast's death. Greenwich, in upstate New York near the border with Vermont, is no stranger to snowfall, but the town received only 4 or 5 inches earlier this week, Bell said. School was canceled on Monday because of snowfall but was reopened on Tuesday, the day of the incident. The boys decided to play together after school, officials said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interests rates for the first time in a year. CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger explains how th... \u201cWe\u2019re on a good path to reaching our objectives,\u201d Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a news conference, in which she was careful not to pick a fight with the incoming administration. In perhaps an oblique reference to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s complaint that the Fed should have elevated rates earlier, she noted that she thought \u00a0it \u201cis not behind the curve.\u201d But she also maintained that she was not going to offer Mr. Trump policy advice.\u00a0 Asked if she wanted another term when hers expires in January 2018, she said she had not thought about it. Mr. Trump has said he wanted to see her replaced. In broad terms, she defended the Dodd-Frank law imposing tighter federal controls on bank, saying it was \u201cimportant\u201d to ensure that lenders keep solid amounts of capital to cushion them in bad times. Mr. Trump has talked about racheting back Dodd-Frank.\u00a0 In its statement, the Fed said that \u201cthe labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year.\u201d In November, it called the pace \u201cmodest,\u201d which in Fed-speak means less robust. The Fed\u2019s outlook for inflation is 1.9 percent. While energy costs are rising, the prices of other consumer items are largely stagnant, and the consumer price index is still low by historical standards.\u00a0 The action by the Fed\u2019s policy-making board came after a two-day deliberation. James O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for \u00a0High Frequency Economics, pointed out that \u201cthe tone of the statement was a bit more upbeat than last time. Job gains were once again described as \u2018solid,\u2019 but the decline in the unemployment rate was noted.\u201d A key question now is when the Fed will next lift rates, and how often. Last year at this time, the central bank indicated it wanted to hike rates four times, but later scotched that goal amid uncertainty over economic growth. Financial futures market bets currently predict the Fed will bump up rates twice in 2017.\u00a0 A second question is how Fed actions will interact with Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to stimulate economic activity by slashing taxes and expanding efforts to build and repair the U.S.\u2019s deteriorating infrastructure, like highways, bridges and ports. Yellen said she needed more details from the new administration\u2019s fiscal framework before figuring out how it would impact ecnomic growth. But she added that tax reductions might he best focused on worker training and capital investment.\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Email Public approval of president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition is lower than the ratings his predecessors received during that period, according to a Gallup survey released Wednesday. The poll found that people in the U.S. are evenly divided, 48 percent to 48 percent, over how Mr. Trump is handling the transition process . For previous presidential transitions, about two-thirds or more of the public approved of the process. In 2008, three-quarters of the public approved of the way then-president-elect Obama handled his transition. About two-thirds felt the same way about George W. Bush in early 2001 and about Bill Clinton in late 1992. The latest survey found 86 percent of Republicans approve of how Mr. Trump is handling the transition while only 17 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of independents approve. Comparing transition approval to initial job approval ratings for former presidents, their job approval ratings were slightly lower than what the public believed during the transition period. Based on that pattern, Gallup predicts that Mr. Trump\u2019s initial job approval rating will be in the low 40 percent range. The Gallup poll surveyed 1,028 adults between Dec. 7 and 11 with a 4 percentage point margin of error. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Yahoo suffers world's biggest hack affecting 1 billion users Yahoo headquarters Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press Yahoo says more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in 2013. Yahoo says more than 1 billion accounts may have been hacked in 2013. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Yahoo has discovered a 3-year-old security breach that enabled a hacker to compromise more than 1 billion user accounts, breaking the company's own humiliating record for the biggest security breach in history. The digital heist disclosed Wednesday occurred in August 2013, more than a year before a separate hack that Yahoo\u00a0 announced nearly three months ago \u00a0. That breach affected at least 500 million users, which had been the most far-reaching hack until the latest revelation. \"It's shocking,\" security expert Avivah Litan of Gartner Inc. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion \u2014 a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. TWO HACKS, MORE THAN A BILLION ACCOUNTS Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. (Andrea Peterson) But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice \u2014 once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password and questions since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. QUESTIONS FOR VERIZON News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the \"new development before reaching any final conclusions.\" Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses \"definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,\" Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. \"This just adds to fuel to the fire and it won't help Yahoo's cause,\" said Eric Jackson, a longtime critic of the company's management. Although he has in the past, Jackson doesn't currently own Yahoo stock. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. Associated Press ",

And if the matter is not resolved through that process, it would be standard for the GSA to bring the case before the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals. The letter also says that the GSA deputy commissioner told them that the GSA has reached out the Trump transition team with the concerns that have been raised about the lease but have not heard back. But the GSA spokesperson said: \"We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,\" the spokesperson continued. \"In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office. GSA is committed to responsibly administering all of the leases to which it is a party,\" the statement adds. If Trump does not divest from the Washington hotel property, which the Trump Organization leases from the federal government, Trump would effectively become both tenant and landlord to the property as president. Asked about the letter on a call with reporters Wednesday, RNC communications director Sean Spicer said that Trump will address the matter at an expected announcement about his business interests in January. Trump previously said he would hold a press conference on Dec. 15th to clarify how he'll separate himself from his businesses, but that press conference has now been moved to January, according to the transition team. Ethics advocates have called for Trump to completely divest from his businesses in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, but Trump has only said that he would turn over control to his two adult sons. Further details about the plan were not released. 0 Shares ",

Michigan Ave., some workers called 911 and\u00a0barricaded doors after mistaking an \"active shooter\" drill for a real threat. (CBS Chicago) At the Monroe Building at 104 S. Michigan Ave., some workers called 911 and\u00a0barricaded doors after mistaking an \"active shooter\" drill for a real threat. (CBS Chicago) Rosemary Regina Sobol and Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune It was supposed to be just another drill in the Monroe Building in the Loop on Wednesday morning, in this case what to do if a gunman was somewhere inside. The announcement over the PA system said there was an \"active shooter\" in the building at 104 S. Michigan Ave. and people should seek shelter. No one reached by the Tribune remembers hearing the word drill. Some said they recalled earlier warnings about a drill and followed instructions. On the 15th floor, however, workers thought the threat was real: They rushed to a back office that had no windows, scooted desks against the door and called 911.\u00a0 While they waited for help, they left desperate messages for loved ones.\u00a0 \"I got the 'Goodbye, I love you,' all that stuff,\" a husband of one of the workers said.\u00a0 He was among the people who called police, frantic. Officers finally banged on the door about 10 or 15 minutes later -- and told those inside to put their hands up and walk out.\u00a0 They apparently weren't sure if there was a shooter, according to several of the workers in the room. \"We have the dumbest building management in the world,\" one worker said later, now laughing about an episode she described as \"terrifying.\" But building manager Paul Rades put the blame on the workers for not paying better attention. \"We followed the standards and protocol,\" Rades said, wearing a reflective vest as he spoke to reporters outside the building.\u00a0 \"We notified all of our tenants a month ago and also all our tenants' office managers attended an in-person training two weeks ago. ... People need to listen to the drill and listen to their office manager.\" 'Active shooter' drill Rosemary Regina Sobol / Chicago Tribune Workers at 104 S. Michigan Ave., stand in the lobby as they prepare to return to work after evacuation. Workers at 104 S. Michigan Ave., stand in the lobby as they prepare to return to work after evacuation. (Rosemary Regina Sobol / Chicago Tribune) Workers on other floors said they were puzzled by the way the announcement was worded. It's unclear why things unfolded the way they did on the 15th floor. Several workers on the 15th said they heard \"active shooter\" and then \"shelter in place,\" meaning stay where you are.\u00a0 Then someone thought they heard shots on the 14th floor, and workers started filing into the back room for safety, several workers said. \"It made it very real,\u201d one woman said, asking not to be named. \"People were throwing desks up against the door because it didn\u2019t lock.\u00a0 There were no windows, which was good.\u201d Five or 10 minutes later, a woman got on the intercom and said there was now a fire drill and everyone should evacuate.\u00a0 But that made the workers even more nervous.\u00a0 Some were convinced the shooter was holding a gun on the woman making the announcement. \"She said that with, like, escalating tension, quiver, in her voice,\" another worker said. \"Then she just said it over and over and over for what must\u2019ve been 30 seconds or a minute: 'This is a fire drill, everyone proceed quietly down to the lobby.' \"No mention of the disconnect \u2026 with the armed shooter,\" the worker said. \"No mention that the story had changed, just this escalating quiver.\" People in the room decided to wait for police. One woman said she called 911 and said the group wanted \"to be led out by a police officer. Otherwise we\u2019re staying.\" The same woman also began texting her family. \"I was on like a text chain with 25 of my family members, scaring all of them,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s maybe the scaredest I\u2019ve ever been.\" Her friend said she thought about texting her son but \"I hadn\u2019t really worked out what I would say.\u00a0 Goodbye?\u2019\u2019 When officers arrived on the floor, \"they pounded on the door and told us to come out with our arms up,\" another worker in the room said. \"So we were led out of lockdown and they were under the impression that there was a shooter because they were responding to our calls.\" Workers on other floors said they did not hear the word drill either but assumed it was. \"I think that's where the confusion came in,\" said one man who works as a marketer for insurance. \"They said it was an active shooter.\u00a0 Everyone was like, what the hell. I locked my door and stayed in the office.\" None of the workers interviewed wanted their names used, saying they had been told not to talk to reporters. Rades, the building manager, said about 700 people work in the building and there have been no problems with previous drills.\u00a0 What happened Wednesday morning was \"blown out of proportion,\" he said. Rades said he his staff would evaluate the building's drill procedures.\u00a0 \u201cWe always like to see how we can provide our tenants tenant the best safety.\u2019\u2019 ",

    "text": "28 Photos Actor and comedian Bill Cosby arrives for the second day of hearings at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania in this February 3, 2016 file photo. Reuters NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- Bill Cosby\u2019s lawyers on Wednesday attacked what they called \u201cvague, remote and often inconsistent\u201d allegations from a slew of women whom prosecutors are seeking to call as witnesses at his sexual assault trial next year. Lawyers for the 79-year-old actor and comedian asked a judge to block 13 accusers from taking the stand, saying uncertainty about where and when some of the sexual encounters took place made them impossible to defend against. Cosby, who was known as America\u2019s Dad for his top-rated family sitcom, \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d which ran from 1984 to 1992, is charged with molesting a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. Prosecutors are seeking testimony from the other accusers to show that Cosby had a long history of knocking out women with drugs and drinks and sexually assaulting them. Cosby has pleaded not guilty.\u00a0 Bill Cosby tells guard, \"Don't tase me, bro\" At a hearing outside Philadelphia, the defense portrayed the potential prosecution witnesses as \u201cbandwagon\u201d accusers who came forward because they sought to cash in on Cosby\u2019s fame and wealth. The women went public at the urging of \u201cclever, cunning lawyers who had the agenda of bringing down an American icon,\u201d Cosby lawyer Brian McMonagle told Montgomery County Judge Steven O\u2019Neill, who must determine whether some or all of the accusers will be permitted to take the witness stand. The two-day hearing closed without a decision, with O\u2019Neill saying he\u2019d take some time before ruling. McMonagle argued prosecutors dredged up unsubstantiated assault allegations dating to the 1960s to try to breathe life into a weak case, and urged O\u2019Neill to \u201cfollow the money\u201d when examining the motives of the accusers. \u201cThere\u2019s no good reason in this world for these uncorroborated, unconfirmed, unreported, ancient allegations to be brought into this courtroom or any courtroom in this country,\u201d he said afterward. Cosby is charged with assaulting Andrea Constand, then a Temple University employee. She filed a police complaint against Cosby, a long-married father of five and her friend and mentor, but a prosecutor at the time declined to file charges. Authorities reopened the investigation last year after scores of women raised similar accusations and after Cosby\u2019s damaging deposition testimony from Constand\u2019s lawsuit became public.\u00a0 28 Photos Bill Cosby's accusers O\u2019Neill ruled last week that the deposition may be used at Cosby\u2019s criminal trial, arming prosecutors with Cosby\u2019s testimony about his affairs with young women, his use of quaaludes as a seduction tool and his version of the sexual encounter with Constand. Cosby\u2019s attorney said Wednesday that Constand has offered shifting accounts of the encounter, making comparisons with the other accusers impossible. Under state law, prosecutors must demonstrate substantial similarities in the accusers\u2019 accounts to be able to call them to the witness stand. Prosecutors have argued that sexual assault victims often recall more details in subsequent interviews, and they say the discrepancies in Constand\u2019s accounts are not material to the case. The other women should be allowed to testify, District Attorney Kevin Steele argued earlier Wednesday, because their stories are so similar they show the \u201chandiwork of the same perpetrator.\u201d Cosby befriended women who saw him as a mentor, incapacitated them out with pills and drinks and molested them, he said. \u201cThis is a lifetime of sexual assault on young women,\u201d Steele told O\u2019Neill.\u00a0 Bill Cosby gets June 2017 court date Cosby\u2019s lawyers said the women\u2019s stories aren\u2019t similar enough to warrant their testimony. They pointed to differences in the location and manner of the alleged assaults, as well as the accusers\u2019 level of education and line of work. \u201cYou cannot ignore the differences,\u201d said another defense lawyer, Angela Agrusa. She said most of the potential prosecution witnesses are represented by famed civil lawyer Gloria Allred and have held news conferences and given dozens of interviews. Agrusa said one accuser shopped a book deal for her life story a few years ago. Allred \u201cduped\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office, Agrusa argued. \u201cShe executed a plan, and she got the DA\u2019s office to be her bag man,\u201d Agrusa said. Allred, who attended Wednesday\u2019s hearing, has argued her clients have a duty to testify if the court wants to hear from them. \u201cWe say as lawyers that when you have the law on your side, you argue the law. If you don\u2019t have the law, you argue facts. If you don\u2019t have the facts, then you attack the victim or other lawyers, or both. Today there was a full-scale attack on victims,\u201d Allred said. The Associated Press doesn\u2019t typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Constand has done.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Cuisinart Before using your food processor for holiday treats in the next few weeks, you might want to make sure the blades haven't been recalled for dozens of mouth lacerations. Cuisinart's parent corporation, Conair, is voluntarily recalling about 8 million units after 69 consumers reported finding broken pieces of blade in their food. That includes 30 cases that caused mouth lacerations or tooth injuries, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission . The issue is with the product's riveted blade, which \"can crack over time and small, metal pieces of the blade can break off into the processed food,\" the CPSC adds. The blade has four rivets positioned around a beige center cap. If you have a Cuisinart food processor, you should check the model number on the bottom of the unit. The affected food processors begin with the following numbers: CFP-9, CFP-11, DFP-7, DFP-11, DFP-14, DLC-5, DLC-7, DLC-8, DLC-10, DLC-XP, DLC-2007, DLC-2009, DLC-2011, DLC-2014, DLC-3011, DLC-3014, EV-7, EV-10, EV-11, EV-14, KFP-7 and MP-14. The units were sold from July 1996 through December 2015, according to the company. Customers can get a free replacement blade.

As each side blamed the other for the deal\u2019s collapse, civilians inside the city issued anguished, angry pleas for international pressure to reinstate it. The Assad government and Iran, Syria\u2019s other main ally besides Russia, appeared not to have been fully consulted on the deal, according to international officials and others briefed on the talks, and were insisting on new conditions. Rebel groups outside the city resumed shelling government-held districts in Aleppo. Civilians in other rebel-held areas to the north protested against their leaders and ransacked posts of hard-line rebel groups, demanding they help those in Aleppo.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb Close to midnight Wednesday, rebel groups announced a new deal for another evacuation attempt on Thursday. Trapped civilians expressed disbelief, and the Syrian military denied that another deal had been reached. But by early Thursday the shelling had tapered off, residents reported, hoping the pause would hold. As the shelling escalated Wednesday morning, a radiology nurse in Aleppo, Mohamed al-Ahmad, said he hoped the world would hear \u201cour final scream,\u201d adding that the wounded, with rescue and medical services in disarray, were bleeding to death in the streets. Yasser, an accountant volunteering in a makeshift medical clinic, posted a photograph via WhatsApp of an injured girl lying on a hallway floor. She was 10, he said, with broken bones, and was crying and shouting: \u201cGet me out of Aleppo. I am afraid, I am cold. My back is hurting me. Where is the doctor?\u201d Yasser, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of being arrested for contacting journalists, said in frustration, \u201cLet us leave \u2014 what is happening?\u201d Problems with the deal had been evident from the start. Soon after it was announced Tuesday night, Syrian officials said they had no knowledge of it, and there was no word from Iran.

Their flight to areas of humanitarian aid is a risky one. By MEGAN SPECIA and YARA BISHARA on Publish Date December 1, 2016. .

The militiamen said they would not allow anyone out until rebel groups had ended their siege of Fouaa and Kfarya, two encircled Shiite enclaves in Idlib Province. Residents said they were told they could leave at 6 a.m., but as buses idled, the shelling resumed. Opposition leaders and civilians inside Aleppo said they believed that Iran had balked at a deal brokered by Russia. Osama Abu Zayd, a legal adviser to Syrian opposition factions, told The Associated Press that Iran\u2019s field commander in Syria was resisting it. The interests of Mr. Assad\u2019s two main backers, Russia and Iran, do not always dovetail. Iran has a stake in retaining the influence it gained by entering the conflict on behalf of Mr. Assad two years before Russia.

They are civilians like us.\u201d The Russian Defense Ministry blamed the rebels for the impasse, saying on Wednesday that they had \u201cresumed the hostilities\u201d at dawn, trying to break through Syrian government positions to the northwest. Residents questioned why rebels inside eastern Aleppo would start shooting again when they were about to escape.

Government opponents also said they suspected Mr. Assad of stalling. His government has often skillfully played its backers against one another. The wrangling could provide cover to finish off Aleppo\u2019s last rebel enclave with force. As one Syrian military officer told Reuters in Aleppo recently, rebels must \u201csurrender or die.\u201d Our reporter\u2019s photographs and cellphone videos from a road trip in one of the world\u2019s most violent war zones. Troubles carrying out the accord were not surprising, as there was no international monitoring \u2014 United Nations officials said the Syrian government had refused their repeated pleas to observe \u2014 and no enforcement provision. The same problems have vexed other deals reached during the conflict. Malek, an activist who said he hoped to join his pregnant wife in northern Aleppo Province, and who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retaliation, said the world saw civilians in rebel-held territory as \u201cno longer human.\u201d \u201cThey think we are Daesh,\u201d he said via WhatsApp, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, the militant group that has established a so-called caliphate in parts of Syria but not in Aleppo. Using a mournful expression, he added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t taste the flavor of life.\u201d At the United Nations on Tuesday, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there had been \u201ccredible reports\u201d of atrocities, including extrajudicial killings, as eastern Aleppo was retaken.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic Why the Russian government might care about these unglamorous House races is a source of bafflement for some of the lawmakers who were targeted. But if the goal of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, was to make American democracy a less attractive model to his own citizens and to Russia\u2019s neighbors, then entangling congressional races in accusations of leaks and subterfuge was a step in the right direction. The intrusions in House races in states including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico and North Carolina can be traced to tens of thousands of pages of documents taken from the D.C.C.C., which shares a Capitol Hill office building with the Democratic National Committee. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The document dump\u2019s effectiveness was due in part to a de facto alliance that formed between the Russian hackers and political bloggers and newspapers across the United States. The hackers, working under the made-up name of Guccifer 2.0, used social media tools to invite individual reporters to request specific caches of documents, handing them out the way political operatives distribute scoops. It was an arrangement that proved irresistible to many news outlets \u2014 and amplified the consequences of the cyberattack. \u201cIt\u2019s time for new revelations now,\u201d the Guccifer 2.0 website proclaimed, as it began to pass out the D.C.C.C. documents, trying to entice reporters to look at them on their own. \u201cAll of you may have heard about the D.C.C.C. hack. As you see I wasn\u2019t wasting my time! It was even easier than in the case of the D.N.C. breach.\u201d Cybersecurity consultants believe the hacking of the D.C.C.C. took place around March or April of 2016 after a staffer clicked on a so-called phishing email. The D.C.C.C. shut down its computer system for a week \u2014 from the moment it learned of the attack in June. But it was already too late to close the door. The consequences started to become clear in August when the hackers released the home addresses, cellphone numbers and personal email addresses of Democratic House members. Document: The D.C.C.C. Responds to the Hack \u201cAs you are aware, the D.C.C.C. and other Democratic Party entities have been the target of cybersecurity intrusions \u2014 an electronic Watergate break-in,\u201d the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, wrote in an email the day after the personal information was released. The email continued, \u201cIt has been widely reported that this cybersecurity incident is part of a Russian cyberattack which appears to be an attempt to interfere with our elections. We take this troubling situation very seriously and have notified the appropriate authorities, including the F.B.I. and Sergeant-at-Arms.\u201d State troopers were sent to the homes of House Democrats across the United States, and they were urged to immediately change their cellphone numbers and personal email addresses, although this took place after many received a series of obscene calls, texts and emails. Photo The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, warned colleagues of \u201cobscene\u201d messages, after a hack released their personal contact information. But it turned out this was just a warning shot. Guccifer 2.0 followed up on the release of lawmakers\u2019 personal data with large caches of internal party documents, starting with some documents related to House races in Florida , including Ms. Taddeo\u2019s contest. The seats that Guccifer 2.0 targeted in the document dumps were hardly random: They were some of the most competitive House races in the country. In Ms. Taddeo\u2019s district, the House seat is held by a Republican, even though the district leans Democratic and Mrs. Clinton won it this year by a large majority. To prepare for the race, the D.C.C.C. had done candid evaluations of the two candidates vying in the primary for the nomination. Those inside documents, bluntly describing each candidate\u2019s weaknesses, are considered routine research inside political campaigns. But suddenly they were being aired in public. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Taddeo, one of the internal D.C.C.C. documents noted , had \u201cproven to be a somewhat poor fund-raiser and she has gained a reputation as an inadequate campaigner among some of the talkers in the community.\u201d Her Democratic opponent in the August primary, Joe Garcia, \u201calso made a large misstep during the campaign saying \u2018communism works,\u2019 which did not sit well in an area with a large Cuban refugee population,\u201d the document says. \u201c More embarrassingly, Garcia was caught on a C-Span feed picking his earwax and seemingly eating it, and the video made the rounds on the internet.\u201d Mr. Garcia was the first to use the material as a tool to attack his opponent, showing up at a televised debate with a printout of the documents and accusing Ms. Taddeo of hiring a private detective to follow him, an allegation she disputed. It was the first of many attacks based on the leaked material. After Mr. Garcia defeated Ms. Taddeo in the primary using the material unearthed in the hacking, the National Republican Campaign Committee and a second Republican group with ties to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, turned to the hacked material to attack him. In Florida, Guccifer 2.0\u2019s most important partner was an obscure political website run by an anonymous blogger called HelloFLA! , run by a former Florida legislative aide turned Republican lobbyist. The blogger sent direct messages via Twitter to Guccifer 2.0 asking for copies of any additional Florida documents. \u201cI can send you some docs via email,\u201d Guccifer 2.0 replied on Aug. 22, according to a cellphone screen shot of the message that the blogger, who writes under the pen name Mark Miewurd, provided to The New York Times. \u201cGreat! Editor@hellofla.com. I\u2019m just getting my kid from school but I\u2019ll be able to get it up pretty quick after I get it. Thanks!\u201d Photo A blogger who anonymously runs HelloFLA! contacted hackers working under the made-up name of Guccifer 2.0 using direct messages on Twitter to request documents about Ms. Taddeo. \u201cDo u have a size limit?\u201d Guccifer 2.0 replied, a question that led the Florida blogger to set up an anonymous Dropbox account so he could take thousands of pages of stolen information from the Russian operative, data that the blogger immediately recognized would have an extremely high strategic value for the Republicans. \u201cI don\u2019t think you realize what you gave me,\u201d the blogger said, looking at the costly internal D.C.C.C. political research that he had just been provided. \u201cThis is probably worth millions of dollars.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Guccifer 2.0 wrote back: \u201cHmmm. ok. u owe me a million.\u201d By September, Guccifer 2.0 had expanded his releases to include documents related to House races in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Illinois and North Carolina, working with individual political bloggers like Miscellany Blue in New Hampshire. \u201cExclusive: Leaked D.C.C.C. documents reveal effort to replace Shea-Porter with \u2018fresh face for 2016,\u2019\u201d said one of the first dispatches posted in New Hampshire, on Miscellany Blue, referring to Carol Shea-Porter, the Democratic candidate for the House, who ended up narrowly winning the seat , despite the intense criticism directed at her by Democratic leaders that was revealed by the leaks. Photo Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat in New Hampshire, won her House seat despite intense criticism of her candidacy by her own party leaders revealed in the hacks. Credit Thomas Roy/The Union Leader, via Associated Press In Pennsylvania, the leaked documents showed that Democratic Party officials did not like their own candidate for one House seat \u2014 a local businessman named Mike Parrish \u2014 and worked aggressively to recruit an alternative. Mr. Parrish, the internal party documents noted , owned a company in Pennsylvania that had been sued eight times, had been delinquent on his taxes and had been named in a 2013 lawsuit \u201calleging racketeering and corruption,\u201d the D.C.C.C. internal report said. Concerned, the party tried to recruit a local businesswoman, Marian Moskowitz, to challenge Mr. Parrish. But Ms. Moskowitz ultimately declined to run for the seat, so the party was left with Mr. Parrish, whose standing was further hurt when the details about the Democrats\u2019 misgivings about him drew coverage from bloggers and newspaper s . Mr. Parrish lost his bid for the seat. Guccifer 2.0 even posted a cache of confidential documents focusing on Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n , Democrat of New Mexico, the chairman of the D.C.C.C., who faced no serious challenger this year. Mr. Luj\u00e1n said it was a clear effort to send a message to the party leadership \u2014 that the hackers wanted to try to hurt Democrats at all levels of the party, from lesser known races in Florida to the leadership. After the first political advertisement appeared using the hacked material, Mr. Luj\u00e1n wrote a letter to his Republican counterpart at the National Republican Congressional Committee urging him to not use this stolen material in the 2016 campaign. \u201cThe N.R.C.C.\u2019s use of documents stolen by the Russians plays right into the hands of one of the United States\u2019 most dangerous adversaries,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n\u2019s Aug. 29 letter said. \u201cPut simply, if this action continues, the N.R.C.C. will be complicit in aiding the Russian government in its effort to influence American elections.\u201d Photo Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was targeted by Guccifer 2.0 even though he faced no serious challenger. Credit Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call, via Associated Press Ms. Pelosi sent a similar letter in early September to Mr. Ryan. Neither received a response. By October, the Congressional Leadership Fund , a \u201csuper PAC\u201d tied to Mr. Ryan, had used the stolen material in another advertisement , attacking Mr. Garcia during the general election in Florida. Advertisement Continue reading the main story AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, said he did not control how the material was used in the ad, although she did not dispute that the material had been stolen as part of an act of Russian espionage. \u201cSpeaker Ryan has said for months that foreign intervention in our elections is unacceptable,\u201d she said in a written statement. At least some Republican players turned down a chance to exploit the material, including Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, who was running for re-election in a contest where he faced off against Mr. Parrish and was aware of the unflattering material about his opponent that had become public. \u201cWe believed it was neither necessary nor appropriate,\u201d said Vincent Galko, a campaign consultant to Mr. Costello, \u201cto use information from a possible foreign source to influence the election.\u201d Still, Mr. Parrish, in an interview Tuesday, said he believed that the document dumps hurt his candidacy. But as a former Army cavalry troop commander who served in West Germany in the final years of the Cold War, he said he was not surprised to learn that the Russians were behind the cyberattack. \u201cI\u2019ve have been fighting Russians my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me this is just a continued punch-counterpunch; the Cold War games are still being played.\u201d Correction: December 13, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the way that AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Paul Ryan, characterized the origins of leaked materials used in political advertisements. She did not dispute that the materials had been stolen as part of an act of Russian espionage. ",

    "text": "Kansas Board OKs Universities' Policies for Guns on Campus By margaret stafford, associated press KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u0097 Dec 14, 2016, 4:54 PM ET 0 Shares Email The Kansas Board of Regents on Wednesday approved policies for how the state's six public universities will implement a state law allowing people to carry concealed guns into campus buildings starting July 1. The regents, with little discussion, approved the plans that spell out university policies on the safe storage and handling of handguns. Stun guns to be used for self-defense also will be allowed, but Tasers \u2014 which fire projectiles and are generally more powerful than generic stun guns \u2014 won't be. The law says universities can ban guns from buildings that have security measures including metal detectors or security guards, but those measures are costly, so concealed guns would be allowed in nearly all campus buildings, including at sporting events. Here are some questions and answers about the Kansas law: \u2014\u2014\u2014 WHAT IS CHANGING? Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signed a law in 2013 requiring concealed carry of handguns to be allowed in all publicly owned buildings unless the owners provide adequate security to prevent anyone from bringing weapons in. Cities, counties and public colleges and universities were allowed to exempt themselves until July 1, 2017. \u2014\u2014\u2014 WHO WILL BE ALLOWED TO CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS ON CAMPUS? Anyone over the age of 21, including students, faculty, staff and visitors. Kansas does not require people to have a license or training to carry a concealed weapon. The universities' policies include restrictions for those who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, mentally ill or those with felony convictions. The policies also state that anyone carrying a concealed weapon on campus must be in control of the handgun and keep it secure on his or her person when it's not in use. Concealed handguns must be in holsters and handguns with an external safety must have the safety on at all times. If the weapon is in a backpack, gun or purse, those items must be on or in the hands of the person at all times. Handguns cannot be stored in any university classroom, office or facility, in any residential unit that does not belong to the gun's owner, or in an unlocked or unattended vehicle. People who live on campus must keep their guns in university-approved storage devices. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE GUNS WILL BE ALLOWED? The policies allow for guns to be restricted in areas that have no public access or require entry through key cards or special codes. So, for example, guns will continue to be prohibited at a nuclear reactor at Kansas State University because public access has always been restricted there. The policies don't currently include any buildings that have security measures that would allow them to continue to ban concealed guns. However, universities could implement permanent or temporary security measures later and return to the Board of Regents for permission to ban concealed guns from those buildings. Officials have raised concerns about allowing guns in areas such with combustible materials, such as chemical or engineering laboratories that store pressurized gas cylinders and rocket fuel. However, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt has said universities can't ban handguns from those places. \u2014\u2014\u2014 HAS THERE BEEN ANY OPPOSITION? Faculty and student organizations at the universities have generally been strongly opposed to guns on campus , and the Lawrence-based Kansas Interfaith Action has said it plans to lobby the Legislature to change the law in the next legislative session. Opponents say allowing concealed guns won't make campuses safer. Some people are concerned that students and professors wouldn't be comfortable discussing controversial subjects if they think there might be a gun in the room. Supporters such as the National Rifle Association argue that lawful gun owners should be allowed to carry on campuses for self-protection. They argue that having more law-abiding citizens with guns could potentially deter mass shootings or allow bystanders to intervene to limit the deadly consequences. At least nine states \u2014 Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Tennessee Utah and Wisconsin \u2014 have laws on the books allowing concealed handguns on campus. 0 Shares ",

Mammoth Lakes, which has a history of seismic activity, recorded a 3.9 magnitude temblor Tuesday night that was followed by\u00a0scores of aftershocks. The quake was felt in the area but no damage was reported. A 3.9 quake was recorded in the town of Templeton on the Central Coast around 4 a.m. It was followed by a 3.0 aftershock. Then, a 5.0 magnitude quake was recorded in Cloverdale in Sonoma County. No damage was immediately reported from that quake, but it was felt across the north San Francisco Bay and as far south as the San Francisco peninsula, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A 3.0 aftershock followed. Mammoth Lakes has been the scene of numerous quake swarms over the years due its location in a seismically active area. The Long Valley caldera is one of the most seismically active regions in the state, and is part of a quiet network of 17 volcanoes throughout California. Many of the older volcanoes haven't been active for thousands of years. The Cloverdale area quake occurred near another seismically active area known as The Geysers,\u00a0geothermal field near Clear Lake. There has been much discussion over the years about the origins of these quakes \u00a0and whether the process of generating energy in the field produces small temblors.

    "text": "Where will the Republican Party go after 2016? For now, Republicans insist they stand united. Just two days after Election Day, Trump spent an afternoon on Capitol Hill, meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Ryan. They walked together in front of a throng of press down the historic halls of Congress, praising the progress made in the meetings and signaling unity. But a number of challenges are already on the way, starting with health care. Trump said during the campaign he favors a more interventionist approach by government than do Republican congressional leaders, and Trump has signaled he wants to preserve certain aspects of Obamacare rather than push a wholesale repeal. Trump has also pushed back on cutting entitlement spending, an effort long backed by traditional conservatives. Yet despite Trump\u2019s stated position, Ryan has continued to talk up his longstanding plan to overhaul Medicare. Trump has also advocated a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure, not unlike the stimulus program Obama championed and that Republican lawmakers largely opposed. In foreign policy, Trump splits with his party in some respects, especially in his lack of skepticism of Russia, but Trump\u2019s international positioning has been mostly inconsistent, leaving Republicans uncertain of his next international move. Trump\u2019s victory was so narrow that it\u2019s difficult to attribute any one factor to carrying him across the line. As mentioned in chapter three, tax policy will be a defining debate for the Republican Party. The party consensus since Reagan has emphasized tax cuts for the wealthy as a way to spur economic growth, but some reformers have proposed abandoning this approach in favor of targeted benefits for working families instead. Trump ran on both sides of the issue: He said he supported higher taxes on the rich, but released two multi-trillion-dollar tax plans that overwhelmingly benefitted top earners. The Uncertain Future Trump\u2019s victory was so narrow that it\u2019s difficult to credit any one factor with carrying him across the line. That also makes it hard for both parties to move into the future. If Trump\u2019s win heralds a decisive trend in which white working class voters support Republicans by ever-expanding margins, he could remain a heavy favorite for re-election in 2020 even as the country becomes more racially and economically diverse. Democrats, for their part, could be caught between a Sun Belt moving their way in places like Georgia and Arizona to make up for the Rust Belt\u2019s Republican drift, but not fast enough for a Democratic candidate to win nationally. It\u2019s also possible that Trump\u2019s win is part of a global phenomenon of populist and nationalistic policies and leaders that have caught fire with voters worried about the ongoing threat of international terrorism, increased immigration and economic inequality. Their growth abroad suggests the Trump phenomenon may be durable and go beyond his personal appeal. But it could be Trump\u2019s election was more of a fluke, a razor-thin victory that any of a number of factors could have reversed. Clinton, like Trump, was an unpopular nominee, and depressed Democratic turnout in close races like Michigan and Wisconsin undoubtedly helped Trump win. The biggest unknown factor, though, is simply how Trump performs as president. He starts with a skeptical electorate \u2014 exit polls showed only 33 percent of voters found him honest, and just 35 percent said he had the temperament to be president \u2014 and will have to prove that he can translate his message of radical change into positive results. For an incumbent president seeking re-election, there\u2019s no substitute for success. The biggest unknown factor is simply how Trump performs as president. Share ",

More than one-third of voters have a positive outlook for Trump: 25 percent expect him to be an \u201cabove average\u201d president and 11 percent say he\u2019ll be one of the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest.\u201d \u00a0 CLICK TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS Voters are about three times as likely to say he\u2019ll be \u201cone of the worst\u201d presidents (31 percent) as one of the greatest, while 12 percent say \u201cbelow average.\u201d \u00a0Sixteen percent peg Trump for \u201caverage.\u201d The bar is lower for Trump than it was for the man he will replace. \u00a0A month after Barack Obama won the 2008 election, 19 percent said he would be one of the country\u2019s greatest presidents, 43 percent a \u201cgood\u201d president, and just 6 percent expected him to be one of the worst. One-quarter of Republicans expect Trump will be one of the greatest presidents (24 percent). \u00a0More than twice as many Democrats think he\u2019ll be one of the worst (58 percent). \u00a0 By a 10-point margin, more voters view the president-elect as a \u201cdivider\u201d than a \u201cuniter\u201d (52-42 percent). \u00a0In January 2009, 80 percent considered Obama a \u201cuniter\u201d according to a USA Today/Gallup poll. \u00a0 The new poll, released Wednesday, also finds 59 percent of voters feel hopeful about the outcome of the election. \u00a0That\u2019s more than feel relieved (50 percent), embarrassed (45 percent), excited (43 percent), scared (41 percent), or empowered (41 percent). \u00a0About one-third feels angry (37 percent) or depressed (30 percent). \u00a0 \u00a0 Maybe not surprisingly, 96 percent of those who are excited about the election results also feel hopeful, and 76 percent of angry voters are embarrassed. Views are divided on Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks (44 percent approve vs. 46 percent disapprove), and a 52-percent majority is at least somewhat concerned the real estate mogul will put his business interests ahead of the country\u2019s. Among Republicans, 5 percent disapprove of the people Trump has selected for his Cabinet, 10 percent see him as a divider, and one in five is concerned about a conflict of interest (19 percent). A 60-32 percent majority approved of the job Obama was doing picking his Cabinet in February 2009. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract Overall, a record 47 percent of voters have a favorable view of Trump, up from 38 percent before the election. \u00a0For comparison, 68 percent viewed Obama favorably following his first presidential win in December 2008. \u00a0Currently, 57 percent have a positive view of Obama. \u00a0Former President George W. Bush had a 60 percent favorable after his 2000 win, and today 54 percent feel that way. Trump\u2019s also made gains on character: 44 percent say he has the temperament to serve effectively as president. \u00a0That\u2019s up from 36 percent a month ago -- and a new high. \u00a0It would probably go higher if he spent less time tweeting. \u00a0 Related stories... Fox News Poll: Trump and the Carrier deal By a 63-27 percent margin, voters think the way Trump uses Twitter is inappropriate. \u00a0In addition, three times as many view his public comments as \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reactions rather than \u201cwell thought-out\u201d statements (69-19 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,034 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 11-13, 2016. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

Blue/Bloomberg SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo , already reeling from its September disclosure that 500 million user accounts had been hacked in 2014, disclosed Wednesday that a different attack in 2013 compromised more than 1 billion accounts. The two attacks are the largest known security breaches of one company\u2019s computer network. The newly disclosed 2013 attack involved sensitive user information, including names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and unencrypted security questions that could be used to reset a password. Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions. It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked. Yahoo said it discovered the larger hacking after analyzing data files, provided by law enforcement, that an unnamed third party had claimed contained Yahoo information. Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers. Yahoo has made a steady trickle of disclosures about the 2014 hacking, which it has been investigating with the help of federal authorities. The company said Wednesday that it now believes the attacker in that breach, which it says was sponsored by a government, found a way to forge credentials to log in to some users accounts without a password. Bob Lord, Yahoo\u2019s chief information security officer, said in a statement that the state-sponsored actor in the 2014 attack had stolen Yahoo\u2019s proprietary source code. Outside forensics experts working with Yahoo believe that the state-sponsored hackers used Yahoo\u2019s code to access Yahoo user accounts without their passwords by creating forged \u201ccookies,\u201d short bits of text that a website can store on a user\u2019s machine. By forging these cookies, attackers were able to impersonate valid users, gaining information and performing actions on behalf of their victims. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Security has taken a back seat at Yahoo in recent years, compared to Silicon Valley competitors like Google and Facebook. Yahoo\u2019s security team clashed with top executives, including the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, over the cost and customer inconvenience of proposed security measures. Security experts also say the time it has taken Yahoo to uncover the breach disclosed on Wednesday is a signal that the company\u2019s security and monitoring technologies are inadequate. \u201cWhat\u2019s most troubling is that this occurred so long ago, in August 2013, and no one saw any indication of a breach occurring until law enforcement came forward,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, the chief executive of Synack, a security company. \u201cYahoo has a long way to go to catch up to these threats.\u201d ",

Bloomberg Fed rate hikes could have a modest effect mortgage rates. (Photo: Michael Dwyer, AP) 142 CONNECT TWEET 27 LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday to lift its benchmark short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point is likely to have a domino effect across the economy as it gently pushes up rates for everything from mortgages and credit card rates to small business loans. And the Fed forecast slightly faster increases the next few years\u00a0amid the prospect of a massive government stimulus.\u00a0And there are a couple of wild cards in the mix that could have a bigger effect on borrowing costs than the Fed. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and spend up to $1 trillion to upgrade infrastructure, combined with forecasts of rising oil prices, already has driven up inflation expectations and long-term bond yields in recent weeks. Such factors could play a significant role again next year. Finally! Fed hikes rates for first time in 2016, forecast 3 more in 2017 \u201cFiscal policy may have a bigger say\u201d than Fed interest rate decisions, says John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial. That would mark a shift from prior years, when Fed action had an outsized effect on a slowly growing economy. Still, the Fed\u2019s decision to lift the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, could have at least some effects on consumers: Mortgages Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates already have climbed from 3.47% to 4.13% since late October, costing the holder of a $200,000 mortgage an additional $75 a month. That\u2019s because 10- year Treasury bond yields have jumped nearly a percentage point since September, partly on Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus plan and faster inflation forecasts. The Fed\u2019s key short-term rate affects mortgages and other long-term rates only indirectly. Wednesday\u2019s anticipated \u00a0hike was already priced into such rates, but two more quarter-point rate bumps next year could lift mortgage rates by a total of a another quarter-point, says Greg McBride, chief economist of Bankrate.com. That would mean an additional $30 a month in payments on that $200,000 mortgage. On the margins, that could discourage a small portion of home purchases, says Steve Rick, chief economist of CUNA Mutual Group. Yet that effect could be more than offset by a tight labor market and faster growing economy that push up average wage gains, allowing homebuyers to easily afford the added cost, Canally says. 10 ways to lower your mortgage rate Meanwhile, other factors may loom large. If Congress fails to approve Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus, for example, long-term rates could fall regardless of the Fed, while a faster growing economy and higher inflation could drive up borrowing costs. Adjustable-rate mortgages, by contrast, typically are modified annually and likely would be affected more significantly by three Fed hikes over the next year (including Wednesday\u2019s), McBride says. Adjustable rates, he says, could rise about a half a percentage point in that period, increasing the monthly payment of the $200,000 mortgage by $60. Auto loans Typical five-year auto loans will be more directly influenced by a quarter point increase in the Fed\u2019s key short-term rate, with a 4.25% car-loan rate rising by a similar quarter point, or $3 a month, McBride says. Wednesday\u2019s move and another two similar rate increases next year would increase the monthly payment for a new $25,000 car by a total $9. \u201cInterest rates are going to be a nonissue,\u201d he says. And with auto sales expected to moderate after peaking this year, manufacturers are likely to roll out other incentives, such as lower prices or rebates that temper costs, Canally says. To save big money, find the used-car-buying sweet spot Credit cards and home equity lines of credit Revolving loans with variable rates, such as credit cards and home equity lines of credit, will feel the most immediate impact from an increase in the Fed\u2019s key short-term rate. Average credit card rates are about 16.25%, while home equity lines about 4.75%, according to Bankrate.com. Banks should pass along a quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate to those consumer rates within weeks. Check these 4 things with your credit cards in December Bank savings rates Since banks will be able to charge a bit more for loans, they\u2019ll have a little more leeway to pay higher interest rates on customer deposits. But don\u2019t expect a fast or an equivalent rise in your savings accounts or CD rate. Since the recession, Americans have been keeping a big share of their money in banks, and so they don\u2019t have to offer big incentives to draw more deposits so they can lend more, McBride says. Also, low interest rates have spelled narrow profit margins for banks for years. They now have an opportunity to benefit from a bigger margin between what they pay in interest and what they earn from loans. As a result, bank savings and CD rates may rise only after a lag of six months or more after a Fed move, McBride says. And an increase of 75 basis points in the fed funds rate by late next year may lead to a rise of just 20 or 30 basis points in savings and CD rates. ",

    "text": "5 Tech Issues Donald Trump Will Face as President By Meghan Keneally Dec 14, 2016, 4:21 PM ET 0 Shares Star Drew Angerer/Getty Images Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, Larry Page, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google), Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, Vice President-elect Mike Pence listen as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting of technology executives at Trump Tower, Dec. 14, 2016, in New York City. 0 Shares Email Donald Trump has been meeting with his political rivals for weeks as he fills up his Cabinet, and now he's meeting with another group of former would-be foes: tech titans. The president-elect, who is known for his prolific use of Twitter to disseminate his message, has been at odds with Silicon Valley at various points during the campaign, and there are a number of tech-related issues that he will have to face during his administration. Here is a rundown of some of the biggest issues on which Trump and his team will likely have to work with the tech giants, some of whom he has insulted. 1. Immigration Though not solely a tech issue, Trump's plans relating to immigration could have a direct impact on the tech world. The ability to hire tech-savvy workers and to make contracts with foreign companies with access to cheaper labor costs have become important building blocks in the tech world, and the prospect of changing those policies could significantly affect the industry's practices. An open letter addressed to Trump and signed by more than 140 tech leaders read, \"We believe that America's diversity is our strength. Great ideas come from all parts of society, and we should champion that broad-based creative potential. We also believe that progressive immigration policies help us attract and retain some of the brightest minds on earth \u2014 scientists, entrepreneurs and creators.\" 2. Net Neutrality Net neutrality \u2014 the principle that internet service providers should not reduce the speed of service for certain content or charge more for access to certain websites \u2014 is an issue that Barack Obama's administration has championed. In 2014, Obama and his team pushed to have the Federal Communications Commission include broadband internet service in its classification of a public utility. Trump spoke out against the move, calling it an \"attack on the internet\" in a tweet. He appeared to imply that conservative media sites could be unfairly targeted, even though that is the opposite intention of net neutrality. Obama's attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014 The open letter also addressed tech leaders' concerns about his understanding of how the internet works. \"We also believe in the free and open exchange of ideas, including over the internet, as a seed from which innovation springs. Donald Trump proposes 'shutting down' parts of the Internet as a security strategy \u2014 demonstrating both poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works,\" the letter stated. 3. Encryption The topic of technology encryption came up in the wake of the shooting in San Bernardino , California, when Apple refused government calls to unlock the iPhone of one of the shooters. Trump told his Twitter followers at the time that he would be using only his Samsung phone rather than his iPhone until Apple turned over information about the shooter to authorities and later called for a boycott of all Apple products. Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 \"The phone's not even owned by this young thug that killed all these people. The phone's owned by the government, OK. It's not even his phone,\" he said at an event in South Carolina in February, referring to the fact that the iPhone was issued by his employer. \"But [Apple CEO] Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up. They should get the security or find other people.\" 4. Cybersecurity With the new reports about the role that Russian hacking could have played in the election, the question of cybersecurity is emerging as a hot topic in the transition to the new administration. Trump called for an increase in cybersecurity throughout the federal government but did not specify how that would be tackled. During the campaign, he said there was a need to \"conduct a thorough review of United States cyberdefenses and identify all vulnerabilities. And we have to do that immediately.\" \"We will improve the Department of Defense's cybercapabilities \u2014 a new threat, a new problem, very expensive, and we're not doing very well with cyber,\" he said. 5. Tech Manufacturing Relocation Trump took Apple to task during the campaign for having many of its products made outside the U.S., and considering his push to bring jobs back stateside, this could be an issue for him to bring to the forefront. \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" he said at a rally in January. Apple does much of its manufacturing in China. Bonus: Direct Attacks on Tech CEOs Trump has not shied from criticizing private companies (like Boeing) or individuals (such as a local union president in Indiana after a deal with Carrier not to move jobs to Mexico), and the same holds true when the two are combined. During the campaign, Trump connected his unfavorable view of Amazon and The Washington Post \u2014 he repeatedly called it unfair and at one point suspended its reporters' credentials to cover his campaign events \u2014 to the two companies' owner, Jeff Bezos. The @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon . \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 Trump took his criticism onto the campaign trail as well. \"I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he bought The Washington Post to have political influence, and, I've gotta tell you, we've got a different country than we used to have ... He owns Amazon. He wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems,\" Trump said at an event in Texas on Feb. 26. For his part, Bezos responded by posting a video on Twitter saying that he would save him a space on a rocket. Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump . Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3 \u2014 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015 Bezos is one of the tech entrepreneurs meeting Trump's team at Trump Tower today in New York. Another attendee who has come under fire from Trump is Apple's Cook. Trump repeatedly complained over the years that the iPhone should have a bigger screen. Steve Jobs is spinning in his grave - Apple has lost both vision and momentum - must move fast to get magic back! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2014 In July 2013, in another tweet about how iPhones should have a larger screen, Trump wrote, \"Bring back Steve Jobs!\" Jobs died in October 2011. When there was speculation that the company would introduce larger screens, Trump appeared to suggest he should get credit for the move. I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soon\u2014long overdue. \u2014 Donald J.

    "text": "OPEN Graphic \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any doubt in anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, said at a postelection conference. \u201cThis was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\u201d For the people whose emails were stolen, this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter, recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices, humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts \u201csuboptimal.\u201d \u201cIt was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cIt was the worst professional experience of my life.\u201d The United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark \u2014 with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as \u201cridiculous,\u201d insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that \u201cthey have no idea.\u201d Mr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn. Advertisement \u201cThis tale of \u2018hacks\u2019 resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook. Democratic House Candidates Were Also Targets of Russian Hacking The fallout for nearly a dozen congressional candidates underscores the effect of the Russian influence operation on the American electoral system. Over the weekend, four prominent senators \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical claims. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed. \u201cThis cannot become a partisan issue,\u201d they said. \u201cThe stakes are too high for our country.\u201d A Target for Break-Ins Sitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture. \u201cGOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair,\u201d reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19, 1972, with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year\u2019s election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again. There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders \u2014 and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have. \u201cThere was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Tamene, who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F.B.I. agent, was not a full-time D.N.C. employee; he works for a Chicago-based contracting firm called The MIS Department . He was left to figure out, largely on his own, how to respond \u2014 and even whether the man who had called in to the D.N.C. switchboard was really an F.B.I. agent. \u201cThe F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,\u201d Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that \u201cthe Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed \u2018Dukes\u2019 by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.\u201d Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system. Photo An internal memo by Yared Tamene, a tech-support contractor at the D.N.C., expressed uncertainty about the identity of Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the F.B.I., who called to inform him of the breach. Mr. Tamene\u2019s initial scan of the D.N.C. system \u2014 using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. \u2014 found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, \u201cI did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,\u201d Mr. Tamene explained in his memo. In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was \u201ccalling home, where home meant Russia,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. \u201cSA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.\u201d Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.\u2019s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee\u2019s system had likely been compromised. Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.\u2019s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,\u201d Mr. Henry said. \u201cWe are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.\u201d \u201cThis is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,\u201d he added. \u201cTo me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don\u2019t see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.\u201d The F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency\u2019s handling of the hack. \u201cThe F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that agents \u201cwill continue to share information\u201d to help targets \u201csafeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.\u201d By March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn. A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, got an odd email warning from Google. \u201cSomeone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account,\u201d the March 22 email said , adding that the sign-in attempt had occurred in Ukraine. \u201cGoogle stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.\u201d Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password. Photo A screenshot of the phishing email that Billy Rinehart clicked on, unknowingly giving Russian hackers access to his account. The New York Times has redacted Mr. Rinehart\u2019s email address. What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the \u201cchange password\u201d button. \u201cThis is a legitimate email,\u201d Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta\u2019s aides, who had noticed the alert. \u201cJohn needs to change his password immediately.\u201d With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an \u201cillegitimate\u201d email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since. Photo Mr. Podesta, center, with Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest aide, in Brooklyn the day after the election. Hackers gained access to tens of thousands of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails. Credit Dave Sanders for The New York Times During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C. The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.\u2019s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated. One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a \u201crobust set of monitoring tools,\u201d Mr. Tamene\u2019s internal memo says. Honing Stealthy Tactics Continue reading the main story Photo The headquarters of the Russian F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., in Moscow. Credit Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press The United States had two decades of warning that Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America\u2019s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead. Their first major attack was detected on Oct. 7, 1996, when a computer operator at the Colorado School of Mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain. The school had a major contract with the Navy, and the operator warned his contacts there. But as happened two decades later at the D.N.C., at first \u201ceveryone was unable to connect the dots,\u201d said Thomas Rid , a scholar at King\u2019s College in London who has studied the attack. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investigators gave it a name \u2014 Moonlight Maze \u2014 and spent two years, often working day and night, tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end, they concluded that the total number of files stolen, if printed and stacked, would be taller than the Washington Monument. Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world. But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese \u2014 who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it. The Russians had not gone away, of course. \u201cThey were just a lot more stealthy,\u201d said Kevin Mandia , a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye \u2014 and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems. The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia. But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks. But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cEach time, they eventually met with some form of success,\u201d Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project , wrote recently in a soon-to-be published paper for the Carnegie Endowment. The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them. 2016 Election Hacking Coverage Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.

But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d So the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld. It was a brazen change in tactics, moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014, they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a little-known American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine, then in political turmoil. They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the steal-and-leak strategy. The Open Society Foundation, run by George Soros, was a major target, and when its documents were released , some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members. Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot. The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call. Advertisement Continue reading the main story With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers. \u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d No one knew just how bad the breach was \u2014 but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created, including Ms. Dacey, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann , a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie, the Washington law firm that handles D.N.C. political matters. \u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201d Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them. \u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201d Photo Michael Sussmann, a Washington lawyer and former cybercrime prosecutor at the Justice Department, received an email in late April confirming that the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system had been compromised. The D.N.C. immediately hired CrowdStrike , a cybersecurity firm, to scan its computers, identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day, CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia, Mr. Sussmann said. The work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer. It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes. \u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager. Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email. Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations. That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone. To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents. In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak. All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201d The D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage. \u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d The Media\u2019s Role Continue reading the main story Photo Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign protested at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times In mid-June, on Mr. Sussmann\u2019s advice, D.N.C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak, they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way, they figured, they could get ahead of the story, win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign. But the very next day, a new, deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2.0 appeared on the web, claiming to be the D.N.C. hacker \u2014 and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides. \u2014         GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 20, 2016 \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns. Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201d But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter. \u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201d That gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be. Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2.0 had been edited by someone calling himself, in Russian, Felix Edmundovich \u2014 an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky . Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian, generated by what was clearly a Russian-language version of Word. When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201d Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks.com , a site that sprang up in June, claiming to be the work of \u201chacktivists\u201d but posting more stolen documents. It, too, seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably, the website was registered in April, suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to what Guccifer 2.0 published on his site, he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications . The steady flow of Guccifer 2.0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6, 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland, Guccifer released the D.N.C.\u2019s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives, it was insider gold. Then WikiLeaks, a far more established outlet, began to publish the hacked material \u2014 just as Guccifer 2.0 had promised. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped out 44,053 D.N.C. emails with 17,761 attachments . Some of the messages made clear that some D.N.C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger, Mr. Sanders. That was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside. Mr. Trump, by now the Republican nominee, expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent, and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25, he sent out a lighthearted tweet : \u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7, a month before the election, the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta , Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. The same day, the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings, in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date, with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d \u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201d The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming. Wednesday@HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks . \u2014         Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) Oct. 2, 2016 But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming. Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling. In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d \u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201d Photo Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, disputed intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that the email leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d Credit Steffi Loos/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence. Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web. \u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201d Devising a Government Response Photo The D.N.C. headquarters in Washington. Credit Justin T. Gellerson for The New York Times Inside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea. In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim. In that case, embarrassing emails had also been released. But the real damage was done to Sony\u2019s own systems: More than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released. Within weeks, intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the North and its leadership . Mr. Obama called North Korea out in public, and issued some not-very-effective sanctions . The Chinese even cooperated, briefly cutting off the North\u2019s internet connections. As the first Situation Room meetings on the Russian hacking began in July, \u201cit was clear that Russia was going to be a much more complicated case,\u201d said one participant. The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics, and they were masters of \u201c kompromat ,\u201d their term for compromising information. But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president. \u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system. In August a group that called itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d published a set of software tools that looked like what the N.S.A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install \u201cimplants,\u201d malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A., a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar. The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning. The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes. Photo Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, pressed for a more muscular response to the Russians. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options. But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president. In a series of \u201cdeputies meetings\u201d run by Avril Haines , the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C.I.A., several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands. \u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201d Even something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky. \u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201d Instead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy. Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage. Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks \u2014 an offer he declined to take up. \u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201d But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting. Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters. But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony. The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role. But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified. A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201d Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. \u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded. Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201d A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201d The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that. The Next Target Continue reading the main story Photo President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. walked back toward the White House after delivering remarks about the election results last month. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive. Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump? In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals. What seems clear is that Russian hacking, given its success, is not going to stop. Two weeks ago, the German intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, warned that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. \u201cThe perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such,\u201d Mr. Kahl said. Now, he added, \u201cEurope is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance, and Germany to a particularly great extent.\u201d But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target. On the day after the presidential election, the cybersecurity company Volexity reported five new waves of phishing emails, evidently from Cozy Bear, aimed at think tanks and nonprofits in the United States. One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper.

The news was first reported by NBC affiliate KUSA in Denver, Colorado, and by the Boulder Daily Camera. The two news outlets did a joint investigation in October which pointed to a variety of potential flaws in the interpretation of the DNA evidence in the case. Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett confirmed in a statement to NBC News Wednesday that his office had met with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which he said will be conducting \"some further testing of the DNA evidence in the Ramsey case, as well as other cold case homicides and pending investigations,\" in a new lab with new testing procedures. JonBenet's pajama-clad body was discovered on the morning after Christmas 1996 in the basement of her family's tony Boulder, Colorado, home. The little girl, much of whose brief life was spent on the beauty pageant circuit, had been beaten and strangled. JonBenet Ramsey REUTERS No one has ever been charged in the case. Two theories have emerged among experts and armchair detectives alike: That an intruder broke into the house and killed JonBenet, or that someone in JonBenet's family was responsible for her death. Despite an initial reluctance by the Ramseys to be interrogated by authorities and to allow their then-9-year-old son to be questioned, no one in the family was ever named as a suspect. In 2008, based on results of DNA testing she had received at the time, former Boulder District Attorney Mary Lacy officially cleared JonBenet's family \u2014 mother Patsy, father John, and brother Burke \u2014 of the cloud of suspicion that had hung over them since the murder. Lacy's letter of exoneration was based on evidence that showed an unknown male's DNA on JonBenet's underwear and long johns, supporting the intruder theory, and therefore eliminating the Ramseys as suspects, she said.

PATRICK DAVISON / AFP/Getty Images But the DNA evidence that she reviewed, which was obtained exclusively by KUSA and the Boulder Daily Camera along with reports from the private lab in Virginia that did the testing, did not support her conclusion, according to forensic experts who examined the material for the news outlets. Lacy's letter stated: \"The match of male DNA on two separate items of clothing worn by the victim at the time of the murder makes it clear to us that an unknown male handled these items. Despite substantial efforts over the years to identify the source of this DNA, there is no innocent explanation for its incriminating presence at three sites on these two different items of clothing that JonBenet was wearing at the time of her murder.\" Play ",

    "text": "CBS News Dec 14, 2016 6:46 PM EST As Donald Trump convened\u00a0 his meeting of tech leaders , there was a conspicuous absence Wednesday at Trump Tower: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the social media platform is renowned -- he has over 17 million followers and tweets news and opinions regularly. Representatives from Twitter were not invited to Wednesday\u2019s meeting with technology executives because the guest list was limited to senior executives from tech behemoths like Apple, Amazon and Google, Trump transition sources said. Trump meeting with tech giants after past criticism In attendance were Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, IBM\u2019s Ginny Rommety, and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, among others. Twitter\u2019s market capitalization is $13.5 billion, compared with $614 billion for Apple on the high end. The company present with the closest market capitalization was Tesla, at $32 billion, still well over twice Twitter\u2019s size.\u00a0 \u201cThey simply were not big enough and do not have the economic viability of these companies,\u201d a senior transition source told CBS News.\u00a0 Sean Spicer, a spokesperson for the transition, told MSNBC, \u201cThe conference table was only so big.\u201d President-elect Trump meets with top tech leaders Politico reported the social media company had been \u201cbounced\u201d from the meeting because of a spat that arose over emojis and advertising dollars during the campaign. Using barnyard language, a Trump spokesman vehemently denied any connection.\u00a0 Twitter was one of dozens of tech companies that did not receive an invitation to the meeting, the spokesman explained. A Twitter spokesman would not comment on Politico\u2019s report or on Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting. In the fall, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee (RNC) reached a deal with Twitter to spend $5 million on campaign advertising. As part of the agreement, Twitter promised to provide custom emjois for certain hashtags - icons that appear with a certain phrase. The deal hit a snag before the second presidential debate when Twitter initially approved and then objected to an emoji for the hashtag #crookedhillary that showed a running stick figure holding a moneybag. Moneybag emoji designed by Trump campaign Close screenshot / Gary Coby, Trump campaign, via Medium Twitter offered the Trump campaign and the RNC a discount on the ads and a chance to redesign the emoji. But on October 7th, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called Spicer to voice his objection to the new design (a moneybag with wings) and spike the emoji deal. Moneybag with wings emoji designed by RNC and Twitter Close screen grab / Gary Coby, Trump campaign via Medium \u00a0 Twitter said at the time, \u201cWe believe that political advertising merits a level of disclosure and transparency that branded political emojis do not meet, and we ultimately decided not to permit this particular format for any political advertising.\u201d The social media platform released the same statement again Wednesday after Politico published its report but would not comment further.\u00a0 \u00a0 A person familiar with Twitter\u2019s negotiations with the RNC offered no proof that Wednesday\u2019s snub was retribution for the emoji flap, but said that tensions still remain. Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel arranged the meeting with the president-elect and vice president-elect. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Katia Christodoulou, European Pressphoto Agency) NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 Tanur\u00a0Tsiknakis\u00a0and her husband,\u00a0Michalis,\u00a0now have two sets of clocks in their home they must follow \u2014 each on a separate\u00a0time zone one hour apart. \u201cMy phone and all my digital appliances are set in southern time,\u201d said Tanur, 35, a diving instructor who lives in the south but works on the north side of this divided island of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. \u201cOur (TV) satellite box and my car clock are set to northern time.\u201d Last month, like the rest of Europe, Republic of Cyprus officials who are aligned with Greece and govern the south side of the island moved their clocks back an hour with the end of daylight savings time. But leaders in northern Cyprus opted against\u00a0the switch and\u00a0followed\u00a0the example of Turkey, which scrapped the change\u00a0on the grounds that it causes\u00a0needless confusion. As a result, Nicosia now holds two distinctions.\u00a0It is the last divided capital in Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall \u2014 a United Nations buffer zone separates the Greek\u00a0southern part of Cyprus from the Turkish-Cypriots in the north \u2014 and it is also the only world capital that\u00a0follows two time zones. The situation might sound humorous, but it reflects more than just a difference of one hour. A\u00a0long and bitter division\u00a0between the island's ethnic Greeks and Turks\u00a0erupted in violence in 1974, when Turkish troops captured more than a third of the island after a\u00a0military junta in Greece\u00a0overthrew the Cypriot leadership and tried\u00a0to unite the island with Greece. Afterward, Turkish Cypriots declared an independent country recognized only by\u00a0the Turkish government. While violence between the two sides hasn\u2019t flared for decades, bureaucratic confusion remains. Today, Tanur, who is\u00a0Greek,\u00a0and Michalis, who is Turkish, might use one time zone for meeting a friend in the north\u00a0but another for remembering when their favorite show airs\u00a0on the south\u2019s TV schedule. And no one is quite sure what to do on New Year's Eve. The time-zone quandary\u00a0is yet another stumbling block in U.N.-brokered peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots that recently resumed after both sides rejected a reunification plan in 2004. The director of Cyprus\u2019 Peace Research Institute, Harry-Zachary Tzimitras, said the issue is a symbol for continued division. \u201cFor some, the time zone change in Turkey means distancing themselves not only from Europe and the Western world, but also from the Cyprus of the future,\u201d Tzimitras said. He added that there is a practical reason\u00a0behind the two time zones:\u00a0Many Turkish-Cypriots lives are intertwined with the Turkish economy, and every financial transaction that occurs in the north goes through Turkey, whether it's a wire transfer or adding credit to a mobile phone. \u201cFollowing the Turkish time zone was a practical necessity for the north, particularly for the banking sector and transportation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't think it was a choice of joining Turkey and abandoning Cyprus.\u201d Many Turkish-Cypriots dislike the situation, saying it makes\u00a0life tough. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t know what time it is these days because my clocks are turned to Cyprus time, but officially here in the north we\u2019re on Turkish time,\u201d said Saimon Bahceli, 49, the Turkish-Cypriot\u00a0owner of a caf\u00e9. He\u00a0joked that he\u2019s often stumped about when he should schedule performances to accommodate his Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot patrons. In one case, the change has had\u00a0serious consequences. Turkish Cypriots take part in a protest on December 6, 2016, in the northern part of Nicosia against northern Cyprus' decision to abandon Daylight Saving Time, blaming the move for a couple of road crashes since its implementation. \u00a0(Photo: Birol Bebek, AFP/Getty Images) Shortly after the north kept its clock unchanged, two teenage girls and their bus driver died in a pre-dawn collision that\u00a0might have been averted if the bus had left an hour later. Hundreds of Turkish-Cypriots took to the streets to protest. Students held signs reading: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t go to school at night.\u201d The Turkish-Cypriot government recently decided that schools and public services would start a half-hour\u00a0later so children and public employees start their days after sunrise. Michalis and Tanur say\u00a0if they can make their mixed\u00a0marriage work, the politicians should be able to mend fences between the two communities. The couple is organizing two street parties on New Year\u2019s Eve to celebrate but also to protest the time\u00a0difference. After midnight in the north, they plan to pass through the buffer-zone and celebrate the New Year again in the south. \u201cIt's ridiculous,\u201d Michalis said. \u201cIt\u2019s like two brothers fighting over a ball. Grow up and share it.\u201d Of course, everyone can just wait for spring and the return of Daylight Savings Time, when all Cypriots will be back on one time zone. 5 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hGmfMC ",

    "text": "Colorado School District Decides Whether to Arm Teachers By The Associated Press DENVER \u0097 Dec 14, 2016, 5:05 PM ET 0 Shares Email A rural Colorado school district is deciding whether to arm its teachers and other school staff to protect its students. The Hanover School District 28 board is set to vote Wednesday night on whether to allow school employees to volunteer to be armed on the job after undergoing training. The district's two schools serve about 270 students about 30 miles southeast of Colorado Springs, and it takes law enforcement an average of 20 minutes to get there. The district currently shares an armed school resource officer with four other school districts. Board member Michael Lawson backs the idea not only as way to protect students from a mass shooting, but also as protection against possible violence connected with nearby marijuana grows, which he believes are connected with foreign cartels, the Gazette of Colorado Springs reported (http://bit.ly/2hoSxeQ). School board President Mark McPherson said a survey showed the community was split on the issue. While staffers would get some training, the retired Army officer said he didn't think it would be enough to help them respond effectively to an active shooter. He worries what would happen if they fired and missed in a classroom. \"We need to leave that to the professionals,\" said McPherson, who also worries about the risk posed by just having the guns in the school building and how they would be stored. He said he is only aware of one marijuana growing operation within about 5 miles of the schools. McPherson said he thinks comments about cartel involvement in the area are just rumors at this point. Other school districts in Colorado and in Texas, Oklahoma and California have also backed allowing teachers to carry weapons following the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. An undisclosed number of teachers and other employees at a one-school district in Colorado's sparsely populated Eastern Plains are currently being trained after the school board approved the move in July largely out of concern for how long it would take law enforcement to respond. All had concealed weapons permits and volunteered for the duty, Fleming School superintendent Steve McCracken said. They all must undergo an initial 46 hours of training, including live fire training, plus yearly training and undergo a psychological examination. The firearm training costs a total of $3,000, and the district will also have to spend unknown amount money to buy firearms and ammunition. But McCracken said that it still makes more financial sense than trying to hire an outside security officer to protect the school. The latest Colorado vote comes on the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre. McPherson said the proposal has been in the works since June and the timing of the final vote is coincidental. 0 Shares ",

Willie Cochran, 20th, is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud, two counts of extortion and two counts of bribery, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. Jason Meisner , Jeremy Gorner and Hal Dardick Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Willie Cochran was running for 20th Ward alderman as a political unknown a decade ago when he vowed to steer clear of the graft and corruption that had ensnared so many Chicago politicians over the years. \"Most people in the ward are tired of our public officials being embroiled in one controversy after another,\" Cochran, a former Chicago police officer, told the Tribune on the day incumbent Ald. Arenda Troutman was indicted on charges of taking kickbacks from contractors. But instead of cleaning up the sleaze, Cochran was charged by federal authorities with being yet another corrupt Chicago alderman. The 15-count indictment announced Wednesday alleged the South Side alderman stole tens of thousands of dollars in charitable contributions meant for poor children and seniors in the largely impoverished ward, funds he later used to gamble and pay for a portion of his daughter's college tuition. Using the broad powers that aldermen enjoy over business deals in their wards, Cochran also shook down a liquor store manager in exchange for his support on an ordinance change and took a bribe in connection with a federal program to clean up vacant eyesores, the charges alleged. Cochran, 64, was charged with 11 counts of wire fraud, two counts of extortion and two counts of bribery, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. He is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 23 at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. This week's indictment of South Side Ald. Willie Cochran adds a new name to a long list: Chicago politicians charged with crimes. Cochran was charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, federal program bribery and extortion. More here. Chicago aldermen have been frequent law-enforcement targets, with... (Chicago Tribune) In a statement Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon said the investigation arose from information provided by former Chicago Legislative Inspector General Faisal Khan, who 13 months ago turned over his files to the FBI after aldermen eliminated his post, complaining of his judgment and overreach. Khan told the Tribune on Wednesday that Cochran's indictment \"vindicated our work.\" He expressed hope that more federal charges could result from his work, saying, \"We referred a number of investigations to the FBI.\" The charges come two months after the Tribune first revealed that a federal grand jury was investigating Cochran for possible misuse of funds. The Tribune broke the news of the indictment Wednesday morning as Cochran attended the final City Council meeting of the year. Minutes later, Ald. Edward Burke, 14th, walked over to Cochran, showed him his iPad and spoke quietly to him for a couple of minutes while the council was busy honoring the Chicago Cubs with the World Series trophy at the front of chambers. In a text message to a Tribune reporter later Wednesday, Cochran vowed to continue to stay on as alderman while under indictment. He said he and his attorney, Thomas Anthony Durkin, would work with the U.S. attorney's office \"to provide the clarity that is needed to get this matter resolved.\" \"I can say my colleagues and the people of the 20th Ward are strong supporters for my family, and I am confident this will be resolved,\" he wrote. Durkin later said the alderman intends to fight the charges vigorously. The indictment again exposed the risk of aldermen leveraging their extensive powers \u2014 in this case over real estate development and liquor licenses \u2014 for bribery. Cubs as word came down that one of their colleagues who was on hand had been indicted on federal criminal charges. South Side Ald. Willie Cochran already was sitting in... An inimitably Chicago scene played out during Wednesday's City Council meeting as aldermen heaped praise on the world champion Cubs as word came down that one of their colleagues who was on hand had been indicted on federal criminal charges. South Side Ald. Willie Cochran already was sitting in... (John Byrne, Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart) According to the charges, Cochran was the sole signatory on the 20th Ward activities fund, a charity set up to host ward events and parties for constituents such as a summer back-to-school picnic, a Valentine's Day party for senior citizens and events during the holiday season. Cochran was charged with using \"a significant portion\" of the donations made over more than four years for his own personal use, including paying $5,000 toward his daughter's college tuition. He also withdrew about $25,000 from ATMs in or near casinos where he gambled, according to the indictment. In October, a real estate developer told the Tribune that the FBI had questioned him about a donation to Cochran for the ward fund. \"I'll tell you the same thing I told them,\" said the developer, who asked for anonymity. \"I gave him a check, I think it was for a couple hundred dollars. ... What he did with it, I have no clue.\" On Wednesday, another businessman who said he testified before the grand jury investigating Cochran told the Tribune he had written several checks to the alderman over recent years \u2014 some for as much as $300 or $500. \"I wrote a check to him for a fundraiser for kids going back to school,\" said the businessman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because federal authorities had not authorized him to talk. \"I was shocked really,\" he said of the charges against Cochran. \"He's always been a straight-up guy.\" According to the indictment, Cochran also solicited a $1,500 check from an attorney \u2014 identified only as Individual A \u2014 who represented real estate developers with properties in Cochran's ward in connection with a federal program to get boarded-up or foreclosed properties occupied as soon as possible. Prosecutors charged that in 2010 and 2011 Cochran provided letters of support to the attorney about a particular real estate project. The unidentified project was completed in 2014. In 2015, Cochran took a $3,000 cash bribe from a liquor store owner \u2014 identified as Individual B \u2014 in exchange for his support of an ordinance amending the municipal code to allow liquor sales in a two-block stretch of South Cottage Grove Avenue in the 20th Ward, the charges alleged. The owner wanted to sell the business, but the area had since gone \"dry,\" and the amendment was needed for the buyer to continue to sell liquor there. The amendment was passed by the City Council in April 2015. But in a twist earlier this year while Cochran was being investigated, the alderman proposed a new ordinance to again prohibit the sale of packaged liquor on that same stretch of Cottage Grove. The council approved that change in October. Individual B, identified by the Tribune through property records as the seller of the Cottage Grove liquor store in August 2015, declined to comment when a reporter knocked on his west suburban home Wednesday evening. Cochran had taken similar action with his campaign fund. State records show that since January 2015 the alderman has filed an unusually large number of revisions to his campaign finance paperwork \u2014 around 80, including 10 since early last month. Over the previous eight years, Cochran had filed only six amendments to his campaign records. In some of the amended campaign finance reports, Cochran revealed he had paid himself out of his campaign fund. In several instances, Cochran did not report those payments until well after he filed his campaign reports with state elections officials \u2014 in some cases more than a year or two later. But the indictment against Cochran makes no allegations that he misused his campaign fund. The City Council has a long, notorious history of corruption as 29 aldermen have been convicted of crimes related to their official duties since 1972. The most recent, Isaac \"Ike\" Carothers, pleaded guilty in 2010 to bribery and tax charges for accepting $40,000 in home improvements for backing a developer's controversial project in his 29th Ward. His father, William, a former alderman, was convicted 27 years earlier. Cochran was elected in 2007 after Troutman was charged with bribery for soliciting donations from developers seeking to do business in the ward. Cochran was quick to capitalize on the news, publicly calling for Troutman to resign on the day she was arrested by the FBI. Troutman pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to four years in prison. Federal authorities have hinted at other investigations connected to City Hall . In August, Franshuan Myles, the head of a nonprofit group that allegedly made a $5,000 payment to a West Side alderman, pleaded not guilty to charges alleging she used state grant funds to cover personal expenses instead of providing summer jobs for youth. Charges alleged that Myles, president and executive director of Divine Praise Inc., wrote a check for $4,932 to \"Individual A,\" previously identified by the Tribune as 28th Ward Ald. Jason Ervin , after her group received a $60,000 grant for youth employment. Ervin has not been charged with wrongdoing. Cochran, who is considered an ally of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, does not hold any position of power \u2014 such as a committee or caucus chairmanship \u2014 in the council hierarchy. He won a third term in office last year, surviving a tough runoff election. After that victory, Cochran told reporters he and his wife were going to celebrate by flying to Las Vegas and renting a convertible for a West Coast road trip. According to the biography posted on his ward's website, Cochran is the youngest of 10 children. He has a master's degree in public administration from the Illinois Institute of Technology and also has a bachelor's degree in sociology. Cochran retired from the Chicago Police Department with the rank of sergeant in 2003 after 26 years on the force. Court records hint at recent financial troubles for Cochran. He has been the target of three foreclosure lawsuits over his personal home and laundry businesses he held a financial stake in. Cochran, who is paid $116,208 a year as alderman and also collects $60,280 annually from his police pension, suggested in late 2014 that aldermen should be paid more, saying he often works 60 hours a week or more. Days later, he was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court claiming he had defaulted on the $420,000 mortgage on his Woodlawn home, according to court records. He still owed more than $384,000 on the mortgage as of November 2014, records showed. The foreclosure was dismissed in July 2015 \"due to the fact that the loan was reinstated,\" court records state. Records show it was the second time Cochran and his wife had faced foreclosure stemming from the same 2006 loan. A similar lawsuit was filed in 2012 and then dismissed months later after the loan was renegotiated, according to court records. In 2013, Cochran, who for years owned the Rainbow Brite laundromat on East 63rd Street, was named in a foreclosure lawsuit involving a string of laundromats he had a financial stake in, according to court records. That lawsuit alleged that the business owner, Alexander Fletcher, had defaulted on a $1.5 million loan involving several laundromats. It was dismissed in 2014.

I think Kanye was a publicity stunt,\u201d Legend told the French outlet\u00a0Clique, in a video since published on\u00a0 RollingStone.com . Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen, who are friends with West and Kim Kardashian,\u00a0were strong advocates for Hillary Clinton during the election, and Legend has past engaged in a war of words with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., on Twitter. Kanye says he met with Trump to discuss 'multicultural issues' West made a highly publicised visit to see\u00a0the president-elect at Trump Tower on Tuesday in New York City, afterward\u00a0tweeting\u00a0they discussed \"multicultural issues.\" The rapper said \"these issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.

By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Brian Fung December 14 at 5:35 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @b_fung \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump held a meeting with several key Silicon Valley leaders December 14. Here's what we know about that meeting. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) NEW YORK CITY \u2014 A dozen or so technology executives filed into a conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower Wednesday wearing suits not usually seen in Silicon Valley. Their combined net worth \u2014 at least $136 billion \u2014 was gilded even for the likes of Trump Tower. After months of acrimony that at times felt personal, they had come to make nice with President-elect Donald Trump. And make nice they did. As they went around the room introducing themselves one-by-one, Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos, once the target of Trump's attacks, said he was \u201csuper-excited to talk about innovation in this administration.\u201d Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was also \u201cexcited to talk about jobs,\u201d according to a pool report from the opening moments of the meeting. (Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) Trump was also on his best behavior during the roughly two-hour meeting. \u201cThis is a truly amazing group of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's nobody like you in the world. In the world. There's nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you.\u201d But behind the cordiality was a sense of trepidation . Trump, both as candidate and president-elect, has used his perch to shame companies, and the consequences haven't been trivial. When Trump tweeted earlier this month that he wanted to cancel Boeing's $4 billion contract to build Air Force One, Boeing's stock price took a hit. Trump has targeted Apple and other companies for manufacturing their products in China, and has called to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, a crucial issue for Silicon Valley companies that import widgets and other hardware components from China. At the meeting, which included the leaders of Google, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, IBM, Cisco, and Tesla, Trump seemed willing to back down from a signature campaign promise to end free-trade deals. \u201cWe're going to make fair trade deals,\u201d he told the executives. \u201cWe're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.\u201d Also in attendance was Trump's children and Wilbur Ross, his nominee for the Commerce Department. Last month, Trump negotiated with equipment maker Carrier, a division of United Technologies, to avoid losing 800 jobs to Mexico in exchange for $7 million in government subsidies. In the days leading up to the meeting, staff for the companies tried to parse whether the image-conscious Trump would try to use his leverage with them to do something similar. After the CEO roundtable, Trump met privately with Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Tesla manufactures its vehicles in California but purchases components from China. Apple hardware largely comes from China. Attendees had a wide-ranging and generally positive conversation, discussing issues from visas for high-skilled immigrants to trade issues to the cloud, according to people familiar with the discussion. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a central campaign promise, and called for an end to the high-skilled visa program during a presidential debate, though he later backtracked. Technology companies are some of the heaviest users of such visas. At the meeting, Trump seemed open to keeping the high-skilled visa program, a person familiar with the discussion said. The president-elect also heaped praise on Facebook board and transition team member Peter Thiel, shaking his hand and calling him a \u201cspecial guy.\u201d Trump made a point of saying that Thiel, who convened the meeting, nixed companies that were too small from attending. But one relatively small company with ties to Thiel made the cut: Palantir. Unlike the other companies in attendance, the data-mining start-up, which Thiel founded in 2004, is private and had revenue last year of less than $300 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. A large portion of Palantir's business involves contracts with federal agencies, and the company is currently engaged in a lawsuit with the Department of Defense over the right to compete for more contracts. The executives left as they arrived \u2014 wordlessly and quickly, striding through the lobby and ignoring press questions. Some smiled; Oracle's Catz flashed a brief thumbs-up when asked how the meeting went. business ",

USA TODAY (Photo: Yahoo!) 2520 CONNECT TWEET 29 LINKEDIN 38 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo late Wednesday disclosed a breach that took place in August\u00a02013 that may have resulted in the theft of data associated with more than one billion user accounts. The latest\u00a0breach is separate from a 500-million-account breach the company disclosed in September of this year. At the time, the 500-million-account breach, which took place in 2014, was believed to be the largest on record. Yahoo ( YHOO )shares fell 2.5% after hours. The new revelation comes at a time when cybercrime issues loom larger than ever. The CIA has accused Russia of specifically attempting to tamper with the U.S. election via hacked emails, ransomware hit the nation's seventh-largest transit system , in San Francisco\u00a0and a monster botnet of hijacked devices took down much of the East Coast's Internet traffic for a day in October. \u201cWe truly are under major siege and we\u2019re unprepared for it. It really is a national emergency,\u201d said Avivah Litan vice president at Gartner Research. \u201cWe need a national response plan for this.\u201d Whether the attacker in this instance was state-sponsored or merely economically motivated, the danger is very real, said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. \u201cWe're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments,\u201d he said. \u201cAs is the case in any cyber-attack, the incentive is there, the reputation threat is real, and intelligence services have 1 billion reasons to try.\u201d Top hacks and data breaches Yahoo said in September that it had evidence linking the 500-million-account breach to a state-sponsored actor. It does not know who is behind the 1-billion-account breach announced Wednesday and it does not appear the two are linked. In a statement on its website , the company said, \"We believe that the August 2013 incident is likely distinct from the incident we disclosed on September 22, 2016.\" There is some overlap between the affected accounts, but Yahoo is not disclosing how much. Ongoing acquisition Verizon announced a $4.8\u00a0billion deal to acquire Yahoo on July 25 and work on the takeover has been ongoing since then. \"As we\u2019ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions,\u201d it said in a statement to USA TODAY. The revelation could absolutely derail the Verizon acquisition, said Jacob Olcott,\u00a0former legal advisor to the Senate Commerce Committee and now vice president at the security firm BitSight. Verizon was buying Yahoo in part to get customer accounts. \u201cNow Verizon will be trying to figure out what\u00a0the customer loss will be, based on this information that\u2019s being released now and how it affects their valuation,\u201d he said. In addition, Verizon will need to factor in how much it will cost for them to bring Yahoo up to their security standards, he said. Verizon begins Yahoo breach evaluation, earnings hit by Samsung Note 7 recall November disclosure Yahoo disclosed in November that a law enforcement officials had given it data files showing what appeared to be evidence\u00a0that an unknown third party had access to Yahoo user data. Yahoo brought in outside forensic experts and confirmed that the data was in fact from Yahoo users. As part of that analysis, Yahoo now says it believes the attacker \u201cstole data associated with more than one billion user accounts,\u201d the company said in a release . Yahoo does not know who was behind the theft. The company has pinpointed the date when the attackers were able to remove user information from the system as \u00a0August 2013, but it does not know when they gained entry to its network or how long they were there. The fact that the breach went unnoticed for so long isn\u2019t surprising, said Arun Vishwanath,\u00a0a security expert at the University at Buffalo. \u201cThe sobering facts are that almost all such hacks are only accidentally discovered and that hackers usually stay in the system undetected for at least a year if not more,\" he said. \"Yahoo's case is not so unique. Only its scale is troubling.\u201d The stolen account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords\u00a0and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, the company said. The stolen information did not include payment card data, or bank account information, Yahoo said. Yahoo is working to notify affected users, and is working closely\u00a0with law enforcement to investigate the breach. Some in the security community said Yahoo had not been as concerned with security as it might have been. \u201cIn our interactions with Yahoo over the years, there has been a consistent lack of interest in security as well as a palpable arrogance in their ability to manage their security without any help from the outside.\u00a0 As we said in our last interaction, \u2018thank you for the meeting and the best of luck doing everything yourself,\u2019\u201d said Philip Lieberman, president of Los Angeles-based Lieberman Software.

And whatever you do, don\u2019t serve red & green sugar cookies shaped like Christmas trees, first reported by the fine folks at Campus Reform . \u201cAvoid religious symbolism, such as Santa Claus, evergreen trees or a red nosed reindeer, which are associated with Christmas traditions,\u201d Kessler recommended. \u201cExcellent alternatives are snowflakes, snow men or winter themes not directly associated with a particular holiday or religion.\u201d Now, that one left me a bit puzzled \u2013 because I can\u2019t seem to find any reference to a red-nosed reindeer in the New Testament. Speaking of snowflakes, he also suggested party planners avoid playing Christmas carols or any music associated with a \u201cfaith tradition.\u201d Instead, he recommended \u201ccelebratory party music.\u201d Instead of chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Texas Woman\u2019s University wants everybody to Wang Chung tonight. As for the Yuletide noshing, Professor Kessler advises a diverse menu with \u201citems that reflect dietary preferences and requirements of non-majority groups in your organization (e.g, halal or kosher).\u201d Just imagine the festive scene at TWU\u2019s all-inclusive winter shindig. Instead of scarfing down Little Smokies and shrimp cocktail, guests would be stuffing their faces with gluten-free hummus and Gefilte fish.\u00a0 So if you are one of the unfortunate souls who received an invitation, you might want to drop by the Chick-fil-A drive-thru before the party. I reached out to the university spokesperson to get the back story or at least some context on their Yuletide suggestions \u2013 but so far no one has returned my telephone call. Because as it now stands, it sure looks like the folks at Texas Woman\u2019s University are a few nuts shy of a fruitcake.

I was trying to track her down on behalf of Angel Mott. But then I found her. And met her. This may sound odd in a week in which the 31-year-old Des Moines woman is burying her own mother, but one of the people whom Mott would most like to meet right now\u00a0is a complete stranger. Mott didn\u2019t even know the woman\u2019s name. All she knew is that the woman looked to be in her 30s and had short black hair streaked with purple. And that this mystery woman was incredibly tender and compassionate with Mott when she was at her grief-stricken worst in the middle of a store aisle on the morning of Black Friday. You know the scene: Typical behavior on the High Holy American shopping day after Thanksgiving\u00a0is to stampede directly to some cheap plastic thing\u00a0and trample everything and everybody in the way. But Mott was graced by a more serene fellow shopper\u00a0at 6:25 a.m. in the middle of Mills Fleet Farm in Ankeny, just as she received a devastating phone call. Mott wasn\u2019t there on a shopping spree; she only needed a pair of dog beds for her German shepherds, especially her decrepit 12-year-old pooch, Killer, whose bones ache\u00a0on her hardwood floors. That\u2019s when the call came in from the nursing home on the south side of Des Moines where her mom lived. \u201cAngel, honey,\u201d said the nurse on the phone, \u201cyour mom passed away.\u201d Mott\u2019s mom, Rose Danylchuck, was 57. Angel Motts with her mother,  Rose Danylchuk, during Motts' wedding in 2013. \u00a0(Photo: Special to The Des Moines Register) \u201cI just kind of blacked out,\u201d Mott said, \u201cand I just started crying uncontrollably. And I sat down on the shelves probably for about 5 minutes and just bawled.\u201d The mystery woman encountered Mott and, instead of averting her gaze and breezing by, stopped and asked what was wrong. The mystery woman sagged to the floor, held Mott and sobbed with her. The mystery woman kept her in a tight embrace until Mott was able to regain enough composure to get back on her feet. She even led Mott to the checkout line and asked if any shoppers had enough Christmas spirit to let the grieving woman cut in line. The lanes immediately parted to let her through. Mott, still dazed, didn\u2019t think to ask the mystery woman her name. She sat in her car for 20 minutes before she could even regain her senses enough to drive to the opposite side of the metro. She fought through a panic attack to walk into the nursing home and into her mother\u2019s room to confront the horrible scene of her mother's body crumpled in the room where the two had spent hours together. \u201cIt was the worst sight I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d she said. Danylchuk\u00a0will be laid to rest in Des Moines Thursday. In recent days, Mott\u2019s gratitude for the mystery woman has been a comfort, so much that she longed to reach out and belatedly thank her. But all she remembered was the dark hair with purple streaks. I pressed Mott for other details \u2014\u00a0distinctive shoes, a concert T-shirt, whatever \u2014\u00a0to no avail. She did barely notice\u00a0the stranger\u2019s blond-haired sister also standing nearby. So Mott did what all of us do these days: She turned to Facebook. She posted a paragraph for the more than 63,000 members of the \u201cI grew up in Iowa!\u201d public Facebook group: \u201cHoping you nice people can help me find a lady. I was out shopping on Black Friday at six in the morning at Mills Fleet Farm in Ankeny. In the middle of shopping I got a phone call that my mom had passed away. I sat down on the shelf in the aisle and must've bawled for several minutes. Some nice lady with black hair (I think) and purple highlights, sat down with me and hugged me for about five minutes. She cried with me. I would just like to thank her very much. Not one person stopped to see if I was OK. But her and her sister did and I appreciate that more than they'll ever know! My mom was my best friend. I felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest. She was only 57. I'm only 31, I still need my momma!\u201d Mott was used to visiting her mother at least every other day.\u00a0Roles had reversed in recent years so that Mott had become her mother\u2019s caregiver and guardian. Angel Mott, left, suffered the death of her mom, Rose Danylchuk, 57, on Friday, Nov. 25. \u00a0(Photo: Special to The Des Moines Register) Danylchuk was a certified nursing assistant full of humor and empathy who worked in hospice, tending to the emotionally gut-wrenching work of ushering patients through their final fragile months of life. She worked at the Kavanagh House on 56th Street in Des Moines. She changed bedding, helped patients shower or brush their teeth, or sat with them just to hold a hand when they were scared and lonely. Danylchuk loved her work but also found joy in the birth of her granddaughter, Mott's daughter, Kennedy. The little girl was born a couple years ago, just six months\u00a0before everything changed. \u201cShe was so, so happy to be a grandma,\u201d Mott said. \u201cShe was ready for the next chapter of life.\u201d But all that changed suddenly when a blood clot in Danylchuk's head triggered massive, debilitating strokes. She was robbed of much of her eyesight and confined to a wheelchair. According to Mott, doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of her mother's complex, worsening condition. The last months were horrible. Danylchuk lost the ability to speak. She quit moving. It was as if her body was contracting, withering. She couldn\u2019t even open her hands. Hallucinations became routine. \u201cShe thought we were murdered next to her, lying next to her dead,\u201d Mott said. \u201cShe thought we were being eaten by alligators.\u201d She thought she was drowning. \u201cI\u2019m actually very thankful that she doesn\u2019t have to suffer anymore,\u201d Mott said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to lose your mom.\u201d Mott had just put her mother in hospice a week before the death, but the staff had expected her mom to linger for half a year. So that gives you a sense of Mott's fragile state of mind when she received that phone call in the middle of Fleet Farm, and why she was so touched by the mystery woman's kindness. And why she felt compelled to search for her. One particular re-post of Mott's initial Facebook paragraph led to yet another\u00a0re-posting, which in turn was spotted by the mystery woman\u2019s sister, Sara Ross. Ross wrote: \u201cThe lady she is looking for is my lovely sister Stephanie Uhlenberg. She just saw her there crying and couldn't just walk by. She had to make sure she was OK. Once she found out why she was crying her heart just went out to her. Doesn't matter if a stranger or not no one needs to be alone when receiving news like that.\u201d Uhlenberg, 42, is happy to pass for a 30-something. And the Ankeny woman\u2019s dark brown hair is streaked with faded purple because she\u2019s a die-hard Minnesota Vikings fan. \"She had these tears coming down her face,\" Uhlenberg remembered of that Black Friday morning. \"I sat next to (Mott) and held her. I didn't know what else to do.\" Once Uhlenberg realized that Mott had been scouring social media for her, the most appropriate thing she could think to do was to grab her sister and attend Danylchuk's visitation Wednesday evening at Hamilton's Funeral Home in Des Moines. I watched as Uhlenberg walked into the lobby\u00a0\u2014 easy to spot with her purple hair and Vikings coat. Once Mott recognized her, the two strangers-turned-friends\u00a0wrapped each other in another big embrace. They shed happier tears. The family and other mourners looked on, probably feeling what I felt: It was reassuring to see such a warm, visible sign that the chance encounters and random acts of kindness we too often take for granted sometimes make a big difference. \"My heart just went out to you,\" Uhlenberg said to Mott. \"I just wanted to know if you were going to be OK.\" When Uhlenberg introduced her sister, Mott then wrapped Ross in a hug, laughing through her tears, \"I barely recognize you.\" That's OK, Ross responded with her own laugh. Uhlenberg was glad that she could help. She called Facebook \"such a great thing and such a horrible thing at the same time.\" We know all too well from our daily lives how social media can divide us. But in the best case it also stitches us together. \u201cThat hug meant the world to me,\" Mott said. \"It made me feel like people actually still care.\u201d After Uhlenberg consoled Mott that morning and ushered her out the door, she went looking for her own mother who had been shopping with her and was wandering in some far corner of the store. She found\u00a0her mom and wrapped her in a big hug. *** ",

Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the family planning group performs abortions at some clinics. J. Scott Applewhite/AP The Obama administration is trying to protect Planned Parenthood's federal funding before the president turns over the reins of government to Republicans who have historically been hostile to the family planning group. The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a regulation Wednesday that says states that award federally funded grants for women's health programs can't discriminate against Planned Parenthood . The regulation doesn't name Planned Parenthood, but it was clear the rule was written with the organization in mind. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the family planning group performs abortions at some clinics. \"President Obama has cemented his legacy as a champion for women's health,\" said Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards in a written release . \"This rule protects birth control, cancer screenings, [sexually transmitted infection] testing and treatment and other health care for millions of people.\" Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide family planning services to women get federal funding through the Public Health Service Act . The group says 1.5 million of its patients benefit from the money provided by the federal government. Article continues after sponsorship Planned Parenthood gets more than $500 million a year from the federal government. About 75 percent of that comes from Medicaid, for medical care provided to patients with low incomes. The new HHS rule reinforces federal law that says the agency cannot discriminate against qualified organizations in granting federal funds. Still, the rule could be overturned in 2017 when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Federal lawmakers are allowed to roll back regulations under the Congressional Review Act. Or they could go through a formal rule-making process to reverse Wednesday's action. ",

Gen. Mike Flynn, \"inappropriately shared\" classified information with foreign governments, a 2010 military investigation concluded. The finding, first reported by The Washington Post, contradicts Flynn's previous account of the incident, in which he told the newspaper in August that he had permission to share the material. The documents, obtained by the Post under the Freedom of Information Act, do not describe what Flynn shared or with whom while he was the top military intelligence officer in Afghanistan. The Post said the material had to do with CIA activities. In an interview with The Post in August, Flynn acknowledged that he had been investigated for giving classified information to British and Australian officials \u2014 America's closest allies \u2014 serving in Afghanistan alongside U.S. forces.

The Defense Department's inspector general's office, which conducted an independent review of the investigation, came to the same conclusion, the documents state. The investigation concluded that he did not act \"knowingly\" and that \"there was no actual or potential damage to national security as a result.\" It also points out that no disciplinary action was taken against Flynn. The Army investigation was ordered by the head of U.S. Central Command, whose commander at the time was retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Trump's pick to be defense secretary. Ken Dilanian ",

Bush is displayed in this Feb. 15, 2002, file photo at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. (Photo: Damian Dovarganes, AP) 4544 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The very\u00a0first President's Intelligence Checklist \u00a0\u2014 the predecessor to what's now known as the President's Daily Briefing\u00a0\u2014 was delivered to President John F. Kennedy on a June Saturday in 1961. Typewritten on eight pages of 8.5-by-8-inch paper and stamped \"For the President Only \u2014 Top Secret,\" it contained 14 two-sentence briefs culled from diplomatic, military, intelligence and press sources, six shorter notes, and maps of Laos and the Congo. Today, President Obama receives the document on an iPad. The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions. The maps can be interactive, and the briefings can include video. The differences aren't just technological. After serving 10 presidents\u00a0\u2014 and now preparing to brief the 11th, President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 the\u00a0President's Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision-making styles of each commander in chief. And the ways in which it's produced, read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach\u00a0national security issues. \"It\u2019s the only standing meeting he has every day. Even if we don\u2019t have the meeting, he gets the document,\" said Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes. \"Everyday there's the possibility that he'll see something that will cause him to move the entire U.S. government in a new direction. There's nothing else like that.\" For Obama, the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who's often disdainful of\u00a0raw, unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective. He encourages dissenting opinions. He's interested in \"open source\" intelligence \u2014 including press accounts and, increasingly, social media \u2014 in addition to old-fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications. President-elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence. He's still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for, and catered to, Obama. He's reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president, part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman. But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence. For the first month, he\u00a0received\u00a0in-person intelligence briefings only once a week, although his transition team now says it's three times a week. But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant. \"I get it when I need it,\" Trump told Fox News Sunday. \"I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\" he said. \"I don't need that. But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know.' \" In skipping daily briefings, Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing\u00a0\u2014 albeit much later in his presidency. \"Over the years, you accumulate knowledge,\" Obama said\u00a0 in a YouTube interview \u00a0earlier this year. \"Now, I've got enough of a baseline of knowledge. I've seen problems come up before, I've seen patterns that have emerged. I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did. ... I'm skimming. I'm looking at, are there significant differences?\" The frequency, the duration, the format, the depth, the subject matter\u00a0\u2014 even the distribution list\u00a0\u2014 are all up to the president. In a book published earlier this year, former CIA officer David Priess argued\u00a0that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it\u00a0\u2014 and will continue to evolve to meet the president's personality, learning style and priorities. \"If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance, he or she will get that,\" said Priess, author of The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings .\u00a0\"There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons.\" The President's Daily Briefing is what its name implies, Priess said. \"It is brief. Everything is not going to make it in. It\u2019s daily. If it\u2019s not breaking, or not current, it doesn\u2019t get in,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\"But the most important word is\u00a0'president.'\u00a0Is this deserving of his attention?\" That's a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess. And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues\u00a0\u2014 and for the intelligence community to get to know the president-elect. Aides: Trump gets frequent classified briefings The (expletive) moment Current and former national security officials say frequent, in-person briefings with the president \u2014 and the president-elect \u2014 are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well-informed. \"There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants,\" former CIA director Michael Hayden said. In his book,\u00a0 Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror , he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the \"aw, s---\" moment. Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four-star general, former director of the National Security Agency and former director of the CIA. \u00a0(Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) It's attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president-elect's political advisers with a dose of reality. Hayden calls it \"phenomenon of the unpleasant fact.\" \"That's when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration. You're telling them something they don\u2019t want to hear and don\u2019t want to believe,\" he said. And it's important to do that in an in-person briefing, as opposed to the written product. \"You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker,\" Hayden said. \"And you need the ability to do that face to face, and to do it with your tone, and your words and your body language to communicate, as opposed to just throwing it over the transom.\" When Obama first took office, the intelligence community grumbled that Obama\u00a0\u2014 or at least his national security staff\u00a0\u2014 wanted the reports so brief that they called them \"PDB haiku.\" Hayden's early briefings of Obama (he was replaced three weeks into Obama's presidency) were \"far less tactical\" than the briefings President George W. Bush was receiving. But Michael Leiter, who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama, said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months. \"His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy, and more about how the\u00a0U.S. was perceived in the\u00a0world and interacted in the world,\" he said. \"But there certainly was\u00a0an evolution. To me, that was most crystallized, around the time of underwear bomber,\" he said, referring to the Christmas Day\u00a02009 plot to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner. \"That so changed the president's perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things.\" From then on, he said, any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it. Dissenting voices Still, it's a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team. Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the\u00a0uncorroborated bits of information \u2014 or to attribute more credibility to information only because it's classified. \"Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you're not looking at what's right in front of your eyes,\" Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election. \"It\u2019s worrisome to get into raw intelligence,\" he said.\u00a0\"Because you may have some intercept that you think is great, but it could be some official in some country, it could be just their view, or what they hope happens. Or,\u00a0sometimes they know that the (National Security Agency)\u00a0is listening, and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence. That's where the job of ODNI is very hard.\" Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Ben Rhodes \u00a0(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) ODNI is the\u00a0Office of the Director of National Intelligence, an office created by Congress in 2004 in a series of post-9/11 intelligence reforms.\u00a0While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community, the CIA\u00a0\u2014 by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis\u00a0\u2014 still has an outsized role in the process. Obama has said he's conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts. \"I've learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I\u00a0do about a topic,\" Obama said in the YouTube interview. \"And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time.\" But while Obama says he listens to all voices, not all of those voices feel that they're being heard. A 2014 report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government\u00a0and\u00a0found that \"broader community participation in the President's Daily Brief (PDB)\u00a0remains a challenge.\" Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower-level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally \u2014 a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter's presidency.\u00a0\"Let's get the analysts who are living through these issues every day,\" Rhodes said. \"He likes that, so he's tried to do that more.\" The daily book often contains dissenting views, which Leiter said were \"often the most\u00a0illuminating thing in a\u00a0PDB article.\" And under Obama,\u00a0non-urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president. And highly sensitive information gleaned from top-secret sources and methods is balanced with open-source intelligence \u2014 the kind of information that's available to anyone reading a newspaper. 'Rebalancing' the PDB Presidents, of course, also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities \u2014 and that gets reflected in their briefings. Richard Nixon's had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China. Ronald Reagan's was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union. And for the last two presidents, the Middle East has dominated the PDB \u2014 to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind\u00a0intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture. \"You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia,\" Rhodes said. \"To the point where we\u2019ve had to say, 'Hey, guys, we're rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. Make sure that's represented in the PDB.' You almost have to reach out for that stuff, because it doesn't always naturally come up.\" Obama's PDB also increasingly includes information on economic, environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security. And they're not necessarily\u00a0confined to foreign affairs. Last summer, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing. This Aug. 14, 2008, file photo shows a man crossing the CIA logo in the lobby of CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. \u00a0(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) World's most exclusive newspaper The President's Daily Briefing, also known as \"the book,\"\u00a0is among the most secret documents the government keeps. For a time, even its very existence was thought to be classified. It's just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community. But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief,\u00a0it has a sense of urgency and importance\u00a0\u2014 and even mystique\u00a0\u2014 that other top secret documents don't have. \"Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it,\" said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified 2,500\u00a0briefings to Presidents Kennedy and\u00a0Lyndon Johnson last year. \"The PDB is the most abundantly staffed, most deeply sourced daily information service in the world.\" It's been referred to as the world's most exclusive daily newspaper, written exclusively for the president of the United States. But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers. Kennedy never shared his with his vice president. Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing, instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger. The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people. In the Obama administration, the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen, including the secretary of State. In her book\u00a0Hard Choices, Clinton called the hand-delivered report\u00a0the \"first order of business\" after getting to the office each morning. Her schedules, released under the Freedom of Information Act, often allotted\u00a0the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB. The president could even share the briefing with members of his family. Trump and his family have denied reports that he's sought security clearances for his children and for son-in-law Jared Kushner, but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom. Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA's integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected.\u00a0\"These are the same people that said\u00a0Saddam Hussein\u00a0had weapons of mass destruction,\" the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week. That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers \u2014 and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them. \"President Obama\u2019s experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday.\u00a0\"President Obama is certainly not the first president to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I'm confident the president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.\" ",

More than 1 billion Yahoo accounts may have been exposed after a third-party hacker hit the internet company in a separate attack from the one that was revealed in September . \"Yahoo believes an unauthorized third party, in August 2013, stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts,\" the company said in a statement. \"The company has not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft. Yahoo believes this incident is likely distinct from the incident the company disclosed on September 22, 2016.\" That hack, which affected 500 million accounts, was among the biggest breaches of all time. At 1 billion this time, Yahoo may have earned a dubious new honor. The data stolen from the newly revealed breach includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some instances, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. \"The investigation indicates that the stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected,\" the Yahoo statement said. Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Reuters Authorities handed over data files from a third party that were purported to include Yahoo data, according to the company's chief information security officer, Bob Lord. \"As we previously disclosed in November, law enforcement provided us with data files that a third party claimed was Yahoo user data. We analyzed this data with the assistance of outside forensic experts and found that it appears to be Yahoo user data,\" Lord wrote. Through forensic analysis, Yahoo was then able to determine that a breach occurred in August 2013. It's \"very rare\" to learn about two mega-breaches in such a short window of time, Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security at the cybersecurity company SentinelOne and a former Yahoo employee, told NBC News. \"It's really few and far between,\" he said. \"Having multiple distinct breaches doesn't sound good.\" What if you have an account? Yahoo will notify potentially affected users and require them to change their passwords. Because security questions and answers were stolen, Yahoo has nullified any unencrypted questions and answers, Lord wrote. The latest disclosure comes after a tumultuous year for Yahoo. It was announced in July that Verizon had reached an agreement to buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion. The deal is still in process, and it remains unclear how the latest revelation could affect the sale. In a November SEC filing, Yahoo warned Verizon could still pull out of the deal. \"There is no assurance\" the merger will be \"consummated in a timely manner or at all,\" the filing said. It's also possible Verizon could renegotiate, buying Yahoo for a lesser price. \"Breaches or security concerns have never materially impacted an acquisition but this one could be different,\" Grossman said. Related: Yahoo Warns Verizon Could Pull Out of $4.8 Billion Deal In addition to possibly scuppering one of the year's biggest deals, Yahoo's September mega-breach has led to a plethora of federal, legal, state and local investigations, along with dozens of class-action lawsuits from consumers. There's no telling what could come after this latest disclosure. Alyssa Newcomb ",

On Tuesday, Russia declared the battle over, but on Wednesday fighting resumed. Related Article Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 13, 2016 Tuesday morning, Mr. Zarqa shared images of injured people fleeing violence in the besieged areas. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 13, 2016 Mr. Zarqa openly opposes the Syrian government. He has been a regular contributor of audio, video, and text messages to a WhatsApp group that activists, doctors and others use to share information and opinions with journalists covering the Syrian war. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 8, 2016 Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 8, 2016 His posts are a mix of news about attacks, political opinions, personal impressions and glimpses of daily life. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 3, 2016 Part of the washing \uf62d Finally we managed to get a car to fill our water container. Now no water for all of Aleppo. Internet connection isn\u2019t stable for most of besieged Aleppo. Some of the messages showed Mr. Zaqra\u2019s attempts to move on with life, despite the war. Last week, he  posted this audio file of gunfight near his apartment. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 5, 2016 Mr. Zarqa said via text message that he went to Saudi Arabia in 2011, after the Syrian conflict started, to avoid being drafted into the Syrian army. He said he returned voluntarily to Aleppo, in April 2015 to teach in the eastern half of the city then controlled by insurgents. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 8, 2016 Mr. Zarqa said that he got married nine months ago, and that his wife is pregnant. He often jokes about the government offensive. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 7, 2016 If the regime approaches my neighborhood, the first I\u2019ll do is making salad from my plants and eating it. \uf60a But more often than not, his messages are grim. Last Friday, Mr. Zarqa shared a number of audio clips of renewed clashes and of what he said were warplanes dropping bombs near his home. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 9, 2016 The morning after, he went to a rooftop and posted this video of the damage: Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 9, 2016 Several people in the messaging group expressed fear of being killed or arrested by the government if they left the besieged area. Most of the messages showed scenes of destruction, despair and violence. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 11, 2016 Over the past week, Mr. Zarqa has remained optimistic that somehow he would be able to stay in the city, even as forces loyal to the Syrian government continued to gain territory. Last week, he shared a photo of a sweater dress that his wife was knitting for the baby girl of a friend. Wissam Zarqa, Dec. 9, 2016 My wife is making a nice dress for little Limar now. So please stop talking about the end of revaluation in Aleppo in your pieces. We are still trying to give life a chance here. \uf60a On Tuesday, Russia declared the battle over, but on Wednesday shelling resumed, and a promised evacuation of the remaining fighters and their families had not begun.

Yasmin Seweid, 18, was in police custody Wednesday afternoon, police told CBS New York.\u00a0 Police told CBS News she was charged with filing a false report and obstructing governmental administration.\u00a0 Seweid claimed that she was verbally assaulted by a group of three men on the subway around 10 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 1.\u00a0 She told CBS New York she got on the No. 6 Train at 23rd Street and Park Avenue after leaving an event at Baruch College. \u201cI heard them talk, but I had my headphones in, I wasn\u2019t really listening, I had a long day. And they came closer and I distinctly heard them saying, \u2018Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d she said. Seweid said she was then verbally attacked by the three drunk, white men. \u201cThey were surrounding me from behind and they were like, \u2018Oh look, it\u2019s an f***ing terrorist,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t answer. They pulled my strap of the bag and it ripped, and that\u2019s when I turned around and I was really polite and I was like, \u2018can you please leave me alone?\u2019 and everyone was looking, no one said a thing, everyone just looked away.\u201d Seweid said no one stopped the men, not even when they tried to tear off her hijab. \u201cThey kept saying, \u2018you don\u2019t belong here, get out of this country, go back to your country,\u2019 and finally they came really close and they were like, \u2018take that rag off your head,\u2019\u201d she said. Seweid also criticized President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cThe president-elect just promotes this stuff and is very anti-Muslim, very Islamophobic, and he\u2019s just condoning it,\u201d she said.

Cloud Contact Reporter Pentagon audits found widespread problems in enlistment bonuses given to\u00a0soldiers in several National Guard units across the country, but soldiers facing repayment demands in those states won\u2019t be eligible for waivers under a new federal law that will apply only to the California National Guard. The bonus mistakes appeared less common than in the scandal that has rocked the California Guard, although the Army Audit Agency  looked only at a small sample of the bonuses and only at four states. Agency audits obtained by The Times found \u201clittle or no oversight\u201d of\u00a0bonuses and other financial incentives given to soldiers in Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania from 2006 to 2010, the only states reviewed. The audits said those Guard units paid \u201cincentives to ineligible soldiers\u201d and later \u2014 like the California Guard \u2014 sought to recover the money. The reports did not say how many soldiers were affected in the other states. In October, following stories in The Times, the Pentagon suspended an aggressive effort to recover improper bonuses from about 9,700 California Guard soldiers and veterans. Congress last week passed a law that is expected to produce waivers for most of them.

Alan Thicke, beloved TV dad and real-life father of singer Robin Thicke, died Tuesday at age 69. But the provision, part of the $619-billion defense authorization bill that President Obama is expected to sign,  applies only to the California Guard. Soldiers and veterans from other states facing repayment demands are not covered. Among those ordered to repay their bonuses are soldiers who did not complete their enlistments after they were injured in combat. Dennis Lang, a former Army reservist from \u00a0Columbia, Mo., said he received a letter from the Pentagon in March ordering him to repay $5,000 of a $20,000 enlistment bonus after he was discharged from the Army because of injuries he received in Iraq. A civil affairs sergeant assigned to a small outpost in east Baghdad in 2007 and 2008, he was injured in a mortar attack. He was later diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and memory loss due to his head injuries. He says he first learned that he owed the Army $5,000 when he got a call from a debt collection agency last year, informing him that he was  delinquent. The Pentagon had turned the matter over to a private collection agency because Lang had not responded when it mailed a letter demanding repayment to an address he hadn\u2019t lived at for  more than a decade, he said. The debt stemmed from his failure to attend training with his Missouri Guard unit after he returned from Iraq. The Pentagon then demanded partial repayment of his bonus. When he refused to pay, they began taking $300 out of his Social Security disability check every month. \u201cI think it\u2019s just disgusting but I haven\u2019t really been fighting it,\u201d he said Wednesday in an interview. While California\u2019s bonus fiasco has received the most attention, other states were also lax \u00a0in ensuring that soldiers were eligible for the bonuses they got, according to the audits obtained by The Times. None of the audits blamed fraud for the overpayments. In California, state and federal investigations focused on what prosecutors described as \u201cmassive fraud\u201d although only one person who issued improper bonuses was sent to jail. But the audits revealed other major problems. In the Indiana National Guard, an audit of 130 enlistment bonuses awarded from 2006 to 2011, totaling $1.7 million, found that 45% were \u201cimproperly paid to soldiers that didn\u2019t meet or maintain eligibility requirements\u201d or were paid too much. Since completion of the audit, \u00a0an additional 1,132 cases where soldiers received improper bonuses have been found, according to Maj. Benjamin Tooley, a spokesman for the Indiana Guard. A total of $1,693,975 has been recovered from 443 soldiers, with \u00a0an additional 469 cases still under review, he said. Tooley said soldiers are facing repayment demands for several reasons, including failing the Army\u2019s physical fitness test or drug and alcohol tests, or because they changed job assignments that invalidated the bonus. He said soldiers could appeal, and that \u201cno instances of criminal intent, to include fraud,\u201d have been found. In the Missouri National Guard, 30% of the enlistment bonuses and 70% of soldiers\u2019 student loan repayments \u2014 another incentive used to attract recruits \u2014 \u201cwere made to ineligible soldiers or weren\u2019t properly processed, \u201d according to the Army audit. The audit looked at only 61 payments, a tiny sample, however. It blamed the errors on relatively minor violations of rules, not on systemic problems. One soldier didn\u2019t have a \u201cbonus control number,\u201d a record-keeping requirement, before he signed his contract, for example. Two others received their bonuses in lump sums, instead of installments, as required under the rules. Nonetheless the audit recommended seeking repayment of the $45,237.22 paid to the soldiers. The Missouri Guard did not return calls seeking comment on the audit. In the Pennsylvania National Guard, improper bonus payments were rare. All but four of 60 payments reviewed were \u201cproperly paid,\u201d a 2011 audit found. Because problems appeared less acute in other states, the National Guard Bureau, the Pentagon agency that oversees state Guard organizations,\u00a0decided not to order a full audit of incentive payments around the country. It opted instead to tighten internal controls against fraud, officials said. \u201cWe saw very early that there was no evidence of systemic, widespread fraud of the level that was found in California,\u201d said Jack Harrison, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau. Lt. Gen. Timothy Kadavy, the director of the Army component in the National Guard Bureau told a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week on the California bonus scandal that reforms ordered since the audits, conducted between 2011 and 2013, had largely eliminated most improper bonuses. \u201cThere are no issues outside of what we know to be normal\u201d mistakes in paying bonuses, he said. But even states that were not audited are continuing to find large numbers of improper bonus payments. Texas is still trying to recover up to $4.6 million from 2,252 soldiers it believes violated their bonus contracts over the last decade, according to the Texas National Guard. \u201cBonus recoupment, directly related to contractual violations, is nothing more than the standard ebb and flow of operations with the National Guard,\u201d Lt. Col. Travis Walters, spokesman for the Texas Guard, said in a\u00a0statement. The Pentagon began offering the most generous incentives in its history in the mid-2000s to recruit and to retain soldiers to help fill ranks for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Guard organizations frequently overlooked strict eligibility requirements in handing out bonuses that ranged to more than $50,000 in some cases. The Army audits found that authority to issue\u00a0bonuses was held by state \u201cincentives managers,\u201d who worked with little supervision and were sometimes confused about eligibility requirements. That was the case in California, where Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, a relatively low-ranking noncommissioned officer, was the sole person in the California Guard responsible for approving bonuses. In 2011,\u00a0she pleaded guilty in federal court to filing false claims and was sentenced to 30 months in prison. \u00bb ",

The FBI and other agencies don't fully endorse that view, but few officials would dispute that the Russian operation was intended to harm Clinton's candidacy by leaking embarrassing emails about Democrats. The latest intelligence said to show Putin's involvement goes much further than the information the U.S. was relying on in October, when all 17 intelligence agencies signed onto a statement attributing the Democratic National Committee hack to Russia. The statement said officials believed that \"only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\" That was an intelligence judgment based on an understanding of the Russian system of government, which Putin controls with absolute authority. Now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation, the intelligence officials say. Their use of the term \"high confidence\" implies that the intelligence is nearly incontrovertible. \"It is most certainly consistent with the Putin that I have watched and used to work with when I was an ambassador and in the government,\" said Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. \"He has had a vendetta against Hillary Clinton, that has been known for a long time because of what she said about his elections back in the parliamentary elections of 2011. He wants to discredit American democracy and make us weaker in terms of leading the liberal democratic order. And most certainly he likes President-elect Trump's views on Russia,\" McFaul added. Clinton cast doubt on the integrity of Russia's elections. As part of contingency planning for potential retaliation against Russia, according to officials, U.S. intelligence agencies have stepped up their probing into his personal financial empire. Play ",

    "text": "Dec 14 2016, 1:49 pm ET Is a Rate Hike a Good Thing for the Average American? by Ben Popken advertisement The Fed just agreed to raise key interest rates by 0.25 percent. So what does that mean for the average American? We take the example of one suburban mom and demonstrate how the rate increase \u2014 just the second since 2006 \u2014 could impact her wallet. Meet Jane. As the single mom pulls her Subaru Outback into the parking lot at Target, she takes a moment to wonder how the federal interest rate hike will affect her. She kills time by running a few numbers on her phone's calculator: She's got $5,000 in credit card debt, $10,000 in savings, a $30,000 home equity line of credit, and a down payment nest egg. Then there's her two boys. After the divorce, the house just seems like too much space and too many memories. It would be nice to start over, but still stay in Indianapolis, her hometown. She's got her eye on a $200,000 three-bedroom, two-bathroom Craftsman with plenty of yard space. The credit card has the least impact, her minimum payment will only go up $1, according to data from Bankrate. Phew. And finally she'll start to see some interest on her savings account \u2014 albeit only $25 more a year. That's not much, but it's enough for a couple of pepperoni pizzas, plus tip. That's something at least. However, she'll also see a bump-up on the minimum payment on her home equity line, $6.25 a month, or $75 a year. That'll eat up that additional savings interest three times over. Grr. As for that new dream house? Well, she learns that mortgage rates aren't tied directly to the Fed rate. But they've already increased more than half a percentage point based on the economic outlook, including government stimulus and inflation. So that new $200,000 mortgage will cost an additional $58 per month, or $696 a year. Nothing to sneeze at but, all in all, not too much damage. She exits her car and begins walking towards the store entrance. The question is, what happens if the Fed keeps raising rates? She saw a story that said there could even be three rate hikes in 2017 . Who knows where mortgage rates will go, but three sets of Fed increases would mean $100 in savings interest, $300 more in payments on her HELOC, and $48 more on that credit card debt, per year. Net, she would end up being $248 worse off within 12 months. But that's too far ahead to worry about, she thinks as she rummages in her purse. Let's just get through dinner tonight. Now, where are those darn coupons? Ben Popken ",

Joshua Samuel Aaron, 32, was arrested at Kennedy Airport on Wednesday. He pleaded not guilty to a 22-count indictment charging him with conspiracy, computer hacking, securities fraud and wire fraud, among other charges. U.S. companies fight back with vigilante hacking His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Aaron waived extradition and asylum in Russia and voluntarily returned to the United States \u201cto responsibly address the charges.\u201d\u00a0 The prosecution was announced last year by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who said two men had been arrested in Israel after they conspired with Aaron to carry out \u201cthe single largest theft of customer data from a U.S. financial institution ever.\u201d Bharara said thieves took data on more than 83 million customers of JPMorgan Chase & Co. in 2014. The prosecutor said Aaron was charged with working to hack into the networks of dozens of American companies. In a release Wednesday, Bharara said the men engaged in \u201cwhat we have called \u2018hacking as a business model.\u2019\u201d JPMorgan Chase is the nation\u2019s biggest bank by assets. A Manhattan federal court indictment said identifying information on millions of customers from companies other than JPMorgan Chase was stolen from 2012 to last summer, too. Aaron\u2019s co-defendants -- Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein -- were arrested by Israeli authorities in July 2015 and were extradited from Israel in June. They have pleaded not guilty. The indictment said some of the massive computer hacks and cyberattacks occurred as the men sought to steal the customer base of competing internet gambling businesses or to secretly review executives\u2019 emails in a quest to cripple rivals. If convicted of the charges, the defendants could face decades in prison. Aaron pleaded not guilty to the charges during a brief appearance Wednesday before a magistrate judge. With consent from his defense lawyer, he was scheduled to be held overnight pending another court appearance on Thursday before a district judge.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

A woman described Tuesday how a sexual encounter with a Northern Illinois University police officer in 2011 turned nonconsensual, as the former officer's trial on sex assault charges began in DeKalb County. The woman, now 24, was the opening witness in the trial of Andrew Rifkin at the county courthouse... (Clifford Ward) The woman, who Tuesday described the incident as extremely painful during testimony that became emotional, came into the courtroom midway through Rifkin's testimony and was shaking visibly as she sat in the gallery. Before Rifkin could be cross-examined by DeKalb prosecutors, the judge ordered jurors out. He then told the attorneys that he had seen the woman trembling and apparently shaking her head in disagreement with parts of Rifkin's testimony. Brady said he was worried about the woman's health and also concerned jurors could be prejudiced by seeing her reaction. The woman left the courtroom to talk with prosecutors and did not return for Rifkin's cross-examination. Afterward, Rifkin attorney Bruce Brandwein asked the judge to bar the woman from attending closing arguments because it could imperil a fair trial. Brady said he wouldn't ban her, but also said he would not allow any overt shows of emotion in the jury's presence. Earlier Wednesday, two women who were friends and fellow students of the woman described how the woman and Rifkin had met while he was serving as the officer assigned to their residence hall. Aesha Duncan, who in 2011 was a sophomore, said the woman described her first sexual encounter with Rifkin as \"kind of rough and she enjoyed it.\" ",

Susan Walsh/AP hide caption toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is expected to discuss the central bank's decision on a benchmark interest rate Wednesday. She's seen here speaking on Capitol Hill last month. Susan Walsh/AP America's central bank is nudging its benchmark interest rate higher, announcing a move from the current 0.25-0.50 percent to a range of 0.50 and 0.75 percent. The decision emerged from a session of the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday. Analysts had widely expected the hike of a quarter of a percentage point. With a low unemployment rate and signs of growth among workers' wages, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said, the central bank expects to raise rates three more times in 2017. The official Fed announcement predicts \"only gradual increases\" in the rate. The vote to nudge benchmark interest rates higher was unanimous, the central bank says . The federal funds rate has fallen sharply since reaching its recent high in June of 2006, when the rate stood at 5.25 percent. YouTube The interest rate decision was announced at 2 p.m. ET; Yellen held a news conference 30 minutes later. We've updated this post with details from that event. \"The stock market was expecting the Fed to raise rates, so this increase in rates was already priced into market prices,\" former Fed economist Ann Owen, a professor at Hamilton College, tells NPR's Jeremy Hobson on Here and Now . \"The only time there's a reaction in the stock market is when there's some element of surprise.\" Article continues after sponsorship Discussing banking officials' economic projections Wednesday, Yellen said the GDP is expected to grow by a rate of 2.1 percent in 2017 (from a current mark of 1.9 percent) and by 2 percent in 2018. Yellen also noted that over the past year, a net gain of 2.25 million new jobs have been added to the U.S. economy. Announcing its decision, the Fed noted that inflation has increased \"but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.\" The rate hike is the first of the year \u2014 despite signals from the Fed when it raised rates at the end of 2015 that more boosts were likely in 2016. While economists were encouraged to see U.S. workers' wages finally rising this year, international developments (China's slowdown, Brexit) complicated the picture. The interest-rate decision follows a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. For analysis of the economic picture officials are seeing \u2014 and how it might change \u2014 here's David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, who spoke about the Fed's expected move to NPR's Steve Inskeep for today's Morning Edition: Federal Reserve Raises Key Interest Rate In First Move Since 2015 ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic \u201cRussia is going to be the central litmus test for United States policy,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cOur allies and our adversaries are watching this very closely, and obviously the names of the cabinet positions are being scrutinized that much more closely.\u201d Senate Republicans \u2014 including Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 who have long been critical of Mr. Putin and of President Obama\u2019s attempt to \u201creset\u201d relations with Moscow, have praised Mr. Tillerson. \u201cMr. Tillerson is a very impressive individual and has an extraordinary working knowledge of the world,\u201d Mr. Corker said. That view was echoed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. The laudatory response from many Republicans over a choice that a year ago, on paper at least, might have appalled them demonstrates a strong desire to begin a new administration aligned with Mr. Trump. It is the same dynamic that has prevented a larger outcry from congressional Republicans over revelations that Russia interfered with the presidential election. They fear they could appear aligned with Democrats in raising questions about the election\u2019s legitimacy. While congressional leaders called for investigations into possible tampering, they stopped short of ordering expansive efforts like a select committee. At the same time, a majority of Republicans are overjoyed with Mr. Trump\u2019s other cabinet picks \u2014 staunch conservatives in the world of education, health care and law enforcement \u2014 and are likely to accede to the president-elect\u2019s choice for the nation\u2019s chief diplomat. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The other selections are \u201cdraft picks for conservatives who have been looking to reform those departments for years,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, who was passed over for secretary of state. \u201cThose cabinet picks have certainly helped build up some of that political capital.\u201d Photo President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with Mr. Tillerson, right, in June 2012. At left is Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft. Credit Sputnik/Reuters Still, the contrast from recent years is striking. In 2012, when Mr. Romney was running for president, he called Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe,\u201d a position echoing decades of Republican thinking. He was derided by Mr. Obama, his opponent. Mr. Corker and others have joined the most robust voices on Capitol Hill in calling for sanctions on Russia, a position that would seem to put them at odds with Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson. He and 20 Senate Republicans tried in 2014 to push through severe new sanction triggers against the nation, and he praised Mr. Obama when he imposed them on Russia for destabilizing Ukraine. Both of the last two major defense bills authorized funding for security assistance to Ukraine, including lethal assistance the Obama administration has refused to provide. This year\u2019s bill authorizes $3.4 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative, a fourfold increase from last year, focused on increasing the size, capability and readiness of American forces in Europe against growing threats to their security and territorial integrity. Those bills, while championed by Mr. McCain, are in keeping with a long history of bipartisan agreements over checking Russia, like the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a trade measure that required emigration criteria to get certain trade benefits. In 2012, led by Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, Congress overwhelmingly passed more sanctions tied to Russian human rights abuses. Last week, Congress passed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act as part of the broad defense bill, continuing a longstanding bipartisan focus on human rights and anticorruption efforts. \u201cI have found Congress on both sides of the aisle to be entirely robust on the issue of Russia,\u201d said William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital, noting that the Senate passed the 2012 measure 92 to 4.

    "text": "Fed Hikes Key Interest Rate for 2nd Time in a Decade By Rebecca Jarvis Dec 14, 2016, 2:22 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Fed Rate Hiked for 2nd Time in a Decade 0 Shares Email The Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate by 0.25 percent point today, the first such increase in a year. The target interest rate is now 0.50 to 0.75 percent, increasing from a range of 0.25 to 0.50 percent. The decision was widely expected by investors, who have been speculating for months about when the Fed would increase rates. Before last year\u2019s increase (from a range of 0 to 0.25 percent), the Fed had kept interest rates low in an effort to boost the economy amid the Great Recession and its aftermath. Before December 2015, it last raised the rate in June 2006. In a statement the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the body in charge of adjusting the key borrowing number \u2014 said it \"expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.\" The Fed also indicated that it could hike rates as many as three times next year. \u201cIt is a good sign that the Fed is increasing rates,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told ABC News. \u201cThey are increasing rates because the job market is strong, unemployment [is] low, wage growth is picking up and inflation is getting back to their target.\u201d \u201cIt is an indication of a healthy economy that the Fed feels comfortable increasing rates back to something more typical,\u201d he said. Your Bottom Line Average Americans are likely to be affected most directly by higher loan rates, according to Zandi. \u201cRates will rise on credit cards, home equity loans, auto loans and adjustable rate mortgages ,\u201d he said. While the cumulative effect of several hikes in the future could significantly affect the average consumer, today\u2019s increase is likely to have a minimal effect, according to BankRate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride. \u201cRising rates have a minimal effect on car loan affordability, with a quarter-point move making a difference of $3 per month on a $25,000 car loan,\u201d he said. For those who remain concerned, he advises that they should \u201cshop around for the best financing, negotiate the price of the car, negotiate your trade, but don\u2019t sweat rising interest rates.\u201d On the bright side, higher interest rates in theory provide a boost to savings accounts. But just as the incremental hike is not likely to affect borrowers very much, savers shouldn\u2019t expect a big payday either. \u201cSavers should have low expectations, as many banks will try to hold the line on savings rates,\u201d McBride said. He advised that savers \u201cseek out the top-yielding accounts offered by online banks, community banks and credit unions , as this is where the best returns will be found and a better likelihood of seeing higher rates passed along.\u201d For those with investments or retirement accounts wrapped up in the market, there is, likewise, little to worry about, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. Markets have been rallying since the election, and investors fully expected today\u2019s hike, so the possibility of a jolt in stock prices is minimal. \u201cThe rise in rates was well anticipated by markets, and the key will be future communications from the Fed around next steps,\u201d Haworth said. \u201cMarket watchers in general appear to be expecting a couple more rate hikes in 2017.\u201d He continued, \u201cA more hawkish tone from the Fed could limit further stock price gains, while a more dovish tone would generally be constructive for equities.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "50 Photos In this June 18, 2015 file photo, Charleston, S.C., shooting suspect Dylann Storm Roof is escorted from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C. AP CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A survivor of the Charleston church slayings called 911 shortly after Dylann Roof opened fire and killed nine of her friends during a Bible study. Polly Sheppard\u2019s call, played for jurors on Wednesday, starts with a prayer and a plea for help: \u201cPlease answer. Oh, God.\u201d When the recording ended, Sheppard staggered from the witness stand and several family members rushed to help her down the aisle and out of the courtroom as she stared blankly ahead.\u00a0 Roof trial reveals disturbing new evidence Prosecutors rested their case in Roof\u2019s federal death penalty trial and his lawyers called no witnesses after the judge ruled that mental health experts, job applications and his academic record were irrelevant to whether Roof is guilty of attacking the church. Roof\u2019s attorneys have largely conceded there is no disputing the facts of the case and have instead tried to focus on whether he should face the death penalty or life in prison. Roof, who is white, is charged with hate crimes in what prosecutors say was a racially motivated attack on nine black worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Jurors will hear closing arguments Thursday. In her testimony, Sheppard remembered something about each of the nine victims -- how the Rev. Daniel Simmons was nicknamed \u201cDapper Dan\u201d because of his fine hats and shiny shoes or how the bathrooms at the church didn\u2019t have the same shine since Ethel Lance, who kept them tidy, was killed. There was a catch in her voice each time assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson asked her to identify a dead friend and fellow worshipper. Sheppard recalled what happened June 17, 2015, when Roof came into Wednesday night Bible study, took the lesson from the church\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, and sat down beside him quietly for 45 minutes. Her voice filled with sadness, unlike the prosecution\u2019s opening witness -- the only other adult survivor Felicia Sanders -- whose voice had both sorrow and anger as she ended her testimony saying Roof deserved to be in the pit of hell.\u00a0 17 Photos South Carolina church shooting victims Sheppard said she dove under a table when the first shots were fired. She heard boom after boom and watched shells fall to the floor as Roof\u2019s black boots inched closer and closer. She prayed out loud. Roof stopped, pointed his .45-calibur Glock at her and told her to shut up, she said. Roof asked if he had shot her yet. Sheppard said no. Roof said he wanted to leave her alive to tell the world why he attacked a historic African-American church. \u201cI have to. I have to,\u201d Sheppard recalled Roof telling her. \u201cYou\u2019re raping our women and taking over the nation.\u201d Roof then moved away. Sheppard grabbed Lance\u2019s cellphone that tumbled near her and called 911. In between telling the operator what she knew, Sheppard prayed. \u201cHelp us, Lord. Please help us, Lord. Please Jesus, help us.\u201d Sheppard\u2019s 911 call was the final evidence jurors heard before closing arguments Thursday morning. If they find Roof guilty, those same jurors will return Jan. 3 to decide if he is put to death or gets life in prison. Roof\u2019s defense lawyers wanted to tell jurors about a hodgepodge of records that they said would define Roof\u2019s mental state before the shootings. But U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel said since Roof was not judged insane at the time of the crime, his mental state had nothing to do with whether he was guilty.\u00a0 Was Dylann Roof going to target other churches? Gergel said the defense was welcome to introduce that evidence in the penalty phase. But it\u2019s not clear if jurors will hear it because Roof has indicated he will be his own lawyer during that phase of the trial. Earlier Wednesday, a medical examiner showed jurors X-rays of each person killed, with black spots the size of a penny showing the bullets that remained inside of them. Dr. Erin Presnell said many of the victims had several wounds to their arms. Several times, Presnell stepped down from the stand to show how someone with their arms pulled up tight against them could end up having a bullet enter and exit their bodies several times. Other victims had shots closely clustered together as if the victims were still. Earlier, witnesses testified that some of the wounded tried to play dead. Surveillance video from the day of the attack \u00a0in June 2015 showed people walking into the church. Then, in walks Roof, carrying a 45 Glock pistol and seven magazines.\u00a0 Malcolm Graham, whose 54-year-old sister Cynthia Hurd was murdered,\u00a0 spoke to CBS News . \u201cThis was an attack on a race of people and an attack on the Christian church and an attack on humanity,\u201d Graham said. In Roof\u2019s confession video, an FBI agent asked Roof, \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d \u201cI had to do it because somebody had to,\u201d Roof said. \u201cBlacks are raping and killing white people on the streets every day... What I did is still minuscule to what they\u2019re doing to white people every day.\u201d Along with the overt racism, Roof\u2019s confession and notes show the then-21-year-old as naive and immature. He wrote a note apologizing to\u00a0 his mother \u00a0and saying \u201cas childish as it sounds, I wish I was in your arms.\u201d\u00a0 But Roof meticulously prepared for the shootings. He carried eight magazines that could each hold 13 rounds, but loaded only 11 each so that he could shoot 88 times. That\u2019s a revered number among white supremacists, standing for \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.\u00a0 At one point, an agent asked if Roof had thought about killing more blacks.\u00a0 \u201cOh, no. I was worn out,\u201d Roof said.\u00a0 Prosecutors play confession tape in Charleston church shooting trial Roof said he left bullets in a magazine so that he could kill himself after the slayings, but changed his mind when he didn\u2019t immediately see any police.\u00a0 He apparently hadn\u2019t heard the news during his 17 hours on the run. About 45 minutes into his interview with the FBI, an agent decided to tell him that nine people were dead.\u00a0 \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even that many people in there,\u201d Roof said incredulously. \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d\u00a0 The video is blurry, making it hard to see Roof\u2019s facial expressions. After being told the details, an agent asked how he felt.\u00a0 \u201cWell, it makes me feel bad,\u201d said Roof, who earlier in the confession estimated he might have killed five.\u00a0 Agents asked Roof why he chose Emanuel AME. He said it\u2019s because he saw it described online as the oldest black church in the South.\u00a0 Survivor Felicia Sanders testified that said Roof sat through the Bible study beside pastor Clementa Pinckney, and opened fire as the rest of the group of 12 closed their eyes for a final prayer.\u00a0 \u201cI was sitting there thinking about whether I should do it or not. That\u2019s why I sat there for 15 minutes. I could have walked out,\u201d Roof said.\u00a0 Church surveillance videos indicate Roof was actually inside for about 45 minutes. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Craig Timberg and Hayley Tsukayama December 14 at 5:48 PM Follow @craigtimberg Follow @htsuka Yahoo said Wednesday that more than 1 billion user accounts \u2014 meaning most of the Internet giant\u2019s customers worldwide \u2014 were hacked in 2013, leading to the release of user names, telephone numbers, dates of birth and other personal information. News of the hack, coming after the announcement in September of a separate hack affecting 500 million accounts, means that Yahoo has been the victim of the two largest data breaches ever reported. Both have been announced since Yahoo agreed to sell its core businesses to telecommunications giant Verizon in July for $4.8 billion. The incident raised new questions among analysts regarding the viability of that deal and whether the valuation will need to be changed, especially if the hacks trigger litigation against the company. \u201cThis is another major blow,\u201d said Jeff Kagan, a Georgia-based telecommunications industry analyst. \u201cIt throws into question what\u2019s really going on at Yahoo. And if you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on at Yahoo, does Verizon have the guts to buy a potential bomb? This company could explode with major problems and major losses.\u201d In the 2013 incident, Yahoo said that credit card and bank account numbers, which are stored separately, were not affected, but the breach did include some unencrypted \u201csecurity questions\u201d that the company uses to authenticate users. The two recent hacks have come after Yahoo agreed to sell its core business, including Yahoo Mail, to Verizon in July. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) [ Have you ever had a Yahoo account? You might want to change some passwords. ] Yahoo also reported a separate incident Wednesday in which hackers used what the company called \u201cforged cookies\u201d to gain access to some accounts, though it did not give the number. That incident, the company said, appeared to have links to the one announced in September involving \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d attackers. Law enforcement officials said that breach, which happened in 2014, was probably the work of Russian hackers , though no final conclusion has been reached. To minimize the damage, Yahoo is alerting affected customers and requiring them to change their passwords. But the scale of the hack and the time that has passed since it happened suggests that few of the company\u2019s customers were unaffected. Given the size of the two hacks, many Yahoo users are likely to have had their information stolen more than once. Yahoo has said it has more than 1 billion users worldwide, though the company\u2019s fortunes have been sagging for years as other tech companies have snatched away pieces of its search, email and other Web-based businesses. \u201cYahoo encourages users to review all of their online accounts for suspicious activity and to change their passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account,\u201d the company said in a statement . \u201cThe company further recommends that users avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails and that they be cautious of unsolicited communications that ask for personal information.\u201d Regarding the deal with Verizon, Yahoo said in a statement, \u201cWe are confident in Yahoo\u2019s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.\u201d Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.\u201d Security experts have long complained that Yahoo lagged the industry in adopting measures to protect its customers. The breach that Yahoo announced Wednesday was discovered after law enforcement officials shared with the company a data set that \u201ca third party\u201d claimed was from Yahoo user accounts. The company, in conjunction with outside experts, verified that it was data stolen in August 2013, the company said in a statement. The news caused a late dip in Yahoo\u2019s stock price, sending it down as much as 2.7 percent in after-hours trading. \u201cThe fact that we now have two breaches implies that Yahoo security measures were inadequate. So it is more likely there will be future breaches uncovered,\u201d said Laura Martin, senior analyst at Needham & Company. \u201cIt sounds to me like they never knew about any of these breaches, which means they never fixed the problem. That implies that the assets are actually less valuable than we thought.\u201d Staff writer Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. business ",

By Craig Whitlock and Greg Miller December 14 at 7:00 AM Follow @craigmwhitlock Follow @gregpmiller A secret U.S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, \u201cinappropriately shared\u201d classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents show. Although Flynn lacked authorization to share the classified material, he was not disciplined or reprimanded after the investigation concluded that he did not act \u201cknowingly\u201d and that \u201cthere was no actual or potential damage to national security as a result,\u201d according to Army records obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act. [ Read the military investigation into Michael Flynn in 2010 ] Flynn has previously acknowledged that he was investigated while serving as the U.S. military intelligence chief in Afghanistan for sharing secrets with British and Australian allies there. But he has dismissed the case as insignificant and has given few details. The Army documents provide the first official account of the case, but they are limited in scope because the investigation itself remains classified. Former U.S. officials familiar with the matter said that Flynn was accused of telling allies about the activities of other agencies in Afghanistan, including the CIA. President-elect Donald Trump named retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn his national security adviser on Nov. 18, but Flynn has a history of making incendiary and Islamophobic statements that have drawn criticism from his military peers. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The Army files call into question Flynn\u2019s prior assertion that he had permission to share the sensitive information. During the presidential race, Flynn campaigned vigorously for Republican nominee Donald Trump and drew attention for his scalding attacks against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified material. Clinton was investigated by the FBI for allowing classified information to be transmitted on her private email server when she ran the State Department. No charges were filed against the former secretary of state, but the issue dogged her for more than a year. [Trump\u2019s national security adviser says he\u2019s ready to fight another world war ] At the Republican National Convention in July, Flynn called on Clinton to drop out of the race for putting \u201cour nation\u2019s security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server.\u201d He egged on the partisan crowd in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d adding: \u201cIf I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth, a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today.\u201d Flynn did not respond to requests for comment. The office of the Army\u2019s Judge Advocate General released a four-page summary of the investigation into Flynn in response to The Post\u2019s Freedom of Information Act request for records of any misconduct allegations involving the retired three-star general. The U.S. military opened the investigation into Flynn in 2010 after receiving a complaint from an unnamed Navy intelligence specialist, according to the documents. The intelligence officer charged that Flynn violated rules by \u201cinappropriately\u201d sharing secrets with \u201cvarious foreign military officers and/or officials in Afghanistan.\u201d 1 of 24 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

But former U.S. officials familiar with the case said it centered on slides and other materials containing classified information about CIA operations in Afghanistan. \u201cIt was a general intelligence briefing that included stuff that shouldn\u2019t have been on those slides,\u201d said a former senior U.S. intelligence official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. The disclosures revealed \u201cstuff the intelligence community was doing that had a much higher level of classification.\u201d The agency has had an extensive presence in the Afghanistan since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Beyond gathering intelligence on al-Qaeda and the Taliban, the CIA has also assembled its own paramilitary networks in the country, paying warlords for cooperation and funding armed groups known as Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams. A second former U.S. official said Flynn failed to secure permission to reveal those secrets. \u201cThis was a question of whether or not information was put through proper channels before it was shared,\u201d the second official said. The episode marked the second time in a year that Flynn had drawn official complaints for his handling of classified material. Former U.S. officials said that Flynn had disclosed sensitive information to Pakistan in late 2009 or early 2010 about secret U.S. intelligence capabilities being used to monitor the Haqqani network, an insurgent group accused of repeated attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Flynn exposed the capabilities during meetings with Pakistani officials in Islamabad. The former U.S. intelligence official said a CIA officer who accompanied Flynn reported the disclosures to CIA headquarters, which then relayed the complaint to the Defense Department. Flynn was verbally reprimanded by the Pentagon\u2019s top intelligence official at the time, James R. Clapper Jr. Clapper subsequently became director of national intelligence and endorsed Flynn to become his successor as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In 2014, however, Clapper forced Flynn out of that job over concerns with his temperament and management. The newly disclosed Army documents state that the 2010 investigation was ordered by the head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Although the records do not say exactly when the case was opened, the commander at the time would have been Marine Gen. James Mattis. Mattis took charge at Central Command\u2019s headquarters in Tampa, Fla., in August 2010. One month later, Flynn was ordered back to Washington from Afghanistan. He was assigned to a temporary job at the Pentagon as the special assistant to the Army\u2019s chief of intelligence while the investigation unfolded, records show. Mattis was nominated this month by Trump to serve as secretary of defense. In that role, Mattis will work closely with Flynn; the retired generals are expected to be the most influential voices on national security in the Trump administration. The Army documents that summarize the investigation into Flynn do not specify which countries he was accused of improperly sharing secrets with. In an interview with The Post in August, Flynn said he was scrutinized for giving classified information to British and Australian officials serving in Afghanistan alongside U.S. forces. In that interview , Flynn defended his actions and said he did nothing wrong. \u201cThat was substantiated because I actually did it. But I did it with the right permissions when you dig into that investigation. I\u2019m proud of that one. Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies, please.\u201d The Army documents, however, state explicitly that the Central Command investigation determined that Flynn did not have permission to share the particular secrets he divulged. The Defense Department\u2019s inspector general, which conducted an independent review of the investigation, came to the same conclusion, the documents show. It is routine for the U.S. military to share intelligence in Afghanistan with NATO allies such as Britain, as well as other members of the broader international coalition fighting the Taliban and al-Qaeda, including Australia. But there are established mechanisms and guidelines that must be followed. Flynn was highly regarded within the Army for the key role he played in shaping U.S. counterterrorism strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan. Pentagon officials had intended to promote Flynn in 2010 to the rank of lieutenant general and to make him assistant director of national intelligence, a job that would place him in charge of improving ties with foreign intelligence agencies. The Central Command investigation delayed his career advancement for a full year. He received his promotion and new assignment in September 2011. After being forced to retire from the military in 2014, Flynn became a vocal opponent of the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding Iran and al-Qaeda. At the same time, he gained a reputation for floating conspiracy theories on Twitter. Some Democratic lawmakers have criticized his selection as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The position, however, is not subject to Senate confirmation. Read more: ",

Financial markets have sent a forceful message that the era of super-low interest rates is coming to a close. The\u00a0 Federal \u00a0Reserve \u00a0has raised a key interest rate in response to a strengthening U.S. economy and expectations of higher inflation, and it foresees three more rate hikes in 2017. The Fed's move will mean modestly higher rates on some loans. Wednesday's action signaled the Fed's belief that the economy has improved over the past year after a rough start to 2016 and can withstand slightly higher borrowing rates. Its expectation of three rate increases in 2017 is up from two in its forecast three months ago. The central bank said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that it's raising its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. The Fed had most recently raised the rate last December from a record low near zero set during the 2008 financial crisis. Responding to a question at a news conference, Chair Janet Yellen said she didn't think the economy needed stimulus from President-elect Donald Trump 's proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending \u2014 the kind of fiscal support that Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke , had called for in the past. Yellen said such policies would be unlikely to maximize employment, since the unemployment rate \u2014 4.6 percent, a nine-year low \u2014 is now slightly below the Fed's own long-term target. \"My predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when the unemployment rate was substantially higher than it is now,\" she said. The Fed chair stressed that she wasn't providing advice or guidance to the incoming Trump administration. And she downplayed any expectations that Trump's economic program could lead to faster rate hikes resulting from higher inflation. The Fed's move Wednesday, only the second rate hike in the past decade, came on a unanimous 10-0 vote. The central bank also released updated forecasts that showed modest changes to its outlook for growth, unemployment and inflation, mainly to take account of a stronger economy and job market. James Marple, senior economist at TDBank, said the Fed's forecast of three rate increases next year, up from two, was the \"only real surprise\" Wednesday. \"The move up is a signal that the Fed has become more confident in the economic outlook and that inflation will increasingly track closer to the 2 percent target,\" Marple said. It's hardly guaranteed that the Fed's forecast for three hikes in 2017 will prove accurate. Last year at this time, for example, the Fed predicted it would raise rates four times in 2016. It turns out it's raising them just once. Wednesday's rate increase should have little effect on mortgages or auto and student loans. The Fed doesn't directly affect those rates, at least not in the short run. But rates on some other loans \u2014 notably credit cards, home equity loans and adjustable-rate mortgages \u2014 will likely rise soon, though only modestly. Those rates are based on benchmarks like banks' prime rate, which moves in tandem with the Fed's key rate. After the Fed's announcement, several major banks announced that they were raising their prime rate from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent. \"This single quarter-point move in interest rates will go largely unnoticed at the household level, but coupled with last year's hike, the cumulative effect could mount quickly if the Fed quickens the pace of rate hikes in 2017,\" said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst. Mortgage rates have been surging since Trump's presidential victory last month on expectations that his economic program would accelerate economic growth and inflation. Stock investors appeared disappointed by the Fed's forecast of three rate increases in 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down about 118 points \u2014 0.6 percent \u2014 a sign that stock investors are pricing in additional Fed rate hikes. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.57 percent from 2.47 percent Yellen attributed the Fed's higher number of estimated rate hikes for 2017 to a lower unemployment rate and possibly some changes in\u00a0federal\u00a0budget policy beginning next year. But she emphasized that any changes to the Fed's projections were \"modest.\" She said Fed officials, during their meeting, discussed Trump's economic plans as well as the surge in stock prices, bond yields and the dollar that's followed his election. She said they reached no conclusions. \"We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment, and we have time to wait and to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decision-making,\" she said. In response to a question, Yellen said she plans to serve out her four-year term, which ends in February 2018. Most analysts don't expect her to remain after that. The Fed's latest projections have the unemployment rate dipping to 4.5 percent by the end of 2017 and remaining at that level in 2018. It foresees economic growth reaching 1.9 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2017, slightly more optimistic than it projected in September. The central bank kept its long-term estimate for economic growth at 1.8 percent, far below the 4 percent pace that Trump has said he can achieve with his economic program. Overall, the Fed's policy statement showed only modest changes in wording from the previous meeting. It did note that inflation expectations \"have moved up considerably but still are low.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "Dems scramble to prevent their own from defecting to Trump Published               December 14, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Senate Democrats have been scrambling to prevent two of their members from taking a post in the Trump administration, trying to prevent any defection that could bolster Republicans\u2019 control of the chamber.\u00a0 They recently launched a \u201cfull court press\u201d to retain Sens. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota, after each met with Republican President-elect Donald Trump, one senior Senate Democrat told Fox News. Manchin now appears less likely to bolt -- after saying he wants to remain in the Senate and being passed over for Energy secretary -- which puts the focus squarely on Heitkamp.\u00a0 The first-term lawmaker, who faces reelection in 2018 in a conservative state, still appears in the running for the Agriculture secretary post. A Trump transition team source told Fox News the president-elect \u201creally wants her\u201d for the job. Either departure would poses short- and long-term challenges for Senate Democrats.\u00a0 If Heitkamp left, her seat could remain empty for months, meaning Democrats would have one less vote to stop any of Trump\u2019s first-100-day initiatives, which could including getting a Supreme Court nominee confirmed in the Senate or passing a tax overhaul. The North Dakota legislature last year changed its laws so that a Senate seat remains vacant, without a place-holder senator, until it is filled in a special-election vote held within 95 days of a resignation. In the longer-term, Senate Republicans would have a solid chance of winning Heitkamp\u2019s seat in a special election and adding to their 52-48 member majority.\u00a0 In West Virginia, the governor would under the law appoint a temporary replacement and hold a special election within 48 to 120 days to fill the seat for the remainder of the term which ends in 2017. West Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor likely would appoint a Democrat to fill the seat in the interim.\u00a0 As a Democrat in an increasingly conservative state, Manchin initially had appeared at risk of leaving. And his words and actions in recent weeks -- criticizing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and risking a government shutdown over coal miner benefits -- suggested a willingness to depart the Senate, or at least prepare for a tough reelection fight in 2018 in a state that went for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton 68-26 percent.\u00a0 Manchin last month chastised Reid for calling Trump after his White House win a \u201csexual predator,\u201d saying Reid\u2019s remarks were an \u201cabsolute embarrassment\u201d and \u201cneedlessly \u2026 tearing this country apart.\u201d Reid recently told CNN that Manchin\u2019s comments were \u201chis way to get out the door.\u201d Democrats, in an apparent effort to solidify their caucus, recently made Manchin part of their leadership team. And Trump\u2019s official decision Wednesday to pick former Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry for Energy secretary, for which Machin was being considered, settled the speculation for now.\u00a0 \u201cI was humbled to be considered for the Secretary of Energy position,\u201d Manchin said in a statement. \u201cI have dedicated my life in public service to doing what is best for the people of West Virginia. Right now, I believe that I can best serve my state of West Virginia in the United States Senate.\u201d Heitkamp and Manchin are among 10 Democrats in the chamber seeking reelection in 2018. Trump has only three remaining Cabinet posts to fill -- Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs. FoxNews.com's Joseph Weber and Fox News' Bret Baier and John Roberts contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "The evacuation buses finally arrived \u2013 but Aleppo has descended back into violence Nabih Bulos The evacuation of Syrian rebels bunkered in their last remaining holdouts in the beleaguered city of Aleppo has been delayed, rebels and activists said Wednesday, as an 11th-hour cease-fire forged by Russia and Turkey broke down after only a few hours of calm. The agreement, which called for a cease-fire to take effect late Tuesday night and have rebels leave their bastion early Wednesday, came as the government took near total control of the rebels\u2019 enclave in eastern Aleppo. It represents the most significant achievement by the government of President Bashar Assad in the almost six-year civil war ravaging the country. The deal would have allowed opposition fighters to exit from Aleppo\u2019s southwestern flank toward\u00a0countryside areas still in rebel hands, taking\u00a0their personal weapons \u2014 a major point of contention that may have\u00a0contributed to the scuttling of the arrangement. On Tuesday, before the cease-fire went into effect, the United Nations said at least 82 civilians had been killed in fighting. Late that day, the green buses used to shuttle opposition fighters out were reported to have arrived in Aleppo, according to pro-government groups. But they had remained empty, and residents from within rebel areas said there had been no evacuations. Caught between rebels and government forces, the Syrian city of Aleppo has largely been cut off from the rest of the world in recent months. But this week, as Syrian forces advanced on rebel-held areas, residents took to social media to send pleas and heartbreaking farewells to a global audience. ... ... (Nina Agrawal) Instead, the sounds of intense artillery and mortar shelling as well as sporadic gunfire could be heard once more after hours of calm overnight. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can hear it, but there are artillery and mortar strikes on the besieged areas,\u201d Mahmoud Raslan, a pro-opposition activist, said via the WhatsApp messaging service on Wednesday. He said he was in Salah Al Din, a neighborhood at the very edge of the Syrian government\u2019s advance. Minutes later, he sent an audio recording of loud explosions in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group with a network of activists in Syria, said at least 10 people had been killed in the barrage hitting eastern Aleppo. \u201cEverything has collapsed,\u201d said Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the Observatory. Late Wednesday, Ahmad Qurah Ali, the spokesman for the hard-line Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham, said in a statement on social media that a cease-fire would start at midnight Damascus time. The first group of the wounded and civilians would leave early Thursday morning, he said. Activists and residents contacted in eastern Aleppo confirmed a significant reduction of hostilities in the wee hours of Thursday morning, but that there were still occasional sounds of gunfire. One resident, Dr. Ghaith Suleiman, said in a Whatsapp message that he received word the evacuation would go through in the morning under supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross . Damascus and Moscow have yet to confirm any arrangement. Meanwhile, the Hezbollah-affiliated Central Combat Media outlet issued a report late Wednesday saying that all rumors regarding a cease-fire and \u201cthe exit of the gunmen\u201d were completely untrue. Syrian government forces conduct a final sweep to take the last rebel holdouts in eastern Aleppo. (Associated Press) It was unclear why Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0deal had broken down. The Russian Reconciliation Center, the Russian army\u2019s monitoring body in Syria, blamed the rebels for the delay and the subsequent breakdown of the fragile truce, saying in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cwhen the [buses] arrived at the agreed boarding site the militants opened fire on the column.\u201d Russia has been Assad\u2019s closest ally, and its air power, deployed on behalf of the Syrian forces, effectively turned the tide of the battle in Aleppo. The Reconciliation Center added that \u201cthe militants had taken advantage of the cease-fire to regroup \u2026 and resume combat operations,\u201d but \u201cthe terrorists were rolled back.\u201d The statement employed the Russian and Syrian governments\u2019 standard description for the rebels arrayed against the rule of Assad. \u201cThe Syrian army went ahead with the operation to retake eastern Aleppo\u2019s quarters from the militants,\u201d the Russian statement continued. Zakaria Malahifji, spokesman for Fastaqim Kama Umert, an opposition faction fighting inside Aleppo, blamed the Syrian government and its Iranian allies for the breakdown, saying they had been displeased that the deal had been imposed on Damascus by Russia without consultation.

(W.J. Hennigan) The Observatory for Human Rights said the issue was that the rebels had been all but defeated and that \u201cthe regime had gotten nothing in return for this agreement.\u201d Mayadeen, a Lebanese news channel that is close to the Assad government, said government and Iranian officials had insisted on evacuating the wounded in Fuah and Kefraya, two villages in the opposition-controlled province of Idlib that have been besieged for almost two years, and that vital humanitarian aid be allowed in. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest sharply criticized both Russia and Syria, as well as Iran, another Assad ally. He said the United States was \u201cworking diligently through a variety of diplomatic channels\u201d to resolve the situation. \u201cWe continue to be deeply concerned about the situation in Aleppo,\u201d he said at the daily White House press briefing. \u201cWe are seeing the same reports that you are, that innocent people are being slaughtered in the streets at the hands of the Assad regime, aided and abetted by the Russians and the Iranians. And it raises deep concerns. And it's a deeply tragic situation. And these atrocities have to come to an end.\u201d Among those holding out in eastern Aleppo was Monther Etaky, 28, and his family \u2014 his wife, Walaa, 25, and their newborn son, Yazid. \u201cWe will be slaughtered by them,\u201d he said, speaking of the Syrian government forces. \u201cWe prefer to fight them and die like a tree, standing, not be annihilated.\u201d Etaky, speaking via WhatsApp late Tuesday, said he and his family had been forced in recent months to relocate to an abandoned apartment and live without running water and only sporadic electricity. But they had refused to leave, even after he watched his friends die in airstrikes and bombings and\u00a0even when he had to spend his days hunting for food. There was too much history for him to leave, he said, too many ghosts. \u201cThe criminal regime killed my friends,\u201d he said. Then the cease-fire was announced, and Etaky realized he might finally have to depart. \u201cNo way to stay in the city at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to evacuate.\u201d But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rick Perry was picked to run the Department of Energy , cutting down dead trees is the new Gold Rush happening in California , Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade is coming back , and the National Film Registry\u2019s Class of 2016 has arrived .

    "text": "How Trump Team Is Considering Changing White House Press Briefings By Jordyn Phelps Dec 14, 2016, 8:08 PM ET 0 Shares Star Susan Walsh/AP Photo President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the Brady press briefing room at the White House in Washington, Nov. 14, 2016. 0 Shares Email The Trump administration is considering doing away with the assigned seating in the White House briefing room, the president-elect's pick for chief of staff, Reince Priebus , told radio host Hugh Hewitt. Seats in the front row of the briefing room are coveted and occupied by the networks, cable outlets and wire services. Priebus also incorrectly asserted that the arrangement was put in place by the Obama White House. The seating assignments are actually controlled by the White House Correspondents' Association. \u201cThere was a notable factual inaccuracy in Mr Priebus's remarks: News organizations have had assigned seats in the briefing room since those seats were installed in 1981. That was not an Obama-era innovation as Mr. Priebus suggested,\u201d WHCA President Jeff Mason said in a statement. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest also affirmed that the current seating arrangement pre-dates the Obama administration and suggested the incoming administration might want to read up on the issue. \u201cI certainly would recommend to the incoming administration that they collect and familiarize themselves with some basic facts as they consider what sort of policies to implement moving forward,\u201d Earnest said. This morning, Priebus incorrectly told Hewitt that reporters could take any seat they wanted under the Bush administration . \u201cThis was the first front row assigned seat issue, as I understand it, started in the Obama administration. In the Bush administration, you just took a seat, and I guess there were a couple of people that have had reserved spots. But for the most part, the more formalized reserved seating piece came in over the last eight years,\u201d Priebus said. Priebus also said the possibility of changing the current seating assignment in the briefings \"is being talked about\u201d by the transition team. Mason said the WHCA looks forward to working with the incoming administration to address questions or concerns about the arrangement. \u201cThe WHCA assumed responsibility for assigning the seats in the briefing room over the last two decades at the request of both Republican and Democratic administrations, who were mindful of the potential appearance of playing favorites if they assigned the seats themselves,\u201d Mason said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Log Out Two years after Prop 47, addicts walk free with nowhere to go In 2014, California voters freed about 13,500 low-level offenders from crowded prisons and jails. But many ex-inmates have traded incarceration for a cycle of homelessness, drug abuse and petty crime. Jenny Espino , USA TODAY Network-California Published Dec. 14, 2016 Email Comment Ruben Lopez Jr. wakes up on a rundown leather couch inside a dingy auto shop in the Los Angeles suburbs. He feels the familiar temptation of an old enemy. His body aches, his mind buzzes, his nose runs and his stomach twists. He craves meth just to steady himself and knows it is only two blocks away, at a small homeless camp under a bridge. Lopez, 57, a longtime addict, was serving a life sentence in prison for a third-strike methamphetamine conviction until last year, when he was released by Proposition 47, which downgraded drug possession and most small thefts to misdemeanors. Prop 47 felt like emancipation at first, Lopez said, but freedom has not gone as planned. Ruben Lopez Jr., a meth addict who was released under Prop 47 after 20 years in prison, spends his nights in his cousin's auto shop in Downey, Calif. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) After two decades behind bars, his only job prospects are low-paying temp work. He would be homeless if not for the generosity of his cousin, who lets him sleep in the auto shop. He is still smoking meth. He knows that if police were to bust him again, he\u2019d be locked up for hours, not years. So, did Prop 47 help him? \"No,\" Lopez says, with a weary shake of his head. \"It helped me get out of jail. But ultimately it just let me loose to bury myself.\" Two years after it was approved by California voters, Prop 47 has scaled back mass incarceration of drug addicts, but successful reform is woefully incomplete. Proponents celebrate how the law freed at least 13,500 inmates like Lopez from harsh sentences in crowded prisons and jails, but Prop 47 has done little to help these people restart their lives. Instead, the unprecedented release of inmates has exposed the limits of California\u2019s neglected social service programs: Thousands of addicts and mentally ill people have traded a life behind bars for a churning cycle of homelessness, substance abuse and petty crime. Prop 47 earmarked millions saved in prison costs for inmate rehabilitation, but not a penny has been spent. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s shortage of treatment programs is more glaring than ever. Expanding rehab would be expensive, but it is still a cheaper, more effective and more humane strategy for addressing addiction than locking drug abusers in prison. \"The problem is, if you don\u2019t actually do anything to change conditions of their lives, they\u2019re going to be back on the streets anyway,\" said Elliot Currie, a University of California, Irvine criminologist. \"What\u2019s to prevent them from going back to the same old ways when they get out? The answer is nothing.\" x Share Propsition 47 freed roughly 13,500 inmates and erased an estimated 198,000 low-level drug and theft felony convictions. But many released by Prop 47 struggle to find the resources to turn their lives around. Kristen Hwang/The Desert Sun This alarming lack of support services is one key finding in a landmark investigation by USA TODAY Network-California journalists\u00a0who spent seven months analyzing the impacts of Prop 47, a sweeping criminal justice reform law that has been debated and demonized\u00a0but rarely understood. To uncover the ramifications of the law, reporters from four publications \u2013 The Desert Sun, The Ventura County Star, The Record Searchlight and The Salinas Californian \u2013 filed 65 records requests, scrutinized thousands of pages of public documents and performed over 50 interviews with policymakers, academics, police, district attorneys, public defenders, drug addicts and former felons. Among our findings: How we did it: The Prop 47 project California police have dramatically deprioritized drug busts in the wake of Prop 47, arresting and citing about 22,000 fewer people in 2015, a 9.5 percent decrease in the first year since the possession of meth, heroin and cocaine was downgraded to a misdemeanor. Nearly 200,000 felony convictions have been retroactively erased by Prop 47 as of September, according to a first-ever analysis. Government agencies were not required to track how many convictions were reduced, so journalists gathered public records from 21 counties to calculate a statewide estimate. Many former felons will be slow to take advantage of their restored rights because they are unaware their convictions have been downgraded. For those who are aware, however, Prop 47 offers an unparalleled chance for better jobs. Tens of thousands of people\u00a0no longer have to report felony convictions on job applications, making them drastically more employable than they\u2019ve been in years or decades. Michael Romano, a Stanford law expert who helped write Prop 47, stressed in a recent interview the law has been \"amazingly successful\" in its primary goal, which was always to get low-level drug offenders out of California\u2019s crowded, damaging prison system. But tackling drug addiction and mental illness, which plague so many who were released under the law, is a task that will require investing hundreds of millions of dollars in community treatment programs across the state. \"It is incumbent on local governments to engage this problem,\" Romano said. \"Prop 47 was not a cure-all. It\u2019s not a panacea. It is one piece in an extraordinarily complicated puzzle \u2013 perhaps the most complicated puzzle in our communities.\" Many inmates released under Prop 47 have ended up homeless on the streets of Los Angeles' infamous Skid Row, shown here in November. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) A criminal history Wayne Woods, a homeless drug addict who was released by Prop 47, walks through a small park near Union Station in Los Angeles. (Photo: Kristen Hwang/The Desert Sun) For the first time in 20 years, Wayne Woods was a free man. Homeless, but free. Woods, 53, who has been a cocaine and heroin drug addict for most of his life, was released by Prop 47 in March after serving 20 years in prison. With nowhere to go, Woods found his way to Los Angeles\u2019s infamous Skid Row, where tents and cardboard shelters crowd the streets between soup kitchens and free clinics. Needles litter the ground. Drugs are used in plain sight. Woods could not resist for long. He was rearrested in June after a police officer spotted him smoking crack on a street corner. At the police station, Woods realized how much things had changed. The same drugs that had locked him up for years felt like they were barely illegal at all. He was back on the streets in two weeks. \"In my case, it\u2019s worse,\" Woods said, wandering through downtown LA, carrying everything he owns in a backpack. \"In prison, everything was provided. I had a place to stay. I had meals. I had a job, if I wanted to work. And if I wanted to do some drugs, I could have gotten that in there too.\" Like Woods, many of the drug addicts released under Prop 47 found it easy to slip back into their old habits after leaving the system because they didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t access rehab programs. Their plight is the latest chapter in California\u2019s century-long neglect of the addicted and the mentally ill. In the same way addicts have spent generations in the prison system, the U.S. once locked up the mentally ill in asylums. After World War II, Congress promised to replace the shameful asylum system with a network of community mental health centers. The asylums closed, but most of the centers never opened. Patients were freed, but not cured. California made the same mistake. In 1968, the state shifted responsibility for the mentally ill to the counties\u00a0but never followed through with funding. Then-Governor Ronald Reagan closed nine state mental hospitals but twice vetoed the transfer of funds for county treatment programs. In 15 years, the mental hospital population fell 77 percent. A prisoner sleeps during a mid-morning visit to the Monterey County Jail in Salinas. (Photo: Jay Dunn/The Salinas Californian) A lack of treatment options and an era of tough-on-crime policies imprisoned more and more of California\u2019s inseparable mentally ill, addicted and homeless populations. Between 1980 and 2000, California\u2019s prison population quintupled and the proportion of inmates charged\u00a0with drug crimes tripled. The state raced to build 21 new prisons over those years, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep pace: The corrections system reached 175 percent capacity by 2000. \"Jails turned into the mental health system,\" said Currie, the UC Irvine criminologist, \"so in many ways we have to finally grapple with the problem we should\u2019ve fixed in the first place.\" California came to a crossroads in 2011 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state's prison crowding had gotten so bad it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. California responded with AB 109, which moved thousands of non-serious and non-violent offenders into county jails. Three years later, when jails were overcrowded too, Prop 47 released low-level felons, including thousands of mentally ill and drug addicted inmates. But treatment programs with empty beds are still hard to find. \"We talk about the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \u2013 that doesn't really exist. People come out and it's like they time traveled,\" said Eunisses Hernandez, an advocate at the Drug Policy Alliance, a reform group. \"If we want criminal justice reform and social justice reform to work, it's not just about fixing the machine that's incarcerating people, but it's about fixing the system that comes out and supports them when they come out.\" For Lopez, the meth addict in the LA suburbs, that support system felt out of reach. Lopez, who suffers from bi-polar disorder, grew up in Southern California and fell into addiction quickly. He drank beer and smoked pot in high school, but while his friends just dabbled, he used daily. Lopez dropped out of school and joined the Marine Corps, where he started using harder drugs. He was kicked out of the Marines in 1981 after getting arrested in a home invasion robbery case. That case was Lopez\u2019s first strike. California\u2019s once-rigid \"Three Strikes\" sentencing system mandated a life sentence to any defendant with two violent or serious prior convictions \u2013 even if their third crime was just drug possession or shoplifting. The system was responsible for locking up many of the defendants that Prop 47 eventually let out. Ruben Lopez Jr., a meth addict who was released from prison by Prop 47, hugs Blair Stewart, a homeless woman, in Downey, Calif. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) Lopez\u2019 third strike came in 1994, when a Glenn County police officer caught him with 1.8 grams of meth and a sawed-off shotgun during a traffic stop. Lopez got life in prison for felony drug possession and the gun charge was dropped. He was released in April 2015 after Prop 47 reduced his conviction to a misdemeanor. Lopez found himself in an unfamiliar world. Prison had done nothing to cure his addiction. Drugs were a familiar crutch, and they were rampant. \"It was like putting a kid loose in the candy store and telling them there's no consequences,\" Lopez said. \"Eat whatever you want. Party up. That was me.\" Lopez joined and then quit rehab programs twice after his release, saying the strict rules felt too much like prison. With no place left to go, Lopez called his cousin he barely knew who owned an auto shop. The cousin offered him a couch to sleep on, but set one rule \u2013 no drugs in the shop. Lopez broke that rule quickly, so the cousin kicked him out. For the next five weeks, Lopez slept on the streets, hidden away in a burrow dug under a roadside bush, sheltered with cardboard and blankets. In November, Lopez\u2019s cousin let him move back into his shop even though he's still using meth. \"This is where I ended up at,\" Lopez said. \"This is where my decision making got me, where my addiction got me \u2013 to nothing, zero.\" Police patrol near a homeless camp in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey in November. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) The waiting game Rochelle Solombrino had a beer in her hand and two twelve-packs in the car when she saw the flashing lights in her rearview mirror. She knew she was headed to prison, but she was going to finish her beers first. So she fled, chugging Coors Light, as the police cars multiplied behind her and the helicopters swarmed overhead. Ten beers and 25 minutes later, she pulled over. Rochelle Solombrino, 50, who had four felonies reduced under Prop 47, points to her star in Fred Brown Recovery Services that shows the date she stopped using drugs and alcohol. She is now 7 and a half years sober. (Photo: Kristen Hwang/The Desert Sun) The 2007 car chase, for which Solombrino served 18 months in prison, was just the latest on a lengthy rap sheet \u2013 47 misdemeanors over four decades. Every crime had been fueled by drugs or alcohol. Solombrino was in the grasp of her addiction and she thought she could never escape. And yet she did. After her release, Solombrino joined a treatment program and has never used drugs or alcohol since. Now seven years sober, she knows she couldn\u2019t have recovered without a program. She also knows how badly the addicts released by Prop 47 need them too. \"Those were active addicts. They may still be active addicts,\" said Solombrino, 50, who retroactively reduced four felonies under Prop 47. She is now operations coordinator at Fred Brown Recovery Services in San Pedro, where she got clean. \"Those are people that needed help, that need help, and I can reassure you that they didn\u2019t all get help. So, definitely, we need more programs.\" In-patient treatment programs can help even the most serious addicts, according to scientific studies, but hundreds of thousands of California\u2019s addicts have never gone through rehabilitation. Some write off the idea of rehab, too addicted to give their habits up or concerned they\u2019ll never make it through. But those who seek help can be asked to wait weeks or months before beginning treatment, and by then, the urge to recover has vanished into the next pill, drink or syringe. \"If you were to call any treatment facility in Los Angeles County looking for a residential bed, they'll tell you there's a waiting list,\" said David Ramage, an administrator at Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in Pasadena, which has a 90-day wait list. \"People die waiting to get treatment. That is the bottom line.\" California State Prison, Los Angeles County is photographed during a tour in December. (Photo: Anthony Plascencia/The Ventura County Star) The shortage of treatment beds is a result of inadequate funding. California has underinvested in drug rehab for decades, policy experts said, and Prop 47 is the latest example. Prop 47 advocates, who promised voters the law would save hundreds of millions of dollars in prison costs, have accused Gov. Jerry Brown of diverting the money into the state\u2019s general fund. A recent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office report projected $130 million in savings for the past fiscal year, but the state deposited $67.4 million into its Prop 47 fund. Brown\u2019s office directed comment on Prop 47 savings to the state Department of Finance. H.D. Palmer, the department\u2019s deputy director of external affairs, said the state did not \"lowball\" the savings. \"One of the worst things we could do is lead to false expectations,\" he said, \"and therefore (have) people budget on a higher level of savings at the local level that in the end is not achievable.\" Using the Prop 47 fund, the state will put $34 million into mental health treatment, substance abuse and diversion programs this fiscal year, but the process of divvying up that money only began last month. For now, treatment facilities are cash-strapped and scrambling. And even when the money finally arrives, expansion will not be easy. California State Prison, Los Angeles County. Lancaster, Calif. (Photo: Anthony Plascencia/The Ventura County Star) Neighborhoods sometimes push back when treatment centers try to expand, said Doug Burg, an administrator for the Amity Foundation, which runs reentry programs for current and former inmates throughout the western U.S. If that hurdle is cleared, each new facility still needs a county contract and time to train employees. \"For us to really move away from mass incarceration, I think these propositions are absolutely essential,\" Burg said. \"But it\u2019s hard because often we think of these big policy changes and we don\u2019t think of the operational needs for the people, the service providers, that have to run these programs.\" Compared to the criminal justice system, however, treatment is a far more cost-effective strategy for handling California\u2019s 565,000 drug-dependent adults. In-patient treatment programs, which typically last from six months to a year, cost about $20,000 per person \u2013 less than a third of the annual cost to keep an addict in jail or prison. And by treating addiction, the root cause of many drug and property crimes, rehab reduces the chance people commit crimes in the future. \"When you do drug treatment, it is just hands down cheaper and more effective,\" said drug policy expert Dina Perrone, a criminology professor at California State University, Long Beach. While community treatment centers struggle to keep up with demand, drug court programs are emptying. Drug courts traditionally fill their seats through a \"felony hammer\" strategy that uses incarceration to pressure addicts into recovery. When an addict is arrested, a drug court judge gives them a choice: spend years behind bars or join a year-long rehab program. After Prop 47, however, the formula doesn\u2019t work. Incarceration is unlikely, and misdemeanor probation is shorter and less restrictive than drug court, so many offenders choose it instead. The results are clear. At the longest running drug court program in Los Angeles, run out of a narrow building on the edge of Skid Row, enrollment has plummeted from 80 people to only four. Ramage, who leads the drug court program, said Prop 47 \"tore it apart.\" Many inmates released under Prop 47 have ended up homeless on the streets of Los Angeles' infamous Skid Row, shown here in November. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) Policy experts quickly counter that drug court programs still criminalize addiction. Those who can\u2019t complete the programs end up behind bars regardless. \"That's not the way the system should work,\" said Hernandez, from the Drug Policy Alliance. \"That felony hammer has only been good to incarcerate generations of our communities.\" Solombrino, from\u00a0the 2007 car chase,\u00a0was locked up dozens of times, but that never helped her addiction. Treatment was the only effective solution for a life of crime and drug abuse. Solombrino\u2019s parents divorced when she was a toddler. At her private Christian grade school, she struggled to cope with being gay. And at age six, she was molested by her step-father. By the time she was sixteen years old \u2013 when she was regularly using pot, cocaine and PCP \u2013 she couldn\u2019t hide her emotions any longer, so she turned to her dad for help. \"I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t feel good. I don\u2019t feel good inside. I feel a lot of anxiety,\u2019\" she remembers now, 34 years later. \"He said, \u2018Take a drink, you\u2019ll get over it.\u2019 In our culture, you don\u2019t stress on those kinds of things. Take a drink, everything\u2019s going to be fine. So that\u2019s what I did.\" No amount of family conversation, jail time, warnings from judges or interventions from her friends convinced Solombrino to change. But in treatment, she faced her darkest memories head on. She wrote an 18-page autobiography of her life, she attached three emotions to every significant event and she drafted letters to each of the people who appeared in her story. She apologized to the people in her life who she had wronged. She learned from others who were facing addiction and she was congratulated by her new support network each day she stayed clean. \"Every treatment step that we did, this weight just kept being lifted and lifted and lifted and I was free. All of a sudden I was light again,\" Solombrino said. \"I felt like a child, like oh my god I can literally start over again. I don\u2019t have to be defined by my past but what I\u2019m trying to do today to change.\" \"That, for me, was the freedom of purging all my demons and all my secrets and all my life,\" she said.

Sean Rayford/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Sean Rayford/Getty Images A woman at a memorial service wears tributes to two of the nine people murdered at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Sharonda Singleton and Ethel Lance. Sean Rayford/Getty Images Six days of testimony from law enforcement officers, criminal investigators and people who witnessed the murder of nine people in a church basement last year in Charleston, S.C ended Wednesday. Dylann Roof, 22, faces 33 federal hate crimes charges for allegedly opening fire during a bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015. In the past week, forensics experts, FBI agents and various law enforcement officers presented evidence including a recorded confession by Roof and excerpts of a journal he kept that both appeared to show he had been planning the massacre for months, and had deliberately targeted the church in order to kill black people. The federal government's final witness was Polly Sheppard, 72, a retired nurse who survived the shooting even as she watched her friends die around her. In Taped Confession, Charleston Church Shooter Says 'We All Know I Am Guilty' Sheppard testified that Roof told her he would let her live so she could tell the story of what he had done, reported Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio. The Charleston Post and Courier reported that Sheppard, \"clutching a tissue, kept her voice even\" as she described what happened. The paper summarized her testimony: \"Sheppard said she dove under a table when Roof opened fire. Shell casings clattered to the floor and gunshot blasts echoed over the fellowship hall as Roof fired some 77 rounds at the 12 people gathered. From beneath a table covered in a white linen, Sheppard watched the gunman's boots stepping closer and closer to her, she said. \"When he reached her, he pointed his .45-caliber Glock at her. \" 'I was praying out loud,' she said. 'He told me to shut up.' \"He asked if he had already shot her. \" 'No,' she replied. \" 'I'm not going to,' she said Roof told her. 'I'm going to leave you here to tell the story.' \"Sheppard then sat silently in the witness stand as prosecutors played her frantic call to 911 dispatchers that night, telling an operator: 'Please, Emanuel church,' she blurted between shallow breaths. 'People shot. Please send right away!' ... \"Police arrived shortly after asking, 'Where is he?' But by then, Roof had slipped out of the church's side door and headed out of town.\" Article continues after sponsorship Police arrested Roof in North Carolina the next day, as we reported . Olgin reported that, in the 911 call, jurors could hear a wounded person moaning in pain in the background. Accused Charleston Church Shooter Rehires His Defense Team After Sheppard finished her testimony, the prosecution rested its case, and the defense announced it would not call any witnesses. Dylann Roof told the court he did not want to testify, reported the Post and Courier. Closing arguments are set to begin Thursday morning, after which the jury will consider whether Roof is guilty of the 33 charges against him, including nine murder charges. If the jury finds him guilty, the penalty phase of the trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 3. Roof has asked to represent himself in that portion of the trial, as the jury decides whether to sentence him to death. Roof is also facing separate murder charges brought by the state of South Carolina, which is also seeking the death penalty. That trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 17. ",

AF Reader, Phoenix, AZ 2:37 PM ET Hi Monica! My fiancee and I are planning our honeymoon in Cancun. We wanted somewhere warm, not too far away and safe. Do you have any pitfalls we should avoid while planning and traveling there? Any suggestions for activities? Monica Drake Travel Editor, The New York Times 2:36 PM ET First of all, congratulations on your upcoming wedding! Monica Drake Travel Editor, The New York Times 2:36 PM ET I would urge you to try to go off the beaten path a bit. We published a great 36 Hours on Cancun a few years back in which we suggested a day trip to Isla Mujeres: There\u2019s more to Mexico\u2019s top travel destination than alcohol-fueled partying. Take a look. The New York Times Travel Editor, The New York Times 2:37 PM ET The other option is to go farther afield and check out Tulum, which has grown more touristy but has still retained the charm that made it popular.

Monica Drake Travel Editor, The New York Times 2:41 PM ET I think I should first say to consult your primary care doctor on these medical questions. Monica Drake Travel Editor, The New York Times 2:41 PM ET But for a guide to where you\u2019re at risk of contracting malaria: the CDC has a useful guide that I consult, and Peru is on that list.
