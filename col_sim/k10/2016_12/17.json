USA TODAY Sports Minnesota Golden Gophers head coach Tracy Claeys. (Photo: Jeff Hanisch, USA TODAY Sports) The University of Minnesota football team is threatening to boycott one of the nation\u2019s best known and most lucrative second-tier bowl games over the suspension of 10 players accused of participating in a sexual assault. Prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to file criminal charges, and the players thought the matter was behind them. But a separate school investigation concluded Wednesday that the athletes violated a policy adopted last year that defines sexual assault as anything without a \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d expression of consent. Now, less than two weeks before the Golden Gophers\u2019 scheduled Dec. 27 face-off with Washington State, the walkout threatens to upend the Holiday Bowl. On Thursday, the entire team gathered to tell reporters they will not practice or play unless the suspensions are revoked. Several players also are facing possible expulsion. Have never been more proud of our kids. I respect their rights & support their effort to make a better world! \u303d\ufe0f\uf3c8 \u2014 GoldenGopherHFC (@GoldenGopherHFC) December 16, 2016 \u201cAll these kids\u2019 reputations are destroyed,\u201d senior quarterback Mitch Leidner said. \u201cTheir names are destroyed. It\u2019s extremely difficult to get back, and it\u2019s very unfair for them, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re sticking together through this thing.\u201d In a joint statement issued Friday, University President Eric Kaler and athletic director Mark Coyle called the suspensions \u201ca values-based decision,\u201d not a legal judgment. \u201cBut we can tell you that certain behavior is simply unacceptable and antithetical to our institutional values. We support Gopher Athletics\u2019 decision because this is much bigger than football,\u201d the statement said. The administration said they had offered to meet with players Friday, but the offer had not been accepted. Sexual misconduct already has been a sensitive subject for the university and for its athletics department. Former athletic director Norwood Teague resigned in August 2015 amid allegations of sexual harassment. His replacement, Coyle, was brought in with orders not to tolerate such behavior and played a key role in the decision to suspend the players. University officials have declined to say why the players were suspended or provide any details of the internal investigation, citing student privacy rules. But an attorney for several of the suspended players and the father of one of them confirmed the action was taken in connection with an alleged sexual assault in an apartment near campus in the early hours of Sept. 2, after the Gophers won their season-opener. According to police reports, the woman who made the complaint attended a few parties before ending up in the off-campus apartment of players Carlton Djam and Tamarion Johnson. The reports said she accompanied Djam and a male whose name was redacted to Djam\u2019s room, where she had sex with both of them at the same time. Video 2: #Gophers football team makes its demand in boycott of all activities leading to Holiday Bowl. https://t.co/oyg8MhmKCa \u2014 Andy Greder (@andygreder) December 16, 2016 After the unnamed male left, she said Tamarion Johnson entered the room and that she had sex with him, too. She said she remembered seeing several people watching. \u201cShe described it as a line of people, like they were waiting for their turn \u2026 She recalls yelling for them to stop sending people in the room because she couldn\u2019t handle it,\u201d one of the reports said. The woman said she recalled at least three other men forcing themselves on her, including players Dior Johnson and Ray Buford Jr. She told police the sexual contact between her and Djam and the unnamed man may have been consensual, but that it was not consensual with the others. She was not sure if she had had sex with player KiAnte Hardin, though he told police they did and that she agreed to it. The men all told police their sexual contacts with her were consensual. The school\u2019s policy says consent may be initially given, but can be withdrawn at any time and that \u201csexual activity must stop\u201d at that point or even if there is confusion over consent. Djam recorded video of part of his encounter with the woman and turned it over to police. According to one investigator\u2019s description of it: \u201cShe appears lucid, alert, somewhat playful, and fully conscious; she does not appear to be objecting to anything at this time. \u2026 (She) sounds as though she is somewhat intoxicated, but is not slurring her words and is certainly conscious and aware of what is going on. She does not appear to be upset by the sexual activity and does not indicate that she wants it to stop \u2026 and the sexual contact appears entirely consensual.\u201d The woman acknowledged to police that she drank five to six shots of vodka that night and that there were gaps in her memory, the reports said. Statement from Mark Neville, Executive Director, National Funding Holiday Bowl: https://t.co/JtwtNJLlFI \u2014 Holiday Bowl (@HolidayBowlGame) December 16, 2016 The roles of most of the other suspended players were not clear in 22 pages of redacted police reports released Tuesday. The Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office said it had insufficient evidence to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that either force was used or that the victim was physically helpless as defined by law.\u201d That statement cited the high standard of proof needed to secure a conviction in criminal cases. But the university uses a lower bar in student discipline cases \u2014 the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d That standard, used by courts in most civil cases, requires proof only that it\u2019s \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the student code of conduct was violated. A redacted copy of the university\u2019s 82-page investigation report obtained by Minneapolis television station KSTP goes into greater detail than the police report, with the woman saying she believed 10 to 20 men had sex with her, though she was not certain because of her limited memory. University investigators wrote that they generally found her account more credible than those of the accused students. The investigators concluded that several students had failed to provide full and truthful information. The school\u2019s Office for Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action investigates allegations of sexual misconduct against students, according to university websites. The office then prepares a report and shares its findings with the Office for Student Conduct and Academic Integrity, which determines the sanctions and informs the accuser and accused. Either side can request a formal hearing before a special committee, and either party can appeal that panel\u2019s decision. It\u2019s not clear if that has happened. Neither attorney Lee Hutton, who represents several of the players, nor the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Office returned calls seeking comment from The Associated Press. BOWL WATCHABILITY\u00a0RANKINGS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 40. Quick Lane Bowl: Boston College (6-6) vs. Maryland (6-6), Detroit, Dec. 26, 2:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2 \u2014 While both teams are happy to get this postseason opportunity, the fact is neither of them played a brand of football that was aesthetically pleasing this season. BC\u2019s games tended to challenge the viewer\u2019s resolve even when the Eagles were winning. They averaged under 20 points a game, while the Terrapins weren\u2019t much more productive putting up just over 25. It will likely be close, but it almost certainly won\u2019t be pretty.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 39. Heart of Dallas Bowl: Army (7-5) vs. North Texas (5-7), Dec. 27, noon ET, ESPN \u2014 In addition to occupying a less-than-ideal time slot, this game has the added disadvantage of being a rematch. The Black Knights committed a ton of mistakes in a 35-18 loss to the Mean Green on Oct. 22. Obviously the West Pointers have played a lot better since then, but the same cannot be said for North Texas. The Mean Green dropped four of their last five, including a head-scratching setback at Texas-El Paso in the regular-season finale.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 38. St. Petersburg Bowl: Miami (Ohio) (6-6) vs. Mississippi State (5-7), Dec. 26, 11 a.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The RedHawks deserve plenty of credit for getting to bowl eligibility, winning their last six games following an 0-6 start. But they haven\u2019t fared well outside the MAC, so they aren\u2019t likely to match up well with the Bulldogs. Miss State somewhat salvaged a disappointing season with November victories against Texas A&M; and archrival Ole Miss.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 37. Independence Bowl: North Carolina State (6-6) vs. Vanderbilt (6-6), Shreveport, La., Dec. 26, 5 p.m. ET, ESPN2 \u2014 We\u2019ll grant that both teams ended the season on a high note, getting to .500 at the expense of an in-state rival. The Commodores, in fact, won their last two, displaying some offensive punch that might help this game exceed expectations. The Wolfpack\u2019s win against North Carolina just made a season of \u2018what ifs\u2019 harder for their fans to accept. They aren\u2019t likely to make much headway against the Vandy defense.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 36. Hawaii Bowl: Middle Tennessee (8-4) vs. Hawaii (6-7), Honolulu, Dec. 24, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Raiders at least get another nice destination after playing in the Bahamas to finish last season. But this one is in effect another home game for the Warriors, who give up plenty of points but still tend to perform better when they don\u2019t have to leave the islands. Middle\u2019s offense has been somewhat makeshift since QB Brent Stockstill went down with a season-ending injury, but they did explode for 77 points against Florida Atlantic in their most recent outing.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 35. Arizona Bowl: Air Force (9-3) vs. South Alabama (6-6), Tucson, Dec. 30, 5:30 p.m. ET, ASN \u2014 This contest isn\u2019t likely to attract much of an audience given the rest of the day\u2019s activities. The Falcons will be heavy favorites playing much closer to home, though the curiously inconsistent Jaguars managed wins against Mississippi State and San Diego State despite finishing 2-6 in the Sun Belt.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 34. Foster Farms Bowl: No. 23 Utah (8-4) vs. Indiana (6-6), Santa Clara, Calif., Dec. 28, 8:30 p.m. ET, Fox \u2014 This has the makings of a mismatch, assuming the Utes can overcome their disappointing finish and play to their potential. The Hoosiers\u2019 record is unexceptional, without either notable wins or egregious losses. But they\u2019ll be in something of a state of flux following coach Kevin Wilson\u2019s ouster, and the crowd figures to favor Utah.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 33. Cactus Bowl: Boise State (10-2) vs. Baylor (6-6), Phoenix, Dec. 27, 10:15 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The 2016 season frankly can\u2019t end soon enough for Baylor, a program already beset with off-field issues that turned miserable on the field as well with a six-game closing skid. The Broncos\u2019 Mountain West aspirations were dashed in road setbacks at Wyoming and Air Force, so their biggest challenge might be finding sufficient internal motivation to handle the Bears.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 32. Liberty Bowl: Georgia (7-5) vs. TCU (6-6), Memphis, Dec. 30, noon ET, ESPN \u2014 Despite a few interesting end-game situations, Georgia\u2019s season typified the lackluster landscape that was the SEC East. The Horned Frogs were just as inconsistent, looking unstoppable at times and completely inept at others. If the version of TCU that dropped its season finale on its home field to Kansas State 30-6 shows up in Memphis, there won\u2019t be much to see.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 31. Pinstripe Bowl: Pittsburgh (8-4) vs. Northwestern (6-6), Bronx, N.Y., Dec. 28, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 It was an odd season for the Panthers, with an offense potent enough to claim victories against two top-five teams but a defense inconsistent enough to lose a few shootouts. None of Pitt\u2019s losses can be classified as bad, however, and they should be able to outscore the up-and-down Wildcats. Northwestern\u2019s defense can keep it in a lot of games and will need to do so again.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 30. New Orleans Bowl: Southern Mississippi (6-6) vs. Louisiana-Lafayette (6-6), Dec. 17, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The participants and their fans won\u2019t have far to travel for this event, at least, though it isn\u2019t likely to generate much interest beyond the region. The Golden Eagles tended to sink or swim with QB Nick Mullens, who returned from a two-game absence due to a concussion in time to lead a needed win against Louisiana Tech in the season finale. The Ragin\u2019 Cajuns are happy to be here as well after finishing 4-8 a year ago. They had to win their last two, including an upset of Sun Belt co-champ Arkansas State, to make it happen.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 29. Cure Bowl in Orlando: Arkansas State (7-5) vs. Central Florida (6-6), Dec. 17, 5:30 p.m. ET, CBSSN \u2014 As mentioned, the RedWolves shared the Sun Belt crown. But they posted a non-league mark of 0-4, including a puzzler against FCS member Central Arkansas. Their reward is in effect a road game, and the Knights will be quite pleased for the chance to defend their home turf after going winless in 2015. UCF has no standout wins but acquitted itself well in a one-point loss to eventual AAC champion Temple.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 28. Military Bowl in Annapolis, Md.: No. 24 Temple (10-3) vs. Wake Forest (6-6), Dec. 27, 3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Speaking of Temple, the Owls probably deserved a better fate in several regards. They claimed the title in the most competitive, top-to-bottom, of the group-of-five conferences, only to see their coach hired away and to earn just a short bowl trip. The Demon Deacons are in their first bowl since 2011, but they enter on a three-game slide and will likely have to count on their defense to keep this one close.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 27. Miami Beach Bowl: Tulsa (9-3) vs. Central Michigan (6-6), Dec. 19, 2:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Hmmm...the Chippewas playing a team from the state of Oklahoma \u2014 where have we seen that before? Sorry, Cowboys\u2019 fans. To be honest, CMU\u2019s season hasn\u2019t lived up to its promise since that controversial September win in Stillwater. The Golden Hurricane were involved in plenty of shootouts in the AAC and figure to put up another big score.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 26. New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque: New Mexico (8-4) vs. Texas-San Antonio (6-6), Dec. 17, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Lobos never seem to get to travel when they make the postseason. There\u2019s a bit more intrigue this time, however, as UNM plays host to UTSA in its bowl debut. Though the visitors are the Roadrunners, the Lobos will likely do most of the running; they lead the FBS in rushing offense averaging 361 yards a game.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 25. Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth: Navy (9-4) vs. Louisiana Tech (8-5), Dec. 23, 4:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Despite its ending, it was a superb season for the Midshipmen as they cracked the top 25 and played for a conference title for the first time in their storied history. But all that took a physical toll, and they now limp into this bowl date on a two-game skid with several key players sidelined. Louisiana Tech also lost in a conference title game, but the Bulldogs\u2019 high-octane passing attack will be a difficult matchup for Navy.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Birmingham Bowl: No. 22 South Florida (10-2) vs. South Carolina (6-6), Dec. 29, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Turns on the coaching carousel are often unpredictable and rarely desirable, but the Bulls\u2019 program seems poised to emerge in good shape. Meantime, they\u2019ll try to put a stamp on a solid season with win against SEC competition. Like most of their fellow division members, the Gamecocks weren\u2019t always easy to watch, and they\u2019ll almost certainly want to keep the score down in this duel with dynamic USF QB Quinton Flowers.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. Texas Bowl in Houston, Kansas State (8-4) vs. Texas A&M (8-4), Dec. 28, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Not all 8-4 teams are created equal. The Wildcats aren\u2019t all that disappointed about it, while the Aggies endured yet another November swoon and might already be in next-year mode. Most of K-State\u2019s games stayed close throughout, but A&M has struggled to move the ball since losing QB Trevor Knight to injury.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Holiday Bowl in San Diego: Minnesota (8-4) vs. Washington State (8-4), Dec. 27, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 it\u2019s rare that this event doesn\u2019t draw a matchup worthy of the top half. But the Big Ten\u2019s strong New Year\u2019s Six presence has limited the pool somewhat for the league\u2019s other bowl partners. This is not to take anything away from the Golden Gophers, who improved on last year\u2019s 6-7 campaign. But if they fall behind early, they won\u2019t have the firepower to catch up with the Cougars, who were in the Pac-12 title hunt until the final weekend of the season.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Famous Idaho Potato Bowl in Boise: Idaho (8-4) vs. Colorado State (7-5), Dec. 22, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 This pairing probably escaped notice upon its release, but it could prove to be highly entertaining. The Rams were among the hottest teams in the west at season\u2019s end winning four of their last five, with the only loss coming in a 49-46 shootout with Air Force. The Vandals posted a 6-2 league record in their penultimate swing through the Sun Belt and hope to leave an impression before returning to the Football Championship Subdivision. Idaho tends to make this event fun when it\u2019s here, earning a 42-35 win against Southern Miss in 1998 and a 43-42 triumph over Bowling Green in 2009.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. Dollar General Bowl in Mobile, Ala.: Troy (9-3) vs. Ohio (8-5), Dec. 23, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014  Both these teams missed out on opportunities to win or share their respective conference titles on the regular season\u2019s final weekend, and neither will want to end the campaign with a losing streak. The Trojans feature the more diverse offense with the one-two backfield punch of QB Brandon Silvers and RB Jordan Chunn, but the Bobcats should have QB Greg Windham back at full speed to test the Troy defense.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. TaxSlayer Bowl in Jacksonville: Georgia Tech (8-4) vs. Kentucky (7-5), Dec. 31, 11 a.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Getting here was a good step for both programs. For the Yellow Jackets 2016 was a bounce-back, while it was something of a breakthrough for the Wildcats as they made headway in the SEC East. The game itself should be in interesting contrast of styles, though both offenses do most of their work on the ground. Georgia Tech\u2019s option attack, directed by QB Justin Thomas, will try to control the clock and keep UK\u2019s pair of 1,000-yard rushers, Boom Williams and Benny Snell, off the field.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 18. Bahamas Bowl in Nassau: Old Dominion (9-3) vs. Eastern Michigan (7-5), Dec. 23, 1 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 When you haven\u2019t been to a bowl since 1987 like EMU, or if you\u2019re bowling for the first time like ODU, any destination is nice. The fact that they get to go to the Bahamas is icing on the cake. The contest itself should be entertaining as well. Monarchs QB David Washington has thrown for 2,648 yards and 28 TDs. The Eagles will counter with Brogan Roback, who served a two-game suspension to start the season, has epitomized the program\u2019s maturation.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Belk Bowl in Charlotte: No. 19 Virginia Tech (9-4) vs. Arkansas (7-5), Dec. 29, 5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 If nothing else, this clash shouldn\u2019t lack for dramatic moments. The Hokies\u2019 campaign has been a mixed bag of signature wins and puzzling losses, but when they don\u2019t beat themselves they can play with anyone. The Razorbacks have also battled inconsistency but can also put up a big score when they don\u2019t give the ball away.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Sun Bowl in El Paso: No. 16 Stanford (9-3) vs. North Carolina (8-4), Dec. 30, 2 p.m. ET, CBS \u2014 The Cardinal fell off the national radar after a bad first month. But they gradually worked their way back into the top 25. And oh yeah, they still have all-purpose threat Christian McCaffrey. The Tar Heels\u2019 season has been the reverse, featuring a strong start with some exasperating losses to area rivals down the stretch. UNC is never out of a game with QB Mitch Trubisky, but he must be careful against the Stanford defense.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Music City Bowl in Nashville: No. 21 Nebraska (9-3) vs. Tennessee (8-4), Dec. 30, 3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 There were positive steps for these proud programs, but neither fan base will feel particularly satisfied with an ending loss. Tennessee has been let down by its defense, particularly over the last month of the campaign, but QB Joshua Dobbs will do everything in his power to go out a winner. The Cornhuskers didn\u2019t fare well against the tougher competition on their schedule, so a bowl win would help erase some bad memories. QB Tommy Armstrong is still battling a hamstring injury but hopes to be ready.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Russell Athletic Bowl in Orlando: No. 12 West Virginia (10-2) vs. Miami (Fla.) (8-4), Dec. 28, 5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Mountaineers enjoyed a terrific year, except when they were facing teams from Oklahoma, of course. Whether a win here will actually translate into momentum for 2017 remains to be seen, but it would be a nice send-off for senior QB Skyler Howard. The Hurricanes have endured a wild ride of four-game streak, with a skid in the middle sandwiched by a good start and better finish. QB Brad Kaaya will look to maintain the sharpness he showed in the final month.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego: BYU (8-4) vs. Wyoming (8-5), Dec. 21, 9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 One of the better rivalries from the old WAC gets rekindled in this appealing destination. Though the Cowboys missed out on the Mountain West championship, they\u2019ve still enjoyed a fine turnaround. The Cougars seem to only know how to play close games, so a tight finish is a good possibility. The bad news for BYU is QB Taysom Hill sustained yet another season-ending injury, this time to his elbow.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Camellia Bowl in Montgomery, Ala.: Toledo (9-3) vs. Appalachian State (9-3), Dec. 17, 5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Sun Belt co-champion Mountaineers take on the high-flying Rockets, who came within a game of playing for the MAC title in this opening-day treat. Leading the way for Toledo is veteran QB Logan Woodside, who has 43 TD passes this season with the help of an explosive receiving corps. ASU QB Taylor Lamb isn\u2019t quite as prolific but directs a solid ground attack that has helped them to a possession-time edge of nearly eight minutes per game.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 11. Boca Raton Bowl: Western Kentucky (10-3) vs. Memphis (8-4), Dec. 20, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The Conference USA champion Hilltoppers will treat their fans to this tasty tilt with the Tigers, who made coach Mike Norvell\u2019s debut season a success. WKU, of course, knows a bit about having its coach hired away \u2014 Jeff Brohm is leaving for Purdue, and on Wednesday the WKU announced Notre Dame offensive coordinator Mike Sanford as its new hire \u2014 but has maintained its winning tradition. The Hilltoppers are putting up over 45 points a game while the Tigers average just under 40, so buckle up and enjoy watching WKU\u2019s Mike White and Riley Ferguson of Memphis trade big plays.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Sugar Bowl in New Orleans: No. 7 Oklahoma (10-2) vs. No. 17 Auburn (8-4), Jan. 2, 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 This is the last one before the national championship game, but it has the potential to unfold as the least attractive of the majors. Whether this game turns out to be competitive largely depends on the Tigers, who hope to have several of their key offensive playmakers healthy by game time. The Auburn defense will pose a challenge for the Sooners\u2019 pair of Heisman finalists, QB Baker Mayfield and WR Dede Westbrook, but things could get out of hand quickly if the Big 12 champs build a lead.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Cotton Bowl in Arlington, Texas: No. 8 Wisconsin (10-3) vs. No. 14 Western Michigan (13-0), Jan. 2, 1 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The curiosity factor of how the group-of-five representative fares against a power-conference opponent will turn to intrigue if the Broncos are able to hang with the Badgers into the second half \u2014 and they very well might. Wisconsin isn\u2019t an offensive juggernaut, and WMU doesn\u2019t often make mistakes that would give the Badgers a short field. The Broncos did display some uncharacteristic nervousness in the MAC title game, however, and they\u2019ll have to shake any residual jitters immediately to make the most of this chance.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Outback Bowl in Tampa, No. 18 Florida (8-4) vs. No. 25 Iowa (8-4), Jan. 2, 1 p.m. ET, ABC \u2014If nothing else, this contest should be close throughout because neither offense is likely to generate sufficient points for a big lead. It would not be stunning, in fact, to see one of these accomplished defensive units produce a big play that could shift momentum. And hey, no matter who wins, there\u2019s a free appetizer.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. Las Vegas Bowl: San Diego State (10-3) vs. Houston (9-3), Dec. 17, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC \u2014 You\u2019ll want to make time to catch this highlight of the bowl season\u2019s first full day. If not for some ill-timed off days resulting in losses, either of these teams might have been candidates to appear in the New Year\u2019s Six lineup. As it is, the Mountain West champion Aztecs and Donnel Pumphrey (No. 2 nationally in rushing with 2,018 yards; he needs just 108 yards to become the all-time FBS leader) should stage a terrific back-and-forth battle with the Cougars and feisty QB Greg Ward Jr.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla.: No. 6 Michigan (10-2) vs. No. 10 Florida State (9-3), Dec. 30, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Even though this is a much sought-after bowl destination, it\u2019s not the one either of these teams wanted at the start of the season. Even so, a victory will mean a top-10 finish. Seminoles\u2019 freshman QB Deondre Francois appears to have a bright future, though his line must do a much better job protecting him. In the meantime he\u2019ll look to send backfield mate Dalvin Cook off to the next level with a win, assuming he chooses to enter the draft. The Wolverines should have QB Wilton Speight back at full strength, and it will be interesting to see how many uses Michigan finds for Jabrill Peppers in what might also be his send-off performance.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Alamo Bowl in San Antonio: No. 11 Colorado (10-3) vs. No. 13 Oklahoma State (9-3), Dec. 29,  9 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 We strongly considered making this one the most appealing pairing outside the six access bowls. It features two teams that were playing for power conference titles on the final weekend of the regular season. The time off should help Buffaloes\u2019 QB Sefo Liufau\u2019s bad ankle heal. CU will need him at full speed to keep up with Mason Rudolph and the Cowboys.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Citrus Bowl in Orlando: No. 15 Louisville (9-3) vs. No. 20 LSU (7-4), Dec. 31, 11 a.m. ET, ABC \u2014 In the end, we went with this one to head the non-New Year\u2019s Six clashes. The main attraction is the Heisman Trophy winner against the stingiest defense he\u2019s encountered all season. Cardinals\u2019 QB Lamar Jackson will have to pick his spots to run more carefully against the hard-hitting Bayou Bengals, though LSU will miss the constant presence of LB Kendell Beckwith (knee).\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.: No. 5 Penn State (11-2) vs. No. 9 Southern California (9-3), Jan. 2, 5 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The \u201cGranddaddy\u201d easily heads the list of non-playoff matchups. You will not find two hotter power-five teams entering the bowl season outside of Tuscaloosa. Much of the Trojans\u2019 reversal of fortune is attributed to the switch to freshman QB Sam Darnold, but the USC defense also made strides after September. The Nittany Lions have made second-half comebacks into an art form this season, but their fans would still like to see a strong first series from QB Trace McSorley and RB Saquon Barkley to ease some anxieties.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Peach Bowl in Atlanta: No. 1 Alabama (13-0) vs. No. 4 Washington (12-1), Dec. 31, 3 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 The apparent inevitability of the Crimson Tide\u2019s march to the SEC championship prompts us to put their game second of the playoff semifinals. Washington took its fans on a tremendous ride this season all the way to the Pac-12 title. But it doesn\u2019t bode well that in the Huskies\u2019 lone loss to USC they were dominated at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and that is where Alabama imposes its will on a weekly basis. Washington QB Jake Browning must make some deep connections early for the Huskies to have any shot at pulling off the upset.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 1. Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz.: No. 2 Ohio State (11-1) vs. No. 3 Clemson (12-1), Dec. 31, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2014 Keeping in mind the overarching \u2018anything can happen\u2019 reality that is, after all, the reason we watch sports, we give this semifinal a higher probability of holding our interest. Both the Buckeyes and Tigers survived a few nail biters to get here, so a little fourth-quarter drama to close out the calendar year is a strong possibility. S Malik Hooker and the superb Buckeyes\u2019 secondary could limit the big-play opportunities for Clemson QB Deshaun Watson, so the Tigers will need a big contribution from RB Wayne Gallman. The Ohio State attack works best when QB J.T. Barrett can find all-purpose back Curtis Samuel in space, but he\u2019s sure to receive added attention from Clemson LB Ben Boulware.\u00a0 USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?

    "text": "advertisement Two lawyers were charged Friday with a \"massive extortion scheme\" in which they uploaded X-rated films to file-sharing sites, sued the people who downloaded them \u2014 and collected millions from victims who feared public humiliation, prosecutors said. Paul Hansmeier and John Steele actually produced some of the pornography, solely for the purpose of copyrighting it so they could file \"sham lawsuits\" used to shake down their targets, Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger said. \"The conduct of these defendants was nothing short of outrageous,\" Luger said at a press conference hours after Hansmeier and Steele were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering and perjury. \"Everything about their practice of law was fraudulent.\" Authorities arrested Paul Hansmeier, of Woodbury, shortly before U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger announced charges on Dec. 16. Carlos Gonzalez / ZUMAPRESS.com Luger sounded disgusted as he described the alleged scheme in which two officers of the court allegedly used unwitting judges to unmask those who downloaded the porn \u2014 until it became clear in 2013 that the lawsuits were not legitimate. The lawyers began by offering to represent the makers of sex films against video pirating, prosecutors said. But instead of trying to protect the copyrighted material, they allegedly put them on websites where they knew they would be illegally downloaded. Because all they had was internet addresses for the downloaders, the attorneys filed copyright infringement lawsuits against \"John Does\" and then sought subpoenas that gave them names. They never intended to go forward with the lawsuits because the litigation would reveal that they had uploaded the movies themselves, Luger said. Instead, they offered the victims the chance to settle and keep their name out of court papers for several thousand dollars, according to the indictment. Eventually, Hansmeier and Steele realized they could cut out the middlemen. They went to a porn convention and cut deals to produce porn they could use to trap more file-sharers. \"They were essentially their own clients,\" Luger said. In an offshoot of the original scheme, the defendants created a company called Guava, then claimed that its computer systems had been hacked in an effort to find the names behind some Internet addresses and file more lawsuits, the indictment charges. Until courts got wise to what was happening, the pair raked in about $6 million in settlements, prosecutors said. Hansmeier and Steele's firm, Prenda Law, fell apart after courts hit it with sanctions and a federal judge referred them to criminal investigators. Hansmeier, 35, who was suspended from practicing law this fall, was arrested Friday morning and was due to appear in court later in the day. His wife, attorney Padraigin Browne, said she had no comment. Steele, 45, was arrested in Florida; his Chicago law office said they did not know who is representing him. In previous litigation they had denied any fraud. Tracy Connor ",

But the brutality, Obama contended, could not have been fully dealt with without U.S. troops on the ground and full-scale U.S. involvement. \"Unless we were all in and ready to take over Syria, we were going to have problems\u2026It was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,\" Obama said. Despite that, Obama said he feels a responsibility for the brutal violence that has been captured by both journalists and on social media. \"I always feel responsible...There are places around the world where horrible things are happening and because of my office, because I am the president, I feel responsible,\" Obama said. Trump's arrival to the White House could prompt a major shift in U.S. policy towards Assad and his ally, Russia. \"I don't like Assad at all,\" Trump said during a presidential debate in October. \"But Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS.\" Obama acknowledged it's good for an incoming president to view U.S. foreign policy with \"fresh eyes,\" but that he needs to take a \"systematic, deliberate\" approach to dealing with America's alliances around the world. Trump angered Chinese leaders by holding a call with the Taiwanese president that bucked the well-established \"One China\" policy that does not acknowledge Taiwan as own government. \"Their reaction on this issue could end up being very significant. That doesn't mean that you have to adhere to everything that's been done in the past, it doesn't mean that you got to think it through and have planned for potential reactions that they may engage in,\" Obama said.

    "text": "OPEN Interactive Feature Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, congratulated Mr. Friedman . Yossi Dagan, the head of a regional council of settlers in the West Bank, called Mr. Friedman \u201ca friend and a true partner of Israel and the settlements.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the United States, the Republican Jewish Coalition said it hoped Mr. Friedman would \u201crepair relations with our greatest ally in the Middle East that have eroded over the last eight years,\u201d while former Senator Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican, said Mr. Friedman would help \u201cbuild a much closer and stronger\u201d relationship between the United States and Israel. For the Palestinian leadership, the choice of someone with views at odds with the broad American approach to Israel over decades poses a grave challenge. The office of President Mahmoud Abbas has not yet commented on the appointment. Other observers, including a number of prominent American Jews, expressed dismay at the choice. Martin S. Indyk, executive vice president of the Brookings Institution and a former ambassador to Israel, said that Mr. Friedman would be \u201ca great ambassador for the deep settler state,\u201d referring to right-wing Israelis who want to expand their presence in the Palestinian territories. \u201cBut David Friedman needs to be U.S. envoy to all Israelis,\u201d Mr. Indyk wrote on Twitter . \u201cIs he up for that?\u201d Daniel C. Kurtzer, a retired career diplomat and Princeton professor who was ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005, under President George W. Bush, said in an interview that the appointment alarmed him. \u201cMr. Friedman\u2019s published articles and public statements will create significant damage for American interests and for the possibility of Israeli-Palestinian peace,\u201d Mr. Kurtzer said. \u201cHe has made clear that he will appeal to a small minority of Israeli \u2014 and American \u2014 extremists, ignoring the majority of Israelis who continue to seek peace. Friedman\u2019s appointment as ambassador runs directly contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s professed desire to make the \u2018ultimate deal\u2019 between Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d Peter Beinart, an author and journalist who has written extensively about Israel, called Mr. Friedman \u201c totally unqualified ,\u201d likening his selection to that of Ben Carson , the retired neurosurgeon who has been tapped by Mr. Trump to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

    "text": "'Thanks for saving my life': Dennis Rodman's heartfelt tribute to Craig Sager Photos of Craig Sager, who worked basketball games for TNT for nearly a quarter-century. Peter HolleyThe Washington Post The NBA community is mourning the loss of Craig Sager after the legendary broadcaster died following a two-year battle with acute myeloid leukemia. And while tributes have poured in from all corners of the league, including players and coaches from multiple eras, perhaps none contained as much gravity as the message Dennis Rodman tweeted within hours of the announcement of Sager's death. For Rodman, Sager wasn't just an NBA fixture; he was the reason the notoriously troubled Hall of Fame player lived past the age of 31. \"Craig Sager thanks for saving my life when I was in dire need of help in Detroit back in 1993. Condolences to your family. RIP my friend,\" Rodman tweeted. Rodman was referring to a dark chapter in his life, in April 1993, when the Detroit Pistons - the team with which Rodman won two NBA championships - were on the verge of cutting ties with him. The complicated star found himself adrift and alone - and contemplating suicide. \"Those thoughts went through my head,\" he said in a 2011 interview with reporter Graham Bensinger. \"I think the circumstances were dispersing from Detroit. The organization wanted to get rid of key people on the team . . . I was basically by myself. [Or so] I thought.\" He added: \"I didn't have no family in Detroit.\" In the Motor City, Rodman \"wore out his welcome with his bizarre behavior,\" according to a 1993 Los Angeles Times story, which noted he was suspended twice for insubordination and once \"removed his shoes and read a magazine after being taken out of a game at Washington.\" The Times reported in October 1993 that \"Rodman left a suicide note last February, and police later found him sitting in the parking lot at the Palace of Auburn Hills with a loaded rifle in the back of his truck.\" ",

    "text": "US Demands Return of Seized Drone by Chinese Navy in South China Sea By Luis Martinez Dec 16, 2016, 2:06 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH One-China Policy: The Basics 0 Shares Email A U.S. oceanographic underwater drone was seized by a Chinese Navy warship in international waters of the South China Sea on Thursday. The United States has filed a diplomatic protest with China over the incident, demanding the return of the drone that was clearly marked as U.S. government property. The incident occurred Thursday afternoon local time about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines as the USNS Bowditch, a civilian-manned U.S. Navy oceanographic vessel, was conducting research using an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) known as an \"Ocean Glider.\" The UUV was \"gathering military oceanographic data such as salinity, water temperature and sound speed ... in accordance with international law,\" a Pentagon spokesman said. The crew of the Bowditch was in the process of recovering one of the two ocean gliders when a small boat was launched from a nearby Chinese Navy warship. The small boat retrieved the other drone from the water and returned it to the Chinese vessel. The American crew contacted the Chinese vessel by radio multiple times, demanding the return of the drone. The demands were ignored, the Pentagon said. The only response the Chinese vessel gave was \"we are returning to normal operations\" as it pulled away from the Bowditch, according to the Pentagon. \"Using appropriate government-to-government channels, the Department of Defense has called upon China to immediately return an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) that China unlawfully seized on Dec. 15 in the South China Sea while it was being recovered by a U.S. Navy oceanographic survey ship,\" said Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, in a statement released Friday. \"The UUV is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States,\" said Cook. \"We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law.\" A U.S. defense official said there was no indication as to why the Chinese would want to pick up an unclassified drone used for ocean research. The South China Sea has become an international focal point for China, the United States and other countries in the region. China has claimed seven reefs in the Spratly Island chain as its own, essentially dredging them into islands. There are also territorial claims over the Paracel Islands located east of Vietnam and the Scarborough Shoal, 200 miles west of the Philippines. New satellite imagery released publicly by a Washington think-tank this week seem to indicate that China has begun placing \"significant\" military defenses on the artificial islands it has built up in the Spratly Islands. 0 Shares ",

USNS Bowditch U.S. Navy Two U.S. Navy Ocean Glider Unmanned Underwater Vehicle were collecting data during what the Pentagon called a routine survey approximately 50 nautical miles north west of Subic Bay, in the Philippines. The incident did not take place near the hotly disputed Spratly Islands. The gliders \"stopped dead in the water\" as they awaited recovery by the USS Bowditch, an oceanographic research vessel. A Chinese ship that was already shadowing the Bowditch swooped in and \"unlawfully retrieved\" one of the gliders. \"They stole it,\" an official with knowledge of the incident told NBC News. There were multiple attempts at bridge to bridge communication to demand the Chinese give the glider back. The Chinese acknowledged the call but said that they were returning to normal operations, ignored requests to return the glider and left the area. \"This is an action that's not in keeping with international law,\" Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said on Friday. Related: \"Is China Militarizing the South China Sea?\" The issue is being addressed through diplomatic channels, the official said, adding that the U.S. has already issued a formal demarche, or messaged request to China. A defense official tells NBC news that the U.S. Navy knows where the Chinese ship is, but are not actively tracking it. The officials said this does not likely qualify as an act of war. \"No one here is freaking out about this, but it was unprofessional,\" the official said. Related: China 'Not Afraid' of War After U.S. Ship Sails in Disputed Area: Paper This glider is commercially available and they retail for about $150,000. These types of gliders are generally used for environmental collection to help the Navy better understand the oceans and how sonar works. They are also used to help the Navy better conduct anti-submarine warfare The stolen glider belongs to Military Sealift Command and was not conducting surveillance. The incident follows a series of tense exchanges with China, including that nation's sharp rebuke of president-elect Donald Trump's phone call with Taiwan's president in a departure from decades-long policy toward the island prefecture. Two Chinese military aircraft intercepted a U.S. military reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea in May. And in October, a U.S. destroyer sailed near the artificial islands built by China in the disputed waters of the South China Sea in a move that was seen as an open challenge to Beijing's territorial claims.

    "text": "By Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura December 16 at 3:30 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @davidnakamura President Obama answers questions during Friday's news conference. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) President Obama said Friday that his administration did not ascribe motives to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 campaign ahead of Election Day because he did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome in favor of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cAnything said by me or anyone in this White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens,\u201d Obama said at a year-end news conference. \u201cI wanted to make sure everybody understood we were playing this thing straight. That we were not trying to advantage one side or the other.\u201d [ What you need to know about Russia\u2019s election hacking ] Obama defended his administration's handling of the investigation into the hacking of private emails from top Democratic Party officials, amid reports that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Russian operatives used the stolen materials to try to help Republican Donald Trump win the election. The FBI has now joined the CIA in that assessment. Clinton has cited the stolen emails, which were made public by WikiLeaks, as a factor in her upset loss to Trump, and her former campaign John Podesta blasted the FBI for focusing more aggressively on investigating her use of a private email server than on Russia's involvement. [ Clinton blames Putin\u2019s personal grudge against her for election interference ] Obama emphasized that his administration publicly accused Russian actors of being behind the email theft in early fall and noted that reporters speculated that the disclosure of the private messages was made to embarrass Clinton and other Democrats during a hard-fought campaign. The president suggested that the public was free to interpret the motives behind the leaks for themselves. \u201cWhat we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place so that if you started seeing some effect on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd that was exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. Then it would have become just one more political scrum.\u201d Obama added that \u201cpart of the goal here was to make sure we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was going to take place.\u201d Obama has pledged to respond to Russia's actions with punitive measures, but he did not offer more details about when or how he might do so. Obama suggested that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin knew about the hacking, and he said he warned Putin to \"cut it out\" during an international summit in the fall. The president said he did not denounce Russia more forcefully in public leading up to the election because he did not think that would have any effect. \"Folks out there who somehow suggest that if we went out there and made a big comment and thumped our chest about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spoke the Russians?\" he said. \"The idea that public shaming is going to be effective doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.\" Obama noted that Trump has been complimentary of Putin and he expressed frustration at Republican leaders who have refrained from criticizing Russia since Trump's victory. The president cited a poll from the Economist and YouGov that said 37 percent of voters approved of Putin. \"The former head of the [Soviet spy agency] KGB,\" Obama said. \"Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave at how that happened.\" \u00a0 ",

Johnson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune One player's fall offers the opportunity for another to rise. And so it is with Bobby Portis , who remained ahead of Nikola Mirotic in the rotation for a second straight game after Portis didn't play by coach's decision the previous four games. \"It's always difficult to sit and watch the guys play,\" Portsi said. \"At the same time, I just tried to keep myself ready. I'm a team guy first. I want to play, but I just want to win.\" During Portis' previous rotational turn, he logged most of his minutes at center alongside Mirotic, who wasn't scheduled to play even before forgetting about and getting fined for missing the team's mandatory walkthrough Friday evening. Now Portis is logging minutes at power forward alongside Cristiano Felicio. \"I don't really care which position I play,\" Portis said. \"I was guarding guys who were much taller and stronger than me, but I'm a competitive guy.\" That trait is what stood out to coach Fred Hoiberg during Portis' return to the rotation Thursday night in Milwaukee. Hoiberg cited Portis' sprinting the floor and strong screen-setting as aids in the Bulls ' fourth-quarter comeback bid. \"I thought Bobby gave us great energy,\" Hoiberg said. Hoiberg said the rotation is fluid. On Friday, Portis finished with 10 points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes in the Bulls' 95-69 loss to the Bucks . October's trade sending Tony Snell to the Bucks and Michael Carter-Williams to the Bulls looked like one of those win-wins for both teams.

I'm running with (director of sports performance) Chip (Schaefer) a lot, just trying to stay in shape so when I'm ready to come back (to practice) hopefully it won't take me long to get back to playing (games).\" Carter-Williams has been sidelined since Oct. 31, when he sprained his left wrist and suffered a bone bruise in his left knee. Hoiberg said the guard will have a prominent rotation role. \"I think Coach has a lot of confidence in me,\" Carter-Williams said. \"I really take pride in the defensive end. I want to help the team.\" Charity stripe: The Bulls shot 22 free throws in Thursday's matchup against the Bucks, the 15th time they have attempted 20 or more.

    "text": "U.S. Navy China has seized an unmanned underwater vehicle deployed by a U.S. Navy ship in international waters, according to Pentagon officials. The seizure of the underwater vehicle took place Thursday, about 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines, Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in a statement Friday. The situation is unusual: U.S. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told journalists there was no precedent for it in recent memory, NPR's Tom Bowman reports. The Pentagon said the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey ship, had two unclassified \"ocean gliders\" \u2014 unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) \u2014 in the water, conducting \"routine operations in accordance with international law.\" The undersea drones measure things such as salinity and temperature. The Bowditch was retrieving one vehicle when a Chinese warship pulled up, put a small boat in the water and retrieved the second UUV, officials told reporters. In South China Sea Islands, Anti-Aircraft And Radar Systems Emerge In Full Color The U.S. sent radio messages requesting that the drone be returned, the Pentagon statement said, but the Chinese ship merely acknowledged the messages and ignored the request. No shots were fired by either vehicle, officials said, and the Chinese ship left with a final message that it was returning to normal operations \u2014 and with the drone. The U.S. has issued a demarche \u2014 a formal diplomatic protest \u2014 and demanded the drone's return, Reuters reports. \"We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law,\" Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in his statement. The incident occurred in the long-disputed waters of the South China Sea, where several countries have various overlapping territorial claims. China has been the most aggressive in claiming the strategically and economically significant waters as its own. Competing Claims In The South China And East China Seas Notes These are the approximate claims by China and other countries. In many cases, countries are intentionally vague about the extent of their claims. Credit: Katie Park / NPR Satellite photos taken in the past few weeks appear to show a significant defense buildup on China's artificial islands in the South China Sea. Beijing uses the artificial islands as part of the justification for China's territorial claims \u2014 which were invalidated months ago by an international tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Article continues after sponsorship A Primer On The Complicated Battle For The South China Sea That ruling is \"legally binding, but all but impossible to enforce,\" as NPR's Anthony Kuhn put it at the time. \"The U.S. has consistently said it has no dog in the fight over conflicting claims in the South China Sea,\" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR this summer. \"But ... the U.S. has conducted a series of high-profile freedom of navigation operations in the disputed waters, near the artificial islands China has created there.\" The drone seizure also comes amid fresh tensions between China and the U.S., following moves by President-elect Donald Trump that have unsettled decades of diplomatic protocol. What Will A Trump Presidency Mean For China? Trump spoke with Taiwan's president by phone earlier this month, and told Fox News he \"wouldn't feel bound by a one-China policy\" \u2014 the policy holding that Taiwan is part of China, which China considers essential for diplomatic relations. China responded to Trump's latter comments by expressing \"serious concerns.\" NPR's Rob Schmitz wrote last month that it's hard to tell how Trump's presidency will affect ties with China, which has been spending \"more than ever\" to expand its military capabilities. He noted that one Trump adviser said Trump would beef up the U.S. fleet to defend U.S. trade in the South China Sea \u2014 which directly conflicts with Trump's campaign rhetoric. The drone incident also could impact diplomatic relations with the Philippines. In South China Sea Dispute, Filipinos Say U.S. Credibility Is On The Line The U.S. and the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have been closely tied for decades; the two countries are treaty allies. In recent years, a rise in tensions between Manila and Beijing has led to a growing U.S. military presence in the Philippines. But the Philippines' new president, Rodrigo Duterte, has signaled a shift away from the U.S. and made overtures to China. \"There's no doubt Duterte is trying to reset the Philippines' fractious relationship with China, a falling-out based largely on Beijing's recent territorial moves in the South China Sea,\" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR this fall . \"But there's also little doubt that Manila's relationship with Washington is on the rocks \u2014 and not just because of U.S. criticism of Duterte's war on drugs, which has left more than 3,000 dead since the president took office in June.\" ",

    "text": "By Larry Light MoneyWatch December 16, 2016, 5:10 PM Trump tweet against Vanity Fair brings it a bonanza Email Usually when President-elect Donald Trump pumps out a nasty tweet, the recipient suffers, such as Lockheed ( LMT ) did after he derided what he deemed the high cost of a fighter plane it is constructing. But the reverse is true after he took on his newest target: Vanity Fair, which gave the restaurant in Trump Tower a scathingly bad review.\u00a0 In the tweet, he slammed the magazine for poor circulation numbers, writing: \u201cWay down, big trouble, dead!\u201d \u00a0 But in the aftermath, Vanity Fair said Thursday\u2019s subscriptions soared 100 times the level it usually gets in a day. Plus, Thursday saw the largest number of subscriptions sold in a single day for any Cond\u00e9 Nast publication. Further, Vanity Fair added 10,000 new Twitter followers. \u00a0 The president-elect uses his Twitter account to air his grievances, sometimes sending stock prices into a tailspin The fracas started on Tuesday, when Vanity Fair writer Tina Nguyen posted her review of the Trump Grill steakhouse , which is off the lobby of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite namesake New York building. Trump Tower houses retail, office and condo spaces, including his own home.\u00a0 The Vanity Fair review carried the headline: \u201cTrump Grill Could Be the Worst Restaurant in America.\u201d The writer criticized its decor, lack of toilet paper in the restroom, and the food. For instance, she decried the \u201cflaccid, gray Szechuan dumplings with their flaccid, gray innards, as a campy version of \u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 jackhammered in the background.\u201d The review appeared on Vanity Fair\u2019s Hive site, which carries a red banner that it\u2019s \u201cthe magazine Trump doesn\u2019t want you to read.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 The incoming president wasn\u2019t amused, and tweeted his counterattack Thursday morning, striking back at the magazine and its editor, Graydon Carter:\u00a0 Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016 Trouble is, his assessment of the magazine is incorrect. Cond\u00e9 Nast, which publishes the title, said the circulation of its physical magazine increased 2.8 percent, to 1.23 million, as of June 30 (magazines report every six months). And as of October, its website had more than 14 million unique visitors, up 16 percent compared to 12 months earlier. That was even before both circulation and web traffic spiked in the wake of the review and Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter blast, a story first reported by Adweek . \u00a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s views of specific media outlets run hot and cold. He recently tweeted his thanks to Time magazine and the Financial Times for each making him its person of the year. But last year he knocked Time for choosing German Chancellor Angela Merkel, tweeting that the magazine \u201cwould never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite.\u201d\u00a0 Time selects its person of the year not as an endorsement, but to mark that he or she has dominated the news and made a big impact on the world, for good or ill. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

The officials said electing Trump was only part of what Russia was trying to accomplish. The larger goal, they said, was to undermine confidence in American democracy. \"Mostly they wanted to build uncertainty and challenge faith in the American election system,\" said one official. The FBI's view has been that Russia's main goal was causing mischief, said the official. That Russia also supported Trump was \"one part\" of the FBI assessment.

The other 16 agencies and the FBI did not publicly endorse the CIA's assessment. The confirmation that major intelligence agencies agree on the nature and intent of the Russian operation may put additional pressure on Donald Trump and his supporters, who have sought to portray the government as divided about what happened.

Richard Burr of North Carolina, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a statement Friday endorsing the intelligence and the men and women who collect it. Burr promised a committee investigation of \"the cyber activity directed against our nation by the Russian Government.\" He added that intelligence officers \"check politics at the office door and focus on their mission,\" in what appeared to be a message to Trump, who has suggested that U.S. spies are not to be trusted. But Rep. Devin Nunes of California, a Trump transition official who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, issued his second statement in three days complaining that his committee had not been briefed on the conclusion by the CIA that Russia intended in part to elect Donald Trump. \"We have not received any information from Intelligence Community (IC) agencies indicating that they have developed new assessments on this issue,\" Nunes said. A U.S. official said Nunes had been briefed as part of the \"Gang of 8,\" the Congressional leaders who receive the most sensitive intelligence. A Congressional aide insisted that was not the case.

    "text": "\u201cYou can indict 400 people. They don\u2019t care,\u201d said Robert E. Anderson Jr., who until last year served as the F.B.I.\u2019s most senior executive overseeing computer investigations. The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. The American government divides the cybersecurity world into two categories: attacks directed or sponsored by governments, and those conducted by criminals. But Russian hacking defies easy categorization, American officials say, because the Russian government tacitly supports many private hackers and occasionally taps them for freelance government work. That has complicated investigations and upended the normal diplomatic order. In May 2009, for instance, Secret Service agents met in Moscow with their counterparts in the Russian Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B. The Americans said they were investigating a hacker who had installed malicious code in the software that some American businesses used to process credit card transactions. The hacker was stealing millions of credit card numbers and selling them in an underground digital marketplace. The agents provided a name \u2014 Roman Seleznev \u2014 and the aliases he used online. His father was a member of the Russian Parliament. The Secret Service had followed his digital trail to Vladivostok, and they asked for help catching him. Within weeks, all evidence of Mr. Seleznev\u2019s online identity vanished from the internet. Rather than advancing the case, the Russian government had set it back, the American authorities believed. Prosecutors described their blunt conclusion in court documents: \u201cFurther coordination with the Russian government would jeopardize efforts to prosecute this case.\u201d The American authorities were left to pursue Mr. Seleznev by themselves. The Russians are not always uncooperative. This week they deported Joshua Samuel Aaron, 32, who was wanted by the F.B.I. on charges of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Wall Street banks. But Mr. Aaron, who was arrested Wednesday at John F. Kennedy International Airport after arriving on a flight from Moscow, is an American, not a Russian. In another computer crime case, in 2014, the Justice Department shut down two global computer networks that had been used to steal millions of dollars. Called Operation Tovar, it involved intelligence agencies around the world. The target was 30-year-old Evgeniy M. Bogachev. Safely in Russia, he watched as the F.B.I. made him a most-wanted fugitive and offered a $3 million reward for his capture. Photo Evgeniy M. Bogachev is wanted by the F.B.I. for his involvement in a cybercrime case in which millions of dollars were stolen from unsuspecting victims. Credit via F.B.I. In that case the F.B.I. was actually able to identify the person sitting at the keyboard. More often, the authorities identify aliases or internet addresses but cannot prove who is behind them unless the hackers get sloppy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the Seleznev case, for example, the authorities searched a Yahoo email account that was used to register some of the servers in the credit-card scam. Agents found, among other things, receipts for flowers that Mr. Seleznev had sent to his wife. In the D.N.C. case and other election-year hacks, the authorities have concluded that people affiliated with the Russian government are to blame. But even if intelligence officials can identify who is behind those attacks, naming the actual perpetrators is even harder. One senior federal law enforcement official said this week that investigators still had many unanswered questions. If it can be done, naming and prosecuting the hackers would follow a path set in 2014, when the Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army on charges of hacking into American networks. The indictment links the men to specific email addresses and aliases, but does not reveal how the authorities made those connections. \u201cThe chance of us ever getting those Chinese guys is about zero,\u201d said Mr. Anderson. \u201cBut it does show them that there\u2019s a change afoot. At least the way we\u2019re looking at it policy-wise.\u201d Criminal charges have more practical implications, too. \u201cIt\u2019s about denying them the ability to travel freely and preventing them from spending their ill-gotten gains anywhere but Russia,\u201d said Leo Taddeo, the chief security officer at Cryptzone and the former top agent in the F.B.I.\u2019s New York computer operations division. \u201cYou\u2019re confining them to a prison that spans 11 time zones that can be a pretty unpleasant place.\u201d ",

By Aaron Blake December 16 at 12:47 PM Follow @aaronblake Hillary Clinton looks on as first lady Michelle Obama speaks during a campaign rally at Wake Forest University on Oct. 27, in Winston-Salem, N.C. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Hillary Clinton, in audio just unearthed by the New York Times , offers her most unvarnished accounting of her 2016 election defeat yet. And while it's no surprise that she blames FBI Director James B. Comey \u2014 she's done that before , if a bit less forcefully \u2014\u00a0she also points pretty squarely at another \u201cunprecedented,\u201d non-Comey actor: Russia. Here's a partial transcript of Clinton's comments to campaign donors Thursday night: There were some unprecedented factors that I don\u2019t think we can ignore, because to do so is at our peril. Now, don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from independent analysts. Take it from the Trump campaign. Take it from Nate Silver, who\u2019s pointed out that swing-state voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me, because of the FBI letter from Director Comey. And Nate Silver believes \u2014 I happen to believe this \u2014 that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome. But we're also learning something more every day about the unprecedented Russian plot to swing this election. And this is something every American should be worried about. You know, we have to recognize that, as the latest reports made clear, Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me. Clinton later added, in reference to\u00a0Russia's meddling, that \u201cthe press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign.\u201d Clinton doesn't directly say \u201cI lost because of Russia\" \u2014 at least not as directly as she says it about Comey \u2014 but it wasn't as if she brought it up simply to make a case about cybersecurity; she brought it up in the context of the \u201cunprecedented factors\u201d that led to her loss. Right after she points to late deciders voting against her because of Comey, she brings up Russia. And Clinton isn't the only one entertaining the idea that Russia made the difference. President Obama said in a new NPR interview that Russia's meddling changed the \u201catmosphere\u201d of the race and dominated the news coverage in a way that crowded out other issues and advantaged Trump in a clear way. Obama told Steve Inskeep : That whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that number one, issues weren't talked about a lot in the coverage, huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively, her experience, her \u2014 her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of State, all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum, in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxiety and fears that some voters have I think definitely made a difference. But did it actually make a difference? Obama then\u00a0put on his political scientist/pundit cap and left it open as a possibility. \u201cElections can always turn out differently,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact, just based on the coverage.\u201d Obama was very diplomatic about this, but he's clearly not disputing the idea that Russia may have changed the results of the 2016 election; that's the inescapable extension of his comments. He was asked a direct question about whether it \u201ccould have turned out differently,\u201d and Obama's answer was decidedly far from \u201cno.\u201d And in fact, Obama seems to think Russian meddling mattered in a very big way by essentially turning the entire debate away from Clinton's strengths. Obama emphasized during the same interview that he didn't want to start \u201cre-litigating\u201d the 2016 election, but the problem with looking at Russia's role is that this is inherently part of the process. The fact is that Trump's margin of victory was so small \u2014 less than 1 percentage point in the three states that mattered: Michigan (0.2 percent), Pennsylvania (0.7) and Wisconsin (0.8) \u2014\u00a0that even a small shift could have made the difference. If Russia's meddling moved the vote in every state just one point toward Trump, it made the difference. This is a big reason Republicans have been reluctant to go down this road . Even those who may be legitimately worried about Russia's meddling know it's not hard to draw the line from A to B to C: The Russians meddled on Trump's behalf, and Trump won by a very small margin ( about 80,000 votes ), so it's quite possible Russia tipped the scales in the election. The comments from Clinton and Obama aren't likely to make them feel better about entertaining this investigation and all the questions that come with it. If the conclusion of that investigation is that Russia penetrated deeply and was able to influence the process in a serious way, there will always be that doubt about whether it made the difference and whether Trump would have been president without it. We may never know for sure, but as Clinton and Obama demonstrate, plenty of people will have their suspicions. politics ",

    "text": "Email WASHINGTON -- An Army major general has been stripped of his stars and forced out of the military after a 30-year military career because of a long extramarital affair and \u201cswinger\u201d lifestyle. An Army spokesman says Maj. Gen. David Haight was demoted by three steps to the rank of lieutenant colonel, a steep and rare downgrade for a senior officer. The demotion will cost him more than $40,000 in annual retirement pay, based on pay scales for a lieutenant colonel and a two-star general with 30 years in the Army. And it slams the door on what was once a promising career. Army Secretary Eric Fanning approved the board\u2019s recommendation and made the final decision. The spokesman was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke anonymously. Haight, the married father of four adult children, was leading an apparent double life, which was exposed publicly by USA Today in August. According to USA Today, he had an 11-year extramarital affair as well as multiple sexual partners, which put him at risk of espionage and blackmail.\u00a0 After an Army investigation that issued a report in April, Haight was fired in May from his job of running operations at the European Command. But his firing -- or the reasons for it -- were not made public. Haight formerly served as a top aide to Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which meant that Haight had access to top-secret, sensitive national security information.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Welch pleaded not guilty this morning to all charges stemming from the incident. Welch is charged with a federal offense of interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, a District of Columbia offense of assault with a dangerous weapon, and a D.C. offense of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. He was arrested earlier this month after allegedly walking into a Washington pizza place with a loaded AR-15 rifle and firing shots to \"investigate\" the false rumors that the restaurant was harboring children. Man Fires Assault Rifle in Pizzeria Named in Fake-News Conspiracy The establishment got swept up in a flurry of fake news reports and social media postings that linked the restaurant to Hillary Clinton and a trafficking ring. Michael Flynn Jr. -- the son of Trump's national security adviser pick, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn -- was forced out of the Trump transition team amid the fake news controversy after he pushed the \"pizzagate\" conspiracy theory in a flood of tweets. On Sunday, Dec. 4, Welch got in his car and drove from his hometown in North Carolina directly to the pizzeria. In a text message to his girlfriend a few days before, Welch wrote that he had been researching the \"pizzagate\" conspiracy theory and it was making him \"sick,\" according to the criminal complaint against him. Around 3 p.m., he arrived at the restaurant, where witnesses say they saw Welch holding the rifle across his chest, according to the complaint. He was carrying a loaded assault rifle and a fully loaded .38 caliber Colt revolver, according to court documents filed by the prosecution. At that point, patrons and staff fled the building. While inside, he encountered a locked door and attempted to open it with a butter knife, the complaint says. When that didn't work, he fired shots at the lock with his AR-15, documents say. Still unsuccessful at opening the door, he climbed on top of furniture to look inside the locked room and found it empty, according to the complaint. Less than a half hour later, Welch exited the building with his hands in the air and complied with officers\u2019 instructions. Welch was first charged in D.C. court, but now faces federal charges as well. He has been detained since his arrest. He was arraigned in federal court and scheduled for a detention hearing this morning. However, his attorney conceded that he would remain in detention. \"He understands the nature of the charges in the indictment,\" said Assistant Public Defender Dani Jahn of her client after the hearing, declining to comment further. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office also declined to comment outside of the courtroom. Welch is scheduled for a status hearing on Jan. 5, 2017.

    "text": "By Reena Flores CBS News December 16, 2016, 1:10 PM Hillary Clinton talks election loss, Vladimir Putin's \"personal beef\" with her Email In a discussion with donors Thursday night, Hillary Clinton attributed her general election loss to the \u201cunprecedented\u201d events of Russian cyber interference and a\u00a0 letter written by FBI Director James Comey \u00a0to Congress. The cyber attacks -- which U.S. intelligence sources believe were\u00a0 approved by Vladimir Putin -- were the result of a \u201cpersonal beef\u201d the Russian leader had with her, Clinton told the gathering of fundraisers, who had given a total of about $1 billion to her campaign. She attributed the Russian president\u2019s vendetta to her harsh criticism of the country\u2019s 2011 parliamentary elections, which she called \u201cso flawed, so illegitimate that it was embarrassing.\u201d \u201cPutin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,\u201d she said, according to audio obtained by the New York Times. \u201cHe is determined to score a point against me which he did. But also undermine our democracy.\u201d U.S. investigators believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to damage Hillary Clinton and inject doubt and chaos into the election pr... That Putin\u2019s grudge against Clinton led to Russia\u2019s involvement in the U.S. elections was a theory espoused earlier this week by some like Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014. In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d McFaul was asked about why Putin would champion Donald Trump over Clinton. \u201cLet\u2019s remember that Vladimir Putin thinks she interfered in his election -- the parliamentary election in December 2011 -- and has said as much publicly, and I\u2019ve heard him talk about it privately,\u201d he said Sunday. Clinton, in her talk with donors, hammered home that the cyber hacks were \u201cnot just an attack against me and my campaign.\u201d \u201cThis is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here,\u201d Clinton said, before calling for a \u201crobust\u201d investigation by Congress into the hacks similar to the commission investigating the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. \u201cThis is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\u201d Clinton also attributed her defeat in battleground states to the 11th-hour letter sent by FBI Director James Comey to lawmakers, where he once again raised the specter of finding more emails from her private server, months after the agency concluded their investigation and just days before the general election. Citing political analyst Nate Silver and his interpretation of available data, she said \u201cswing state voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me because of the FBI letter from Director Comey.\u201d \u201cNate Silver believes - I happen to believe this - that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome,\u201d said Clinton, who has remained largely out of the public eye since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 8. Clinton\u2019s remarks come just as the Obama administration has pledged to take action against Russia for the hacking attacks. \u201cI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections , that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing,\u201d President Obama told NPR in an interview Thursday, responding to a question about whether it was necessary for Russia to pay a price for interfering in the election. \u201cSome of it may be...explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

A worker tapes a box while packing items on Cyber Monday at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in San Bernardino. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Natalie Kitroeff There are few things more important to Amazon than\u00a0delivery. A large part of the reason the retailer is valued at $360 billion is that it has managed to\u00a0get customers the things they want, cheaper and faster than its competitors. Someday, the company promises, drones\u00a0will deposit\u00a0boxes at people\u2019s doorsteps. But for now, the job of handling the holiday delivery crunch is left to an army of people like Angel Echeverria. Echeverria, 38, drives for LMS Transportation, a local courier in Inglewood\u00a0that delivers packages for Amazon. He starts each day with about 260 boxes, which he has to drop off at maybe 200 addresses across up to 80 miles in Southern California. Factoring in the time needed to load and gas up his white van, which sometimes sports a magnetized Amazon logo on the back door, Echeverria has to hit one home every two minutes, on average. Failing to deliver even one package is not an option, he says. \u201cIf you bring anything back, they basically want to cut your throat off,\u201d says Echeverria, a single father of three who makes $15 an hour. (Associated Press) For all the control it exercises, Amazon doesn\u2019t count Echeverria and many other people who speed around major cities in vans filled with Amazon boxes as its employees. In an echo of complaints by Uber drivers and other contract workers, delivery drivers in interviews with The Times and in court documents say Amazon is working them past a reasonable point, and often\u00a0avoids paying them overtime or giving legally required meal breaks. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company\u2019s code of conduct for contract delivery companies requires them to provide \u201cappropriate work hours and overtime pay.\u201d But in the last two years, drivers in four states have sued the company for allegedly misclassifying them as independent contractors. Those drivers have said they don\u2019t get overtime pay and can earn less than the minimum wage\u00a0because they spend so much on gas every week. In 2015, drivers for\u00a0Pasadena-based courier Scoobeez who delivered packages for Amazon sued both companies for denying them overtime and effectively paying them less than the minimum wage after drivers subtracted gas, tolls and maintenance from their paychecks. Drivers in Arizona settled in October with Amazon, \u00a0which did not admit fault. Cases against the company in California, Illinois and Washington are still being adjudicated. Labor experts say the cases against Amazon are unusual among contract-work complaints for the level of control the company is claimed to have over the people who deliver its goods. \u201cWith Uber, the individual worker decides on their own when they want to work, how long they want to work, and how they want to provide service to the customer,\u201d said Seth Harris, former deputy secretary of the U.S. Labor Department. \u201cThis is not that. Amazon has a product in its fulfillment center or its warehouse that has to get to a particular person by a particular time, and they are dictating all of that.\u201d Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said the delivery firms it contracts with make their own decisions about when to fire employees. But she added that Amazon expects the contract companies to provide a certain level of service. Those expectations mount during the holidays. On its busiest day, the Monday after Thanksgiving \u2014 Cyber Monday , in industry parlance \u2014 Amazon was expecting to receive more than 54 million orders. To get the flood of holiday goods to their purchasers,\u00a0Amazon relies on every delivery option available.\u00a0That\u00a0includes FedEx, UPS and the Postal Service, which in 2013 agreed to deliver packages on Sunday for the company. But three years ago Amazon began relying more on local couriers, said Rob Howard, the chief executive of Grand Junction, a Web platform that connects those companies to Amazon and other e-commerce retailers. \u201c[Amazon] realized that the local couriers could do more than UPS and FedEx. In many cases they are less expensive, because they are non-unionized, the drivers are independent contractors,\u201d Howard said. Several drivers and industry officials said in interviews that Amazon keeps records on the performance of every one of its drivers, and pressures contractors to fire the ones who can\u2019t keep up.\u00a0 In a court deposition, a former manager at a delivery service called LaserShip, which was sued in Virginia by drivers for misclassification, said the company kept those records on drivers on behalf of Amazon. It said the retailer does not want drivers to exceed a certain threshold of complaints, and had requested that the company fire at least one driver.\u00a0 Angel Echeverria, who delivers packages for Amazon, at home in Baldwin Park.

(Christina House / Christina House) Echeverria, the Los Angeles driver, reports to work at an Amazon facility in Commerce, where he loads a van up with boxes and then drives to a nearby gas station to fill his tank. Amazon gives him an Android phone with an app that\u00a0scans packages and determines his route. He says it is also used to track how much of a dent he\u2019s made in his delivery load that day.\u00a0 He has learned not to stop for lunch because, he said, Amazon employees will call his dispatcher at any point in the day if they notice that he\u2019s behind schedule. Echeverria said he eats on the road, usually scarfing down hot dogs and chips from 7-Eleven stores, which have Amazon lockers  that he often uses for deliveries. California law requires that businesses give\u00a030-minute lunch breaks and regular rest breaks to hourly workers who spend more than five hours on the job. If a customer calls Amazon to complain about not receiving a package that he was responsible for, Echeverria says he gets cited by the retailer. On Monday or Tuesday mornings, Echeverria says, his dispatcher at Inglewood-based LMS Transportation gathers drivers together and reads aloud the number of complaints each had the week before, from a weekly report provided by Amazon. \u201cTo put it out in front of everybody, you are being humiliated,\u201d Echeverria said. Raymond Rakshani,\u00a0a co-owner of LMS, said Amazon does provide a weekly report on complaints about each driver\u00a0and measures each driver in terms of \u201cdefects per million opportunities,\u201d a metric traditionally\u00a0used in manufacturing to keep tabs on each worker\u2019s\u00a0performance. Rakshani said Amazon does not want any individual driver to exceed a ratio of two complaints\u00a0 for every 1,000 packages they\u2019re tasked with delivering.\u00a0But he said that Amazon does not instruct LMS to fire drivers who have had a trend of high complaints. LMS independently starts a disciplinary process, he said, starting with retraining, if a driver has a high number of citations for two consecutive weeks. He disputed other details of the workday described by Echeverria. It\u2019s the LMS dispatcher\u2019s decision, not Amazon\u2019s, to call a driver in the middle of the day if he or she is behind on deliveries, Rakshani said; the dispatcher will communicate the tardiness to Amazon employees, not the other way around.\u00a0 Rakshani disputed that dispatchers read complaints for each driver aloud. \u201cIf it happens, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said, adding\u00a0that he tells managers to talk to drivers one-on-one. At the start of each day drivers are told by their managers that California law requires them to take 30-minute lunch breaks, he said, and at the end of each day they sign a statement acknowledging that they took lunch. He also questioned the idea that drivers would be admonished for failing to deliver  their entire loads. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he should be scolded,\u201d Rakshani said.\u00a0 Meticulously tracking drivers, hour by hour, is part of Amazon\u2019s broader obsession with speed, which has allowed it to turn week-long delivery times into days, and now hours. \u201cThey measure the heck out of them to make sure the delivery experience works well,\u201d Howard said. The company tracks how many missed, damaged or late deliveries each driver at each company has, said Howard, who, before founding Grand Junction,  was the CEO of an Oakland-based logistics company that delivered packages for Amazon. The company encourages couriers to fire drivers who have too many bad marks on their record, and terminates contracts with companies that have too many under-performing drivers, Howard said. But maintaining a tight grip on drivers may become legally risky for the company, said labor experts and plaintiffs lawyers. In 2015, the company started a service called Amazon Flex, which allows the company to contract directly with independent drivers and save the 30% of delivery costs that local couriers normally pocket, Howard said.

Gen. David Haight of the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) and U.S.  Army Maj. Darren Glenn of the 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) discuss solutions during an advising mission May 29 to Baraki Barak, Afghanistan. (Photo: Capt. John Landry, U.S. Army) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Army has stripped Maj. Gen. David Haight of three ranks, Army Secretary Eric Fanning said Friday,\u00a0following revelations contained in documents and interviews of Haight's decade-long extramarital affair and \u201cswinger lifestyle. A board of his peers called for Haight to be busted to lieutenant colonel, a demotion that will\u00a0cost him nearly $43,000 per year in pension pay. Fanning, in an interview, said he had\u00a0accepted the recommendation after a panel of three officers reviewed Haight's\u00a0conduct \u2014\u00a0and his secret second life \u2014\u00a0and determined that lieutenant colonel was the last rank in which he had served satisfactorily. Fanning spent hours discussing the case with other general officers and read the investigative report twice before accepting the recommendation, he said. \"He\u2019s going to be retired as a lieutenant colonel,\" Fanning said. \"Pretty big drop.\" Haight's attorney, Army Lt. Col. Sara Root, said Haight deeply regrets the affair but strenuously denies that it affected his service through multiple combat tours. \"He's 100% devoted to his country,\" Root said. \"He has sacrificed a lot for his country. He's not a threat to his country and would never do anything to harm it.\" Haight, a decorated infantry soldier and Army Ranger, had served as the director of operations for U.S. European Command until the spring. An Army investigation determined that he had had an 11-year long affair with Jennifer Armstrong, a government employee, and had misused his government cellphone to stay in contact with her. The Army reprimanded Haight \u2014 effectively ending his career \u2014\u00a0and hauled him back to Washington. He was placed in a job with few responsibilities while the board determined his rank for retirement. Haight had been allowed to maintain his clearance to view classified material until the day after USA TODAY published the story about his secret life, and had raised questions about his susceptibility to espionage. Root said Haight had never been targeted by spies and would never divulge national security secrets. If Haight had been allowed to retire as a two-star general with 30 years of service, he would have been paid about $122,800. Retirement as a lieutenant colonel drops that pension to about $79,800.

Courtesy of Garrett Boyte hide caption toggle caption St. Joseph, La., a town of about 1,100 people in northern Louisiana. Courtesy of Garrett Boyte Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has declared a Public Health Emergency for the town of St. Joseph, after officials found water going to three buildings \u2014 one of them the town hall \u2014 was contaminated with lead or copper. The governor said state testing showed elevated levels of lead at a private residence as well as the town hall building, on Thursday. The tests also showed \"elevated levels of copper\" at two private homes. The governor's office issued a statement warning residents of St. Joseph, which is home to about 1,100 people , not to use tap water: \"The Town of St. Joseph has experienced water problems for years due to the poorly maintained and deteriorating water distribution system. Frequent breaks in the water distribution system provide a potential health risk because of the drop in water pressure. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Louisiana Department of Health recommends that residents use an alternative source of water for personal consumption, including making ice, brushing teeth or using it for food preparation and rinsing of foods.\" Article continues after sponsorship The state's emergency preparedness office said it will provide three liters of water per day to each person in town until the state and local governments come up with \"a more permanent source\" of water while the current distribution system is repaired. Beyond Flint: In The South, Another Water Crisis Has Been Unfolding For Years Residents of St. Joseph have been concerned about the town's water quality for years, in part because it often doesn't look clean. In February, resident Garrett Boyte told NPR , \"It's just a given fact that at some point during the week, you're going to have brown or yellow water.\" Louisiana state health officer Jimmy Guidry told NPR in February, \"Like most small water systems, when you don't have many customers, it's very expensive and it's not affordable.\" He continued: \"It could take years. It's the kind of thing, which if you don't maintain it along the way, you're going to have to take care of it when it gets in trouble, and now it's in serious trouble. And it's going to be very costly to take care of those issues.\" \"What's happening here in St. Joseph got the attention it's gotten because Flint has made water a public issue,\" Boyte said, referring to the water crisis in Flint, Mich., where corrosive river water leached lead from pipes that delivered the supply to homes. This week marked one year since Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declared a state of emergency . Unfiltered tap water in the city is still not safe to drink. A Year Later, Unfiltered Flint Tap Water Is Still Unsafe To Drink On Friday, a federal appeals court ruled the Michigan government must continue to provide bottled water to Flint residents who do not have adequate water filters, after the state argued the water quality had improved to the point where it was no longer necessary, according to The Associated Press. Last week, Congress finally approved $170 million in aid to Flint, Steve Carmody of Michigan Public Radio reported , but \"city officials say they'll need tens of millions more to replace all of the city's lead pipes. The state says about 600 pipes have been replaced this year; at that rate it would take half a century to replace more than 30,000 suspect lines.\" ",

    "text": "President Obama Says Hillary Clinton Was Not 'Treated Fairly' During Presidential Election By MaryAlice Parks Dec 16, 2016, 6:41 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Obama Addresses Alleged Russian Interference in Election 0 Shares Email President Obama said today that he did not think Hillary Clinton was \u201ctreated fairly\u201d during the presidential election. Obama was asked specifically during a news conference whether his former secretary of state lost because of Russia\u2019s reported hacking of the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign computer servers. The president pivoted on that question, and instead lobbed a critique of the media. He said he found the coverage of Clinton \u201ctroubling.\u201d \u201cI think she's worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and I don't think she was treated fairly during the election, I think the coverage of her -- and the issues -- was troubling,\u201d he said. Clinton and her campaign in recent days have also expressed disappointment with news outlets' focus on her private email server during the campaign over Russia\u2019s involvement in the data breaches. Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta , called the coverage of the Russia story \u201clackadaisical,\u201d and Clinton last night reportedly told donors in New York that she was glad the press was catching onto the issue. Looking ahead, President Obama said that perhaps he can give \u201ccounsel and advice\u201d to the Democratic Party. \u201cThe question is how do we rebuild that party as a whole so that there's not a county in any state -- I don't care how red -- where we don't have a presence and we're not making the argument because I think we have the better argument,\u201d he said of the Democratic Party. He added that he would have liked to have helped more to build a national and successful party but struggled to contribute more time because of his primary responsibilities at the White House. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Glitch in Christmas Tree Lights Sets Fire That Kills Couple By The Associated Press SALT LAKE CITY \u0097 Dec 16, 2016, 4:11 PM ET 0 Shares Email A Utah couple died after faulty Christmas tree lights sparked a fire at their home of 49 years, authorities said. The fire started Thursday night in a front room of the house in Woods Cross, about 10 miles north of Salt Lake City, according to South Davis Metro Fire spokesman Jeff Bassett. Investigators believe the husband and wife used a fire extinguisher to try to put out the flames but they were overcome by smoke, Bassett said. Bassett said the couple, 74-year-old Melba Mecham and 77-year-old Gary Mecham were unconscious when firefighters pulled them from the home. Rescue workers tried to save the Mechams but the couple died at a hospital. Bassett said neighbors had called 911 and tried to rescue the couple but the front door was too hot to open, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Neighbors say the Mechams had lived at the home for 49 years. Bassett said the couple had mentioned to others they had been having trouble with the lights, which came prewrapped to their artificial tree. Smoke and chemicals from the burning artificial tree likely overwhelmed the couple, while Christmas presents and logs for their fireplace stacked near the tree added fuel to the fire, investigators said. \"We're talking a hot, thick black smoke that was to the floor,\" Bassett said, according to the Deseret News. \"Extremely difficult, zero visibility.\" Neighbor Karen Gay Davis remembered Melba Mecham as someone who gave creative Christmas gifts to neighbors. Her husband was a former upholsterer who was quiet and witty, neighbor Irene Bonner told the Salt Lake Tribune. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "An Intel advertisement on a Hewlett-Packard desktop computer in 2012. Paul Sakuma/AP hide caption toggle caption An Intel advertisement on a Hewlett-Packard desktop computer in 2012. Paul Sakuma/AP California is the first state to adopt efficiency standards for computers and monitors, the state's energy commission announced this week. The commission approved regulations that limit the amount of energy computers and small servers can use when they are idling, asleep or turned off. The regulations for monitors will also limit the amount of energy the apparatus uses when it is turned on. \"It's common sense that electronic equipment ought to consume a minimal amount of energy when it is not being used,\" energy commissioner Andrew McAllister said in a statement . The commission estimates computers and monitors in the state use more than 5,600 gigawatt-hours of electricity . That's up to 3 percent of residential electricity use and 7 percent of commercial use. Tech Leaders Seek Computer Efficiency The limits will go into effect over the course of three years, starting with regulations on small-scale servers and office workstation computers beginning Jan. 1, 2018. When all the regulations are in effect, the commission estimates the electricity cost savings for the state \"could save consumers an estimated $373 million annually.\" The regulations will cause the prices of computers and monitors to go up, the commission acknowledges. It estimates laptop computers will increase by $1, and desktops by less than $10. Most laptop computers already comply with the new standards, according to a commission report . Monitors will go up by about $5 and workstation computers, which are usually more expensive than regular desktops, are expected to increase in cost by about $13. The commission believes the overall savings, if consumers factor in the energy costs of owning a less energy-intensive machine, will outweigh the upfront price increases. Article continues after sponsorship The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that while the regulations apply only to computers in California, \"the sheer size of the state's share of the computer market is so formidable \u2014 California by itself accounts for 25 million computer monitors, 23 million laptops and 21 million desktops \u2014 the new standards will have ripple effects across the country and beyond.\" \"It will have a global impact and significantly change the way future energy-efficient desktops and all-in-one computers are designed and manufactured,\" Andrea Deveau, vice president at the trade group TechNet, told the paper. TechNet's members include Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Cisco, Microsoft and Google. \"It was never taken lightly and it is definitely an historic rule-making,\" Deveau said. Some 'Energy Star' Appliances May Not Be That Green There is no mandatory federal energy efficiency standard for electronics. Since 2009, a joint Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy program has offered a voluntary efficiency certification known as Energy Star. That program includes optional standards for computers. A spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, Amber Pasricha Beck, told NPR the new state regulations for 17- to 20-inch monitors are slightly more stringent than the most recent Energy Star standards, and significantly more stringent for 20- to 30-inch monitors. As for desktops, where the state hopes to make the most significant energy efficiency gains for computers, the baseline state standards are more stringent than the voluntary federal standards, Beck said. For notebook computers, the state and current federal standard are about the same. ",

    "text": "on YouTube His parents were concerned about him that morning and followed him to school after discovering their missing weapons, police said. They heard the shot and disarmed him at Mueller Park Junior High School in Bountiful, about 11 miles north of Salt Lake City. No one was hurt, but the incident put the school on lockdown and sent hundreds of parents rushing to the school to find out what happened. Late Thursday afternoon, the Bountiful Police Department released the body camera footage from the first officer arriving at the school. The video shows the officer running through empty school hallways before finding someone holding the boy against a wall, with the teen\u2019s arms pinned behind his back. CBS affiliate KUTV reports \u00a0the person holding the boy is his father, with his mother nearby. The woman is seen apparently placing a shotgun and a handgun on the ground. As the officer cuffs the boy, the father can be seen pulling a package of ammunition out of the boy\u2019s bag. The video does not show the voice or face of the teen or faces of the boy\u2019s parents. Police said they redacted parts of the footage to protect the boy\u2019s identity because he is a minor. The footage shows the officer handcuffing the teen and asking if anyone else is involved. It\u2019s not clear if or how the teen answered. The boy appeared by video during a detention hearing Thursday\u00a0in which Davis County Deputy Attorney Ryan Perkins said prosecutors want to try the teen as an adult. The teenager seemed stoic during the brief hearing. The Associated Press is not naming him because of his age. The boy is charged with two counts of felony theft of a firearm; one count of felony discharge of a firearm; and two counts of misdemeanor possession of a short-barreled shotgun on school premises. A brief narrative of the events that accompanies the charges offered no new information about the incident. The boy\u2019s attorney, Lindsay Jarvis, told Juvenile Judge Mark Andrus that she plans to request a psychological evaluation of the boy. The teen has no previous history with the juvenile court system, court officials said. After he fired one shot into the ceiling, leaving a hole the size of a small plate, the boy didn\u2019t say a word as a teacher and one of 26 students tried to talk him out of firing again, said police, relying on interviews with other kids in the class. That pause gave the boy\u2019s parents a few extra seconds to arrive at the classroom and take him into the hallway. Bountiful Police Chief Tom Ross applauded the parents for recognizing something was off with their son and taking action, though he declined to provide specifics on what the parents noticed. Prosecutors declined comment about whether the parents could face charges in the incident. The boy is scheduled to be back in court on Dec. 22. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Pat McCrory has signed a measure limiting the powers of his soon-to-be Democratic successor, Roy Cooper, a move critics are calling an unprecedented power grab orchestrated by the state's Republican-controlled legislature. The bill McCrory signed on Friday merges the State Board of Elections and State Ethics Commission into one entity comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans. Previous state law would have allowed Cooper to put a majority of Democrats on the board, which sets the rules for the state's notoriously burdensome balloting .

Protesters packed the halls of the General Assembly Friday as lawmakers voted on another bill that would require Senate confirmation for cabinet appointments. The state Senate voted to approve that measure Friday afternoon, sending it back to the state House for final consideration. At least 16 people were arrested Friday, according to General Assembly police. The series of measures were introduced in a surprise move Wednesday during a special session ostensibly called by the General Assembly to consider relief for Hurricane Matthew victims. Lawmakers did indeed approve a $201 million aid package earlier in the day, but then moved onto the legislation aimed at curbing the power of Cooper, who beat Republican McCrory last month by about 10,000 votes. McCrory did not concede until last week -- a full month after voters cast their ballots -- following numerous failed attempts to lodge complaints about the election results. No evidence of widespread voting fraud ever came to light. In his first national television interview since winning the gubernatorial contest, Cooper told MSNBC's Chuck Todd Thursday that the legislature's action was a \"partisan power grab that goes far beyond political power.\" Play ",

Ramon Cortines, in cap, center, with L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, right, L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck, background, and school board President Steve Zimmer during LAUSD's one-day shutdown on Dec. 14, 2015. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Howard Blume Contact Reporter An internal report on last year's unprecedented one-day shutdown of Los Angeles schools due to a terrorist threat reveals a confused chain of command among school district and city officials that hampered their ability to quickly and decisively evaluate the risk. In the end, district officials made a cautious decision regarding the threat, which turned out to be a hoax, as\u00a0was suspected very early on. New York City schools received the same emailed threat and remained open . Once the decision to close L.A.\u2019s schools was made, the process of shutting down the nation\u2019s second-largest school system,\u00a0which affected the daily routines of more than a million people, unfolded with remarkable smoothness and calm: School buses turned around or never left the garage. Employees went home or stayed home. Students and parents made contingency plans. The media and officials got out the word. Officers walked through nearly 1,000 campuses. But part of this success was due to the fact that no real emergency existed. The report acknowledges serious logistical\u00a0problems outside of public view that could have mattered in an actual crisis. The report, released in response to a Los Angeles\u00a0Times public records request, affirms that law enforcement and district officials acted quickly to confront the threat, bringing impressive resources to bear. But  outside law enforcement agencies also stepped aside over the question of whether schools should be closed, leaving\u00a0the decision\u00a0to school officials\u00a0who lacked any\u00a0training\u00a0to evaluate the danger. The district\u00a0also was in the middle of a leadership transition, which hampered the decision-making.\u00a0L.A. schools Supt. Ramon Cortines was on the verge of retirement\u00a0and\u00a0had turned over day-to-day control to his second-in-command, Michelle King\u00a0(who, about a month later, would be named his successor).\u00a0This unsettled situation crucially affected how events played out. Cortines was not even notified of the threat until 4:55 a.m., nearly seven hours after it was known, at which point he had to make an instant call just before the start of the school day. \u201cIn hindsight, it would have been prudent to brief other key district executive staff and the superintendent of schools in the early stages of the investigation to better allow for administrative and operational considerations,\u201d the report concludes in something of an understatement.\u00a0 The report does not state\u00a0when King first was notified or explain what, if any, attempts were made to reach her. The language of the report relies\u00a0repeatedly on passive-voice construction, making it impossible to determine exactly who made important decisions within L.A. Unified.\u00a0The Times has pieced together additional details through interviews with key players.\u00a0 The drama began at 10:01 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 14, when school board President Steve Zimmer received the emailed threat . He happened to be on his computer at the time, and he did not know that the threat had also been sent to other past and current board members and to the New York City school system. \u201cI am emailing you to inform you of the happenings on Tuesday, 12/15/15,\u201d the email began. \u201cSomething big is going down. Something very big. It will make national headlines. Perhaps, even international ones.\u201d The email then\u00a0spoke of\u00a0a desire to\u00a0avenge\u00a0bullying suffered for being a Muslim. The sender vowed\u00a0to detonate pressure-cooker bombs\u00a0hidden in backpacks, release nerve gas at lunchtime and launch assaults by\u00a0more than 30 people\u00a0armed with \u201cKalashnikov rifles, Glock 18 machine pistols, and multiple handheld grenades.\u201d At 10:17 p.m., Zimmer notified school police Chief Steven K. Zipperman. Zipperman\u00a0notified the Los Angeles Police Department 11 minutes later. By 10:41 p.m., LAPD\u2019s major crimes unit and the FBI were involved. Early on,\u00a0\u201cthe objective was to identify the sender and source before the beginning of the school day,\u201d the report states. \u201cWhile the threat \u2018as a whole\u2019 appeared unlikely, portions of the threat were concerning.\u201d Posturing aside, there was fear\u00a0that a \u201clone wolf\u201d was out there, intent on doing harm days after\u00a0the terror attack\u00a0that killed 14 people in San Bernardino. By 2:30 a.m., computer technicians and law enforcement investigators determined that the threat came from an overseas server, apparently in Germany,\u00a0although it could have been routed there from someone in the United States seeking to cover their tracks. If so, the strategy apparently worked because the FBI still has made no arrests.\u00a0 Even though the report avoids the topic, it is clear based on interviews that Zimmer and\u00a0Zipperman played instrumental roles, including in the delay in notifying Cortines.\u00a0 \u201cFor me,\u00a0the urgency was to get it into the hands of law enforcement and certainly to be there to convey my urgency and concern,\u201d Zimmer told The Times.\u00a0\u201cUntil their determination was that we were going to have to make a decision about shutting down all the schools, I did not think we had to wake the superintendent up in the middle of the night.\u201d Zimmer also acknowledged his limitations in evaluating\u00a0the situation: \u201cThis type of threat I have no ability to assess. I had no expertise to offer whatsoever and no ability to really make a determination of do you wake up the superintendent.\u201d King first appears in the district\u2019s timeline as part of a conference call with Zipperman and Zimmer at 4:41 a.m., although it is likely she already had been notified. King declined to be interviewed about\u00a0the incident after it occurred, and a district representative\u00a0said\u00a0she was not immediately available Friday. \u00a0 \u201cBased on the conference call, it was decided that in the best interest of the safety of the students and staff of the LAUSD, all school sites should be checked prior to any students or staff entering,\u201d the report reads.\u00a0\u201cBecause of the scope and magnitude of the final recommendation to check all schools, a districtwide \u2018shutdown\u2019 was the only option.\u201d At this point, police agencies were not willing to completely discredit the threat\u00a0or tell the district what to do. Zimmer said he began to realize, along with King and Zipperman, that the decision was going to fall to the district. King had the authority to cancel school, but the triumvirate decided to defer to Cortines. The situation unfolded differently in New York City, where ultimate authority rested with the mayor, who compelled his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, to make a decision based on the chief\u2019s expertise. Bratton decided no school shutdown was necessary.\u00a0 In L.A.,\u00a0Cortines awoke to a conference call that included Zimmer, King, Zipperman and LAPD Asst. Chief Earl Paysinger, according to interviews. Paysinger offered no advice on what to do, said Cortines. His role, apparently, was simply to offer support for what Cortines decided. \u201cThey talked about involvement of the FBI,\u201d said Cortines. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018This is still under investigation.\u2019 Those are the words they used with me.\u201d \u201cTime was against me,\u201d Cortines said.\u00a0\u201cThe starting of the buses were against me. I knew I had to do something quickly if I was going to do something.\u201d There also was peril in excessive caution. A clumsy effort to close schools would be embarrassing, and the district stood to lose $30 million for the lost day of student attendance. (The state later waived that penalty.) Over the course of the day, the usually\u00a0dapper Cortines, in sneakers and a yellow cap,\u00a0became\u00a0the face of steady\u00a0leadership, backed literally and figuratively by a phalanx of city and law enforcement officials.\u00a0 But things were less smooth than they appeared. Although L.A. Unified has been praised for its rapid responses to crises, it wasn\u2019t fully prepared to shut down the entire system.\u00a0 \u201cThe [school police] lacked an adequate standing response plan.\u201d the report states.\u00a0 Technical problems\u00a0also\u00a0limited the scope of the automated messages that went out. Cafeteria staff reported to their assignments. The district could not track the locations of its 1,300 school buses. At the emergency center,\u00a0\u201cresponders experienced difficulty logging into various district systems,\u201d which were slow and suffered from \u201cintermittently lost connections,\u201d the report states.\u00a0Too many people, eager to help, flooded the command center. \u201cSome computers\u00a0crashed, some computers ran slowly, conference calling failed to work, and only one-third of the people\u201d in the emergency center had access to\u00a0computers, the report said.\u00a0 District staff has addressed some of the problems and is looking into funding for other fixes, according to the partially redacted\u00a0report, which was dated Oct. 4 and prepared by Zipperman and Associate Supt. Earl R. Perkins. After the all-clear notice was given, after the emergency center had shut down, one more problem emerged late that evening. Milk and bread\u00a0deliveries for the next day had never been made to cafeterias on the shutdown day. These deliveries usually happen\u00a0in daylight hours for safety reasons. A weary police force reassembled and escorted food trucks to their destinations. The following morning , when students returned to school, their breakfast was waiting for them.

An Uber self-driving car is displayed in a garage in San Francisco. (Eric Risberg/Associated Press) David Pierson Uber said it will continue to operate its self-driving cars in San Francisco despite demands from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to cease its program or face legal action. In a call with reporters Friday, Anthony Levandowski, Uber\u2019s vice president for self-driving technology, argued that the ride-hailing giant\u2019s newest cars shouldn\u2019t be regulated like autonomous vehicles because they still require human drivers in case of emergency. In essence, Uber\u2019s new fleet of taxis should be treated the same as Tesla, Levandowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why the DMV would seek to require self-driving Ubers to get permits when it accepts that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology does not need them,\u201d he\u00a0said. The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a tersely worded letter addressed to Levandowski on Friday, the attorney from the California Department of Justice ordered Uber to remove its self-driving cars from the state\u2019s roadways until it complies with state rules. \u201cIf Uber cannot advise the undersigned that it will immediately remove its self-driving vehicles from California public roadways until it obtains the appropriate permit, as 20 other companies have done, the Attorney General will seek injunctive and other appropriate relief,\u201d the letter said. It is not unusual for Uber to launch a new program without consulting regulators. A self-driving truck rolled out in Nevada also caught the ire of the DMV there after a promotional video surfaced showing one of the vehicles rolling down a highway without a driver behind the wheel.\u00a0 \u201cReal-world testing on public roads is essential both to gain public trust and improve the technology over time,\u201d Levandowski said. John M Simpson, privacy project director with Consumer Watchdog, was angered by Uber's decision to flout the DMV's demand. \"It's an outrageously irresponsible position,\" Simpson said. \"The DMV should immediately seek an injunction and Uber's executives should be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible under the law.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Visiting Downtown Disney?

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Dec 16, 2016 5:00 PM EST President Obama began his final end-of-year press conference by touting all of the achievements his administration has made over the last eight years and then told reporters that the White House handled Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. election in the right way.\u00a0 President Obama on Russian hacks, Syria and more Mr. Obama said that wages have grown over his two terms, Obamacare has provided healthcare insurance to thousands of Americans and it\u2019s led to businesses creating millions of jobs. The president said he cut deficits by nearly two-thirds and he cut down the U.S. troop size overseas and Osama bin Laden has been killed. Russian hacking of the U.S. election The president was asked if he was prepared to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin by name for ordering a cyber attack against the U.S. election and whether he agrees with Hillary Clinton\u2019s assertion that \u00a0Russian hacking contributed to her loss.\u00a0 \u201cBased on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC and that as a consequence, it is important for us to review all elements of that and to make sure that we are preventing that kind of interference from cyber attacks in the future,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cMy hope is that the president-elect is going to be similarly concerned that we aren\u2019t going to have foreign interference in our election process.\u201d Obama vows to retaliate for U.S. election interference The president then explained that the White House didn\u2019t reveal what Russia\u2019s motives were before the election or that the administration didn\u2019t respond more forcefully because he didn\u2019t want to contribute to the \u201chyper-partisan atmosphere.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI wanted to make sure that we were playing this thing straight...imagine if we had done the opposite...it would have become immediately just one more political scrum,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we handled it the way it should have been handled.\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Obama said that he pulled Putin aside at a conference in China in early September to tell him to \u201ccut it out\u201d and the president said the U.S. did not see further tampering of the election.\u00a0 He was asked later on whether he would declassify evidence that proves Russia was responsible. \u201cWe will provide evidence that we can safely provide that does not compromise sources and methods,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know.\u201d Pressed on whether he absolutely believed Putin authorized the hacks, Mr. Obama responded that \u201cThe intelligence that I\u2019ve seen gives me great confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack - the hack of the DNC, and the hack of John Podesta.\u201d Evidence, he said, was provided in a closed session on a bipartisan basis to him and leaders of Congress, including the chairs and ranking members of relevant committees.\u00a0 He added that the hack \u201chappened at the highest level\u201d of the Russian government, noting that \u201cnot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis is a pretty hierarchical operation,\u201d he said. \u201cLast I checked, there\u2019s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation particularly when it comes to policies directed at the United States.\u201d\u00a0 When asked whether he believes Donald Trump\u2019s social media responses to the reports on Russian hacking emboldened the Kremlin, the president urged some caution before criticizing his successor.\u00a0 \u201cI think the president elect is still in transition mode from campaign to governance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you\u2019re not in power as when you\u2019re in power.\u201d Mr. Obama further called on the president-elect to choose a unifying path forward on the issue, saying it would be wise to \u201cwelcome a bipartisan process\u201d of investigating the election to ensure the preservation of democracy\u2019s cornerstone.\u00a0 A senior administration official said this week that the U.S. has \u201chigh confidence\u201d \u200ethat it was the G.R.U. -- Russia\u2019s largest intelligence agency -- that conducted the hacking of the DNC and DCCC with the goal of giving an advantage to Donald Trump . \u00a0Further, officials say they are convinced that the hacking that plagued the DNC was approved by Putin. Sources confirmed to CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues this week that they believe Putin was aware of attacks that began in July of last year. \u00a0 In an interview with NPR that aired early Friday morning, the president said that \u201cthere is no doubt that when any\u00a0 foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections , that we need to take action and we will -- at a time and a place of our own choosing.\u201d And \u201csome of it may be...explicit and publicized,\u201d he continued. \u201cSome of it may not be.\u201d Future of the Democratic party The president weighed in on the future of the Democratic party, urging liberals to expand their horizons -- even into red states -- when it comes to winning over voters. \u201cHow do we make sure we are showing up in places where democratic policies are needed, where they\u2019re helping?\u201d Mr. Obama asked. He pointed to his own campaigns in the past and what he did to win them, saying he won his U.S. Senate seat in Illinois by \u201cgoing to fish fries and sitting in VFW halls and talking to farmers.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t win every one of their votes, but they got a sense of who I was,\u201d he said, noting that his own family\u2019s history \u201cwasn\u2019t all that different from theirs even if I looked a little bit different.\u201d The president expressed regret that he was unable on the whole to transfer his own grassroots campaign success to down-ticket candidates, especially during midterms. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I would have liked to have done more of, but it\u2019s kind of hard to do when you\u2019re dealing with all kinds of issues\u201d in the White House, he said. Still, he added, \u201cI could not be prouder of the coalition I put together in each of my campaigns, because it was inclusive.\u201d Asked to weigh in on the race for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, where Labor Secretary Tom Perez is a contender, the president said he was glad he didn\u2019t \u201chave a vote in this.\u00a0 He did, however, comment on some of the candidates, which he said were \u201calso my friends and are fine people as well.\u201d Of Perez, Mr. Obama called him \u201cone of the best secretaries of labor in our history.\u201d \u201cHe is tireless,\u201d he said. He is wicked smart. He has been able to work across the spectrum of, you know, labor, business, activists. He has produced.\u201d \u201cWhoever leads the DNC, and any candidate with the Democratic brand going forward, I want them to feel as if they can reach out and find that common ground,\u201d he said. Aleppo, Syria: \u201cI cannot claim that we have been successful.\u201d Asked if he felt personally responsible for the atrocities in Aleppo, Syria during the country\u2019s civil war, Mr. Obama said he has \u201calways\u201d felt responsible. \u201cBecause of my office, because I\u2019m president of the United States, I feel responsible,\u201d he said, adding that the same applies for domestic issues as well as international conflicts. Specifically on actions that can be taken in Syria, Mr. Obama said he has \u201ctaken the best course I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States.\u201d Aleppo evacuations halted after attack \u201cI understand the impulse to want to do something\u201d in Aleppo and Syria as a whole, the president said. \u201cIt sounded like the right thing to do -- but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap.\u201d At the same time, he said of the U.S. approach in Syria: \u201cI cannot claim that we have been successful.\u201d On establishing a safe zone in Syria, the president said it would be very difficult to do. \u201cThat requires some force that is willing to maintain that territory in the absence of consent from the Syrian government -- and now the Russians or the Iranians,\u201d he said. A free and fair election? Mr. Obama was asked if he can assure the public that the election was \u201cfree and fair.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was a concern and will continue to be a concern going forward,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with. That assurance, I can provide.\u201d\u00a0 Russian influence and U.S. foreign policy The president was asked if he\u2019s concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin and about his pick for secretary of state: Rex Tillerson.\u00a0 \u201cThe Russians can\u2019t change us or significantly weaken us,\u201d he said, adding that the Russian economy doesn\u2019t produce anything that consumers want except oil, gas and arms.\u00a0 \u201cThey can impact us if we lose track of who we are,\u201d he said. They can impact us if we abandon our values,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Mr. Obama then appeared to make a thinly veiled criticism of Mr. Trump. He said that Putin can weaken the U.S. if Americans buy into notions that \u201cit\u2019s okay to intimidate the press\u201d or \u201clock up dissidents\u201d or \u201cdiscriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like.\u201d Revisiting the \u201cOne China\u201d policy The president was asked if the \u201cOne China\u201d policy needs a fresh set of eyes or whether Mr. Trump\u2019s approach -- taking a call from Taiwan\u2019s leader -- would set the U.S. on a collision course geopolitically. \u201cI\u2019m somewhere in-between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think it should be not just the prerogative but obligation of a new president to examine what makes sense and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d President-elect's comments may lead to frayed ties with China Mr. Obama said that there\u2019s no bilateral relationship \u201cthat carries more significant\u201d than between the U.S. and China. He said that Mr. Trump needs to understand what the consequences would be of up-ending the \u201cOne China\u201d policy. The president advised Mr. Trump broadly, \u201cAcross the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you are doing it in a systematic, deliberate and intentional way.\u201d\u00a0 The Electoral College Calling the Electoral College a \u201cvestige\u201d and a \u201ccarryover\u201d from the time of the founding fathers, the president discussed the recent debate over electors and their usefulness.\u00a0 \u201cThere are some structures in our political system as envisioned by the founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is if we have a strong message if we\u2019re speaking to what the American people care about, typically the popular vote and the Electoral College vote will align.\u201d When pressed on whether he would allow electors to receive an intelligence briefing before they gathered for a vote next week, Mr. Obama said that he would not wade into that issue. \u201cIt is not my job to decide my successor,\u201d he said. \u201cI have provided people with a lot of information about what happened during the course of the election but more importantly, the candidates have talked about their beliefs and their vision for America.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

County firefighters rushed to El Monte after 5 a.m. to rescue two homeless women stranded on an island in the San Gabriel River where it meets the 60 Freeway. Joseph Serna Contact Reporter An overnight rainstorm that wreaked havoc on Southern California\u2019s roads, freeways and foothills will make way for a cold and blustery weekend that could bring snow and ice to the Grapevine, the National Weather Service said Friday. A winter weather advisory issued for the Southland -- from the Cuyama Valley in San Luis Obispo County to Los Angeles County\u2019s inland mountains \u2014 warned that temperatures may drop below freezing at elevations as low as 2,500 feet. A combination of \u00a0\u201cstrong winds, icy roadways, and dangerous wind chill readings will bring the potential for treacherous driving conditions through Saturday morning across the north facing slopes of ...\u00a0local mountains \u2026 including Interstate 5 near the Grapevine,\u201d the advisory said. One to three inches of snow may fall in the Tejon Pass area, where winds could gust up to 55 mph, said weather specialist Bonnie Bartling. \u201cTravel could be dicey there,\u201d Bartling said. How to drive in the rain Here\u00a0are\u00a0some tips on how to drive safely in rainy\u00a0weather. Here\u00a0are\u00a0some tips on how to drive safely in rainy\u00a0weather. See more videos Drivers going through the Grapevine and other Southern California\u00a0mountain roads are urged to carry emergency supplies such as extra water, flashlights, blankets and snow chains. At lower elevations the forecast is only slightly better, Bartling said. Temperatures are expected to drop into the low 30s in Los Angeles County\u00a0valleys and hover in the low 40s along the coast and downtown Friday night. Saturday evening is predicted to be even colder, she said. The forecast promises a second night of difficult driving conditions for many Southern California motorists. Rain that moved in Thursday night and ended Friday closed a major traffic route to Los Angeles International Airport and closed the 110 Freeway near South Pasadena, authorities said. It also helped to collapse an ivy-draped wall onto several cars in Cudahy. The storm, which also prompted the rescue of two women in the San Gabriel River,\u00a0began in San Luis Obispo County the previous afternoon and dumped\u00a0more than five inches of rain there in 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service. By Friday morning, the storm\u00a0had moved into Los Angeles County, pouring well over an inch of rain in the mountains, valleys and downtown. The downpour was heavy enough that it triggered a minor mud flow in Duarte, where two brush fires had torn through the foothills earlier this year. The mud flow forced the closure of Valley View Elementary School. Commuters heading to LAX in the morning were forced to avoid La Cienega Boulevard where it meets Fairview Boulevard, after more than a foot of water filled the street and forced the Los Angeles Police Department to close the area, police said. Meanwhile, the muddy westbound 210 Freeway transition to the northbound 5 Freeway was closed\u00a0through the morning after a big rig turned on its side, the California Highway Patrol said. The CHP also closed the 110 Freeway in both directions near\u00a0South Pasadena\u00a0after a massive lake formed between York Boulevard and Via Marisol, Caltrans reported. \u201cThey\u2019re having some tough times out there,\u201d said CHP Officer Peter Nicholson. The rain\u00a0also brought a slew of big rig accidents, one of them fatal, to Los Angeles-area freeways and triggered at least one swift-water rescue. La Cienega Boulevard closed due to flooding Commuters heading to LAX in the morning were forced to avoid La Cienega Boulevard where it meets Fairview Boulevard. Commuters heading to LAX in the morning were forced to avoid La Cienega Boulevard where it meets Fairview Boulevard. One person was killed when a big rig overturned on the transition road from the westbound 105 Freeway to the northbound 710 Freeway in Paramount, said California Highway Patrol Officer Dion Conley. But as fast as authorities could\u00a0clear freeway lanes, wayward drivers clogged them up again. \u201cOn the way to work I passed three spin-outs,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff happening out there.\u201d Highlighting the troubles Southern California drivers have with the rain, Nicholson said there were 165 collisions reported between 7 p.m. and midnight Thursday in Los Angeles County,\u00a0when the rain had arrived. There were only 54 crashes during the same time period last week when it was dry, he said. Meanwhile, about 40 L.A. County firefighters rushed to El Monte after 5 a.m. to rescue two homeless women stranded on an island in the San Gabriel River where it meets the 60 Freeway, authorities said. Footage from news outlets showed the women were hoisted into an L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department helicopter. Also evacuated from the raging waters was a bucket-load of five shivering Chihuahua puppies. Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Visiting Downtown Disney?

That\u2019s despite assurances from the Southern California Gas C ompany , which has investigated complaints and ruled out the possibility of a leak. Ms. Clayton-Tarvin talked about the area\u2019s layout of gas lines, the trajectory of the smell\u2019s spread and her sense in the odor of a hint of mercaptan \u2014 a natural gas additive. \"The smell that I smell,\u201d she said, \u201cis the natural gas smell.\u201d Other residents wonder about offshore oil platforms, or perhaps the shipping vessels arriving into the nearby ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. \u201cMy theory, which is based mainly on the process of elimination, is that it is oil tankers off the coast releasing pressure,\u201d Ms. Deaton said.

Tax records show the family of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave thousands of dollars to this and other settlements. A photograph from October shows part of the Jewish settlement of Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. Tax records show the family of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, gave thousands of dollars to this and other settlements. (AP) Tracy Wilkinson and Joshua Mitnick Contact Reporter Here in the desert hills of the\u00a0West Bank, near\u00a0the Palestinians\u2019 principal city of\u00a0Ramallah, a group of Orthodox Jews has\u00a0built the town of Beit El, a place\u00a0that most of the world considers an illegal\u00a0settlement constructed on\u00a0occupied Palestinian land. For decades, U.S. policy has opposed such settlements as harmful to the peace process. But the\u00a0Israeli\u00a0settlers now have some well-placed American supporters. Funds\u00a0to help construct Beit El came\u00a0partly from a U.S.-based foundation run by President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner , and the Kushner\u00a0family. And David Friedman, Trump\u2019s long-time real estate lawyer who was named Thursday as the next U.S. ambassador to Israel, served as the president of the American Friends of Beit El foundation. His name is on a girls\u2019 school in the settlement in tribute to his support. The amounts given by the Kushners were small; $5,000 here, $10,000 there, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. But they constitute another piece in the puzzle of how\u00a0the\u00a0Trump administration will approach one of the Middle East\u2019s most\u00a0intractable conflicts. There are growing signs that\u00a0Trump is poised to upend\u00a0decades of U.S. foreign policy on dealing with Israelis and Palestinians,\u00a0giving Israel a freer hand to build settlements\u00a0and relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Debate over Russian hacking heats up; Obama promises retaliation Dec. 16, 2016, 12:52 p.m. This is our look at President-elect Donald Trump's transition and the outgoing Obama administration: President Obama says the U.S. will retaliate against Russia , but actions may be secret Some Jewish groups... (Tracy Wilkinson) Several of Trump\u2019s advisers have said they do not regard settlements as illegitimate or obstacles to peace. Unlike President Obama , who pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to temporarily freeze some settlement construction on land seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, Trump appears less likely to pressure Israel to constrain its building. \u201cI think it is safe to say that we will see diminished American efforts to promote traditional diplomacy, traditional critique of Israeli settlement activity or the need to resume some peace process with the Palestinians,\u201d said Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. At the same time, Trump said in an interview with the New York Times that he would \u201clove\u201d to be the president who finally made peace between Israel and the Palestinians; he has said it would be the \u201cultimate deal.\u201d Trump even went so far as to say Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, might serve as a special envoy to the Middle East to work on Israeli-Palestinian issues \u2014 a prospect many consider preposterous given the younger Kushner\u2019s lack of diplomatic experience and because he would be seen as biased in favor of Israel. Trump has also said he would move the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something almost no country in the world has done because Jerusalem is disputed. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians claim it, or part of it, as their capital, and the U.S. position for decades has been that its status must be resolved through negotiations. Past U.S. presidents\u00a0made similar pledges about relocating the U.S. embassy. But upon taking office, all concluded such a step would not only provoke Palestinians, but also unsettle Arab allies throughout the region. After his appointment was announced,\u00a0Friedman stated he looked forward to forging the U.S. bond with Israel \"from the U.S. embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem.\u201d Friedman also has voiced opposition to\u00a0the so-called two-state solution, the existence of an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side by side in peace, which has been\u00a0the basis of U.S. policy since the 1950s\u00a0and the framework for peace negotiations in that part of the world.\u00a0At a Jerusalem election rally shortly before the U.S. election, he vowed that a Trump administration would never pressure Israel to accept a Palestinian state. Such assertions explain why several U.S. Jewish groups reacted negatively to Friedman\u2019s selection.\u00a0Friedman\u2019s positions on the two-state solution \"foreclose on the possibility of advancing,\" Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, said in an interview. By abandoning the two-state solution, \u201cthey\u2019re saying they are not bound by the last 25 years\u201d of history,\u00a0said Michael Koplow, policy director of the Israel\u00a0Policy Forum, a liberal think tank that focuses on Israel. Dennis Ross, veteran diplomat who served as Middle East envoy in Republican and Democratic administrations, cautioned that Trump will not be able to write\u00a0off\u00a0the Palestinians altogether if a real resolution is to come about. \u201cThe first thing is you have to restore a sense of possibility,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThere is no sense of possibility on either side now.\u201d Violence between Israelis and Palestinians has diminished since the end of the last major uprising more than a decade ago. But both\u00a0sides worry that any major shifts in the\u00a0status quo, such as the relocation of the U.S. embassy, a\u00a0marked increase in settlement construction or a move by Israel to annex West Bank territory, could trigger renewed Palestinian protests or terror attacks. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat\u00a0warned Trump against upsetting the fragile status quo, which was achieved through previous rounds of negotiations. \u201cThese are issues agreed to in an American-sponsored, international-sponsored\u00a0peace process \u2026 and no one should take any decisions which may preempt or prejudge, because this will be the destruction of the peace process as a whole.\u201d Successive Israeli governments, and especially that of the hawkish Netanyahu,\u00a0have allowed a vast network of settlements to develop throughout the West Bank and in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem. More than half a million Jewish Israelis now live in settlements, according to Israeli government figures. Few issues anger Palestinians\u00a0more than settlements, which they see as crisscrossing the land they claim as their state and making territorial continuity of their future state impossible. Past U.S. presidents \u2014\u00a0both Republican and Democratic \u2014 have criticized settlement expansion, with especially pointed words coming recently from Obama, who famously does not get along with Netanyahu, in part because of the landmark deal to curtail Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear armament. Netanyahu argues that Iran cannot be trusted and poses a major threat to Israel. Despite the criticism, the United States in September agreed to a $38-billion, 10-year package of military assistance to Israel, the largest single pledge of security aid in U.S. history.\u00a0 Israeli settlers are hoping to make inroads during the Trump administration.\u00a0At Beit El,\u00a0Baruch Gordon, a fundraiser for the settlement, described\u00a0Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father,\u00a0as a \"very good friend\" of the settlement and one of its top supporters. \"Charlie and his wife are wonderful people,'' he said. He said he had not met Jared. On a recent\u00a0Friday\u00a0before Shabbat, yeshiva students poured over religious texts inside a brand new study hall, a beit midrash. It and its small campus were erected with contributions from the\u00a0U.S. foundation, American\u00a0Friends of Beit El Yeshiva Center,\u00a0which lists the Charles Kushner as a founding trustee of its annual fundraising gala.\u00a0 Through its own U.S. charity, Beit El is one of several Jewish settlements that has received money from the Kushner Foundation in recent years, according to IRS\u00a0filings.

Matt Rourke/AP hide caption toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Hillary Clinton spoke at a private event Thursday night. Pictured here, the Democratic presidential candidate walks off the stage after speaking in New York on Nov. 9. Matt Rourke/AP Hillary Clinton has kept a low profile since losing the election to Donald Trump, but at a private event before donors Thursday night, she blamed her loss, in part, on \"some unprecedented factors\" \u2014 namely Russian hacking and the letter about the investigation into her email server released by FBI Director James Comey days before the election. \"Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me,\" Clinton said, per audio obtained by The New York Times . The event, for campaign donors, was closed to the press. In the remarks, Clinton ties the \"beef\" to the country's parliamentary elections in 2011, which as secretary of state, Clinton said were \"unfair, not free, illegitimate.\" Obama On Russian Hacking: 'We Need To Take Action. And We Will' Around the time of those elections, Russian citizens took to the streets to protest Putin's power grab. \"Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people,\" Clinton said. \"And that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election.\" These were Clinton's most extensive remarks to date about the Russian hacking, how it may have related to her electoral loss and the origins of what NBC termed as Putin's \"vendetta\" against Clinton. Clinton has previously blamed the FBI, in part, for her loss. Her campaign staff also has talked about the FBI's role in the election earlier this month at a conference at Harvard's Institute of Politics examining the election results . Clinton's team blamed FBI Director James Comey's two letters in the final days of the campaign as well as Russian-linked hacking of the Democratic National Committee and campaign Chairman John Podesta's personal Gmail account. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Family Tried To Auction Coffee With Ivanka, Raising Ethical Concerns The argument, one which Clinton repeated last night, is that voters who were undecided until the end broke for Trump because of the Comey letter and the swirling controversy linked to daily WikiLeaks posts of internal campaign emails. In a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday night, Podesta argued the FBI's priorities were off, given that the agency apparently put more emphasis on investigating Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state than Russian interference in the U.S. election. \"Comparing the FBI's massive response to the overblown email scandal with the seemingly lackadaisical response to the very real Russian plot to subvert a national election shows that something is deeply broken at the FBI,\" Podesta wrote. Clinton herself attempted to argue that it was bigger than herself, saying she was pleased to see a bipartisan group of senators calling for an investigation into the hacking. \"This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here,\" Clinton said. \"This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\" President-elect Trump, however, continues to downplay the significance of the hacking, questioning whether it really was Russia: Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2016 The Senate Intelligence Committee released a statement, describing how it plans to proceed with its investigation into the hacking, and the intelligence community's conclusion that it was directed by people at the highest levels of the Russian government. \"Majority Leader McConnell and incoming Minority Leader Schumer have made it clear they expect any review of Russia's involvement in our nation's elections to be conducted in a bipartisan manner,\" the intelligence committee's statement reads. \"It is a charge the [committee] takes seriously.\" MAILBAG: Could 'Faithless Electors' Keep Donald Trump Out Of The White House? The statement also says the committee will carry out the investigation expeditiously, \"but we will take the time to get it right and will not be influenced by uninformed discourse.\" Some hearings will be public, but much of the work will be conducted behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of the committee's work. As for the results of the election, some Democratic Party donors who spoke to Politico questioned whether the focus from Clinton's team on Comey and Russia is productive, saying a full postmortem of what went wrong in the campaign is still needed.

So many people visited the federal government website that the administration extended the deadline until early next week to give more people time to sign up for what could be the last year of Obamacare coverage. A woman reading the HealthCare.gov insurance marketplace internet site KAREN BLEIER / AFP - Getty Images The Republicans who will control Congress and the White House starting next month say they'll repeal the law that provides the insurance markets as soon as they can \u2014 although there's no clear plan for how, when or what to put in its place. Related: Repeal Obamacare? Maybe Not Obama plugged the health insurance marketplace, the centerpiece of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, in his last press conference of the year before heading to Hawaii for vacation. \"Yesterday was the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get coverage,\" Obama said. \"Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs.\" That's compared to 600,000 sign-ups last year on the Dec. 15 deadline. Obama said when he took office, 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. \"Today, we have covered more than 20 million of them,\" he said. \"For the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured.\" Republican opponents of Obamacare don't dispute the coverage numbers but say the law has failed to bring down costs for consumers, as had been promised. Related: Most Americans Don't Want Obamacare Repealed Premiums have risen as insurance companies taking part in the exchanges have struggled to make the profits they seek with the other restrictions imposed by the law. Obamacare limits the ability to charge higher premiums for women and older people, and it forces insurers to take all comers, even people who are already sick. But the publicity over higher premiums didn't seem to scare off new customers. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 4 million people have signed up for coverage on Healthcare.gov, compared to about 2.8 million enrollments by the first week of December last year. That includes 1.1 million people not covered before and 2.9 million renewals. \"Yesterday was biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than 670,000 Americans signed up to get coverage.\" Most people who buy private insurance on the health insurance marketplaces get a hefty federal subsidy to help pay the premiums. An analysis by the Center for Health and Economy found those subsidies would cost $42.6 billion next year, an increase of nearly $10 billion over this year. Related: Obamacare Repeal Would Take Insurance from 30 Million People The enrollment numbers do not include 12 health insurance marketplaces run by states and Washington, D.C. independently of the federal government. The new demand could help improve profitability for insurers, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \"If the current (Affordable Care Act) open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing,\" he said via Twitter. If the current ACA open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing. \u2014 Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) December 16, 2016 \"Because of the extraordinary demand, we extended the deadline to sign-up for January 1 coverage by two business days until 11:59 pm PST December 19. We don't yet know how many people will take advantage of this extension, but nearly a million consumers left their contact information to hold their place in line,\" HHS said in a statement. Obama on Friday took a shot at critics who said the law would hurt business and employment by requiring larger employers to cover their workers. \"Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs,\" he said.

By REUTERS. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said on Friday that he refrained from taking aggressive public action in retaliation for Russian hacking of Democratic Party institutions before the presidential election because he was concerned that such moves might be interpreted as unfair meddling in the campaign. In a news conference before leaving for a two-week vacation in Hawaii, Mr. Obama said that he told President Vladimir V.

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 16, 2016 6:03 PM EST RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republicans stripped the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority on Friday and were on the cusp of an even greater power grab, an extraordinary move critics said flies in the face of voters. Just last week,\u00a0 it appeared Republicans were ready to finally accept Democrats\u2019 narrow win in a contentious governor\u2019s race. As it turns out, they weren\u2019t done fighting.\u00a0 North Carolina Governor-elect Roy Cooper speaks to supporters at a victory rally the day after his Republican opponent, incumbent Pat McCrory, conceded in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 6, 2016 REUTERS In a surprise special session in the dying days of the old administration , some say the Republican-dominated legislature has thrown the government into total disarray, approving at least one bill aimed at emasculating incoming Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s administration. Cooper, the current attorney general, has threatened to sue. And many in the state are accusing Republicans of letting sour grapes over losing the governor\u2019s mansion turn into a legislative coup.\u00a0 \u201cThis was a pure power grab,\u201d said retired school librarian Carolyn White, 62, a long-time demonstrator who was arrested as part of the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protests against GOP-led legislative policies. \u201cI got arrested two years ago. Did it make any difference? No. But just like the civil rights movement, it\u2019s forward together. You just have to keep going forward.\u201d The protesters were so loud that Senate and House cleared the galleries - a highly unusual move - and more than two dozen people were arrested this week. Some protesters chanted \u201call political power comes from the people\u201d as demonstrators were escorted from the Legislative Building by authorities. Those that remained behind could only watch the debate through glass windows or listen to it online.\u00a0 Hundreds stomped their feet or banged on windows outside the gallery, causing several Republican lawmakers to note they were having trouble hearing during the debate. Democrats repeatedly stated their objections. \u201cThe kindergartners are getting rowdy,\u201d said Republican Rep. Dana Bumgardner. She said Democrats were \u201ccreating out of thin air a talking point for the next election.\u201d Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, who lost to Cooper by about 10,000 votes, quickly signed into law a bill that merges the State Board of Elections and State Ethics Commission into one board comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans, according to documents from General Assembly staff. The previous state elections board law would have allowed Cooper to put a majority of Democrats on the panel. The law would also make elections for appellate court judgeships officially partisan again. Another bill that received final legislative approval would force Cooper\u2019s Cabinet choices to be subject to Senate confirmation. McCrory must decide whether to sign the second law passed by a General Assembly that has repeatedly tugged the man who campaigned as a moderate in 2012 as Charlotte\u2019s moderate former mayor into hard-right turf. Lawmakers\u2019 veto-proof majorities since 2013 and the uncompetitive election districts they drew have allowed legislative Republicans to ignore Democratic viewpoints and sometimes McCrory\u2019s desires. Republicans insist the legislation is simply adjusting the constitutional powers already granted to the General Assembly. Many of the provisions had been debated for years but always got set aside. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no better time than to deal with it in the present,\u201d said Republican Rep. Bert Jones. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory holds a news conference with fellow members of the Republican Governors Association at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Feb. 23, 2015, in Washington. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Democrats said it was an attempt by the GOP to cling to power a week after the Republican incumbent conceded.\u00a0 \u201cI really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\u201d said Rep. Billy Richardson, a Democrat. Republicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities, holding 108 of 170 seats even though the state has been more closely divided in recent statewide and federal elections. North Carolina is a presidential battleground state that Barack Obama won in 2008 by just over 14,000 votes. Four years later, Mitt Romney edged Obama by about 92,000 votes. Donald Trump won in November. GOP legislators have been able to expand their majorities thanks to approving redistricting maps in 2011. But nearly 30 of those legislative districts were struck down last summer. A federal court has directed updated maps be approved by March 15. Cooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans\u2019 agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights. \u201cIf I believe that laws passed by the legislature hurt working families and are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,\u201d Cooper said. Republicans pointed to past sessions of the General Assembly, when it was dominated by Democrats. Democrats stripped the powers of the first and only GOP lieutenant governor of the 20th Century in the late 1980s. But Democrats said there\u2019s been no such widespread effort to limit the power of an incoming executive before he took office.\u00a0 On Friday afternoon, N.C. GOP Chairman Robin Hayes issued a statement about those protesting \u00a0the dicusssions this week. \u201cYesterday the rights of over nine million citizens were violated when a small mob formed inside the North Carolina House and Senate Chambers in an attempt to stop the duly elected representatives from debating critical issues,\u201d the statement said,\u00a0 CBS Raleigh affiliate WNCN reported . \u201cWe support the freedom and right of every citizen to speak for or against legislation, and well as the constitutional right to petition government for a redress of grievances. However, when a few hundred people decide to shut down the work of the General Assembly simply because they are against the outcome, we have gone from free speech to mob rule,\u201d it said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Dec 16 2016, 6:05 pm ET University of Minnesota Football Players Boycott Activities After Sexual Assault Suspensions by Erik Ortiz Football players boycott after teammates suspended 3:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161217004948if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/834920515771\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The entire University of Minnesota's football team is boycotting practices \u2014 and potentially an upcoming bowl game \u2014 until a forceful request from players is met: lift the suspension of 10 teammates involved in sexual assault allegations. It's a defiant demand by the 99-member team against university officials \u2014 one that if not resolved means the Gophers won't hit the field in the Dec. 27 Holiday Bowl against Washington State University. Before then, the team is supposed to hold five practices before flying to San Diego for the match-up. During a news conference Thursday at the team's practice facility, the players said they were blindsided by the suspensions this week. \"All these kids' reputations are destroyed,\" said senior quarterback Mitch Leidner. The teammates, wearing maroon uniforms, stood with the players who were suspended indefinitely from the team, calling them the \"10 falsely accused.\" The players told reporters they also want an apology from university president Eric Kaler and athletic director Mark Coyle, as well as a closed-door meeting with two University Board of Regents members to discuss how to \"make the program great again.\" The Minnesota Golden Gophers look to the sideline for instructions in the second quarter against the Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium on Nov.26, 2016, in Madison, Wisconsin. Dylan Buell / Getty Images One of those board members, Darrin Rosha, told NBC News on Friday that he is open to a discussion. \"I have been in contact with the chair of our board, and he is evaluating that request,\" Rosha said. \"I made clear to him that I am willing and prepared to meet with our student athletes pending a resolution of their legitimate concerns.\" A university spokesman declined to comment further Friday, and told NBC News that federal privacy laws prevent the school from sharing details about the suspended students. \"The reality is that not everyone can have all of the facts, and unfortunately the university cannot share more information due to federal laws regarding student privacy,\" Kaler and Coyle said in a joint statement. Kaller added in a statement Friday that his first responsibility is upholding the university's values. \"One of my jobs as president is to put our institutional values at the forefront of all we do and ensure our actions are aligned with those values. This principle is far more important than any football game and the university community as a whole, and it is more important than any single athletic team,\" Kaller said. Coyle echoed Kaler's sentiment in a letter to University of Minnesota student athletes. \"We're confident that together, we can get through this difficult time much stronger if we hold true to our values and hold each other accountable,\" he said. The suspension of the 10 players stems from a Sept. 2 incident in which a female student had sexual contact with players. In a redacted police report, a police investigator said the sexual encounter with one player appeared to be consensual based on videos taken at the time and shown to police by the player, according to the Star-Tribune newspaper. However, the Star-Tribune said, the woman told police that sexual contact with three other players was not consensual. Police reports and the female student's testimony obtained by the newspaper describe how the student went to an off-campus apartment with two football players. During the course of the night, she said, had sex with one player. But she was forced to have sex with others, she said. \"I was shoving people off of me,\" she later testified in court to obtain restraining orders, according to the Star-Tribune. \"They kept ignoring my pleas for help. Anything I said they laughed. They tried to cheer people on.\" The woman filed restraining orders against five players in October, but she dismissed them after an agreement that they would stay at least 20 feet away from her, the Star-Tribune and NBC affiliate KARE reported. While six players were involved in the incident itself, police said, it's unclear why the others have been implicated. In the end, no players were ever arrested and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office on Oct. 3 said it declined to press charges. \"Based on the evidence available ... there is insufficient, admissible evidence for prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either force was used or that the victim was physically helpless as defined by law in the sexual encounter,\" prosecutors said. Still, an attorney for the 10 players said some of them have been recommended for expulsion from the university following an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action investigation. Attorney Lee Hutton did not immediately return a request for comment Friday, but has said he would appeal the suspensions. If facts are proven to be untrue, who will be the first to resign? \u2014 Attorney, Lee Hutton (@LeeHuttonIII) December 16, 2016 A father of one of the suspended students, freshman Antoine Winfield Jr., threatened to pull his son out of the Big Ten school if officials don't step down. \"It's a brotherhood,\" Antoine Winfield Sr., himself a retired player for the Minnesota Vikings, said at the news conference, \"and it shows you the support and love that all the players feel for each other.\" While the players still have the upcoming Holiday Bowl, some of them could see their scholarships revoked if they don't resume playing football. \"What, are they going to pull 120 guys off the team?\" senior Drew Wolitarsky asked during the news conference. \"I mean, they're not going to have a team if that's the case.\" Tracy Claeys, the Gophers' head coach, attended the news conference as well and tweeted about his players: Have never been more proud of our kids. I respect their rights & support their effort to make a better world! \u303d\ufe0f \u2014 GoldenGopherHFC (@GoldenGopherHFC) December 16, 2016 The suspension has divided students on campus, some of whom support the players and others who say the alleged victim's claims shouldn't be so quickly brushed aside just because charges weren't filed. Gopher lineman Joe Bjorklund tweeted that players standing up for one another \"isn't an attack\" on the female student. Erik Ortiz ",

On Thursday, she said that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended \u201cto undermine our democracy.\u201d Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended \u201cto undermine our democracy\u201d and were ordered by Vladimir V. Putin \u201cbecause he has a personal beef against me.\u201d Speaking to a group of donors in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Putin, the Russian president, had never forgiven her for the accusation she made in 2011, when she was secretary of state, that parliamentary elections his country held that year were rigged. \u201cPutin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. It is the first time Mrs. Clinton has publicly addressed the impact of the hacks since the intelligence community concluded that they were specifically aimed at harming her campaign. \u201cMake no mistake, as the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the group, which collectively poured roughly $1 billion into her effort. \u201cThis is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.\u201d The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. In her remarks, she endorsed the proposal of a bipartisan group of senators to investigate the hacking and said the inquiry should be modeled on the commission set up after the Sept. 11 attacks. \u201cThe public deserves to know exactly what happened, and why, in order for us to prevent future attacks on our systems, including our electoral system,\u201d she said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mrs. Clinton said the hacking was one of two \u201cunprecedented\u201d events that led to her defeat. The other was the release of a letter by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director , shortly before the election disclosing new questions about emails handled by her private server. The letter, she said, cost her close races in several battleground states. \u201cSwing-state voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the F.B.I. letter from Director Comey,\u201d she said. Mrs. Clinton first talked about the impact of Mr. Comey\u2019s letters in a conference call with donors a few days after the election. Since the election she has kept a low profile, mostly appearing on social media in photographs by passers-by who have spotted her walking her dogs near her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. ",

(Chris Seward/The News & Observer via AP) 0 Shares Email Nearly a month after Election Day , North Carolina Republicans appeared to finally accept Democrats' narrow win in the contentious governor's race. As it turns out, they weren't done fighting. In a surprise special session in the dying days of the old administration, some say, the Republican-dominated legislature has thrown the government into total disarray, introducing bills aimed at emasculating incoming Gov. Roy Cooper's administration. Cooper, the current attorney general, has threatened to sue. And many in the state are accusing Republicans of letting sour grapes over losing the governor's mansion turn into a legislative coup that flies in the face of voters. \"I believe fervently in democracy. I'm watching it be undermined ... by people who seem unwilling to consider or to listen,\" said Margaret Toman, who was among hundreds of protesters rallying inside the Legislative Building this week, demanding that Republicans leave Cooper's authority alone. The protesters were so loud that Senate and House cleared the galleries, and more than a dozen people were arrested. There were at least 16 new arrests Friday as the House resumed its debate. Protesters chanted \"all political power comes from the people.\" More than 150 demonstrators remained behind in the rotunda of the Legislative Building. Republicans are considering scaling back the number of political appointees Cooper can make and require the Senate's approval for top administrators at state agencies. They also are talking about erasing the governor's ability to shape elections boards statewide. Republicans insist the legislation is simply adjusting the constitutional powers already granted to the General Assembly. They've said many of the provisions had been debated for years but always got set aside. \"There's probably no better time than to deal with it in the present,\" said Republican Rep. Bert Jones. Democrats said it was a GOP power grab occurring a week after Republican incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory conceded a race he lost by just over 10,000 votes. \"It is done in a blatant political move by a party that must be afraid of the voters so they have to hold onto the power that they have,\" said Democratic Rep. Graig Meyer. Rep. Billy Richardson, also a Democrat, agreed, expressing disappointment at the legislature's quick-footed actions during the special session. \"I really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\" Richardson said. Whatever bills get final approval, likely to come Friday, will head to the governor's desk, but it's unclear what would happen next. McCrory, who hasn't commented publicly, could veto or sign the bills, or they could become law without his signature \u2014 and before Cooper takes office Jan. 1. Republicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities. Two former North Carolina governors \u2014 Republican Jim Martin and Democrat Jim Hunt \u2014 said this week that the legislation goes too far. Cooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans' agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights. \"If I believe that laws passed by the legislature hurt working families and are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,\" Cooper said. Republicans pointed to past sessions of the General Assembly, when it was dominated by Democrats. Democrats stripped the powers of the first and only GOP lieutenant governor of the 20th Century in the late 1980s. But Democrats said there's been no such widespread effort to limit the power of an incoming executive before he took office. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Kinnard reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Animal rights activists have unleashed their anger at Texas A&M University, where they say a professor\u2019s experiments on golden retrievers amount to animal cruelty. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) claims Dr. Joseph Kornegay, who works in the school\u2019s Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, is conducting \u201ccruel, useless experiments\u201d on the dogs. The tests involve muscular dystrophy research that PETA says could be carried out without using live canines. \"Three decades of painful experiments on generations of debilitated and suffering golden retrievers have failed to result in a cure or even a treatment that can reverse the course of muscular dystrophy in humans,\" said Dr. Alka Chandna, PETA's senior laboratory oversight specialist. \"PETA is calling for an immediate end to these cruel, useless experiments.\" Those claims were amplified in a letter PETA\u2019s Dr. Emily Trunnell wrote to college President Michael Young that asked the college to instead conduct tests with what they call \u201cmodern, non-animal, human-relevant studies.\u201d In the letter, PETA cited Kornegay\u2019s own research saying researchers stretch muscles of the dogs with levers to induce mechanical damage, and that some dogs experience a shift in their hind limbs and an inability to open their mouths or jaws. The letter also accuses the college\u2019s program of specifically breeding dogs with muscular dystrophy, and calls for an end to that practice. PETA is demanding that the dogs now in the lab be made available for adoption. Kornegay acknowledged the practice, but said there aren\u2019t enough client-owned dogs with the disease for research. He said similar methods are used for dogs with other diseases like hemophilia or retinal diseases. \u201cThere\u2019s not another way,\u201d said Kornegay. \u201cI\u2019m a dog lover, I\u2019m a veterinarian, I\u2019ve had dogs all my life. So every time we have a research project we want to be as sure as we can that the research will be valuable because the dogs are valuable. Not financially valuable, but valuable as individuals\u201d Along with the letter, PETA released a video which they claim was taken undercover inside the Texas A&M laboratory. The video also shows dogs in similar conditions at a lab in France. The footage shows dogs in metal cages, which appear weak as they struggle to eat. Some can be seen salivating excessively, which PETA says is a symptom of the dog\u2019s swollen tongues and weak jaws. Kornegay confirmed that part of the video was shot at a Texas A&M facility, but said based on the dogs in the video, it must be about three years old. He said the facility is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and also noted dogs in the video were wagging their tails, walking up to the person taking the video and doing \u201cwhat dogs do.\u201d \u201cThe suggestion that these dogs are being depicted through the video in a way that they\u2019re being abused or the care for them is not appropriate is just untrue, to be kind. It couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth,\u201d said Kornegay. Kornegay has written more than 30 publications about his research on muscular dystrophy in dogs, including a 2013 article titled \u201cComparative Genomics of X-linked Muscular Dystrophies: The Golden Retriever Model.\u201d \u00a0\u201cToday, dogs are providing valuable information toward understanding and treating human diseases, making the phrase \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d more appropriate than ever,\u201d wrote Kornegay. Kornegay also wrote that dogs can better predict the potential success of treatments for humans compared to other animals like mice. He told Fox News he believes in the importance of his research. \u201cI\u2019ve had to come to terms with what I\u2019ve spent over 30 years doing and the value of that,\u201d said Kornegay. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the research is valuable, it\u2019s important and that progress is being made.\u201d Ray Bogan is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in El Paso, Texas.

Rush-hour snow, freezing rain, possibly record-breaking cold Subzero cold sets in across the Chicago area, making for a frigid commutes and a sunrise that looks deceptively warm. (Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staff Contact Reporter Chicago will get a break from the arctic chill long enough for a snowstorm around the evening rush Friday, freezing rain on Saturday morning, then more snow before polar air returns and possibly breaks some records by the end of the weekend. The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory in effect from noon Friday until 6 a.m. Sunday. The snow is expected to be heaviest during the middle and end of the evening rush Friday, possibly an inch an hour in some places. The snow may turn to sleet and freezing rain Saturday morning, especially in areas to the south of the city. \"Any amount of light freezing rain or freezing drizzle could have large impact,\" the weather service warned. The wind will pick up and the temperature will drop by evening, when more snow is expected. The two waves of snow Friday and Saturday are expected to dump as much as 8 inches near the Wisconsin border, less to the south. Wind chills could get down to minus 25 or worse Saturday night all the way through Sunday night. The low Saturday night is expected to be minus 1, the high Sunday near 2 above and the low Sunday night minus 10. Both days could break records. The record low for Dec. 17 is minus 1 set in 1951, the record low for Dec. 18 minus 11 set in 1983. The storm system has generated storm advisories and warnings from the Rockies through South Dakota into Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northern Indiana and Lower Michigan. This latest arctic front will finally move out Monday and temperatures will begin to climb during the week before Christmas. It's expected to be in the low 30s on Christmas Day with a chance of snow showers.

    "text": "<p>Researchers testing the water in Flint, Michigan.&nbsp;</p> Close CBS News WASHINGTON --\u00a0Congressional Republicans quietly closed a year-long investigation into Flint, Michigan\u2019s crisis over lead in its drinking water, faulting both state officials and the Environmental Protection Agency for contamination that has affected nearly 100,000 residents . In letters to fellow Republicans, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Friday that Michigan and federal officials were slow in detecting high levels of lead in the water and did not act fast enough once the problem was discovered. Michigan task force calls for state-wide tests for lead The committee findings offer no new information and essentially summarize what emerged during several high-profile hearings earlier this year. \u201cThe committee found significant problems at Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality and unacceptable delays in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s response to the crisis,\u201d wrote Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. \u201cThe committee also found that the federal regulatory framework is so outdated that it sets up states to fail.\u201d Flint\u2019s drinking water became tainted when the city switched from the Detroit water system and began drawing from the Flint River in April 2014 to save money. The impoverished city was under state control at the time. Congress blasts Michigan governor, EPA chief for Flint crisis Regulators failed to ensure the water was treated properly and lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply. After nearly a year of haggling, Congress cleared legislation last week to provide $170 million to deal with the Flint crisis and help other communities with lead-tainted water. In his letters to fellow GOP lawmakers, Chaffetz cites \u201ca series of failures at all levels of government\u201d that \u201ccaused and then exacerbated the water crisis.\u201d While the Republican chairman signaled the apparent conclusion of the inquiry - Congress ended its two-year session last week - the panel\u2019s senior Democrat insisted the investigation should continue and accused Michigan\u2019s Republican governor of stonewalling the committee over documents related to the Flint water crisis. Some lead exposure victims facing new threat as adults Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, senior Democrat on the oversight panel, said he wants Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to produce key Flint-related documents within 30 days. Cummings said Snyder and his administration have obstructed the committee\u2019s investigation into the Flint crisis for a year, refusing to provide - or even search for - key documents. Snyder\u2019s intransigence has thwarted committee efforts to answer critical questions about what he knew as the crisis unfolded and why he didn\u2019t act sooner to fix Flint\u2019s water problem, Cummings said. \u201cRequiring Governor Snyder to finally comply with the committee\u2019s request will allow us to complete our investigation and offer concrete findings and recommendations to help prevent a catastrophe like this from happening again,\u201d Cummings wrote to Chaffetz. \u201cIn contrast, allowing Governor Snyder to flout the committee\u2019s authority will deny the people of Flint the answers they deserve.\u201d It\u2019s highly unlikely Republicans who control Congress will continue the inquiry next year. A spokeswoman for Snyder said the governor\u2019s office has provided the committee with hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and the committee has wrapped up its investigation. \u201cIn Michigan, we are working hard each day to continue Flint\u2019s full recovery with funding for pipe replacement and health care for residents,\u201d spokeswoman Anna Heaton said, adding that it is \u201cnot productive to spend time engaging in partisan political attacks from out-of-state politicians\u201d such as Cummings. Chaffetz addressed his letters to the chairmen of committees that oversee congressional spending and the EPA. He asked them to consider redirecting hundreds of millions of dollars now targeted to fighting climate change to upgrade the nation\u2019s drinking water pipes and other infrastructure. Chaffetz also asked for closer congressional oversight of the EPA, saying the agency has failed to update rules concerning lead and copper pipes nationwide. Aryele Bradford, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the oversight panel, called it \u201cinexplicable\u201d that Chaffetz would \u201crush to close down this investigation.\u201d His action \u201cdoes a real disservice to the families of Flint who hoped they would get a fair shake from our committee,\u201d she said. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Daily News 5:35 p.m. EST December 16, 2016 FILE - In this April 19, 2016 file photo, Pitbull appears at the eMerge Americas technology event in Miami Beach, Fla. Pitbull released his $1 million contract with Florida's tourism marketing agency via Twitter Thursday, two days after the House speaker sued to find out details of the agreement that included the production of a video for the song \"Sexy Beaches.\" House Speaker Richard Corcoran filed a lawsuit Tuesday in an attempt to have details of the contract disclosed. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) (Photo: Wilfredo Lee, AP) TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Friday called on the leader of the state's tourism arm to resign in an effort\u00a0to promote transparency after the agency\u00a0refused to release details of a $1 million tourism\u00a0contract with rapper Pitbull. In a letter to VISIT FLORIDA Chairman William D. Talbert III, Scott said\u00a0Will Seccombe should no longer lead the agency. Scott urged a plan to release agency\u00a0spending details, potential returns on investment, and salaries. Seccombe works for the agency's\u00a0board. \u201cThe major changes outlined above require new leadership and ideas at the agency, and I believe it would be best for the future efforts of VISIT FLORIDA for Will (Seccombe) to step down and allow new leadership to come in at this critical time,\u201d Scott wrote. Florida House files suit to release Pitbull contract Before Scott sent his letter, Seccombe had\u00a0fired VISIT FLORIDA Chief Financial Officer Vangie Fields and Chief Marketing Officer Paul Phipps, VISIT FLORIDA spokeswoman Kathy Torian said. Torian said Seccombe has agreed to leave his job and he will establish an official departure date with Talbert and the VISIT FLORIDA board. ",

ABC News The winter storm will bring heavy snow as it moves into the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes regions on Friday. The storm is forecast to arrive in Minneapolis around 6:30 p.m. ET and could leave behind 6 to 10 inches of fresh snow in the area. The coast-to-coast weather system is expected to sweep into the Northeast region after midnight, where inland areas could see over 6 inches of snow locally, according to ABC News meteorologists. Scott Olson/Getty Images) Despite single-digit temperatures people stroll along the lakefront, Dec. 15, 2016, in Chicago, Illinois. By Saturday morning, New York City could have 2 to 3 inches of fresh snow while Boston is expected to receive 3 to 5 inches. But that won\u2019t be the end of the storm\u2019s wrath. A second arctic front is forecast to bring frigid cold and another burst of snow to the Midwest region Saturday night, from Chicago to Kansas City to Oklahoma City, according to ABC News meteorologists. ABC News The snowstorm will move into the Northeast region after midnight. Inland areas could see more than a half a foot of snow locally. Scott Olson/Getty Images A man walks down an ice and snow covered alley toward an L station, Dec. 15, 2016, in Chicago, Illinois. Wind chills, or \"feels-like\" temperatures, will be below freezing for much of the country by Sunday morning, with the coldest of -49 degrees Fahrenheit expected to be in Minneapolis, according to ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo. \u201cBehind this snowstorm , we have even colder temperatures for the Midwest and the South this time,\u201d Golembo said. ABC News The wind chills, or feels like temperatures, will make this winter storm feel even colder over the weekend. As of this morning, 38 states were under winter weather alerts, including Texas and Arizona, which usually boast warmer climes. As the winter storm moves east, ABC News meteorologists said moderate to heavy rain is in store for much of southern California and parts of southern Arizona today. ABC News The weather radar on Friday morning showed moderate to heavy rain for much of southern California and some of southern Arizona. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Republican \u201cfaithless elector,\u201d who made headlines across the country when he wrote a blistering op-ed pledging not to vote for President-elect Trump in the Electoral College, is now under scrutiny himself after his claim to have been a firefighter on 9/11 has been questioned by a local news outlet. Christopher Suprun, a Republican elector in Texas, wrote a piece for the\u00a0 New York Times on Dec. 5 called \u201cWhy I Will Not Cast My Electoral Vote for Donald Trump.\u201d In it, Suprun cites his past as a firefighter on 9/11 as one of the reasons for not voting for Donald Trump on Dec. 19, despite Texas voting comfortably for Trump on Nov. 8. \u201cFifteen years ago, as a firefighter, I was part of the response to the Sept. 11 attacks against our nation. That attack and this year\u2019s election may seem unrelated, but for me the relationship becomes clearer every day,\u201d Suprun wrote. In the piece, he calls on fellow Republican electors to vote their conscience and deny Trump the 270 votes he needs to win the White House, and to back a Republican alternative such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has publicly distanced himself from such efforts. \u201cThe election of the next president is not yet a done deal. Electors of conscience can still do the right thing for the good of the country. Presidential electors have the legal right and a constitutional duty to vote their conscience,\u201d Suprun wrote. \u201cI pray my fellow electors will do their job and join with me in discovering who that person should be.\u201d Yet, as the move to deny Trump the 270 votes has gained momentum and media coverage, Suprun\u2019s past has come under scrutiny. Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA reported that Suprun\u2019s LinkedIn page claims that he was part of Manassas Fire Department in Sept. 2001, but found that he was not part of that Fire Dept. until October, and cited an anonymous first responder who knew Suprun, who contradicted his claims. \u201cHe claimed to be a first responder with the Manassas Park Fire Department on September 11, 2001 and personally told us stories 'I was fighting fire that day at the Pentagon.' No, I was on a medic unit that day at the Pentagon and you make a phone call to Manassas Park and you find out that he wasn't even employed there until October 2001,\" the source told the outlet. Even if Suprun had been hired by Manassas Park before 9/11, the fire chief there told WFAA that they did not respond to the Pentagon that fateful day. \"It\u2019s no different than stolen valor for the military,\u201d the source told WFAA. Suprun responded to the allegations in a statement Friday: \u201cYou\u2019re right, I wasn\u2019t in New York on 9-11,\u201d he said [although WFAA did not make such a claim.] \u201cI was a part of the response to the Pentagon attacks, as a member of the Dale City fire department in northern Virginia.\u201d He explained further in response to a question at an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d on Reddit. \u201cThat story exhibits a reckless disregard for the truth. I never claimed to be a first responder on 9-11 with the Manassas Park Fire Dept. I was a volunteer firefighter at the time for the Dale City Fire Dept. when I responded to the attacks at the Pentagon,\u201d he said. Suprun\u2019s claim is backed up in part by a story in Philly.com in 2012, which reported on a talk Suprun gave for the Never Forget foundation. In that, Philly.com reports him claiming in that talk that he was indeed part of the Dale City Volunteer Fire Department. However, that account does not present him as a firefighter, as he claims to be in his Times op-ed and his Reddit answer, but as a volunteer paramedic. His account does not have him fighting fires, but administering first aid in a nearby parking lot, before being deployed to a recreation center, where he treated first responders. Calls to Dale City Fire Dept. from FoxNews.com were not immediately returned. Follow up questions to Suprun\u2019s agent seeking to clarify his role that day were also not returned. It was not the only question WFAA raised in regards to Suprun\u2019s record. On his LinkedIn profile, Suprun says he is presently a paramedic with Freedom EMS in Dallas, but WFAA reports that no such company exists. A spokeswoman for Air Methods ambulance service, where Suprun's LinkedIn also claims he works, told the outlet he is not employed there either. Electors make their decision on Dec. 19. Suprun is so far the only elector to publicly express his intent to change his vote from Trump. It would take 37 votes to deny Trump the votes needed, which would then send the question to the House of Representatives. Trump would likely still win among the Republican-heavy legislature, but rogue electors hope that by presenting a moderate Republican, they can convince them to snatch the White House away from the billionaire.

    "text": "Drug Overdose Deaths Rise Significantly in Past 5 Years By michael casey, associated press CONCORD, N.H. \u0097 Dec 16, 2016, 3:37 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Heroin Kills More People Than Gun Violence: CDC 0 Shares Email Drug overdose deaths have increased by 33 percent in the past five years across the country, with some states seeing jumps of nearly 200 percent. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30 states saw increases in overdose deaths resulting from the abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers, a class of drugs known as opioids . New Hampshire saw a 191 percent increase while North Dakota, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine had death rates jump by over 100 percent. \"Too many Americans are feeling the devastation of the opioid crisis either from misuse of prescription opioids or use of illicit opioids,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the CDC. \"Urgent action is needed to help health care providers treat pain safely and treat opioid use disorder effectively, support law enforcement strategies to reduce the availability of illicit opiates, and support states to develop and implement programs that can save lives.\" Last year, more than 52,000 people died from drug overdoses, with almost two-thirds involving prescription or illegal opioids. Deaths from synthetic opioids, including illicit fentanyl, rose 73 percent, to 9,580. And prescription painkillers took the highest toll but posted the smallest increase. Abuse of drugs like Oxycontin and Vicodin killed 17,536, an increase of 4 percent. In comparison, the number of people who died in car crashes was 37,757, an increase of 12 percent. Gun deaths, including homicides and suicides, totaled 36,252, up 7 percent. The CDC report also included death certificate data for opioid overdoses in 28 states, finding that 16 saw a jump in death rates from synthetic opioids including illicit fentanyl. New York (135.7 percent), Connecticut (125.9 percent) and Illinois (120 percent) were the hardest hit. As for heroin deaths, 11 states had increases, with South Carolina (57.1 percent), North Carolina (46.4 percent) and Tennessee (43.5 percent) seeing the biggest spike. The Northeast has been hit especially hard by the drug crisis, with New Hampshire among those suffering the most. Just this year, overdose deaths were expected to top 500. The state's congressional delegation was among those supporting a bill that will provide $1 billion in funding to states to fight heroin and opioid abuse. Heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers are the primary drivers of addiction in recent years. \"Obviously the fact that 500 people are going to succumb to addiction this year is just a terrible tragedy,\" said Republican Jeb Bradley, the state Senate majority leader. \"It reminds us all that we have to make sure that we ... monitor carefully what's working and what isn't and be prepared as we come back in January to address this issue.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Kathleen Ronayne contributed to this report from Concord. 0 Shares ",

By late afternoon, Payne had not posted bond and was still in custody. A friend, Sonjia Williams, told NBC News she hoped to arrange for her release soon. Octogenarian jewel thief Doris Payne NBC News During a brief court appearance, Payne objected when a prosecutor reeled off a series of past convictions, saying some of them were duplicates. \"I'm not denying that I have a history,\" Payne said. \"I do.\" Related: Infamous Jewel Thief Doris Payne, 86, Arrested Again In previous interviews, Payne has said she's been arrested more than 20 times in a globe-trotting career that inspired a 2013 documentary. She's still facing charges in a neighboring Georgia county, stemming from the alleged theft of $690 Christian Dior earrings from a Saks Fifth Avenue outlet. She served two years in prison for a 2010 ring theft at a Macy's in San Diego. The judge in the case compared her to the Terminator, who always comes back. \"She's an adventure-seeker and she gets bored easily and she loves the attention,\" Matthew Pond, co-director of \"The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne,\" told NBC News. \"She likes playing the part and getting into the role. She's a bit of an actress.\" While she's lived abroad and once bragged about a $500,000 heist in Monte Carlo, Payne's wings have been clipped. She told the judge Friday that she doesn't have a passport because of her felony record. Tracy Connor ",

Journal, and Tim Evans, The Indianapolis Star 7:40 p.m. EST December 16, 2016 x Share Rachael Denhollander is one of two former gymnasts who have contacted IndyStar about alleged sexual abuse by longtime USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. She filed an August criminal complaint in Michigan. (Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Dr. Larry Nassar, D.O., works with a patient in this 2008 photo. (Photo: Becky Shink/Lansing State Journal) LANSING, Mich. \u2014\u00a0For the second time this year, the former longtime team doctor for USA Gymnastics has been arrested , this time on federal child pornography charges. Michigan officials previously charged Larry Nassar in November with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person younger than 13. The new arrest on Friday is based on a federal indictment in which Nassar is charged with receipt and attempted receipt of child pornography and possession of child pornography. The indictment says that between 2003 and this year, Nassar possessed \u201cthousands of images of child pornography\u201d with file names such as \u201cpedo-vicky_10_year_old_orgasm\u201d and \u201cKelly 13 young girl.\u201d Allegations against Nassar surfaced\u00a0after an IndyStar investigation in August revealed top officials at USA Gymnastics failed to report many allegations they received regarding sexual abuse to police or child welfare authorities. In September, IndyStar first reported sexual abuse allegations against Nassar by two women, including an Olympic medal winner. After that story, more than 50 people filed sexual assault complaints about the osteopathic physician with police at Michigan State University, where Nassar worked at a clinic. The abuse is alleged to have occurred from 1996 to 2016. A 20-year toll: 368 gymnasts allege sexual exploitation Before his arrest Friday, Nassar was free on $1 million bond on the state charges, which carry a potential sentence of life in prison. Nassar's latest arrest came one day after IndyStar published an investigaton revealing at least 368 gymnasts had made sexual abuse allegations against coaches, gym owners and other adults working in the sport, including Nassar, over the last 20 years. Nassar worked as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics for nearly 30 years, accompanying America's top gymnasts to four Olympic Games and numerous international competitions. USA Gymnastics said it cut ties with Nassar in 2015 in response to \u201cathlete concerns,\u201d and alerted the FBI. But USA Gymnastics let it appear that Nassar had retired, which allowed the osteopathic physician to continue working with gymnasts in Michigan and athletes at Michigan Sate University for nearly a year. USA Gymnastics told IndyStar the FBI prohibited officials from telling anyone about the investigation. A blind eye to sex abuse: How USA Gymnastics failed to report cases The two women who shared their stories with IndyStar said the alleged molestation occurred during multiple treatments in the 1990s and early 2000s. The two women, who were juveniles at the time, said the doctor fondled their genitals and breasts. One of them said Nassar also spoke about oral sex and made other inappropriate comments when they were alone, according to court records. The other woman said she told police Nassar was visibly aroused as he examined her during one medical visit. The state charges filed in November did not, however, involve a gymnast. The victim in that case was \"just a child. A little child,\" Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said last month. Court documents say the abuse occurred between 1998 and 2005. \"She provides fortitude to every woman, every girl and every daughter,\" Schuette said of the victim, who's referred to in court documents as \"Victim A.\" The attorney general said at the time that the three felony charges against Nassar are the \"tip of the iceberg.\" He added \"many, many\" complaints have been made against Nassar, and \"we are hopeful that other victims may step forward.\" \"The guy was a predator ... we'll get the conviction,\" Schuette said at a news conference.

By Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima December 16 at 2:20 PM Follow @nakashimae FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the presidency, according to U.S. officials. Comey\u2019s support for the CIA\u2019s conclusion reflects the fact that the leaders of the three agencies have always been in agreement on Russian intentions, officals said, contrary to suggestions by some lawmakers that the FBI disagreed with the CIA. \u201cEarlier this week, I met separately with (Director) FBI James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election,\u201d CIA Director John Brennan said in a message to the agency\u2019s workforce, according to U.S. officials who have seen the message. [ Obama says \u2018we will\u2019 retaliate against Russia for election hacking ] \u201cThe three of us also agree that our organizations, along with others, need to focus on completing the thorough review of this issue that has been directed by President Obama and which is being led by the DNI,\u201d Brennan\u2019s message read. (The Washington Post) Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russian hacking. The CIA and FBI declined to comment. The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill about two weeks ago in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Specifically, CIA briefers told the senators it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was one of Russia\u2019s goals, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. CIA and FBI officials do not think Russia had a \u201csingle purpose\u201d by intervening during the presidential campaign. In addition to helping Trump, intelligence officials have told lawmakers that Moscow\u2019s other goal included undermining confidence in the U.S. electoral system. A separate House intelligence briefing by a senior FBI counterintelligence official last week left some Republican and Democratic lawmakers with the impression that the bureau wasn\u2019t on the same page as the CIA, according to officials present. \u201cThe truth is they were never all that different in the first place,\u201d an official said of the FBI and CIA positions. In his message to the CIA\u2019s workforce, Brennan said the administration has provided detailed briefings to lawmakers and their aides since the summer. 1 of 71 ",

    "text": "Vegetables, Fruit and Herbs Sauce Pizza sauce does not need to be cooked ahead of time, and is so simply prepared that there is no reason to use the store-bought variety. Instead, use a food processor to combine a can of whole, drained tomatoes with a splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Spread the sauce out on the dough using the back of a spoon, stopping approximately 1/2 inch from the dough\u2019s edges. Do not use too much; two or three tablespoons is enough. Keep leftover sauce refrigerated. Cheese Mozzarella is the traditional pizza cheese, but depending on the sort of pie you are creating, really any good melting cheese will do: fontina, Cheddar, Colby, blue, provolone and smoked Gouda, among others, make for delicious pizzas. Meats, Seafood and Eggs Meat on a pizza is an option for some. Sausage and meatballs are both traditional toppings and should be cooked beforehand. Pepperoni, ham and other cured meats do not need to be, though delicate sheets of air-dried beef or pork should perhaps go onto the pie midway through or at the end of the cooking process, lest they dry out in the heat. Anchovies are a marvelous addition to pizzas, and so are clams and mussels, even sheets of smoked salmon, particularly when paired with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and capers. Making a fried egg breakfast pizza is not for freshman-class pizza makers. Sliding a pizza topped with a raw egg into a hot oven takes patience and practice. In the meantime, while your pizza is cooking, gently fry an egg in olive oil in a small skillet on the stove, and when the pizza is done, slide it gently on top of the pie. Vegetables, Fruit and Herbs You can put anything on a pizza. The question is where, and when. Herbs can go below cheese to protect them from the heat of the oven, or onto the top of the pie when it\u2019s done. Pineapple can take heat like a fireman and can go on from the start, raw. Grapes can, too (a nice pairing for sausage). Mushrooms, though, should be cooked on the stovetop before you use them as a topping for pizza. Likewise peppers both red and green. (Thinly-sliced jalapeno pepper is an exception.) Potatoes can go on a pizza raw only if you\u2019re cooking in a very, very hot oven and you\u2019ve sliced them very, very thinly \u2013 otherwise, parboil them before slicing and adding them to the top of a pie. Grilled asparagus is an excellent addition to a \u201cwhite,\u201d or tomato-free pizza. We like thinly sliced Brussels sprouts, sometimes, on similar pies (pair with pancetta!), and leeks melted slowly over butter as well. As a rough guide: Precook anything that won\u2019t cook fast, or cut it so thinly that it will. Anything delicate, like a pile of arugula dressed simply in lemon juice and oil, can go on the pie when it\u2019s done, to cook gently in the pizza\u2019s residual heat. Cooking the Pizza We cook most of our pizzas in the oven, on top of a stone or a steel. But you can bake pizza in a sheet pan as well, or grill it outdoors. You can even cook a pizza on a stovetop. Baking in the Oven To bake a pizza in an oven, you\u2019ll need either to do it on a stone or metal surface, or in a sheet pan. Either way, you should set the oven to its highest temperature and let it heat it for a full hour before you intend to cook. If you are using a pizza stone, steel or a set of tiles, begin by placing it on the middle rack of the oven before you turn it on, allowing it to preheat for a hour. When you\u2019re ready to cook, carefully place your shaped dough on a lightly floured pizza peel or cutting board, or on the back of a baking pan. Gently shake the peel, board or pan back and forth a few times to make sure the dough can move, then add your toppings. Pick up your pizza peel with the topped pie on top of it, and gently slide the pie onto the stone or tiles, starting at the back of the oven and working your way toward its front. Bake for about four to eight minutes, until the edges are a beautiful golden brown, and the sauce and cheese are bubbling nicely. Slide the peel back under the baked pizza to remove it from the oven, and then slide the pizza onto a cutting board, where it can be cut into slices. If you are using a sheet pan, lightly oil the pan, then stretch the risen dough into the shape of the pan, then top and place in the oven until golden brown and bubbling. Pan-Frying on the Stovetop Cooking a pizza on top of the stove is a simple way to get started in the pizza-making game, and a single ball of dough will yield two pan pizzas. Simply heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, then film it with olive oil. Take one half of a ball of risen pizza dough and press it out into a circle just smaller than the pan. When the oil shimmers, put the dough in the pan and adjust the heat so it browns evenly without burning. Prick the dough all over with the tines of a fork. Cook this round in the pan for a minute or so, then turn it over with the bottom is browned and cover with toppings. Either top the pan with a lid to melt the cheese or run it under a broiler to achieve the same result. Grilling Outdoors Grilling pizza really means grilling one side of a flatbread over fire, then turning it over and topping it. And while you can certainly use our essential pizza dough recipe to do that, a sturdier dough recipe that is less prone to ripping will yield a better result. To cook a pizza on a grill requires some planning. You need to cook one side of the pizza before turning it over and topping it, and cooking the other side. So take time to assemble all the ingredients you\u2019ll need to make the pizzas beforehand. Prepare a hot fire; if your grill grate is clean, you shouldn\u2019t need to oil it. Slide the pizza dough from the peel onto the rack. After a few minutes, use tongs to lift the dough and check whether it\u2019s browning on the bottom. Watch closely so it doesn\u2019t burn. When it\u2019s nicely browned, use the tongs to flip the dough over, then brush it with olive oil and cover it with toppings. Place the lid on the grill for a few minutes more until the cheese is melted. ",

A combination of trade deals, automation and economic recessions sent the number of manufacturing jobs plummeting, with 6 million jobs being lost by 2011. But since then, about half a million jobs have been regained. They\u2019re not the same jobs that left. They're not coming back everywhere, or even in the same places where jobs were lost.

Across the Northeast and in urban centers like Los Angeles and Dallas, only one county in seven has seen factory jobs increase since 2011. Manufacturing does tend to account for a relatively small share of big city jobs, typically about 10 percent or less.

There are more than 330 counties where factory jobs are up more than 20 percent since 2008. Not all manufacturing jobs are created equal Some jobs are unlikely to come back, no matter what.

Food products 1990 2015 Food manufacturing, which includes bakeries and confectioneries, is an exception among manufacturers: Mexico won\u2019t be making America's doughnuts anytime soon.

Transportation equipment 1990 2015 \"U.S. policy should be focusing on the high-value manufacturing that actually has a chance to survive and grow and pay people a good wage,\" Muro said. The poster child for this so-called advanced manufacturing is transportation, especially the building of cars, trucks and aircraft. [ Why Trump gets more hype out of 1,000 jobs than Obama does out of 16 million ] Although still below 1990 employment, transportation manufacturing jobs have rebounded since 2011, and in four years, the industry regained about a third of the jobs lost over the previous two decades. The story of South Carolina's transition from old to advanced manufacturing is told through its quiet redbrick textile mills \u2014\u00a0and its bustling auto and aerospace factories. Four in 10 S.C. manufacturing workers could be found in textile and apparel plants back in 1990. But as that workforce withered under the effects of NAFTA, WTO, automation and other factors, the state gained a BMW auto plant in Spartanburg in 1994. Then in 2007, Boeing arrived with a 787 Dreamliner factory near Charleston. Nearby, Volvo is building a plant that, when completed, will make 100,000 cars a year. \"We are definitely seeing manufacturing jobs come back to the U.S.,\" said Joey Von Nessen, a University of South Carolina economist. But there is a key difference. \"The type of jobs is very different than those lost in the great recession,\" he added. [ Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018dumb market\u2019 position on trade breaks with decades of Republican views ] Now, twice as many people work in transportation as in textiles and apparel, making it South Carolina's largest manufacturing sector. There are similar stories across the country: Newport News, Va., with both auto parts plants and shipyards building two nuclear submarines, added 2,500 manufacturing jobs. Wayne County, Mich., home to suburban Detroit auto plants, added 5,100 jobs. Counties with manufacturing jobs above the national average in 2015 1.1x to 2x ",

    "text": "William Lee , Deanese Williams-Harris and Rosemary Regina Sobol Contact Reporters Three people were killed, including an innocent bystander, and at least nine others were wounded Friday in city shootings. The bystander and a second person who died were among four people shot about 3:30 p.m. near 43rd Street and Rockwell Street in the Brighton Park neighborhood near Shields Elementary school. Authorities said several known gang members were gathered in front of a taco stand on Rockwell when a silver car drove through an alley next to the business and parked across the street at the mouth of an alley. Then at least two gunmen got out of the car and opened fire on the group, fatally striking a 17-year-old boy and a 47-year-old man a short distance away, officials said. An 18-year-old man suffered one gunshot wound and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in serious condition while another 17-year-old boy who was shot in the face and neck was in critical condition at Mount Sinai Hospital, police said.\u00a0\u00a0 The 47-year-old suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead on the scene and the 17-year-old also suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital. At the scene, the body of the bystander, identified by neighbors and Ald. Raymond Lopez, 15th, as \"Arturo,\" was lying in snow underneath a blue covering being dusted with snowfall in a curb outside a corner store called Mercado 43. The man was a well known figure in the neighborhood, who could be seen walking with a limp through the neighborhood, therapy his close friends said due to a stroke he suffered several years ago. \u201cArturo was a fixture on that corner, he was just a happy man,\" Lopez said. A man who grew up in the neighborhood said Arturo cared about the families who lived there and took a dim view of gang strife that had engulfed the area. \u201cHe once told my father \u2018These gang (expletives) are going to kill us one of these days,\u2019\u201d the man said at a convenience store across from Shields school. Neighbors said the man could be found most days walking to the taco stand for a cup of coffee or visiting a nearby business that hosted karaoke. Lopez called the taco stand a \u201cproblem building,\u201d saying it was a well-known hangout for local gang members and said that he'd worked with police and different city agencies since August 2015 to have the business shut down, but without success. \u201cAnd now because of this, we have an innocent man killed. This is unacceptable,\u201d Lopez said. The alderman said he was further troubled by the use of a \u201cmachine pistol\u201d by one of the gunman that he said resembles a handgun, but fires assault rifle ammunition at rapid speeds. A similar weapon was recently recovered in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, another part of Lopez\u2019s ward, but this was the first appearance of the weapon in Brighton Park. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for a weapon like this to be on the street,\u201d Lopez said. At least 30 bullet shell casings were found at the scene. Aside from detectives canvassed the area an hour after the shooting, the block where the shooting occurred was quiet with only one homeowner standing watch as police lights flashed in the distance. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she'd lived on the block more than 10 years and called it a hotbed of gang activity and the longtime home of the Satan\u2019s Disciples gang. She said neighbors didn't dare linger outside so long after a gang shooting in an area local residents called \u201cDevil's Playground.\u201d Brighton Park had had 56 shootings this year, according to data compiled by the Tribune, about 11 more than 2015, and eight homicides, doubling last year's total. \"This is one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city. The snow don\u2019t even be stopping it,\" she said, standing in the snow outside her home, pointing to where a man was killed in front of her home more than a year ago.\u00a0 \u201cThere's definitely going to be a shooting after this,\" she said. \"They do that very well.\u201d Earlier, a teen was killed Friday morning on the West Side. The 17-year-old boy was shot in the chest and hand around 8:40 a.m. in the 600 block of North Long Avenue in South Austin, police said. The boy was walking when an unidentified person began shooting at him. The teen ran to a nearby property where he collapsed and was later pronounced dead.\u00a0 About 6:15 p.m., a 19-year-old man was shot in the 4500 block of South Wood Street, police said. He was walking when someone shot him in the back. He was taken to Stroger Hospital in serious condition, police said. Another attack which left a 27-year-old man wounded happened shortly before 4:30 p.m. in the 10600 block of South Halsted Street in the Washington Heights neighborhood, police said. He was getting into a car when someone shot him in the left foot, left knee and right wrist. He was taken in fair condition at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.\u00a0 Shortly before 4 p.m., four people were shot in the 1300 block of South Kedzie Avenue in the Lawndale neighborhood, police said. Three men and one boy were walking to a bus stop when they heard shots and felt pain, police said. An 18-year-old man was shot in the arm, and another 18-year-old was shot twice in the groin and three times in the thigh. The boy suffered a wound to the right arm, and a 25-year-old man was shot in the right foot, police said. The victims drove to Mount Sinai Hospital where their conditions were stabilized, police said. Just before 1 p.m., a 20-year-old man was shot in the leg in the 3500 block of West Ainslie Street in the Albany Park neighborhood, police said. He was in good condition at Illinois Masonic Medical Center. Police said he was not cooperating with investigators.\u00a0 Check back for updates. ",

(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014The FBI is now backing the CIA\u2019s assessment that Russian hackers sought in part to tilt the election in favor of President-elect Donald Trump when they breached American political institutions resulting in the theft of a trove of sensitive communications, a U.S. official said Friday. President Obama, meanwhile, indicated Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin must have been aware of the cyber attacks. \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,\" Obama told reporters Friday. \"This happened at the highest levels of the Russian government.'' Obama said he was awaiting a complete review of the matter by intelligence and and national security officials before he leaves office next month. Read more: Obama threatens retaliation against Russia for election hacking The FBI's support of the CIA's assessment, according to the official familiar with the bureau's position but not authorized to comment publicly,\u00a0comes after FBI Director James Comey and National Intelligence Director James Clapper had meetings with CIA Director John Brennan earlier this week to review the agency's conclusion. The FBI had indicated as recently as Monday that the CIA\u2019s assessment \u2014 delivered earlier this month to some members of Congress \u2014 may prove accurate but lacked the definitive evidence necessary for the agency to reach such a conclusion. That changed, the official said, after the high-level meetings resulted in a consensus on Russia\u2019s motive, a conclusion that so far has been flatly rejected by Trump and has roiled the capital\u2019s political establishment. The Washington Postfirst reported the development Friday. Russia, which has dismissed the CIA\u2019s findings, was publicly identified in October as having breached the systems of the Democratic National Committee, resulting in theft of a trove of sensitive communications. Those communications were later provided to WikiLeaks and DCLeaks, which published the information in the months and weeks leading up to the general election. The leaks prompted the resignation of Democratic\u00a0National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the eve of the party's national convention in July. The leaks also led supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders to protest that the Democratic primaries were rigged against him. At the time Russia was publicly identified, Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson concluded that the disclosures were \"intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.'' The FBI had stopped short of endorsing the CIA's new assessment that Russia was hoping to boost Trump, the official said, because it had been considering how much weight to ascribe to multiple possible motives: Was Russia attempting to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's ability to govern, betting that she would be elected? Was it retaliation against Clinton for her past criticism of Russian elections? Was it intended to undermine confidence in the American political system? Or was it a combination of all? The official said the bureau continued to weigh those and other options. But in the end, the collective effect of the Russian action was to assist Trump. Read more: ",

    "text": "News Local news Clout Street Cochran just latest 20th Ward alderman in federal crosshairs \u2014 3 of last 4 have been indicted Ald. Willie Cochran, 20th, is charged with 11 counts of wire fraud, two counts of extortion and two counts of bribery, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. Privacy Policy Even in the crowded annals of Chicago City Council malfeasance, Ald. Willie Cochran 's indictment this week on federal criminal charges puts the 20th Ward in some rarefied air. When the federal paperwork hit at the start of Wednesday's council meeting, Cochran, a retired police sergeant turned politician, officially became the third of the past four aldermen from the South Side ward to be indicted while in office. It's the City Council's version of the office of Illinois governor, where four of the nine to previously serve ended up convicted. Cochran maintains his innocence and pledges to keep his seat representing parts of Englewood, Back of the Yards, Washington Park and Woodlawn while he fights the 15-count indictment on charges of wire fraud, extortion and bribery. Given the 20th's history, news of the latest charges was met with something short of shock in the ward \u2014 a patchwork of working class and poor neighborhoods, plus a tonier section south of the University of Chicago \u2014 even among those who aren't convinced Cochran did what the indictment claims. Mattie Butler, the veteran executive director of the Woodlawn East Community and Neighbors group, said that's because of the near-constant parade of aldermen from all over Chicago who've gotten in legal trouble over the past several decades. Twenty-nine aldermen have been convicted of crimes related to their official duties since 1972. \"I don't think it's just this ward, I think the indictment is an indication of broader problems in wards across the city,\" Butler said of the charges. \"Still, I have my doubts about whether he did that, what the indictment says he did.\" Willie Cochran was running for 20th Ward alderman as a political unknown a decade ago when he vowed to steer clear of the graft and corruption that had ensnared so many Chicago politicians over the years. \"Most people in the ward are tired of our public officials being embroiled in one controversy... Willie Cochran was running for 20th Ward alderman as a political unknown a decade ago when he vowed to steer clear of the graft and corruption that had ensnared so many Chicago politicians over the years. \"Most people in the ward are tired of our public officials being embroiled in one controversy... (Jason Meisner, Jeremy Gorner and Hal Dardick) The ward desperately needs a committed advocate in City Hall to overcome the unemployment and business disinvestment that have plagued it, she said. \"It's a very high mountain to climb, and that's not (Cochran's) fault,\" Butler said. Cochran's indictment puts him in the company of 20th Ward predecessors Arenda Troutman and Clifford Kelley, whose charges alleged similar efforts to line their pockets by using the broad ward-level power enjoyed by Chicago aldermen. Cochran is accused of shaking down a liquor store manager in exchange for the alderman's support on an ordinance change, and of taking a bribe in connection with a federal program to clean up vacant buildings. Federal investigators also say he stole tens of thousands of dollars in charitable contributions meant for poor children and seniors in the ward, money he used to gamble and help pay his daughter's college tuition. Cubs as word came down that one of their colleagues who was on hand had been indicted on federal criminal charges. South Side Ald. Willie Cochran already was sitting in... An inimitably Chicago scene played out during Wednesday's City Council meeting as aldermen heaped praise on the world champion Cubs as word came down that one of their colleagues who was on hand had been indicted on federal criminal charges. South Side Ald. Willie Cochran already was sitting in... (John Byrne, Hal Dardick and Bill Ruthhart) Troutman was indicted in 2007 on charges of extortion, bribery, mail fraud and income tax evasion for allegedly shaking down developers and others in return for her support on zoning changes, building permits and the sale of city-owned real estate. She pleaded guilty in 2008 to mail fraud and tax fraud and was sentenced to four years behind bars. Following her arrest by the FBI the month before the election, then-challenger Cochran called for Troutman to resign. \"Most people in the ward are tired of our public officials being embroiled in one controversy after another,\" Cochran said after Troutman's indictment. Kelley was indicted in 1986 as part of the Operation Incubator federal investigation into City Hall corruption. The charges alleged he took a bribe from a trash hauling company after helping the company obtain an option to buy land in the 20th Ward to be used as a waste transfer station. He also was accused of taking another bribe from a con man posing as a representative of a New York bill collection agency vying for city work, along with car repairs, campaign contributions and tickets and transportation to the 1984 and 1985 Super Bowls. Kelley, too, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to a year in prison. (Ernest Jones knocked off Kelley in 1987 and served until he died in office, with then-Mayor Richard M. Daley appointing Troutman.) Che \"Rhymefest\" Smith , a Grammy- and Academy Award-winning songwriter and rapper who forced Cochran into a run-off election in 2011 but lost, said the indictment is no surprise. Cochran, Smith said, is just the latest African-American alderman to be elected in Chicago without his constituents' best interests at heart. \"In many African-American wards, the winning candidates are reliant on city power brokers for support, and the selection is never someone who's an advocate for the community,\" Smith said. \"They do what the powers want them to do, and ultimately they do what they want to do for themselves. You can see it in the narcissism of their personalities.\" \"You're less likely to see aldermen who are disconnected from the community get elected in places like Lincoln Park or the Gold Coast, because somebody who's independently wealthy who is connected to the community is going to either run himself or back another candidate to beat them,\" Smith added. \"Community activists in the 20th Ward don't, for the most part, have the financial wherewithal to come up with the $200,000 or more it takes to run a race for alderman.\" Still, the Rev. Richard Tolliver of St. Edmund's Episcopal Church in Washington Park said as cynical as lots of people are about city politics, many are just as skeptical of the legal system. A large number of Cochran's constituents are going to let the case play out, he said. \"I don't think people are rushing to judge,\" Tolliver said. \"Right now, he's not guilty. On the other hand, this situation is likely to continue to add to the feelings of jadedness many voters are experiencing. We need to have the political will to address some of the systemic loopholes that continue to let these kinds of situations happen.\" Cochran, 64, faces 11 counts of wire fraud, two counts of extortion and two counts of bribery, the most serious of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted. According to the charges, he was the sole signatory on the 20th Ward activities fund, a charity set up to host ward events and parties for constituents. Cochran was charged with using \"a significant portion\" of the donations made over more than four years for personal use, including paying $5,000 toward his daughter's college tuition. He also withdrew about $25,000 from ATMs in or near casinos where he gambled, according to the indictment. He's set to be arraigned Dec. 23 at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. ",

    "text": "Dec 16 2016, 2:50 pm ET Hillary Clinton Singles Out Putin, Comey in Election Loss by Halimah Abdullah advertisement Hillary Clinton told donors on Thursday night that her loss was partly due to U.S. election hacks directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and FBI director James Comey's election-eve letter to Congress related to her use of a private email server. \"Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people\u2026that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this Election,\" Clinton is heard saying in an audio recording first obtained by the New York Times and verified as authentic by several sources present at the event to NBC News. Hillary Clinton speaks during a portrait unveiling ceremony for outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid on Capitol Hill on Dec. 8. Mark Wilson / Getty Images The comments, Clinton's most forceful on the topic, come on the heels of an investigation by NBC News which uncovered Putin's heavy involvement Russia's covert campaign to interfere in the American presidential election. Two senior officials with direct access to the information say new intelligence shows that Putin personally directed how hacked material from Democrats was leaked and used. The officials said the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies. Related: Why Didn't Obama Do More About Russian Election Hack? On Thursday Clinton said she wanted people to know about Putin's impact on her ultimate loss because \"he is determined not only to score a point against me, which he did, but also to undermine our democracy.\" Clinton said she was proud as secretary of state to have stood up to Putin in support of democratic values after the 2011 Russian elections. She also told her supporters that they can't lose heart and they, too, are going to have to stand up for democracy in this country and abroad. Clinton reportedly made no mention of president-elect Donald Trump in her speech. Trump has scoffed at the notion that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election's outcome. \"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?\" he tweeted . \"Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\" On October 7 the Obama administration identified Russia as being behind the hacks. President Barack Obama has vowed that the U.S. will respond to Russia's cyber hacking and is expected to address the matter further during a press conference on Friday. \"I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will \u2014 at a time and place of our own choosing,\" Obama said in the interview with NPR, which aired in full Friday on \"Morning Edition.\" Halimah Abdullah ",

(Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images, Mike Marsland/WireImage) Tilda Swinton wants you to decide for yourself about her conversation with Margaret Cho. Cho revealed in a recent podcast that she had a \"long fight\" with Swinton over her decision to play The Ancient One, previously a Tibetan character, in Marvel's\u00a0Doctor Strange. Cho termed their discussion \"weird,\" said it left her feeling like Swinton's \"house servant\" and ended with the actress asking her not to \"tell anybody.\" Margaret Cho reveals 'weird' call from Tilda Swinton But USA TODAY has obtained what Swinton's\u00a0rep Brian Swardstrom\u00a0says is the \"entire unedited and only conversation\" between the two\u00a0\u2013 and it\u00a0appears largely friendly. On May 13, Swinton begins: \"We've never met, but you've been in my head for years - I'm a fan. I want to ask you a favour now which is sprung out of a truly important social conversation but may be heading for some\u00a0crazy-making (crap).\u00a0 The diversity debate - \u00a0ALL STRENGTH to it\u00a0- has come knocking at the door of Marvel's new movie DR STRANGE. Swinton begins, not ends, her conversation requesting privacy, according to the email chain.\u00a0\"I would really love to hear your thoughts and have a - private - conversation about it. Are you up for this? \u00a0Can we e-mail?\u00a0No wrong answer here,' she writes.\"Tell me to (screw) off if you feel like it.\" Cho responds the same day. \"Sure! I'm a big fan of yours,\" she writes,\u00a0detailing the crux of Doctor Strange's problem, writing that \"the character you played in Dr Strange was originally written as\u00a0a Tibetan man and so there's a frustrated population of Asian Americans who feel the role should have gone to a person of Asian descent. \u00a0The larger part of the debate has to do with the 'whitewashing' of Asian and Asian Americans in film. Cho continues: \"Our stories are told by white actors over and over again and we feel at a loss to know how to cope with it. \u00a0Protest seems to be the only solution- we just want more representative images of ourselves in film. TV is getting better in terms of diversity but film is lagging behind.\" Cho signs off with this: \u00a0\"Anyway - hope this helps! We can totally email and we can be private!\" The two actresses continue to email, with the tone remaining largely\u00a0genial. \"So grateful to have a chance to chew this cud with you,\" says Swinton, explaining\u00a0Marvel's since-public stance that they wanted to change the sex of The Ancient One,\u00a0but \"not wanting to engage with the old 'Dragon Lady' trope, they\u00a0chose to write the character as being of (ancient)\u00a0Celtic origin\u00a0and offered that role\u00a0to me,\" says Swinton. (Critics would later severely condemn this rationale.) Swinton continues: \"I accepted happily, impressed that, for once, they aimed\u00a0to disrupt\u00a0the\u00a0'wisdom must be male' never-ending story - and, by the way,\u00a0for once, wanting to\u00a0feature a woman who's a badass, over 26 and\u00a0not simply bursting out of a bikini.\" Swinton asks: \"How\u00a0best might we focus this thing? \u00a0To offer intelligent and\u00a0empowered thinking..\u00a0 And see something constructive coming out of this moment?\u00a0Ducking the issue is not what I am about. \u00a0I want to meet it, but, if possible, move things forward by how I meet it...I would love to know what ideas you - or anyone you know - \u00a0have of\u00a0something properly progressive to bring to this table. The debate is so important for all of us. It needs to build itself on strong ground.\" On the podcast, Cho indicates she\u00a0felt like Swinton was suggesting she ask the Asian community to back off of the criticism, though that's not spelled out in their\u00a0email correspondence. In her following email,\u00a0Cho does plainly state that\u00a0the studio's efforts to make the blockbuster\u00a0more diverse \"is unfortunately lost in the translation here.\" \"I believe very much that you as an artist are about diversity and your body of work shows that - but this particular case of the Ancient One\u00a0is just another in a long list of 'whitewashed' Asian characters and so you're likely to feel the heat of history,\" writes Cho.\u00a0\"I am not sure what to say other than I am glad you want to meet the issue head on - it's a tough one I know.\" Cho praises opening such dialogue: \"I think that talking about the issue frankly\u00a0- as you have done with me is the right way to go. It's hard I know - people get very angry and it's difficult to know what to do to get around that anger.\" But, she adds: \"you should know that it's anger\u00a0built up over many many years of invisibility within film/tv/media that's just exploded now with this film. And it's not just you -\u00a0It's also directed at Scarlett Johansson for Ghost in the Shell.\u00a0Maybe what's best is the highlight the diversity that you do see in the film and that being why you felt drawn to the project.\u00a0Also acknowledge that you're all about diversity and how you want the films you make to be diverse and how film can benefit from that.\" Cho then suggests\u00a0Swinton try \"getting into producing content that would give Asian American voices a platform...that's really what is being asked for.\" Swinton responds that\u00a0she's currently\u00a0producing South Korean director Bong Joon Hoo's upcoming film, Okja.\u00a0 \"Hey that's great about OKJA!\" says Cho. But in this week's\u00a0podcast, Cho suggests Swinton brought up Okja\u00a0as a point of vindication. \"We\u2019d fight about it and basically it ended with her saying, \u2018Well I\u2019m producing a movie and Steven Yeun is starring,\" said Cho. Vanity Fair has reprinted their entire exchange here . USA TODAY has reached out to multiple representatives\u00a0for Cho for comment. 34 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hQwhuY ",

(Photo: Liu Rui, AP) A U.S. Navy underwater drone operating in international waters was captured by a Chinese warship in the South China Sea,\u00a0Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in a statement on Friday. The drone is not armed and is used for gathering weather and temperature data. The incident occurred Thursday. The drone was launched by the USNS Bowditch, a civilian crewed oceanographic ship that is operated by the Military Sealift Command, off the coast of the Philippines. These types of drones, called gliders, typically collect unclassified data, such as water temperatures and salinity levels. The Bowditch was about to recover the glider when a Chinese Dalang III class Chinese warship approached within 500 yards of the Bowditch, launched a small vessel and snatched the drone out of the water, the Pentagon said. The boat brought the device back to the Chinese warship, which then headed away. The Bowditch contacted the Chinese vessel by radio and demanded the return of the glider. The Chinese ship acknowledged the radio transmission but ignored the request to return it, the Pentagon said. The U.S. government has issued a d\u00e9marche, or diplomatic protest, over the incident, demanding its return. The incident comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations. President-elect Donald Trump has been critical of the Chinese, saying they have gotten the better of trade deals between the two nations. The South China Sea is a region where the Chinese have attempted to extend their influence and military presence. The U.S. has insisted on its right to transit through the region in international waters. 6602 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 148 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hPd1Om ",

    "text": "Email MILWAUKEE --\u00a0The prosecutor who charged a former Milwaukee police officer \u00a0with killing a black man in a shooting that sparked riots in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city said Friday that he\u2019s not trying to send a message to the public about police use-of-force. Sylville Smith WDJT District Attorney John Chisholm said he\u2019s confident the facts support the felony reckless homicide charge against Dominique Heaggan-Brown.\u00a0 Heaggan-Brown shot Sylville Smith, 23, during a traffic stop in August. According to court documents, body cameras Heaggan-Brown and his partner wore showed Smith had a gun but was unarmed when Heaggan-Brown, who is also black, fired the fatal shot.\u00a0 The shooting ignited two nights of riots. The violence followed similar unrest in cities from Ferguson, Missouri, to Baltimore in response to the deaths of black men at the hands of police. The killings sparked the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement calling for major changes in how police deal with minority communities. \u00a0 Heaggan-Brown was fired in October over unrelated charges in a sexual assault case but the city had been waiting for months to see whether prosecutors would charge him in the shooting. Chisholm did just that Thursday morning, when he quietly filed the felony reckless homicide charge against Heaggan-Brown. \u00a0 Police Chief Ed Flynn questioned Chisholm\u2019s decision as early as Thursday evening, saying Heaggan-Brown faced a \u201ccombat situation.\u201d Flynn said he hoped Chisholm had more evidence than he\u2019s released so far. Chisholm addressed reporters for the first time in the matter after Heaggan-Brown made his initial court appearance Friday. The district attorney said he understands Flynn\u2019s perspective but stressed he made the charging decision based on the facts. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to signal to minorities the criminal justice system can treat them fairly. \u201cA criminal prosecution isn\u2019t the forum in which to send a message,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cIs there a legitimate issue in terms of police-community relations? No question about it. And nothing exacerbates it more than police-related shootings. But in an individual case I have an ethical obligation to just look at those facts and ... not to consider extraneous things like public sentiment. I believe strongly we\u2019ve done a thorough job examining all the facts.\u201d According to the criminal complaint, Heaggan-Brown stopped Smith\u2019s vehicle on Aug. 13. Smith fled on foot between nearby houses with a gun in his hand. Heaggan-Brown and his partner\u2019s body cameras showed Smith fall to the ground, get up and raise his gun while facing Heaggan-Brown, the complaint said. Heaggan-Brown fired and hit Smith in the arm. The video shows Smith then threw his gun over a fence, although Heaggan-Brown told state agents he thought the gun flew out of Smith\u2019s hand, the complaint said. Heaggan-Brown then fired a second shot into Smith\u2019s chest. Both shots were fired in less than two seconds. Heaggan-Brown said he thought Smith was reaching for another weapon in his waistband so he fired the second time. The video, however, shows Smith reaching for his waistband after the second shot and that he was unarmed at that time, according to the complaint. Chisholm has refused to release the video, saying the footage is evidence. The shooting sparked two nights of riots on Milwaukee\u2019s predominantly black north side. Six businesses were burned along with a squad car. One man was shot but survived his wound. About 40 people in all were arrested in the three nights following Smith\u2019s death. \u00a0 Heaggan-Brown sat silently during his brief court appearance Friday. Wearing shackles and a yellow anti-suicide smock, he spoke only to say \u201cyes\u201d when court Commissioner Grace Flynn asked if he understood he would have to give a DNA sample. ",

    "text": "House GOP Quietly Closes Flint, Mich. Water Investigation By matthew daly, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 16, 2016, 2:17 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder speaks during a year-end interview on Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016, in his office at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing. Snyder said he wants municipalities and labor unions to jointly study how best to tackle retiree health care costs after Republican lawmakers removed a contentious proposal to aggressively curb the benefits from the postelection agenda. (AP Photo/David Eggert) 0 Shares Email Congressional Republicans quietly closed a year-long investigation into Flint, Michigan's crisis over lead in its drinking water, faulting both state officials and the Environmental Protection Agency for contamination that has affected nearly 100,000 residents. In letters to fellow Republicans, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said Friday that Michigan and federal officials were slow in detecting high levels of lead in the water and did not act fast enough once the problem was discovered. The committee findings offer no new information and essentially summarize what emerged during several high-profile hearings earlier this year. \"The committee found significant problems at Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality and unacceptable delays in the Environmental Protection Agency's response to the crisis,\" wrote Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. \"The committee also found that the federal regulatory framework is so outdated that it sets up states to fail.\" Flint's drinking water became tainted when the city switched from the Detroit water system and began drawing from the Flint River in April 2014 to save money. The impoverished city was under state control at the time. Regulators failed to ensure the water was treated properly and lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply. Chaffetz cites \"a series of failures at all levels of government\" that \"caused and then exacerbated the water crisis.\" While the Republican chairman signaled the apparent conclusion of the inquiry \u2014 Congress ended its session last week for a three-week holiday break \u2014 the panel's senior Democrat insisted the investigation continues and accused Michigan's Republican governor of stonewalling the committee over documents related to the Flint water crisis. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, senior Democrat on the oversight panel, said he wants Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to produce key Flint-related documents within 30 days. Cummings said Snyder and his administration have obstructed the committee's investigation into the Flint crisis for a year, refusing to provide \u2014 or even search for \u2014 key documents. Snyder's intransigence has thwarted committee efforts to answer critical questions about what he knew as the crisis unfolded and why he didn't act sooner to fix Flint's water problem, Cummings said. \"Requiring Governor Snyder to finally comply with the committee's request will allow us to complete our investigation and offer concrete findings and recommendations to help prevent a catastrophe like this from happening again,\" Cummings wrote to Chaffetz. \"In contrast, allowing Governor Snyder to flout the committee's authority will deny the people of Flint the answers they deserve.\" It's highly unlikely Republicans who control Congress will continue the inquiry next year. A spokeswoman for Snyder said the governor's office has provided the committee with hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and the committee has wrapped up its investigation. \"In Michigan, we are working hard each day to continue Flint's full recovery with funding for pipe replacement and health care for residents,\" spokeswoman Anna Heaton said, adding that it is \"not productive to spend time engaging in partisan political attacks from out-of-state politicians\" such as Cummings. After nearly a year of haggling, Congress cleared legislation last week to provide $170 million to deal with the Flint crisis and help other communities with lead-tainted water. In his letters, Chaffetz asked GOP lawmakers to consider redirecting hundreds of millions of dollars now targeted to fighting climate change to upgrade the nation's drinking water pipes and other infrastructure. Chaffetz also asked for closer congressional oversight of the EPA, which monitors lead and copper pipes nationwide. 0 Shares ",

The stunning decision, announced late Thursday, came after a complaint was lodged earlier in the week and the Ivy League school found \"several materials\" that were deemed \"vulgar and offensive, as well as misogynistic and racist in nature.\" Men's swimming and diving season has been suspended. https://t.co/JkabeX8s1f \u2014 Princeton University (@Princeton) December 16, 2016 \"The behavior that we have learned about is simply unacceptable. It is antithetical to the values of our athletic program and of the University, and will not be tolerated,\" the school's director of athletics, Mollie Marcoux Samaan, said in a statement. Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber added that he supports the suspension of a team that has \"failed to respect the values of this University and the dignity of other students.\" Nassau Hall on the Princeton Unversity campus in Princeton, New Jersey. Daniel Hulshizer / AP file Princeton officials did not describe the nature of the comments. A university spokesman declined to provide further information to The Daily Princetonian , citing privacy concerns and respect for \"members of the women's swimming and diving team.\" It's unclear whether the women's team was targeted in the listserv comments. The men's team had two more meets left this season, as well as the Ivy League Championships in February. Their current record is 2-2 , placing them in the middle of their division. As a result of the team's behavior, the New Jersey-based school said other actions could be taken aimed at \"education and positive culture building for the team.\" In addition, athletes will receive training next month about using social media, Samaan said. This is the latest incident involving an Ivy League school suspending one of its sports teams. Harvard said in November it was sidelining its men's soccer team for the rest of the season after the discovery of sexually explicit \"reports\" that graded female freshmen players. Erik Ortiz ",

By Amber Phillips December 16 at 3:15 PM Follow byamberphillips North Carolina's Democratic governor-elect Roy Cooper says Republican lawmakers are trying to hinder his work by moving to strip powers from his office. (Reuters) Despite\u00a0protests, widespread criticism\u00a0and a threat by the governor-elect to challenge in court any moves that he believes would unconstitutionally limit his power, the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature has passed\u00a0changes that would severely limit the incoming Democratic governor's power. The legislature approved\u00a0a proposal along party lines Friday that would effectively give Republicans control of the state Board of Elections during election years and split partisan control of local boards of elections, as opposed to giving the governor\u2019s party the majorities on those panels.\u00a0Outgoing Gov. Pat McCrory (R)\u00a0signed the bill into law Friday, despite not issuing any comment on the drama wracking North Carolina politics\u00a0since\u00a0Wednesday. The legislature also looks poised to pass, for the first time in decades, a law requiring\u00a0the governor to get approval by the state Senate for his Cabinet appointees and ending his ability to appoint members to the board of trustees of the powerful UNC school system. The bill would also drastically reduce\u00a0the number of state employees the governor\u00a0can directly hire and fire from 1,500 to 425. The measures were just two of several bills the legislature considered\u00a0in a last-minute, year-end special session reducing the governor\u2019s influence in state government, the judicial branch, the education system and elections oversight, while strengthening the GOP-dominated legislature's influence in all those areas. Immediate reaction to the special session\u00a0appeared sharply divided on partisan lines. Republican legislative leaders said the changes\u00a0were long overdue to realign\u00a0constitutional power in the legislature, though they admitted a Democrats'\u00a0election had accelerated the timetable for the changes. Democratic lawmakers and activists derided their Republican colleagues' attempts at a\u00a0\u201cpower grab\ufffd? and urged North Carolinians to come to Raleigh to protest. Nonpartisan watchdogs, like Bob Hall with Democracy North Carolina, said the changes go \"far beyond the normal partisan wrangling and change of power.\" The timing in particular sparked\u00a0widespread criticism that Republicans\u00a0were playing politics after losing the governor's election.\u00a0Less than two weeks ago, McCrory conceded to Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) in the nation's closest governor's race of 2016. The Raleigh News & Observer reported hundreds of protesters heeded Democrats'\u00a0calls\u00a0and packed the capitol on Thursday and, to a lesser degree, on Friday. Several times, police arrested protesters after they refused to stop booing, chanting and cheering from the public galleries while lawmakers debated the bills. A reporter for an advocacy group who was in the galleries claimed to have been arrested as well. Each time there was a disturbance, GOP lawmakers closed the public galleries, pointing to a live stream people\u00a0could watch instead. Arrests underway as protesters disrupt House debate with chants of \"all political power comes from the people.\" #ncpol #ncga pic.twitter.com/hoCAhvINRS \u2014 Colin Campbell (@RaleighReporter) December 16, 2016 House kicking all members of the public out of gallery for second day in a row. #ncga #ncpol pic.twitter.com/yvoeFKIQJG \u2014 Colin Campbell (@RaleighReporter) December 16, 2016 Much of what's happened over the past few days\u00a0caught Democrats by surprise. In his waning hours in office, McCrory convened lawmakers in\u00a0Raleigh to pass a $200 million relief package for Hurricane Matthew and wildfire cleanup. Lawmakers passed the package, ended the special session Wednesday \u2014 then promptly started a new one and declined to say what it was about until the controversial bills were introduced. In a news conference Thursday with local reporters, Cooper told the legislature to \u201cgo home\ufffd? and warned they could be overstepping their bounds, politically if not constitutionally. \u201cThis is about thwarting the governor\u2019s ability to move us forward,\ufffd? he said, promising to sue lawmakers for passing any law he deemed unconstitutional. \u201cMost people might think that this is a partisan power grab. But this is more ominous.\ufffd? Gov.-elect Roy Cooper holds a news conference to criticize efforts by Republicans to cut the power of the governor's office . (Chris Seward/News & Observer via AP) It's an open question what the courts will make of these changes, said UNC law professor Michael Gerhardt. It's notable, he said, that McCrory never said over the last four years: \u201cI think I'm too powerful\u00a0and you should look for ways to weaken my office.\ufffd? The last time GOP\u00a0lawmakers called a high-profile special session, in March, they ended up ramming through one of the state's most controversial laws in recent memory: a bill limiting what public bathrooms transgender people can use and municipalities' ability to pass anti-discrimination laws for LGBT people. National backlash to that bill contributed to McCrory's upset. He was the only governor in 2016 to lose his seat and the only governor in North Carolina history to lose reelection.\u00a0 (Notably, Republicans in the state legislature kept their supermajority in November.) Power tug-of-wars in\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0aren't unprecedented. In\u00a01972, when Jim Holshouser became the first Republican governor of North Carolina in the 20th century, Democrats in the legislature moved swiftly to\u00a0give the\u00a0Democratic lieutenant governor more control over the state.\u00a0A decade later, the Democratic-controlled legislature tried to roll back those powers after\u00a0voters elected the state's first lieutenant Republican\u00a0governor of the\u00a020th century. Republican Jim Martin was governor during that tumultuous time, yet\u00a0he told\u00a0 told the News & Observer he thinks his party's proposal to take away the governor's ability to\u00a0appoint members to the UNC board of trustees goes \u201ctoo far.\ufffd? Indeed, the consensus in North Carolina political circles is that no\u00a0power-stripping attempt\u00a0has been as\u00a0brazen as this one. And it underscores how contentious relations between the governor and the legislature are expected to be next year. Cooper ousted McCrory by some 10,000 votes out of more than 4 million cast, and Republicans in the state legislature can veto\u00a0Cooper anytime they want. Before Cooper was even sworn in, they signaled they have little intention of playing nice with him. The message Friday was clear, Gerhardt said: \u201cWe have a legislature intent on keeping the score politically.\ufffd? politics ",

The launch of Mylan\u2019s long-promised generic alternative is expected to still generate millions of dollars in revenue for the company while also protecting its market share against current and future competition. Mylan NV said Friday that it will charge $300 for the generic version of its life-saving injections, which come in a two-pack. The generic version will reach retail pharmacies starting next week. The list price of an EpiPen two-pack, which is stocked by schools and parents of children with severe allergies, has grown to $608, up from about $100 seven years ago. Earlier this year, a Congressional panel grilled Mylan CEO Heather Bresch about the soaring cost , which she has blamed in part on an outdated and complex system for pricing drugs. In August, the company said it\u2019s also expanding its patient assistance program , which offers coupons and other savings to reduce out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and underinsured patients and families.\u00a0 \u201cMylan also is doubling eligibility for our patient assistance program to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. This means a family of four making up to $97,200 would pay nothing out of pocket for their EpiPen Auto-Injector,\u201d the company said in a statement.

John Bompengo/AP hide caption toggle caption John Bompengo/AP A man crosses a road near burning debris during September's election protests in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. John Bompengo/AP The Democratic Republic of Congo has ordered telecom companies to block social media sites ahead of protests planned for Monday. That's the day that President Joseph Kabila's final constitutionally sanctioned presidential term expires, though he has delayed elections until April 2018. \"The social media shutdown on the eve of the end of President Kabila's mandate is a blatant attempt to keep the Congolese people in the dark at a critical time, and must be rescinded immediately,\" Amnesty International said in a statement. The temporary blackout request applies to Facebook, Twitter, Skype, YouTube and LinkedIn, according to a copy of the order seen by Reuters. Tension has been ratcheting up in the DRC and protesters have been rallying regularly since Kabila indicated that he intended to remain in office. The presidential vote was initially scheduled for November, but was pushed back following a deal between the government and some opposition leaders, according to Reuters, which adds that the main opposition bloc opposes the delay. Observers had hoped that Monday would mark the country's first-ever peaceful transfer of power. Mvemba Phezo Dizolele of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies laid out the background on Weekend Edition in October : \"President Kabila has been in power for 15 years. He came to power after his father was assassinated. He served five years and then after that a new constitution was put in place via a referendum. He was elected. But the Constitution only allows him two terms, five years each. And now he's trying to wiggle his way to stay for longer.\" Article continues after sponsorship The election commission said it was delaying the election because of a lack of funds and other logistical issues \u2014 but Phezo Dizolele said that's by design, because the government did not provide funding for the election. State Department spokesperson Mark Toner said the U.S. is \"deeply concerned\" about possible violence and unrest in Congo in the coming days. The department called on the DRC government and opposition to come to an \"inclusive agreement\" about a timeline for holding elections. \"There is a grave risk that Congo could descend into widespread violence and chaos in the coming days, with potentially volatile repercussions across the region,\" Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement . \"President Kabila is the one person who can prevent this, by making a clear, public commitment to step down and by ending the violent repression by those under his command.\" The government has suspended the country's soccer league competition over fear of unrest. As the BBC reports, soccer matches have sometimes taken on a political tone, and \"one popular chant at games warns Kabila that his mandate is over.\" The secretary-general of the sports ministry, Barthelemy Okito, told the broadcaster that \"this general situation in the country risks spilling into the stadiums.\" Bloomberg published an investigation Thursday that points to a possible reason why Kabila would want to hang on to power: his family's extensive business interests. Here's more: \"Together the Kabilas have built a network of businesses that reaches into every corner of Congo's economy and has brought hundreds of millions of dollars to the family, a Bloomberg News investigation has found. The sprawling network may help explain why the president is ignoring pleas by the U.S., the European Union and a majority of the Congolese people to hand over power next week, though his advisers dispute this. \"...Kabila and his siblings have assembled an international business network stretching across at least 70 companies, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of thousands of company documents and court filings as well as dozens of interviews with bankers, businessmen, miners, farmers and former government officials.\" The tensions in the DRC come as Gambia also faces a leadership crisis . The country's election authorities says its leader of 22 years, Yahya Jammeh, lost the vote earlier this month. But he refuses to cede power, citing supposed \"irregularities.\" Also this month, Ghana held an election where the opposition candidate Nana Akufo-Addo won and the incumbent leader, John Mahama, conceded. Ghana has a history of peaceful transitions of power. ",

    "text": "Trump Moves to Cancel Deals in Azerbaijan, Georgia By bernard condon and jeff horwitz, associated press NEW YORK \u0097 Dec 16, 2016, 6:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Obama Vows Retaliations Against Russians for Election Cyber Attacks 0 Shares Email The Trump Organization has canceled a licensing deal for a hotel in Azerbaijan and is taking steps to do the same for a project in neighboring Georgia, part of recent efforts by the president-elect to extricate his business from thorny relationships five weeks before he takes office. Both projects either involved or were associated with people tied to politics, partnerships that could have raised problems once Donald Trump becomes president. The moves by Trump's company follow a cancellation earlier this week of a licensing deal for a hotel in Brazil. The Trump Organization also recently shut down four companies registered in Delaware that had no business operations but appeared tied to Saudi Arabia , possibly vehicles for future projects in the country. Trump lawyer Alan Garten said Friday that developers in the projects in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Brazil failed to meet terms of licensing deals. He described the moves as \"normal housekeeping\" and not part of a strategy to reduce potential conflicts of interests. He said the Trump Organization had no moves underway to cancel any other overseas ventures. Government ethics experts have been urging Trump to sell his vast holdings and hand the cash to someone with no ties to the president-elect to invest in a way unknown to him, following the practice of most recent presidents. They say ridding himself of his ownership stake in his business, not just managerial control, is the only way to assure he won't put private profit ahead of the public interest in shaping tax, regulatory and foreign policies. Trump has resisted such a clear break. He has tweeted that he would leave managerial control of his business to his two adult sons and some executives. He said he will hold a news conference next month to discuss details. Trump has stakes in about 500 companies in more than 20 countries around the globe, though many of the foreign ventures involve him just lending his name to buildings owned by others. In Azerbaijan, Trump's partner drew the scrutiny of The Associated Press and other news outlets amid questions about corruption and the country's status as a waypoint for money laundering. The partner, Anar Mammadov, is the son of Azerbaijan's transportation minister. The father was described in leaked American diplomatic cables as \"notoriously corrupt, even for Azerbaijan.\" Though the exterior of the project has been largely constructed, it disappeared from a list of planned Trump Organization projects on the company's website last year amid construction delays and questions about the strength of Anar Mammadov's finances. Trump earned between $2.5 million and $2.8 million in hotel management fees from the unopened hotel, according to the financial disclosures filed by his campaign. Trump licensing deals generally involve the receipt of a significant minority stake in the property, too. The Georgia project is for a tower in the Black Sea resort town of Batumi. Trump lawyer Garten said the president-elect's company sent a \"default notice\" earlier this month to the developer because it had not lived up to terms of the licensing deal. Garten described the move as typically a first step to canceling a deal. Just last week, Trump's development partner told Bloomberg News that the long-stalled project would go ahead, and that \"talks are on.\" In Brazil, the Trump Organization had a deal with a developer putting up a hotel in Barra da Tijuca, an upscale suburb of Rio de Janeiro. The hotel was supposed to be finished in time for the Rio Olympics in August, but only a portion of it is operational even today. In October, prosecutors in Brazil said they were investigating millions of dollars in questionable investments in the hotel by two small Brazilian pension funds. The probe is part of a larger investigation into corruption in Brazilian pension funds. The decision was made because the project was behind schedule, Trump spokeswoman Christine Lin said in a statement. The change took effect on Thursday. She did not answer follow-up questions on whether the investigation prompted the decision. The Rio hotel is owned by LSH Barra. In a statement Friday, that company said the parting was amicable and was unrelated to the corruption probe. Spearheading the project was Paulo Figueiredo Filho, grandson of Joao Figueiredo, the last of the dictators who ran Brazil between 1964 and 1985. In a Facebook post earlier this week, Figueiredo said he was no longer involved in the project. He said he lamented Trump was pulling out, but that his admiration for him hadn't \"changed one millimeter,\" and expressed hope of doing deals with him again. Another Trump project in Brazil, Trump Towers Rio, is also being examined as part of pension investigation. Announced in 2012, construction of the office towers has not begun. \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Writers Peter Prengaman and Mauricio Savarese contributed to this report from Rio de Janeiro.

(Photo: Uber Technologies) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Uber says it won't comply with a California Department of Motor Vehicles demand that it get a permit to test its self-driving cars in San Francisco. The\u00a0DMV on Wednesday sent the company a cease-and-desist letter saying it must stop its self-driving car tests in the state. But on Friday Uber revved its engines, saying it would continue testing despite the DMV's stance. Uber's position is that the semi-autonomous car system it is testing here\u00a0is really\u00a0no different from current\u00a0advanced driver assistance systems available now for owners of Teslas and other cars that help with parking and collision avoidance. In that light, Uber doesn't believe it needs a permit because what it's working on doesn't meet the DMV requirements for a truly autonomous vehicle, which would be one that drives without the active, physical control or monitoring of a human being. The permitting process \"doesn\u2019t apply to us\" because \"you don\u2019t need to get belts and suspenders or whatever else if you\u2019re wearing a dress,\" Anthony Levandowski,\u00a0who runs Uber's autonomous car programs, said in a press call Friday afternoon. \u201cWe cannot in good conscience\ufffd? comply with a regulation that the company doesn\u2019t believe applies to it, he said. The DMV\u00a0cease-and-desist letter said that under the California Vehicle Code, an autonomous vehicle must have a permit to ensure that \"those testing the vehicle have provided an adequate level of financial responsibility, have adequately trained qualified test drivers on the safe operation of the autonomous technology; and will notify the DMV when the vehicles\u00a0have been involved in a collision.\" if Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action,\u00a0 DMV attorney Brian Soublet wrote in a letter addressed to Levandowski. As least\u00a0 20 other companies \u00a0have applied for and received the DMV permits to test on California roads, including\u00a0Google, Tesla, Ford and Nvidia. Uber isn't\u00a0picking a fight, said Levandowski, but is taking a stand. The technology it employs is already \u201ccommonplace on thousands of cars being driven today in the Bay area,\ufffd? he said. Uber has been testing its self-driving cars in San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Pa., for more than a month. In San Francisco, the ride-hailing company is using 11 sensor-packed Volvo XC90 SUVs. Some are meant to pick up\u00a0customers, others will be used to\u00a0log mapping and sensor research miles. In both instances, the cars are not capable of being driven without active physical control and monitoring, according to Uber. Levandowski said Uber has asked the DMV what is different about its technology compared with Tesla's, which have an Autopilot\u00a0partially self-driving feature,\u00a0but hasn\u2019t received an answer. The California DMV wasn't immediately available for comment. For Uber, the question is what, specifically, is the distinction between a semi-autonomous and a fully autonomous vehicle. Levandowski said he didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat threshold you need to cross to go over\ufffd? to become fully autonomous. \u201cIs it being able to make sharp turns?\ufffd? he asked. Uber has been welcomed in Pittsburgh, where it maintains a large facility and where it is also testing its self-driving technology. Asked why the company felt the need to test in California where it was constrained by regulations, Levandowski answered that he went to the University of California-Berkeley, lives in nearby Oakland and works in San Francisco. \u201cWe could also go test it on the dark side of the moon, but it\u2019s more relevant to test it in the place that we think has the most relevance in our lives,\ufffd? he said. Hands at 5 and 7 o'clock When Uber tests its cars, it has people sitting in both the driver\u2019s seat and the front passenger seat, both of whom are monitoring what the vehicle is doing and thinking. \u201cWhen the vehicle is operating, they are instructed to have their hands on the wheel. They have them in the 5 and 7 o\u2019clock positions,\ufffd? Levandowski said. In addition, just as in cars used in Driver\u2019s Ed, there\u2019s a secondary set of controls on the passenger side, \u201cso just like an instructor\u00a0they\u2019re able to take over for the driver,\ufffd? he said. Uber currently is not working toward a vehicle that has no steering wheel, pedals or need for a human driver, Levandowski said. Rather, it is\u00a0pursuing technology that provides a significant level of driver assistance while demanding driver oversight. The current\u00a0tug of war over the testing permit speaks to the\u00a0evolving nature of self-driving car regulations. Government agencies have spent much of 2016 trying to set guidelines\u00a0in order to avoid a patchwork of self-driving cars rules that vary by state, which risks making a driverless car legal in one state and illegal in the next. Earlier this fall, Department of Transportation secretary Anthony Foxx issued a 110-page document aimed at\u00a0steering tech and automotive companies down the same autonomous car lane. A growing number of tech and automotive companies have joined the self-driving car race, with Ford announcing earlier this year that it plans to build a ride-sharing focused self-driving car with no need for a driver by 2021.

The Army also instituted a new procedure that prompts the review of the security clearances of top brass to be triggered by investigations of misconduct, Fanning said Friday. The new approach to clearances, which grant troops and civilians access to national security secrets, stems from a USA TODAY report on a senior officer fired from his job last spring but allowed to retain his clearance for several months. Lt. Gen. Edward Carbon will examine the recent spate of top officers felled by misdeeds, and, one, Maj. Gen. John Rossi, who killed himself, Fanning said. \u201cThis has hit the general officer corps pretty hard,\u201d Fanning said of the suicide. Fanning stressed that the overall number complaints lodged against the Army\u2019s top officers and\u00a0senior civilians has remained relatively low, and dipped in the most recent reporting period, fiscal year 2016, which ended on Sept. 30. The vast majority of that group of about 560 senior officials perform their duties honorably, he said. Maj. Gen. David Haight \u00a0(Photo: Army) Data do, however, show what Fanning referred to as \u201can uptick\u201d in extramarital affairs and other misbehavior. An internal Army report found that \u201cmost concerning is that seven allegations of sexual misconduct, inappropriate relationships and sexual harassment were substantiated in FY16. This constituted a significant increase from the two allegations involving sexual misconduct that were substantiated in FY15. These types of cases have a significant negative impact on the Army and its image.\u201d The Army has been rocked several high-profile cases of top officers felled by extramarital affairs, carousing and suicide. Among the findings of investigators: Maj. Gen. David Haight, the \u201cswinging general,\u201d had an 11-year affair and led a \u201cswinger lifestyle\u201d; Maj. Gen. Ron Lewis, who had been the three-star adviser to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, frequented strip clubs, got drunk in public and had improper interactions with women; Rossi took his own life in July, just days before he was to be become a three-star general. Fanning speculated that the multiple combat tours over the last 15 years of soldiers like Haight, and their long absences from their families, may have contributed to their misconduct. \u201cWe want to have a better understanding of the impact that has on our senior officers, and look for ways that we can mitigate any causes or linkages that we see,\u201d Fanning said.

A plan to add one car pool and express toll lanes to Interstate 290 has been identified as the Illinois Department of Transportation 's preferred option for the roadway, officials announced. During an advisory group meeting Wednesday at the Carleton Hotel in Oak Park , IDOT officials provided an... (Steve Schering) Harmening told Hickey in an Aug. 11 letter that Emergency Traffic Patrol management had implemented controls to prevent fraudulent reporting by drivers and that all drivers had been retrained. Emergency Traffic Patrol officers are supposed to assist stranded drivers on state highways. Officers may need to change tires, provide emergency gas or jump-start batteries. Shealey had been investigated by IDOT auditors for filing false reports and was suspended for 10 days in 2012. The inspector general's office then began a probe to see if there were other problems in the unit. The investigation also found drivers leaving their jobs for long periods while they were supposed to be on duty. Shealey, for example, was found to be off work for more than three hours on June 17, 2013, and more than five hours on June 18, 2013. Instead of working, he was found to be in restaurants or gas stations or parked on side streets, the report found. Another driver was found to have repeatedly passed motorists on the side of the road but filed false reports claiming he was giving help. A supervisor who was fired, Zenon McHugh, admitted to investigators that he had heard \"shop talk\" among drivers about falsifying assist reports but had not inquired about them. McHugh also told investigators, \"If no one is looking, it's not a problem,\" the inspector general's office reported. McHugh could not be reached for comment. But IDOT later issued a statement: \"The inspector general investigation was ongoing when the new administration arrived. Once we had the results, the Illinois Department of Transportation began to take immediate action and worked independently to institute several changes to ensure that this never happens again, including firings, suspensions and establishing new protocols to hold employees to the highest possible standards. Our top priority always will be the safety of the traveling public. We will implement other changes as necessary to keep that commitment.\" In 2014, all but two of the drivers cited in the investigation and all but one of the supervisors made more than $100,000 annually, the report said.

Worth television station. The elector, Chris Suprun, is not employed by an air ambulance service that he lists on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, according to WFAA. And a second paramedic firm he said he currently worked for went out of business eight years ago. State records show Suprun is a licensed paramedic. The news report also questions a key part of Suprun\u2019s biography: his work as a first responder on Sept. 11, 2001. An anonymous source told the station that Suprun had claimed to respond to the terrorist attack at the Pentagon from his post with the Manassas Park Fire Department in Northern Virginia, but the department said it didn\u2019t hire Suprun until October of that year. In 2012, Suprun told a Philadelphia newspaper that he responded to the Pentagon as a volunteer firefighter with the Dale City Fire Department, also in Northern Virginia. The Texas TV station updated its story Friday afternoon after Suprun, on Reddit, said he worked for Dale City at the time of the attacks. However, the station said Suprun did not list the Dale City job on a 7-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9 he recently gave to potential employers in Texas. Suprun did not respond to the station\u2019s requests for comment, and two public relations firms representing him said he would not be available for an interview, according to the story. \"Federal court records show Suprun has spent the last five years in bankruptcy while his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says he was working. He even collected unemployment during part of it, court records show. Suprun was just released from bankruptcy supervision this month,\" the report states. In an op-ed published by The New York Times on Dec. 5 , Suprun said he would not vote for Trump when the Electoral College meets on Monday because he doesn't believe Trump is qualified for the office.

Chicago's golf project is a $30-million renovation of an 18-hole championship golf course. Teddy Greenstein Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune On a gorgeous August day, Tiger Woods halted his top-secret visit to Chicago's South Side to ask this question: Where are the kids? Woods and Mark Rolfing led a motorcade of a dozen golf carts at Jackson Park and South Shore, two city-run, century-old courses with enormous potential. Nearby, teenagers shot hoops and played tennis, not golf. Where are the kids? \"He said it 10 times,\" said Rolfing, the NBC/Golf Channel analyst and DeKalb native. After Woods' cart had to zoom past oncoming traffic at South Jeffrey Avenue, which bisects Jackson Park, the 14-time major winner said to Rolfing: \"Let me get this straight. You're going to do what?\" Woods' skepticism was warranted. For decades, Chicago's golf impresarios have wondered if it would be possible to recast Jackson Park and the lakeside South Shore into a dazzling course that could host a premium PGA Tour event such as the BMW Championship . Finally, the answer is yes. (Teddy Greenstein) As first reported by the Tribune, Woods has committed to be the lead designer. In a statement released by TGR Design, Woods said: \"This project can create incredible possibilities for the community on the South Side. We want to design a course that everyone will enjoy.\" And on Sunday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel will announce the formation of the Chicago Parks Golf Alliance (CPGA), a nonprofit charged with improving Chicago Park District courses and golf facilities, expanding youth golf programs and, most significantly, raising money to make the Jackson Park/South Shore project a reality. The project comes with a price tag of about $30 million, not including the cost of building a tunnel at 67th Street to connect the courses and another under South Jeffrey. Chicago Park District Superintendent Michael Kelly said the goal is to have an 80/20 percent split of private and public money. The $60 million Maggie Daley Park was funded with $40 million from the park district and $20 million in private donations, according to the city. Groundbreaking at South Shore is aimed for the spring, with hopes to complete the 18-hole championship course, plus either a short course or par-3 course, in 2020. Jackson Park will remain open in 2017 and 2018, and the yet-to-be-named championship course will remain public, with discounted tee times for local residents. Kelly said the goal is to keep resident green fees below $50, adding: \"This is a really exciting time if you are a golf nut in Chicago. For far too long, you've watched droves of Chicagoans leave the city to play golf in the suburbs.\" Emanuel is not a golfer, but Kelly said the mayor understands the sport's power as an economic engine. \"Restoring these historic golf courses will create another economic and recreational asset for the South Side,\" Emanuel said in a statement. Tiger Woods will help design a golf complex project for the Jackson Park and South Shore courses. The CPGA will partner with the Western Golf Association in two important ways: to promote caddie programs that could yield college scholarships and to customize the property so it's well-suited to host a tournament such as the 2021 BMW Championship, a FedEx Cup playoff event. Conway Farms in Lake Forest will host the BMW in 2017. It moves to Aronimink in suburban Philadelphia in 2018 and to Medinah in 2019, the final year of the current WGA/BMW agreement. \"We'd look forward to having another option in Chicago, a championship-style course that has a tremendous location and views of the city,\" said Vince Pellegrino, senior vice president of the WGA, who envisions using Soldier Field and McCormick Place to park cars. An initial routing plan obtained by the Tribune has the No. 1 tee box at Jackson Park, not far from the planned $500 million Barack Obama Presidential Center. Sources said President Obama became personally involved in the Jackson Park/South Shore project when he placed a call to Woods, encouraging him to serve as lead designer. Woods has designed six courses. His latest, BlueJack National outside Houston, was named best new private course of 2016 by Golf Digest. The Jackson Park/South Shore course will stretch to between 7,300 and 7,600 yards, with plans for a tee shot over the beach just east of the South Shore Cultural Center. \"The course will have tremendous shot values, which is obviously very important to Tiger,\" said Rolfing, who spearheaded the project and will lead the CPGA. \"This will be his first design that gets tested in competition; what his colleagues and peers think will be important to him.\" Woods has thrived as a player in Chicago, winning two PGA Championships at Medinah (1999, 2006) and the Western Open/BMW Championship five times (1997, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2009). \"I appreciate the support of Chicago-area fans,\" Woods said. \"They know golf and have been a big part of my victories at both Medinah and Cog Hill . I hope this project will draw more local kids to the game in this fantastic sports town.\" tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com ",

In his final press conference of 2016, the president also blamed Russia, Iran and Syrian President Bashar Assad for the ongoing violence in the city at the center of a grinding civil war. \u201cThe world shall not be fooled, and the world will not forget,\u201d Obama said. Obama spoke in the White House press briefing room and faced questions of a variety of topics including allegations of Russian hacking in the U.S. election. The president pushed back on statements he was letting Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cget away with\u201d hacking the U.S. election. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of squabbling,\u201d Obama told reporters. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve said is the facts.\u201d Obama was asked how the U.S. might respond to cyberattacks related to the election that the U.S. intelligence community has blamed on Russia. President-elect Donald Trump has rejected that assessment while accusing the Obama administration of trying to delegitimize his election victory. Obama began his press conference by touting his achievements from his time in office, noting that the unemployment rate has decreased and higher rates of insured people under his healthcare overhaul. Obama said he was leaving the country \"stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started.\" But he's reminding the public that there's more to be done on the country's biggest problems. He says he's going to continue working to push the agenda of his administration after leaving office. Following Friday\u2019s press conference, Obama will depart for his annual family vacation in Hawaii. \u00a0 Advertisement ",

Joe Manchin, D-W.V., speaks during a press conference after meeting with fellow Democratic Senators, on Capitol Hill, July 9, 2013, in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer, Getty Images Email Moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u00a0says he\u2019ll support some of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet nominations during the Senate confirmation process, defying many of his own party, and even some Republicans, who have expressed their discontent with a few of Trump\u2019s picks. In an interview on Fox & Friends, Manchin said he wants the president-elect to be successful despite their obvious ideological differences. In fact, he said he looks forward to extending a bipartisan hand to Republican leaders so that Democrats could get on board and support reasonable policies. The Trump transition team says Secretary of State Nominee Rex Tillerson is already a diplomat. As CEO of a huge global corporation like ExxonMobi... \u201cMy job as a senator is to do everything I can to help him,\u201d the native West Virginian said. \u201cAnd If I do disagree--respectfully disagree--I\u2019m not calling people names.

When he met with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower, he also chatted with incomeing chief White House strategist Steve Bannon , former RNC chairman Reince Priebus, and Ivanka Trump--whom he said also sat in on his meeting with Mr. Trump. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was ultimately selected for energy secretary . Manchin, whose own home state has felt the\u00a0 repercussions of a deteriorating coal industry , admitted in a statement that he\u2019s better suited to help his fellow West Virginians in the Senate. \u00a0 In a separate Fox interview on Thursday evening, Manchin lauded Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks. Despite concerns from both sides of the aisle, Manchin called ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson a \u201ctremendous\u201d person, and he argued Tillerson\u2019s ties to Russia could help ease the contentiousness between the U.S. and Russia.

By Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima December 16 at 7:43 PM Follow @nakashimae FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Obama issued a public warning to Moscow that it could face retaliation. New revelations about Comey\u2019s position could put to rest suggestions by some lawmakers that the CIA and the FBI weren\u2019t on the same page on Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s intentions. Russia has denied being behind the cyber-intrusions, which targeted the Democratic National Committee and the private emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Trump, in turn, has repeatedly said he doubts the veracity of U.S. intelligence blaming Moscow for the hacks. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Trump said in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d his first Sunday news-show appearance since the Nov. 8 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it. . . . No, I don\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d At a \u201cthank you\u201d event Thursday night with some of her top campaign donors and fundraisers, Clinton said she believed Russian-backed hackers went after her campaign because of a personal grudge that Putin had against her. Putin had blamed Clinton for fomenting mass protests in Russia after disputed 2011 parliamentary elections that challenged his rule. Putin said Clinton, then secretary of state, had \u201csent a signal\u201d to protesters by labeling the elections \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) [ Moscow has the world\u2019s attention. For Putin, that\u2019s a win. ] The positions of Comey and Clapper were revealed in a message that CIA Director John Brennan sent to the agency\u2019s workforce Friday. \u201cEarlier this week, I met separately with FBI [Director] James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election,\u201d Brennan said, according to U.S. officials who have seen the message. The CIA and the FBI declined to comment on Brennan\u2019s message or on the classified intelligence assessment that CIA officials shared with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, setting off a political firestorm. In the closed-door Senate briefing, CIA officials said it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was one of Russia\u2019s goals, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. CIA and FBI officials do not think Russia had a \u201csingle purpose\u201d by intervening during the presidential campaign, officials said. In addition to the goal of helping elect Trump, Putin aimed to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, intelligence officials have told lawmakers. A few days after the Senate briefing, a senior FBI counter\u00adintelligence official briefed the House Intelligence Committee but was not as categorical as the CIA briefer about Russia\u2019s intention to help Trump, according to officials who were present. The FBI official\u2019s more cautious presentation of the intelligence to the House panel left some Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the room with the impression that the FBI disagreed with the CIA. (Reuters) Officials close to the FBI and the CIA now say that lawmakers had misunderstood Comey\u2019s position. \u201cThe truth is they were never all that different in the first place,\u201d an official said. Similarly, officials said, Clapper and Brennan saw the intelligence the same way. Earlier this week, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a Trump supporter, wrote to spy chiefs to demand briefings on the Russian meddling. But Clapper responded that he wanted to first complete a review of all available U.S. intelligence, as directed by Obama. Brennan tried to talk to Nunes several times about the dispute. But officials said the congressman didn\u2019t take his calls until after he issued a statement Wednesday asking intelligence leaders to \u201cclarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us.\u201d Officials disputed the statement, saying Nunes had been fully briefed on the intelligence. \u201cIn recent days, I have had several conversations with members of Congress, providing an update on the status of the review as well as the considerations that need to be taken into account as we proceed,\u201d Brennan wrote in his message to CIA staffers. \u201cMany \u2014 but unfortunately not all \u2014 members understand and appreciate the importance and the gravity of the issue, and they are very supportive of the process that is underway.\u201d Brennan wrote to the CIA workforce, officials said, to reassure them in the face of accusations from Trump supporters that intelligence was being politicized. Nunes did not respond to requests for comment, but in a statement, he said, \u201cWe have not received any information from Intelligence Community (IC) agencies indicating that they have developed new assessments on this issue. I am alarmed that supposedly new information continues to leak to the media but has not been provided to Congress.\u201d In one of his last news conference of the year, Obama defended his administration\u2019s response to the Russian hacking and vowed to \u201csend a clear message to Russia\u201d that its meddling was unacceptable. \u201cI think we handled it the way it should have been handled,\u201d he said of the hacking investigation and the lack of a formal accusation of blame until a month before the election. \u201cWe allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence.\u201d Obama was referring to an Oct.\u00a07 statement by Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson publicly blaming Russia for hacking political organizations, a clear reference to the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic officials. U.S. officials said an earlier draft of the Clapper-Johnson statement singled out Putin by name for authorizing the influence operation. But before the final statement was made public, Putin\u2019s name was removed \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t be provocative,\u201d one official said. Instead, the statement blamed \u201cRussia\u2019s senior-most officials.\u201d At that time, Obama said, the U.S. intelligence community \u201cdid not attribute motives\u201d to Russia\u2019s decision to intervene in the election. \u201cImagine if we had done the opposite,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cIt would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place \u2014 at a time, by the way, when the president-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.\u201d At Friday\u2019s news conference, Obama did not directly point the finger at the Russian president. But he came close to doing so by saying: \u201cNot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.\u201d [ Putin wants revenge and respect, and hacking the U.S. is his way of getting it ] Some members of Clinton\u2019s campaign, Democrats in Congress and others have taken the Obama administration to task for not calling out Russian efforts to influence the election sooner, as well as for not taking retaliatory action against those responsible for the cyber-intrusions and leaks to WikiLeaks, the anti- secrecy group. Obama said some possible retaliatory measures might not be seen by the public, although they would be seen or felt by Moscow. Obama, who has only a few weeks left in office, made clear any response to the hacks must be carefully thought through. \u201cThe relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future but does not create problems for us is something that\u2019s worth taking the time to think through and figure out.\u201d Abby Phillip and Greg Miller contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House on Dec. 16, 2016. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama said Friday that successor Donald Trump and other Republicans should support a probe of\u00a0Russian interference in the presidential election, and argued that the \"hyper-partisanship\" of modern politics makes the nation more vulnerable to efforts by adversaries to undermine faith in the voting system. Pushing\u00a0back at Trump's skepticism about\u00a0Russian complicity in the hacking of Democratic campaign emails,\u00a0Obama told a White House news conference that \"people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say.\" In attacking excessive partisanship,\u00a0Obama said it seems some Republicans would rather believe Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, than American officials who they see as somehow favoring the Democrats. Citing a poll that said 37% of Republican voters approve of Putin, a former KGB official, Obama said that GOP icon Ronald Reagan would \"roll over in his grave.\" While Russia is weak country that \"doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms,\" Obama said Putin's country \"can impact us if we lose track of who we are,\" and abandon our values. \"This is part of what I meant when I said we've got to think what is happening to happening to our political culture here,\" Obama said. The president said he is convinced that the Russians \"were responsible\" for hacking the emails of Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton campaign officials, and he strongly suggested he agreed with the conclusion of some intelligence analysts that Putin directed the operation. \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,\" Obama said at one point. Read more: FBI accepts CIA conclusion that Russians hacked to help Trump Trump has disputed claims by intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the hacking of emails from Democratic officials. The president-elect and his aides have accused Democrats of pushing the Russia story in an attempt to de-legitimize his election win. At the White House, Obama suggested he would retaliate against the Russians over the hack, but he did not say specifically how. The president said he personally told Putin to \"cut it out,\" and there would be \"serious consequences\" for such actions. In some cases, he said, \"there are times where the message will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized.\" Obama also said there is no evidence of Russian \"tampering\" with voting machines or the voting system. Under criticism from some Democrats for not acting before Election Day, Obama told reporters he held off talking much about the hack attack back then because people in a \"hyper-partisan\" atmosphere would accuse him of trying to influence the vote. \"It would become immediately just one more political scrum,\" he said. \"I think we handled it the way it should have been handled,\" Obama said. Obama declined to say whether he thought Russian cyber espionage cost Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the election, though he did assail the \"troubling\" news coverage of her candidacy \u2014\u00a0particularly the hacked message as disclosed by Wikileaks. Citing one example, he mocked the media for reporting on the leaked risotto recipe of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. \"You guys wrote about it every day, every single leak about every little juicy tidbit of political gossip,\" Obama told reporters.

    "text": "4 Inmates Escape Tennessee Jail in Deputy's Vehicle; 2 Still at Large By Morgan Winsor Dec 16, 2016, 8:21 AM ET 0 Shares Star Jefferson County Sheriff's Department Matthew Robert Porter, left, and Adam Quinn Lethco escaped from Jefferson County Jail in Dandridge, Tennesse. 0 Shares Email Four inmates escaped a jailhouse in rural Tennessee in a deputy's vehicle early this morning, authorities said. Deputies were treating an inmate, 24-year-old Adam Lethco, at the Jefferson County Work House in Dandridge for a hand injury. As the deputies exited the prison cell, four inmates assaulted them and stole the keys to a deputy's vehicle before fleeing the jailhouse at around 12:15 a.m. local time, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The stolen vehicle, a black Chevy, was spotted by a volunteer firefighter on Highway 411 and later found abandoned on a road in Sevierville. Soon after, Sevier County deputies took one of the escaped inmates into custody, 22-year-old Jimmy Moore. Then at around 3:45 a.m. local time, deputies from Sevier and Jefferson counties took another escaped inmate into custody, 26-year-old Richard Lorenz, deputies said. Moore and Lorenz were transported back to Jefferson County jail and charged with aggravated assault on an officer and escape. Two inmates, Lethco and 27-year-old Matthew Porter, are still on the run. Both men were last seen in the Sevier County area of Highway 411 wearing white shirts with black and white striped pants, deputies said. Lethco is serving an eight-year sentence for aggravated burglary, theft and vehicle theft. Porter is serving the first year of a six-year sentence for reckless endangerment and evading arrest. He is also wanted in Alabama for violating probation and is to serve 12 years in prison there, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office.

    "text": "Obama says election cyberattack came from the 'highest levels' of the Russian government and vows retaliation white house Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) Christi Parsons and Brian Bennett Contact Reporters President Obama publicly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of involvement in cyberattacks aimed at the U.S. election and leveled a threat on Friday \u2014 that the U.S. would retaliate, perhaps in ways no one but the Russians would see. Obama said that he had\u00a0\u201cgreat confidence\" in the assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russians had\u00a0carried out computer\u00a0hacks aimed at the Democratic National Committee and senior aides to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , and that the operation had been approved at \u201cthe highest levels\u201d in Moscow. \"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,\" he added, saying\u00a0that the Russians needed to understand that \u201cwe can do stuff to you.\u201d (Nina Agrawal) U.S. counter-strikes would come \u201cin a thoughtful, methodical way\u201d and would be felt by the Russians, Obama said. \u201cSome of it, we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will.\u201d Obama\u2019s statement came as CIA and FBI officials sought to rebut claims that the agencies were at odds in their assessment of Russia\u2019s role in the attacks. In a message to CIA employees, the agency\u2019s director, John Brennan , said that\u00a0a \"strong consensus\" existed\u00a0among U.S. intelligence services that\u00a0Russia\u00a0orchestrated hacks and that the online leaks were designed at least in part to help Donald Trump win the White House. FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. agreed with that assessment, Brennan wrote. He had met separately with both of them, Brennan added,\u00a0and \u201cthere is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election .\u201d The message was confirmed by a U.S. official after it was\u00a0first reported by the Washington Post. Pat McCrory on Friday signed a hastily passed bill designed to strip power from the incoming Democratic governor and his party. A second bill with similar intentions now awaits McCrory\u2019s signature. ... Defying protesters and legal threats from his successor, North Carolina\u2019s outgoing Republican Gov. Pat McCrory on Friday signed a hastily passed bill designed to strip power from the incoming Democratic governor and his party. A second bill with similar intentions now awaits McCrory\u2019s signature. ... (Matt Pearce) A second U.S. official said the\u00a0FBI concurred with intelligence agencies that the Russian government had orchestrated the cyberattacks, which disclosed emails from the files of\u00a0the Democratic National Committee as well as Clinton\u00a0campaign Chairman\u00a0 John Podesta and other top Democrats. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing and\u00a0portions of it are classified. Although FBI agents have not determined Russia's motive with certainty, they can tell the hacks targeted Democrats and benefited Trump. Whether the Russians were trying to help\u00a0elect Trump, sow confusion in the electoral process,\u00a0undermine an\u00a0eventual Clinton presidency or achieve a combination of those outcomes remains unclear to\u00a0agents, the second official said.\u00a0 Russian officials have denied involvement in the hacking and have said\u00a0the U.S. should show more proof or let the subject drop. Trump has repeatedly denied that anyone knows whether Russia was behind the leaked emails and has mocked\u00a0the CIA's assessment that top Russian officials intervened to help him get elected. In the face of those denials, Obama, who has directed U.S. intelligence agencies to complete a thorough review of the Russian actions before he leaves office, said his administration would disclose at least some of the evidence to the public. But, he warned, much of it would have to remain secret. \u201cWe will provide evidence that we can safely provide, that does not compromise sources and methods,\u201d he said. He added:\u00a0\u201cWhen you are talking about cybersecurity, a lot of it is classified, and we're not going to provide it because the way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know.\u201d Obama\u2019s final scheduled\u00a0news conference of the year \u2014\u00a0an unusually long 90-minute affair that was interrupted briefly while the White House doctor attended to a reporter who had fainted \u2014\u00a0revealed a deepening preoccupation with Putin and Russia in the waning days of his presidency. Asked\u00a0about Trump\u2019s dealings with China and Taiwan since the\u00a0election, Obama cautioned the president-elect\u00a0not to wade too deeply into foreign policy too soon. Obama said he had told Trump that \u201cbefore he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place\u201d and \u201cfully briefed\u201d so they \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d And he repeated that the blame\u00a0for the carnage in Aleppo, Syria, where thousands more civilians were killed or displaced in the last week, should fall on the Syrian government and its Russian allies. But it was the Russian interference in the campaign and the partisan debate surrounding it that clearly was on the president\u2019s mind. In an interview with National Public Radio that aired earlier in the day, Obama said that\u00a0the leaks from Democratic emails had \u201ccontributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time, were Hillary's emails, the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC.\u201d\u00a0 He returned to that theme repeatedly during the news conference. His intense focus on the topic suggested widespread worry among Western allies about a rising threat from Russia, as well as his own concern that Trump and the Republican Party lack the proper skepticism of the Russian leader. Displaying\u00a0a partisan tone that he had avoided in other remarks since the election, Obama sharply criticized\u00a0Republicans who have spoken admiringly of Putin and who have tried to deny or minimize\u00a0Russia\u2019s interference in the election. He cited a recent YouGov poll that showed 37% of Republicans now approve of Putin. \u201cOver a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd how did that happen? It happened in part because for too long, everything that happens in this town, everything that's said, is seen through the lens of \u2018does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats or relative to President Obama.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Russia, he said,\u00a0can\u2019t \u201csignificantly weaken us. They are a smaller country; they are a weaker country. Their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don't innovate.\u201d But, he said, the U.S. could weaken itself through excessive partisanship and mutual mistrust. \u00a0 \u201cWhat I worry about more than anything,\u201d he added, is how \u201cyou start to see certain folks in the Republican Party and Republican voters suddenly finding a government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for as being OK, because that's how much we dislike Democrats.\u201d Obama denied that there had been much \u201csquabbling\u201d between the White House and Trump\u2019s aides on the topic, brushing off Trump\u2019s recent criticism of the White House press secretary as evidence that \u201cthe president-elect, you know, is still in transition mode.\u201d\u00a0 And as Marine helicopters circled the airspace above the White House\u00a0in preparation for his departure for two weeks of vacation in Hawaii, the president derided the idea that a systematic attack on Democratic computer systems could have happened without Putin\u2019s knowledge. \"This is a pretty hierarchical operation,\u201d he said of the Russian government. \u201cLast I checked, there\u2019s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation, particularly when it comes to policies directed at the United States.\" \"I will confirm that this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government,\u201d Obama went on. \u201cAnd I will let you make that determination as to whether there are high-level Russian officials who go off rogue and decide to tamper with the U.S. election process without Vladimir Putin knowing about it.\" Times staff writer Del Quentin Wilber contributed to this report.

    "text": "In his final press conference, Obama looked back on eight years, but pressing questions about Russian hacking and violence in Syria took center stage. Leigh Vogel/WireImage hide caption toggle caption Leigh Vogel/WireImage In his final press conference, Obama looked back on eight years, but pressing questions about Russian hacking and violence in Syria took center stage. Leigh Vogel/WireImage President Obama held his final press conference of 2016 and painted a rosy picture of his tenure as president \u2014 from economic growth to foreign policy. So how did he hold up on the facts and what context did he leave out? We look at five different quotes: 1. \"The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies are trying to obfuscate the truth. The world should not be fooled, and the world will not forget.\" President Obama accuses Russia and Syria of trying to \"obfuscate the truth\" in the city of Aleppo, but says the world will not be fooled and will not forget. He says they are to blame for the atrocities unfolding there. The president says he does feel responsible too. He's defending his decision, though, not to take any military action to tip the balance in Syria. He says it couldn't be done on the cheap. The Obama administration often argued that the choice was between diplomacy or military action, though activists argued there were other options short of sending in thousands of troops uninvited, including safe zones or targeted strikes on Syrian airfields to take out helicopters that were dropping barrel bombs and chlorine bombs on civilian areas. Article continues after sponsorship \u2014 Michele Kelemen, diplomacy correspondent 2. \"So with respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course that I can to try to end the civil war while having also to take into account the long-term national security interests of the United States. And throughout this process, based on hours of meetings \u2014 if you tallied it up, days and weeks of meetings \u2014 where we went through every option in painful detail with maps and we had our military and we had our aid agencies and we had our diplomatic teams, and sometimes, we'd bring in outsiders who were critics of ours. Whenever we went through it, the challenge was that short of putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress, at a time when we still had troops in Afghanistan and we still had troops in Iraq and we had just gone through over a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars...\" President Obama talked about the only other option in Syria being large numbers of troops, but not necessarily. His national-security advisers back four years ago wanted him to arm and train the rebels on a large scale. He decided against it. One of those advisers was Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump's choice to run the Defense Department. Another was Hillary Clinton, as well as Obama's former CIA Director David Petraeus. Safe zones? You would have to send a force on the ground and ask permission of Syria and Russia. Really? What about the hundreds of US Special Operators running around Syria? Obama just sent 200 more. Did he get approval from Assad? Also, Turkey already has sent in combat troops, heading to Al Bab \u2013 without permission. \u2014 Tom Bowman, Pentagon reporter 3. \"There was a survey some of you saw where \u2014 not this just one poll, but pretty credible source, 37 percent of Republican voters approve of Putin. Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.\" Obama appears to be referring to a YouGov poll that showed a recent spike in Republicans' favorability of Vladimir Putin. Pollster Will Jordan tweeted a chart of this on Wednesday: Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt And as Politico reported on Friday : \"Back in July 2014 just 10 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, according to a poll conducted by the Economist and YouGov. By September of 2016, that number rose to 24 percent. And it's even higher today: 37 percent of Republicans view Putin favorably, the poll found in December.\" Republicans' favorability of Putin is still negative, but it is a sharp increase from where they were as recently as September. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben, political reporter Median household income 4. \"...the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record. In fact, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top.\" U.S. Census Bureau This is right \u2014 the median household income in the U.S. climbed by 5.2 percent between 2014 and 2015, to $56,516. That's the biggest jump since the Census Bureau started keeping track in 1967. In addition, income growth at the bottom and middle was stronger than it was at the top by that Census data. Growth at the 10th percentile level was around 7.9 percent, a rate that declined as one went up the income ladder toward the median (that is, the 50th percentile). Median income grew by 5.2 percent. For people at the 90th percentile, it grew by nearly 2.9 percent. That said, how good the data looks for lower income levels depends upon how it's sliced, not to mention which data one uses. As economist Emmanuel Saez pointed out at the Center for Equitable Growth in July, IRS data showed that incomes for people in the top percent of earners grew by 7.7 percent in 2015, compared to 3.9 percent for the bottom 99 percent. That's still solid growth for the 99 percent, and it could still mean strong growth in the bottom tiers of earners, but it suggests that in the top sliver of earners, income growth was once again stronger than for many people in lower classes. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben Perceptions of Democrats as 'liberal, latte-sipping,\" \"politically correct,\" and \"out-of-touch\" 5. \"And where Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte- sipping, you know, politically correct, out-of-touch folks, we have to be in those communities. And I've seen that, when we are in those communities, it makes a difference. That's how I became president. I became a U.S. Senator not just because I had a strong base in Chicago, but because I was driving downstate Illinois and going to fish fries and sitting in V.F.W. Halls and talking to farmers.\" There's no way of knowing how widespread the perception of Democrats as precious, out-of-touch, urban coastal elites is, nor how much it may have hurt Clinton and other Democrats in the election. However, it is altogether possible that the isolation from and resentment toward political power that many Americans feel pushed them to vote for Republicans. As one political scientist explained to NPR this year, that may be a force behind many rural Americans rejecting Clinton in favor of Trump this year. And Hillary Clinton really did tend to do far worse in rural areas than in urban areas. And her performance in those rural areas was worse than Obama's in 2012, which in turn was worse than Obama's performance in those areas in 2008. Those declines in rural areas were much larger than any declines that took place over those same periods in suburban or urban areas. \u2014 Danielle Kurtzleben ",
