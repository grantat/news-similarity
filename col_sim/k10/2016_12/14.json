    "text": "WATCH Trump in Public Spat With CIA 0 Shares Email President Barack Obama says any president who shuns daily intelligence briefings would be \"flying blind\" on national security matters, a stiff push-back against Donald Trump's suggestion that that he doesn't need daily read-ins to fulfill his campaign pledge to \"make America safe again.\" \"I think the president-elect may say one thing and do another once he's here\" in the White House ,\" Obama said late Monday on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show.\" Intelligence agencies, Obama said, \"are not perfect, they would be the first to acknowledge that. If you're not getting their perspective, their detailed perspective, then you are flying blind.\" Trump said on \"Fox News Sunday\" he's not interested in daily intelligence briefings unless developments have changed enough to merit his attention. Trump campaigned heavily on making national security his priority, crafting one widely seen ad around the phrasing that he'll \"make America safe again.\" He wrapped several campaign proposals in the national security theme, including a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and immediate deportation of millions of people in the country illegally. Asked whether he's rejecting valuable intelligence, Trump was defiant. \"I get it when I need it,\" he said of the top-secret briefings sessions, generally designed to present facts for the president to make decisions on when something's changed and what, if any, action should be taken. \"I'm, like, a smart person,\" Trump continued. \"I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years.\" The remarks sent Trump allies, such as incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus Tuesday, insisting that the president-elect respects intelligence analysts. In his Monday night appearance, Obama said the U.S. intelligence agencies are stocked with \"extraordinary, hard-working and patriotic and knowledgeable experts.\" \"It doesn't matter how smart you are,\" Obama said. \"You have to make the best information possible to make the best decisions possible.\" Obama also commented on the burgeoning controversy surrounding the CIA's conclusion that Russia was engaged in computer hacking aimed at interfering with the U.S. election process and helping Trump in his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton . A congressional investigation is in the works, and Obama has ordered a wide-ranging review of the hacking situation. The aim, Obama told \"The Daily Show,\" was to ensure that \"the public and our elected representatives, going forward, can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an effect on the elections in the future.\" \"This was not a secret running up to the election,\" he added. \"The president-elect in some of his political events specifically said to the Russians, hack Hillary's emails so we can finally find out what's going on and confirm our conspiracy theories.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman 0 Shares ",

Xavier Becerra in Congress 1420989_ME_0501_May_Day_March_IK Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times Wendy Carrillo waves a flag at a 2013 May Day march in downtown Los Angeles. Wendy Carrillo waves a flag at a 2013 May Day march in downtown Los Angeles. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Christine Mai-Duc Contact Reporter Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) is still awaiting confirmation as California\u2019s next attorney general , and there\u2019s no date set for an election to replace him, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the furious pace of palace intrigue over the past two weeks. The names of nearly a dozen potential candidates to replace Becerra in Los Angeles\u2019 34th Congressional District have been floated since Dec. 1, when\u00a0Gov. Jerry Brown named him as\u00a0the chosen successor to Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris , California\u2019s newest U.S. senator. One of the most well connected possible replacements, former Assembly Speaker John A. P\u00e9rez, withdrew from consideration\u00a0over the weekend due to unspecified health reasons, saying that his\u00a0treatment \u201cdoesn\u2019t lend itself to the intensity of a campaign that the community deserves.\u201d P\u00e9rez, who ran unsuccessfully for state controller in 2014, had already received dozens of endorsements from members of the state Democratic Party\u00a0when he dropped out, scrambling the race. SIGN UP for our free Essential Politics newsletter >> With P\u00e9rez out, Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), a former labor organizer who was elected to the\u00a0Legislature in 2012 , appears to have begun consolidating\u00a0 support from the state\u2019s Democratic establishment . Gomez announced\u00a0the endorsements of Los Angeles\u00a0Mayor Eric Garcetti, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) and Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) in quick succession after Perez dropped out. Gomez said in a statement announcing his run that he wants to \u201cmake sure that the Trump Republican Party does not have a free hand in Washington.\u201d Four\u00a0other candidates have officially said they would run for the seat. They are Wendy Carrillo, a local labor activist and former journalist who was brought to the United States illegally from El Salvador as a child;\u00a0 Kenneth Mejia , a Green Party candidate and self-proclaimed \u201cBerniecrat\u201d who previously ran against Becerra in the June election; Sara Hernandez, a former aide to L.A. City Councilman Jose Huizar who now runs the public affairs institute Coro Southern California; and Arturo Carmona, a former deputy political director for Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign.\u00a0 In a statement announcing her run, Hernandez said she had raised more than $150,000 and that she knows \u201chow to deal with bullies,\u201d vowing\u00a0to stand up to a Trump administration. They\u00a0and others who are still mulling over\u00a0potential bids\u00a0represent a younger generation of local activists eager to run in a race where the rapidly changing neighborhoods of downtown Los Angeles, Eagle Rock and Highland Park will send a new face to Congress for the first time in more than 20 years. The race comes at a time when California\u2019s statewide and congressional Democrats have vowed to be a thorn in the side of Donald Trump. \u201cThis can\u2019t just be the usual game of musical chairs where one elected [official] moves to another position,\u201d Hernandez said in an interview.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time to turn this ship around, and that needs to be done by investing in a new generation of leadership that has the time and the energy and the fortitude to stand up to these challenges.\u201d U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), center, will leave his congressional seat after 24 years if confirmed as California's next attorney general. State Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), right, has said he won't run to replace him. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), center, will leave his congressional seat after 24 years if confirmed as California's next attorney general. State Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), right, has said he won't run to replace him. U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), center, will leave his congressional seat after 24 years if confirmed as California's next attorney general. State Senate leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), right, has said he won't run to replace him. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) The election of Donald Trump has also prompted several more seasoned politicians to skip the race: De Le\u00f3n said he would not run , focusing instead on working with Becerra to \u201cdefend California\u2019s progress.\u201d L.A. City Councilmen Jose Huizar , who has been a vocal supporter of downtown development, and Gil Cedillo also turned down the opportunity, with Cedillo vowing to \u201cstay and fight\u201d for immigrant rights and other crucial issues in Los Angeles.\u00a0 David Ryu, another councilman\u00a0who last year cruised to victory with major support from the Korean community, also briefly considered vying for Becerra\u2019s seat, but decided against it. But there\u2019s still time for the roster of candidates to expand: Brown can\u2019t set an election date until Becerra resigns and creates a vacancy, something he has said he won\u2019t do until after he\u2019s confirmed by the Legislature. Lawmakers won\u2019t return to Sacramento until Jan. 4. The special election would probably be held no earlier than spring 2017, though the law gives the governor wide discretion in setting the schedule, particularly if it could be consolidated with already-scheduled citywide elections in March and May.

    "text": "Liam Ford and Erin Gallagher Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A man who died Monday in Summit at the site of a Deep Tunnel stormwater reservoir had been struck by vehicle that was part of a snowplowing operation, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Tuesday morning. The man, a carpenter craft worker, died about 2 p.m. at the McCook Reservoir project, part of the Deep Tunnel system, said Bob Kula, a spokesman for the man's employer, Kiewit Corp. of Omaha. Kiewit is the primary contractor on the $121 million main tunnel and gate portion of the $638 million project. A news release Tuesday from OSHA said it was investigating the death of the man, who was identified as Robert Ellison, 55, of the 39300 block of North Hickory Street in Spring Grove, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. The cause and manner of his death had not yet been determined by the medical examiner. In its news release, OSHA said Ellison was \"struck and killed by a rough-terrain vehicle during snowplowing operations\" in a parking lot of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District site at 7700 Canal Bank Road in the southwest suburb. OSHA spokesman Scott Allen said the vehicle had a plow on it. A member of Ellison's family did not wish to comment when contacted Tuesday. OHSA is part of the U.S. Department of Labor . Allen said the agency's investigation will determine who was operating the vehicle and who employed that person. Allen did not immediately know if Ellison was working at the time of the incident, or if he was struck in the parking lot before or after work. \"That's part of the investigation we're still trying to determine,\" Allen said. \"We're conducting interviews with the employer, other employees and potential witnesses.\" ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Donald Trump is scheduled to testify under oath just weeks before he becomes president, but the celebrity chef he is suing is giving him an out. Mr. @realDonaldTrump can we end our lawsuits and we donate $ to a Veterans NGO to celebrate? Why keep litigating? Let's both of us  win.. \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) December 13, 2016 Trump currently has a $10 million lawsuit against Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s\u2019 restaurant Topo Atrio. The restaurant was supposed to be in Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, D.C., but the deal was canceled last year after Trump announced he was running for president and said Mexico was sending \u201crapists\u201d and criminals to the United States. \"Donald Trump's\u00a0recent statements disparaging immigrants make it impossible for my company and I to move forward with opening a successful Spanish restaurant in Trump International's upcoming hotel in Washington, D.C.,\" Andr\u00e9s said\u00a0in a statement at the time. Trump\u2019s team has pushed back on the specifics of the deposition, specifically\u00a0its Washington, D.C., location and the up to seven-hour length. The restaurant group has agreed to a new location but is not backing down on the duration of questioning. A spokesman for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for a response about Andr\u00e9s\u2019 request. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The City Council has vowed to close the controversial facility in 2018. Activists rally outside Santa Monica City Hall last year to protest extending leases for aviation tenants at the city's municipal airport. The City Council has vowed to close the controversial facility in 2018. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Dan Weikel Contact Reporter The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday ordered Santa Monica to halt the evictions of two aviation companies at its municipal airport \u00a0until the agency can finish an investigation into the city\u2019s effort to shut down the facility. FAA officials issued an interim cease-and-desist order to stop the ouster of Atlantic Aviation and American Flyers, two major providers of aircraft services,\u00a0including fuel, flight instruction, hangars and amenities for charter operators. The move\u00a0to evict the companies is part of the city\u2019s strategy to force out aviation tenants, reduce aircraft flights and shut down the oldest operating airport in Los Angeles County by July 2018. If the evictions go forward, the city plans to replace Atlantic and American Flyers with its own municipal aviation company and sell bio-fuel for jets and unleaded gas for propeller planes to reduce aircraft emissions. Federal law allows governments\u00a0that operate airports to provide services themselves instead of relying on private companies. We are pleased that the FAA has recognized our client's federally protected right to be at the airport. \u2014 R. Christopher Harshman, an attorney for American Flyer The city sent the first notices to evict in mid-September and filed\u00a0lawsuits against both tenants in November to regain possession of the property. \u201cWhile we are disappointed\u00a0but not surprised that the FAA has decided to issue this interim order on the pending evictions of Atlantic and American Flyer, we remain committed to replacing private fixed-based operations with public services,\u201d Mayor Tony Vasquez said. The cease-and-desist order states that Santa Monica\u2019s \u201cunremitting effort\u201d to remove critical aeronautical services and its \u201chostility\u201d to\u00a0the sale of leaded fuel still needed by many aircraft is \u201ca clear contravention of law.\u201d The order notes that general aviation aircraft, business jets and turboprop aircraft cannot operate using the fuels approved by the City Council. \u00a0It further states that the city has no desire to provide all the services offered by the companies, such as flight training. Under\u00a0agreements with the federal government, the city must make the airport available for public use and benefit. It cannot discriminate against aircraft types or uses and must make space available for aviation tenants on reasonable terms based on good faith negotiations. . . . We remain committed to replacing private fixed-based operations with public services. \u2014 Santa Monica Mayor, Tony Vasquez \u201cThe city has failed to grant any aeronautical leases since 2015 and is alleged to have negotiated in bad faith while seeking onerous and unreasonable terms,\u201d according to the cease-and-desist order, which later states that the leasing policy for the airport fails to include aviation. \u201cWe are pleased that the FAA has recognized our client\u2019s\u00a0federally protected right to be at the airport,\u201d said R. Christopher Harshman, an attorney for American Flyers. In a separate action, Atlantic Aviation and American Flyers have asked a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge to\u00a0halt the evictions. A hearing is set for Jan. 3. Santa Monica officials say they are working in \u201cgood faith\u201d to\u00a0provide the services and fuel required by federal regulations.\u00a0They have\u00a030 days to respond to the FAA\u2019s cease-and-desist order. In late September, the FAA opened a wide-ranging investigation to determine whether the city\u2019s so-called starvation strategy for the airport violates its federal obligations that date back to the late 1940s. The 227-acre airport has about 270 aircraft and averages 452 takeoffs and landings per day. Supporters say it is an economic benefit for the region, provides a base of operations for major emergencies\u00a0and helps relieve crowded airspace at\u00a0Los Angeles International Airport. Opponents contend the airport should be closed because of noise pollution, potentially harmful emissions from aircraft engines and the risk of a serious crash in surrounding neighborhoods.\u00a0\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s secretary of state pick, is an oil tycoon with close ties to Russia , the L.A.

By Liz Sly , Louisa Loveluck and Missy Ryan December 13 at 7:04 PM Follow @LizSly Follow leloveluck Follow @missy_ryan BEIRUT \u2014 When Syrian rebels surged into Aleppo in the summer of 2012, it was the high point of their still young, still idealistic revolution against President Bashar al-Assad. Four and a half years and hundreds of thousands of deaths later, troops loyal to his government were poised Tuesday to take the city back, heralding the end of an era for the rebellion. With the rebels clinging to a tiny pinprick of territory in one corner of the city, it is now only a matter of time before the government reclaims full control over the country\u2019s biggest metropolis, an architectural and historical jewel that has now become a symbol of the catastrophe of the Syrian war. Last-minute diplomacy to rescue the tens of thousands of people trapped by the fighting or because they fear being detained by loyalist forces generated a deal brokered by Russia and Turkey on Tuesday to evacuate the last rebel-controlled enclave. The deal would see rebel holdouts and perhaps also the civilians still living there evacuated on buses to other rebel-held areas in the north of the province of Aleppo or the nearby province of Idlib, according to Russian officials and rebel spokesmen. But exact details were unclear, and U.S. officials said they were doubtful it would be implemented fully, if at all. Exact details of the civilian evacuation deal reached in Syria remain unclear. Among the questions: Where will the evacuated be taken and what might the rebel fighters face? (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) \u201cWe remain skeptical,\u201d said one U.S. official, speaking on the \u00adcondition of anonymity to discuss a quickly changing situation. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these kind of declarations before by the Russians and the regime, and just as many times we\u2019ve seen them violated and broken.\u201d [ How the Syrian revolt went so horribly, tragically wrong ] If the evacuation does not go ahead, an even bigger nightmare could unfold, U.N. agencies and human rights groups warned. Jens Laerke, the U.N. humanitarian spokesman, called the scenario in Aleppo \u201ca complete meltdown of humanity.\u201d There have already been disturbing reports of abuses as Assad loyalists converged in recent days on former rebel strongholds that had been fighting against the government. The U.N. Human Rights Council said it had been given the names of 82 civilians who were killed in summary executions in two neighborhoods on Monday. According to Rupert Colville, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the reports asserted that Syrian soldiers and allied Iraqi militiamen had entered homes and killed people \u201con the spot.\u201d Among them were 11 women and 13 children, he said. Tens of thousands of people who fled the neighborhoods overrun in recent days have sought refuge in the tiny enclave still under opposition control, joining the residents who were already there and creating chaos in the cramped streets. People stumbled over the bodies of the dead as they fled for their lives ahead of advancing government troops, and they now fear for their lives should they be caught, said Zouhir \u00adal-Shimale, an activist who lives in one of the last rebel-held neighborhoods. Most people now only want the chance to escape the area safely and welcomed the news of Tuesday\u2019s deal with \u201ca kind of shock of happiness,\u201d said Shimale, who was among those who joined in the uprising against Assad\u2019s rule. But now, he said, all anyone can think about is getting out. \u201cIt\u2019s dead. It\u2019s over, and no one cares,\u201d he said. The rout of the rebels gives the Assad government its biggest victory yet in the five-year-old war. It won\u2019t, however, change the course of the conflict, which was all but sealed by Russia\u2019s military intervention more than a year ago. That Assad is in no danger of being toppled has been clear since Russian airstrikes began turning back rebel gains, putting beyond doubt that the opposition would ever be able to overthrow his regime in Damascus. It also won\u2019t end the war. The rebels still control large areas of northwestern Syria, much of the countryside of southern Syria and several pockets of territory around Damascus and near Homs. But the endgame in Aleppo does change the parameters of the conflict, leaving the rebels with no hold over any strategically significant area of the country and no real bargaining chip to try to force the government into a negotiated settlement. Coming weeks before the inauguration of a new U.S. president, Donald Trump, it leaves the Obama administration\u2019s five-year-old policy of using rebel gains to force Assad to compromise in shreds. The bloodshed could now intensify, diplomats fear, as an emboldened government, backed by its Russian and Iranian allies, steps up its efforts to fulfill Assad\u2019s promise to reclaim all of the territory lost to the rebels. Whether they can, at least any time soon, is a different question. It has been three years since government forces turned the tide in Aleppo and began taking back rebel areas. And the war, which has claimed, by most estimates, at least 400,000 lives, has since become much more complicated. The Islamic State now controls more than a third of the eastern part of the country, and has drawn the United States into Syria\u2019s war. While attention was focused on the battle for Aleppo, the militants recaptured the Syrian city of Palmyra , overrunning in just three days loyalist positions that had been depleted by diversions to the Aleppo front. [ The Islamic State has been a catastrophe for Sunnis ] Syrian Kurds are now governing a big area in northeastern Syria that Assad has also said he wants to reclaim. Turkish troops have intervened in another area of the north of the country and control a chunk of territory alongside a force of allied rebels. \u201cTwo things are absolutely clear here,\u201d said the U.S. official. \u201cOne, the regime doesn\u2019t have capability to end this war, even with Russia\u2019s backing, and the scorched-earth approach that they\u2019re taking is only going to attract more extremists.\u201d Aleppo will nonetheless be remembered as a symbolic milestone, the final death of a dream of a more democratic Syria that had waned long ago. The brutality of the government crackdown and the reluctance of world powers to pressure the Assad regime into softening its tactics exposed shortcomings in the global system of laws and norms designed to ameliorate the suffering of civilians in war. Aleppo represents \u201cthe death of respect for international law and the rules of war,\u201d according to David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee, an aid agency. U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey O. Graham, who have long advocated a more assertive U.S. policy toward Syria, said Aleppo would go down in history as one of the great failures of the international community to halt human rights abuses. \u201cThe name Aleppo will echo through history, like Srebrenica and Rwanda, as a testament to our moral failure and everlasting shame,\u201d the senators said, citing the locations of major atrocities in the Bosnian war and in Africa. And Aleppo also became a symbol of the failures of the Syrian revolution, which began with peaceful protests against a dictatorial regime but mutated into an armed rebellion that also violated many of those international rules. In Aleppo, rebels looted homes and factories. They squabbled, fragmented and turned on one another, even in the last days of the siege, battling one another for control over stockpiled weapons, according to rebel commanders and residents of the city. A sizable number embraced the extremist visions of Islam that so alarmed the United States and its Western allies that promises of more significant support were never fulfilled. And now the shattered city stands as a symbol too of a wrecked and polarized country. West Aleppo, which always remained in government hands, is still largely intact, though rebel shelling killed many civilians there, too. Tens of thousands of civilians from eastern Syria have sought refuge there in recent days, streaming across the front line clutching bags and blankets. East Aleppo, which was under rebel control, is destroyed. Syrian state television broadcast live footage throughout the day on Tuesday showing its reporters roaming through the ruins of the newly reconquered neighborhoods, trumpeting the government\u2019s victory as they climbed over piles of rubble, peered into abandoned homes and sifted through the remains of rebel defenses. There was no other sign of life in the empty streets. Ryan reported from Washington.

There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government or Russia on the reports. Pro-government forces reportedly killed 82 civilians \u201con the spot\u201d as they closed in on the last rebel enclave in Aleppo Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said earlier Tuesday. That and other reports of mass killings, which could not be independently confirmed, reinforced fears of atrocities in eastern Aleppo in the final hours of the battle for the city, which has been split between rebel and government control since 2012. Several residents and opposition activists have told The Associated Press that government forces carried out summary killings of rebels in the streets in neighborhoods captured on Monday, but the Syrian military flatly denied the claims, saying such allegations were \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d to try gain international sympathy. None of the residents reached by AP witnessed the alleged killings. Their statements reflected the deepening chaos in the remaining rebel-held areas. Mohammed Abu Rajab, the administrator of the last remaining clinic in rebel-held parts of the city, said people who were killed or wounded are being left in the streets. 21 Photos Fighting rages in Aleppo Aref al-Aref, a nurse and activist in eastern Aleppo, said civilians had taken cover in a medical center in one of the last rebel holdouts after its staff evacuated two days earlier. He said the army killed them, but pressed for details, he said he only heard it from others. Monther Etaky, a resident of eastern Aleppo, said he also heard reports of summary killings and knows the name of three families who have reportedly been killed. \u201cThe last news about mass executions of the people who are arrested by the Assad regime and reports of hundreds of men disappeared, missing and thousands taken to fight with the Assad army, all that will push people to stay here,\u201d Etaky said. The U.N.\u2019s children agency said in a statement on Tuesday that there could be more than 100 unaccompanied children trapped in building under fire in eastern Aleppo, citing a report from an unnamed doctor in the city. UNICEF regional director Geert Cappalaere said UNICEF is concerned over the unverified reports of \u201cextrajudicial killings of civilians, including children.\u201d The U.N.\u2019s human rights office said it has received reports of pro-government forces killing at least 82 civilians in four neighborhoods of the rapidly-shrinking rebel enclave, including 11 women and 13 children. Spokesman Rupert Colville said the reports recount pro-government forces entering homes and killing some civilians \u201con the spot\u201d in the former rebel enclave. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, he said the reports came in late the previous evening and that he doesn\u2019t know exactly when the killings took place. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement late Monday that he is alarmed over reports of \u201catrocities\u201d against a large number of civilians, including women and children, in the past hours in Aleppo. While stressing that the United Nations is not able to independently verify these reports, the U.N. chief said he conveyed his grave concern to the relevant parties. A press release by the U.N. human rights office in Geneva said that multiple sources reported that tens of civilians were shot dead on Monday in al-Ahrar Square in Kallaseh neighborhood, and also in Bustan al-Qasr, by government forces and their allies, including an Iraqi Shiite militia known as al-Nujabaa. Retaking Aleppo will prove to be Assad\u2019s biggest victory yet in the 5-year-old civil war . Aleppo has long been regarded as a major gateway between Turkey and Syria. But a government win in Aleppo does not end the conflict - significant parts of Syria are still outside government control and huge swaths of the country are a devastated wasteland. More than a quarter of a million people have been killed since the conflict began in 2011 with peaceful protests against the Assad family\u2019s four-decade rule. 21 Photos War in Syria \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Inspections at Oakland Warehouse 0 Shares Email There was no record of fire department inspections at the Oakland, Calif., warehouse where a deadly blaze claimed 36 lives, Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said at a news conference today. Reed said that there was nothing to trigger an inspection -- active businesses, not vacant buildings, are inspected, and she said there was no indication that the warehouse was an active business. \"We have no records of 1315 31st Ave. being inspected nor do we have any records of them applying for a special permit, a change of occupancy, any type of tenant improvement,\" or other request that \"would trigger\" the facility to be in the system, Reed said. Reed said there was an inspection at an auto-body shop next to the warehouse earlier this year. There was also no record of complaints to the fire department, Reed said. The cause of the warehouse fire is still unknown, 11 days after the blaze. The electrical system is part of the ongoing analysis, though no final determination has been made, Jill Snyder of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives added at the news conference today. Reed called the Dec. 2 blaze a \"tragic event\" and said \"our thoughts and prayers\" are with the families.

A cease-fire agreement has been reached that would allow civilians and remaining rebel fighters trapped in the besieged Syrian city to evacuate, NBC confirmed Tuesday. Five buses will head into the enclave in the eastern section of the city to pick up the survivors around 5 a.m. Wednesday local time, a source said. It was not immediately clear what weapons the fighters will be allowed to take with them, they said. \"My brothers, cease fire in all neighborhoods of besieged Aleppo city, total ceasefire but all units be prepared in case of any breach of the ceasefire,\" Alfarouq, the leader of the Ahrar ash-Sham rebel group, who negotiated the deal, declared in a statement. \"Now it is a ceasefire but it's still in the beginning (and) might fail. So cease fire, but stay on high alert. God bless you.\" There was no immediate confirmation of the agreement from the Syrian government, which has been waging a brutal campaign to recapture what was once the country's biggest city \u2014 and which is now in ruins. But NBC confirmed that much of shelling and air strikes stopped in Aleppo when the ceasefire was announced. Russia's envoy to the United Nations said the buses are just for the fighters, not for the civilians. \"Now it's going to be under the control of the Syrian government, so there is no need for the remaining civilians to leave and there are humanitarian arrangements in place,\" Vitaly Churkin said. A short time later, Russia announced that all military action in eastern Aleppo was over and that the Syrian government was now in the control. \"I can't confirm the veracity of these reports that this....arrangement has in fact been reached,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said.\"That said, I've also seen nothing to indicate that those reports were not true.\" David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee said the ceasefire was too little, too late. \"Eastern Aleppo has become a bloody graveyard for thousands of innocent people,\" said Miliband. The development came after dozens of civilians were killed by Syrian forces in what the United Nations described as \"a complete meltdown of humanity\" during the final battle for Aleppo. Citing accounts of women and children being burned alive and of families choosing suicide over surrender, the UN human rights office said it received reports of pro-government forces killing at least 82 people as they tightened their grip on the city. Rupert Colville, spokesman of the U.N. human rights office, said before the agreement was announced that he feared retribution against thousands of civilians still holed up in a \"hellish corner\" smaller than one square mile. Civilians flee the Sukkari neighborhood towards safer areas in southeastern Aleppo, Monday. AFP - Getty Images Eleven women and 13 children were among those killed in four different neighborhoods late Monday, Colville told a news briefing, adding that there could be \"many more.\" \"The reports we had are of people being shot in the street trying to flee and shot in their homes.\" Jens Laerke, U.N. humanitarian spokesman said that it looked like \"a complete meltdown of humanity in Aleppo.\" U.N. agency UNICEF said \"many children, possibly more than 100, unaccompanied or separated from their families, are trapped in a building, under heavy attack in east Aleppo,\" citing reports form a doctor on the scene . Arab media reported that scores of civilians were burned alive by regime forces, although this was not confirmed by observers at the Aleppo Media Center or the U.K.-based Syria Observatory for Human Rights. Charles Lister, a Syria expert and senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said there were \"truly shocking stories from Aleppo including husbands and wives taking each other's lives in family suicides\" and that hundreds may have died during Monday's fighting. Truly shocking stories from #Aleppo , incl. husbands & wives taking eachothers' lives in family suicides. Some say 100s died today. #Syria \u2014 Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) December 13, 2016 Trapped activists posted farewell messages on social media, saying they were \"waiting for death or captivity\" while others fled to government-held areas. As the front lines shifted, thousands carried what possessions they could, some pushing relatives in wheelchairs, before a heavy overnight rainstorm. In an emotional Skype interview with NBC News, Ismail Alabdullah, a volunteer with the White Helmets, said: \"All the world let us down, even they can't protect our volunteers or protect the civilians, so we can't carry out our missions\". \"We're not scared of bombing anymore, all we're scared of is Assad's forces more than ever. Me and everyone, even the white helmets.\" Civilians in government-held areas cheered after pro-Assad forces won more territory. George Ourfalian / AFP - Getty Images In the rebel area, photographer Ameen Al-Halabi posted what he described as a \"last letter\" on Facebook . \"I'm waiting for death or captivity by the Assad regime,\" he wrote, saying that \"to die victorious on earth dust is better than despair \u2026 please forgive me and pray for forgiveness and remember me well.\" Twitter user 'Mr.Alhamdo,' who says he is an Aleppo resident, posted a video update saying farewell to his followers.

    "text": "Businessman is convicted in shotgun slaying of woman on Hollywood street over wage dispute Ezeoma Chigozie\u00a0Obioha Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Ezeoma Chigozie Obioha appears in a Los Angeles courtroom during closing arguments in his murder trial. He was convicted of fatally shooting Carrie Jean Melvin in Hollywood on July 5, 2015. Ezeoma Chigozie Obioha appears in a Los Angeles courtroom during closing arguments in his murder trial. He was convicted of fatally shooting Carrie Jean Melvin in Hollywood on July 5, 2015. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Alene Tchekmedyian and Marisa Gerber Contact Reporters It started with a crush and a spat\u00a0over cash. Ezeoma Chigozie\u00a0Obioha had his eye\u00a0on a strawberry blonde who sometimes worked for him. But she turned him down, prosecutors said, and\u00a0eventually notified state officials that he owed her more than $1,000 for work she had done to promote his company. Soon after, someone blasted her in the face with a shotgun as she was walking with her boyfriend\u00a0to a restaurant in\u00a0Hollywood.\u00a0Before long, authorities focused on Obioha. On Tuesday \u2014\u00a0after about a day of deliberating \u2014 jurors convicted Obioha of first-degree murder,\u00a0ending a mystery\u00a0over the brazen slaying of Carrie Jean Melvin , 30. As the clerk read the verdict,\u00a0the victim's father closed his eyes and cried quietly into his hands. One row back, the defendant's sister's eyes widened and she mouthed, \"what?\" in disbelief. The defendant stared ahead, expressionless. Outside the courtroom, Bernard Melvin spoke in a hushed voice, saying that he hoped people would remember his daughter and that he felt great compassion for the defendant's family. \u201cThere's nothing to celebrate here,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cI lost my daughter, and a young man is going to spend the rest of his life in prison. That's nothing to celebrate.\u201d Jamon Hicks, one of Obioha\u2019s attorneys, said his client was saddened and hurt by the verdict, adding that he plans to file an appeal. \u201cThey got the wrong guy,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cHe didn't do it.\u201d Hicks pointed out that his client always came to court with a big stack of papers \u2014 the result of copious research on the case. \u201cI've never had such an engaged client in my life,\u201d\u00a0Hicks said. \u201cTo me that was a sign of an innocent man.\u201d During closing arguments last week, a\u00a0prosecutor portrayed Obioha, 32, as a scorned suitor who also was upset that Melvin had filed a claim against him\u00a0for money he owed her. Days before the killing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michele Hanisee told jurors, Obioha had\u00a0been notified that Melvin had filed a claim with the state Labor Commission after his $1,620 check \u2014\u00a0for 87 hours of work she did marketing his clothing line on social media \u2014 bounced. The prosecutor said the victim also spurned Obioha\u2019s romantic interest in her. \u201cShe gave him a smack down,\u201d Hanisee said. \u201cShe rejected and challenged him.\u201d The morning after the July 5, 2015, killing, a boy playing on the beach in Malibu found Obioha\u2019s Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun under a rock. Lying nearby was an unusual shotgun shell, identical to an expended shell\u00a0found at the crime scene: a white Rio Royal Grand 12-gauge, 00 buck shell with the head stamp\u00a0\u201cglobalshot.com.\u201d Defense attorneys suggested that both shotgun shells, as well as the gun, were planted. A blast from a Rio Royal shell would have caused more wounds to the victim\u2019s face, they argued. Obioha\u2019s mother, Pauline Obioha, told jurors last week that her son was at home the night of the murder. She helped him bathe his two children before he put them to bed, she said, around the same time authorities say he was driving to Malibu to get rid of the gun. The Homicide Report: A story for every victim Open link Hicks asked Obioha\u2019s mother whether\u00a0she was lying to protect her son. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I wouldn\u2019t do for any of my kids,\u201d Pauline Obioha told jurors. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie.\u201d The defense attacked a six-man photographic lineup that two witnesses \u2014\u00a0Melvin\u2019s boyfriend and a security guard who saw the attack \u2014\u00a0used to identify Obioha as the gunman. After the guard described the shooter as \u201cabnormally dark,\u201d he pointed out\u00a0two possible suspects from the lineup. One was Obioha, whose photo was the darkest in the lineup. \u201cThat is manipulated,\u201d attorney Dana Cole told jurors, referring to the photo. \u201cThat is totally manipulated, and it\u2019s just not right.\u201d Hanisee used her final words to jurors to poke holes in the defense\u00a0arguments, suggesting that Obioha\u2019s family lied and fabricated evidence to protect him. Defense attorneys had downplayed the idea of a financial motive for Obioha by showing\u00a0jurors a receipt indicating that he paid Melvin $1,740 in cash on the same day he wrote the $1,620 check that didn\u2019t clear. But Hanisee called the receipt book \u201cfishy.\u201d Obioha\u2019s sister found it after her brother\u2019s arrest, and the May 2, 2015, entry in Obioha\u2019s receipt book\u00a0was out of chronological order. The obvious conclusion, she said, was that the receipt was fabricated. \u201cEvery scrap of evidence that points to anyone points to him,\u201d Hanisee said. And it was just a month ago, she told jurors, that Pauline Obioha said for the first time that her son was with her on the night of the murder. \u201cI think at some point, her mom instincts overtook her,\u201d Hanisee said.\u00a0 In phone calls from jail, she added, Obioha gave his family different explanations about what happened to his gun. First, he said that it  had been stolen. Then, that Melvin\u2019s boyfriend had taken it to set him up. Lastly, he said it had been planted by an ocean photographer who wanted his Instagram and Facebook accounts featured on the news, the prosecutor said. \u201cHe\u2019s spinning stories for his family, and they are more than happy to believe him,\u201d Hanisee said. In reaching their\u00a0verdict, jurors also found true the special circumstance allegation that he committed murder for financial gain.\u00a0Obioha \u2014 who is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 5 \u2014 faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.

At that November concert, West said that he's \"glad Trump inspired racists to reveal themselves\" and that he's still thinking about running for president in 2020, a statement\u00a0he made in August of 2015 at the\u00a0MTV Video Music Awards. West\u00a0also praised the power of music to unify people after a polarizing election,\u00a0saying, \"I'm not asking y'all on your opinions on who's better, but there are people who voted for either side that come together for music.\" Days following his controversial remarks West cut a Sacremento concert short,\u00a0but not before calling out Beyonc\u00e9 and addressing Jay Z: \"Call me, brah, you still ain't call me. Jay Z, I know you got killas, please don't send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man,\" he said. The following 21 remaining tour dates on West's Saint Pablo tour were canceled shortly after. On Nov. 21 West was hospitalized \u00a0to be treated for\u00a0exhaustion\u00a0and dehydration. He spent more than a week at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, including Thanksgiving, and was released to continue treatment on an outpatient basis. On Dec. 9 West was spotted at a West Hollywood museum, sporting newly blonde hair, making his trip to Trump Tower his second public appearance since the hospitalization.

John Kasich has vetoed the so-called heartbeat bill, which would have given Ohio the nation's most restrictive abortion laws. (Photo: The Enquirer / Liz DuFour) COLUMBUS, Ohio\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Gov. John Kasich on Tuesday rejected\u00a0the\u00a0 so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d \u00a0breaking with his party to veto legislation that would have given Ohio the strictest abortion ban in the nation. Kasich did tighten Ohio's abortion laws by signing a bill that would prevent abortions after 20 weeks' gestation, when opponents of the procedure\u00a0say fetuses can feel pain. Still, the governor will face backlash from conservative Republicans for killing the bill they say would have\u00a0prevented thousands of abortions. The measure prohibited abortions after a fetal heartbeat was detected, as early as\u00a0six weeks\u2019 gestation. Janet Porter, a northeast Ohio activist who has led the effort to pass the bill, sent a message to her supporters Tuesday: \"IT IS NOT OVER.\" She urged them to encourage Republicans to override Kasich's veto before the new legislative session kicks off January 3 \u2013 a prospect that seems unlikely. Ohio's 'heartbeat' abortion bill poses Kasich's first test in Trump era Many Republican lawmakers, emboldened by Donald Trump's recent election, wanted Kasich to sign the more restrictive ban. GOP leaders like Senate President Keith Faber\u00a0saw an opportunity to use the heartbeat bill to overturn Roe v. Wade, counting on new Trump-appointed, conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices. In vetoing the bill, Kasich pointed to judicial precedent, saying the legislation was \"clearly contrary to the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 current rulings on abortion.\u201d The governor joined Ohio Right to Life and several Republican lawmakers\u00a0who opposed the six-week ban, saying similar measures already were\u00a0ruled unconstitutional in\u00a0North Dakota and Arkansas. Why spend taxpayer money defending the law? Anti-abortion and abortion rights groups protested in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse in this 2014 file photo. \u00a0(Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour) \u201cThe State of Ohio will be the losing party in a lawsuit and, as the losing party, the State of Ohio will be forced to pay hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to cover the legal fees for the pro-choice activists\u2019 lawyers,\u201d Kasich\u00a0 wrote in a veto message . Read the full veto message below. Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis praised Kasich's approach. \u201cWhile it must have been difficult, the current make-up of a radically pro-abortion Supreme Court required the governor to exercise great restraint,\u201d Gonidakis said. The 20-week ban will restrict access to abortion while still chipping away at Roe v. Wade, abortion opponents such as Gonidakis argue. Still, it does not include\u00a0exceptions for rape, incest or severe fetal anomalies. It does include an exception to save the life of a\u00a0pregnant woman. More than a dozen states have a ban on abortions after 20 weeks gestation. Still, those could be overturned or taken to the Supreme Court for ruling. Current Supreme Court standards say states may not limit abortions before a fetus is viable outside the womb, generally accepted as 24 weeks' gestation. Abortion rights' supporters seem\u00a0torn on how to respond to Kasich's veto. They celebrated a victory with the heartbeat bill\u2019s defeat, but they also adamantly opposed the 20-week ban, which was\u00a0seen as an extension of Ohio Republicans' continued fight to reduce access to abortions.\u00a0The state had 14 abortion clinics in 2013 and now has nine. Cincinnati has one surgical abortion clinic,\u00a0Planned Parenthood clinic in Mount Auburn, and it\u00a0 nearly lost its license to operate last year . \u201cDon\u2019t let John Kasich fool you. He is one of the most extreme anti-abortion governors in this country. Kasich is on a mission to make abortion illegal in Ohio, and he\u2019s intent on using smoke and mirrors and backdoor politics to do it,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement. Very few abortions are performed after 20 weeks in Ohio. Last year, 145 abortions occurred at 21 weeks or later,\u00a0 according to Ohio Department of Health records . The 20-week ban will take effect in 90 days. ",

Kelly Mantle is a former Chicago performer who made Oscar history by being eligible for nomination in the best supporting actor and best supporting actress categories. (Shawn Smith) Tracy Swartz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Kelly Mantle moved from Oklahoma\u00a0to Chicago 20 years ago to break into the theater scene here.\u00a0 He starred in productions at the Comedy Asylum,\u00a0Athenaeum Theatre and Cafe Voltaire, among other venues. He\u00a0also co-founded the Okra Theatre troupe , named for Oklahoma Runaway Artists. The gender-fluid actor\u00a0moved to Los Angeles a few years later to jumpstart his\u00a0film and TV career (and escape Chicago winters that stretched into May). Now Mantle, whose uncle is the late baseball legend Mickey Mantle, has made Oscar\u00a0history. The producers of \"Confessions of a Womanizer\"\u00a0submitted Mantle's name to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and\u00a0Sciences \u00a0for consideration in\u00a0both the supporting actor and supporting actress categories for his role as transgender prostitute Ginger. The Academy granted the request in a\u00a0landmark decision. \"You always dream about (the Oscars) but ... I never knew it was going to have a groundbreaking experience tied to it,\" Mantle said in a phone interview with the Tribune.\u00a0Mantle said he prefers the Tribune use a masculine pronoun when referring to him in this story. Garnering an Oscar nomination for a transgender role is not new. Hilary Swank won a best actress Oscar for her portrayal of a transgender man in 1999's \"Boys Don't Cry\" and Eddie Redmayne got\u00a0a best actor nod for playing a transgender woman in last year's \"The Danish Girl.\" But Mantle is the first potential Oscar nominee\u00a0eligible in both male and female categories. He said the team behind\u00a0\"Confessions of a Womanizer\" approached him about starting an Oscar campaign for the indie film and set up his\u00a0paperwork for the Academy. Mantle\u00a0said he has received a \"pretty favorable response\" since he posted news of\u00a0the Academy's decision\u00a0to Instagram\u00a0last week. \"There have been a few thunderstorms here and there, but\u00a0a thunderstorm has never stopped me before,\" Mantle said. Oscar\u00a0nominations are set to be announced Jan. 24 ahead of the Feb. 26 awards ceremony. In the meantime, Mantle is promoting his\u00a0dark comedy\u00a0\"Middle Man,\" by Chicago-based filmmaker Ned Crowley. Mantle is also shooting the comedy pilot\u00a0\"Tight\" with Alex Kapp Horner, who starred in the canceled CBS sitcom \"The New Adventures of Old Christine.\" Mantle said he doesn't make it back to Chicago often, but he performed\u00a0at Roscoe's in Boystown \u00a0two years ago\u00a0after being\u00a0eliminated in the first round of Season 6 of \"RuPaul's Drag Race.\" \"It was good to get back to the city,\" Mantle said.

    "text": "WATCH Ohio 'Heartbeat' Abortion Bill Heads to Governor 0 Shares Email Oklahoma plans to force hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants and public schools to post signs inside public restrooms directing pregnant women where to receive services as part of an effort to reduce abortions in the state. The State Board of Health will consider regulations for the signs on Tuesday. Businesses and other organizations will have to pay an estimated $2.3 million to put up the signs because the Legislature didn't approve any money for them. The provision for the signs was tucked into a law that the Legislature passed this year that requires the state to develop informational material \"for the purpose of achieving an abortion-free society.\" The signs must be posted by January 2018. Groups representing hospitals and restaurants are among those complaining that the new requirements are an expensive, unfunded mandate from the Legislature. \"We don't have any concern about the information they're trying to get out to women about their babies and their pregnancy. This is just the wrong way to do it,\" said Jim Hooper, president of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association. \"It's just another mandate on small businesses. It's not just restaurants. It includes hospitals, nursing homes. It just doesn't make sense.\" The anti-abortion group Oklahomans for Life requested the bill. The sponsor, Sen. A.J. Griffin, said she may revise the measure in the upcoming legislative session to more narrowly target it to exclude some facilities. \"I do see how it is going to need to be tempered a tad,\" said Griffin, a Republican from Guthrie. \"We need to make sure we have something that's reasonable and still effective.\" Under the law, the signs would state: \"There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you carry your child to term and assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or to place him or her for adoption. The State of Oklahoma strongly urges you to contact them if you are pregnant.\" The signs would also include a link to the Health Department's website. In written comments provided to the Health Department , the Tulsa Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy called the proposed regulations \"completely unnecessary and unwanted\" and said they would provide a significant financial burden on already stressed state agencies, including the departments of Health and Education. Don Maisch, an attorney for the State Department of Health who has worked on the rules, said the signage requirements apply to public restrooms of any entity that is regulated by the agency, including hospitals, hotels and motels, nursing homes, residential care facilities and most public schools. \"There is definitely a cost involved in moving forward with this,\" Maisch said. The Oklahoma Hospital Association projected it would cost at least $225,000 for signage at the state's 140 licensed hospitals, with the fiscal impact on other licensed industries estimated at about $2.1 million. Tony Lauinger, executive director of Oklahomans for Life, said the group's intent was for the Health Department to produce the signage, but only if the Legislature appropriated funds to do so. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ",

The petition suggests that the next major vessel be christened \u201cUSS The Deplorables,\u201d as the petition notes, \u201cto honor those citizens who rose up to defend America and the Constitution from the globalists.\u201d The name is taken from a remark Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made on the campaign trail to refer to supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. \"You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,\u201d Clinton said at a rally in September. \"The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it. And, unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.\u201d Related Image Expand / Contract A supporter of President-elect Donald Trump wears tape with the word \"deplorable\" written on it in the audience at a campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, U.S., September 15, 2016. (REUTERS/Mike Segar) The remark initially offended many Trump supporters, and Clinton apologized for it. But the term quickly turned into a rallying cry for Trump\u2019s campaign and helped the GOP candidate win the White House. Now it appears at least some of his supporters would like the Navy\u2019s next ship to be \u201cdeplorable\u201d as well. The petition, which was started by someone with the initials D.S., has so far only garnered 768 votes since being launched on December 4, 2016 \u2013 99,232 short of the 100,000 needed by January 3, 2017, to receive an official response from the White House. Would you like to be a sailor deployed on a ship called the USS The Deplorables? - David Winkler, director of programs at the Naval Historical Foundation \u201cMy gut reaction when I heard about this was, \u2018Would you like to be a sailor deployed on a ship called the USS The Deplorables?\u2019\u201d David Winkler, director of programs at the Naval Historical Foundation, told FoxNews.com. \u201cDo you think someone would really want to say, \u2018Look at that ship out there \u2013 it\u2019s deplorable?\u2019\u201d While \u201cUSS The Deplorables\u201d may not be cruising through open waters anytime soon, it is not unprecedented for a U.S. Navy ship to be named after someone other than a famous naval officer, president or war hero. More on this... Navy Secretary Says Future Navy Fighter Planes Will Be Unmanned Eschewing the traditional picks of military men in naming ships (i.e. the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower or the USS Ronald Reagan), Mabus recently drew criticism for naming ships in honor of the late gay rights leader Harvey Milk, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and civil rights leader Rep. \u00a0John Lewis among others. \"It just doesn't help at all for what the basic sailor or officer thinks of his chain of command, up to the secretary of the navy,\" retired Vice Adm. Doug Crowder told the Associated Press. \"Is it catastrophic? No. But that's the risk you run.\" Mabus argued that he is honoring people who have shown heroism, just as past secretaries have done. He said he believes that by looking outside the military for heroes, he can help connect people with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. \"I have named ships after presidents. I have named ships after members of Congress who have been forceful advocates for the Navy and Marine Corps,\" Mabus said. \"But I think you have to represent all the values that we hold as Americans, that we hold as a country. And so that's why I've named ships the Medgar Evers, Cesar Chavez, John Lewis, the Harvey Milk. Because these are American heroes too, just in a different arena.\" Related Image U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus salutes servicemen as he leaves the USS Freedom littoral combat ship after his visit, at Changi Naval Base in Singapore May 11, 2013. (REUTERS/Edgar Su) Would \u201cThe Deplorables\u201d pass muster? \u201cThere\u2019s been some controversy in the past with names having some political undertones,\u201d Winkler told FoxNews.com. \u201cMabus is trying to reach out to different groups of people with his choices, but naming a ship \u2018Deplorable\u2019 is not the way to do that.\u201d Controversy over what to name American naval vessels goes back to the earliest days of the United States. George Washington wanted the names of the Navy's first six ships to be inspired by the Constitution. The first five were, but the nation's first Navy secretary, Benjamin Stoddert, arbitrarily named the sixth the USS Chesapeake. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The brash Texas oilman has helped forge or supervise exploration, production and refinery projects in 50 countries on\u00a0six continents, from Africa to the Arctic. The company was widely seen as a quasi-state, with more influence in some parts of the world than the U.S. government. If Tillerson is confirmed as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of State, however, he may find that his 41-year career at the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil and gas company could hamper his ability to freely conduct foreign policy as America\u2019s top diplomat. A Senate confirmation fight already is brewing over Tillerson\u2019s personal and business ties to Vladimir Putin , now Russia\u2019s autocratic president. Few in Congress feel warmly about Putin, and many are outraged that CIA reports show that Russia used hackers to try to influence the U.S. presidential race. After several days of leaks from his transition team, Trump confirmed Tuesday that he will nominate Tillerson , saying the 64-year-old oil mogul\u2019s career \u201cis the embodiment of the American dream.\u201d Donald Trump , a candidate whose social media savvy belied what they saw as a staggering\u00a0disregard for the innovation economy and the\u00a0tech culture that has fostered it. Now comes the reckoning. Some... Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurs made little effort over the last year to conceal their distaste\u00a0for Donald Trump , a candidate whose social media savvy belied what they saw as a staggering\u00a0disregard for the innovation economy and the\u00a0tech culture that has fostered it. Now comes the reckoning. Some... (Evan Halper and David Pierson) \"His tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics make him an excellent choice for secretary of State,\u201d the president-elect said in a statement. To avoid direct conflicts of interest, Tillerson would be required to sell his $240 million in Exxon Mobil stock and other holdings. But he might also have to recuse himself from specific issues before the State Department, experts say. \u201cUnless he severs all financial ties to Exxon Mobil, he will be required by law to recuse himself from everything relating not just to that business, but from all industries in which it operates \u2014 something that would make it very hard for him to do his job,\u201d Norman Eisen\u00a0and Richard Painter, who\u00a0head Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics watchdog group, said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cIt may be that the appearance of conflict and the need for repeated recusals is so profound that the Senate concludes he cannot do the job,\u201d said Eisen, who served in\u00a0the Obama administration, and Painter, who worked for President George W. Bush. Tillerson\u2019s Senate confirmation is far from assured. Democratic opposition appeared strong and some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about his work in Russia, although none have yet said they will vote against him. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he would\u00a0ask Tillerson if he ever voiced criticism to Putin for his egregious human rights record at home and abroad, including\u00a0recent Russian\u00a0air attacks that killed civilians in Syria. \u201cI\u00a0have concerns about what kind of business we do with a butcher, a murderer and a thug, which is exactly what Vladimir Putin is,\u201d McCain\u00a0said. As Exxon Mobil\u2019s CEO, Tillerson opposed the 2014 decision by the Obama administration and its European allies to impose sanctions on Russia for its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine, a\u00a0dispute that sent U.S.-Russian relations into free fall. The sanctions cost Exxon Mobil about $1 billion, according to company reports, because projects had to be scrapped. In 2011, Exxon Mobil had signed a deal with Russia\u2019s largest state-owned oil company, Rosneft, for joint exploration and production in hard-to-reach territory north of the Arctic Circle, where more than 90 billion barrels is believed to be in reserve. Today, that project looks foolhardy, said Pavel Molchanov, an oil industry analyst with Raymond James & Associates. \u201cAt today\u2019s oil prices, there\u2019s absolutely no rationale for Arctic oil drilling,\u201d Molchanov said. \u201cIt\u2019s in a remote location, difficult climate. It\u2019s pretty marginal, economically speaking. There obviously are places to drill with today\u2019s prices. The Arctic is not one of them.\u201d Rosneft was built on the ruins of Yukos, an oil company that belonged to Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was sent to prison for alleged fraud in what many saw as a case of Putin\u2019s revenge for the businessman\u2019s support of anti-Kremlin forces.\u00a0 Rosneft and its CEO, Igor\u00a0Sechin, who is considered Putin\u2019s right-hand man and someone with whom Tillerson worked closely, were specifically blacklisted\u00a0by the Western sanctions. In 2012, two years\u00a0before the Ukraine invasion,\u00a0Putin bestowed Russia's Order of Friendship on Tillerson, a rare prize for a U.S. citizen and one that on occasion has been given to communist spies. The Tillerson \u201cappointment is very beneficial for Putin,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, Russia\u2019s former deputy energy minister and an opposition leader. \u201cIt will mean the end of values of the American foreign policy vector and a transfer to purely pragmatic deals on certain matters.\" On Tuesday, Russia was the first country to praise Tillerson, saying he exhibited a \u201cpragmatism\u201d that would permit \u201ca mutually beneficial relationship\u201d between Moscow and Washington. Other plaudits came from parts of the Middle East, where Tillerson is well known among Persian Gulf royalty. Some Sunni Arab leaders felt neglected by an Obama administration that focused on forging a nuclear pact with Shiite Iran, archrival of Saudi Arabia, and called for a strategic pivot to Asia. In Saudi Arabia, Exxon Mobil\u00a0has multibillion-dollar investments in refineries and chemical companies with Aramco, the Saudi oil conglomerate founded by Exxon and considered the world\u2019s most valuable company, worth an estimated $10 trillion. In Qatar, Exxon Mobil is part owner of 12 of 14 liquefied natural gas plants, and in the United Arab Emirates, Exxon owns nearly a third of the largest oil concession there, according to the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington. \u201cArab leaders in the Gulf might look favorably on the appointment of a familiar oil executive as secretary of State,\u201d said Jean-Francois Seznec, a scholar at the institute. \u201cHowever, they also know he is quite a strategist who knows the regional games and how to play them.\u201d ",

    "text": "Prosecutors Ask Judge to Allow Cosby's Accusers to Testify By maryclaire dale and michael r. sisak, associated press NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u0097 Dec 13, 2016, 6:49 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Bill Cosby's Civil Deposition Testimony Can Be Used by Prosecutors in Criminal Trial 0 Shares Email Bill Cosby used his fame to gain the trust of women before knocking them out with pills and drinks so he could sexually assault them, prosecutors argued Tuesday as they sought to persuade a judge to allow 13 of his accusers to testify in his upcoming sexual assault trial. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele told a judge he wants the accusers' testimony to show Cosby had a lengthy history of drugging and molesting young women. \"The defendant has engaged, over the course of decades, in a signature pattern of non-consensual sexual assaults on young women who were in an unconscious state due to an intoxicant that the defendant administered to them,\" Steele argued. Cosby, who is 79 and has been married for decades, is charged with sexually assaulting a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. His lawyers want the accusers barred from taking the stand at his spring trial. The defense is expected to attack the women's credibility and relevance when his lawyers make their arguments on Wednesday. Judge Steven O'Neill must decide whether to permit all or some of the women to testify under a state law that allows prosecutors to call witnesses of alleged prior bad acts. The accusers include onetime aspiring actresses, a cocktail waitress and a flight attendant and are among 50 women who have come forward with accusations against Cosby since prosecutors reopened the 2004 case last year. The hearing was testy from the start, with the judge twice warning the lawyers to maintain decorum after courtroom shouting matches that centered on the defense team's practice of publicizing the names of the accusers. Steele clashed with Cosby lawyer Brian McMonagle over the defense's insistence on identifying accusers by name in public documents and a court hearing. Steele suggested Cosby's lawyers were publicizing them in an attempt to intimidate the women. McMonagle said many of the women had already gone public with their allegations. \"These are witnesses in a trial,\" he argued. \"They are not children.\" The judge ultimately ruled Cosby's lawyers could identify 11 of the women by name since they'd already told their stories publicly. He said two of the women have remained out of the spotlight and shouldn't be identified in court. Later, Steele blew up at the defense over the positioning of a projection screen, saying Cosby's lawyers had it placed so the women's names would be seen by dozens of reporters in the courtroom gallery. McMonagle said courtroom staff positioned the screen, but he agreed to remove accusers' names from a planned presentation. The judge said he'd be forced to call in sheriff's deputies if the lawyers couldn't behave. The case began a decade ago when Temple University employee Andrea Constand filed a police complaint against Cosby, her friend and mentor, over an encounter at his home. A prosecutor at the time declined to file charges. But authorities reopened the case last year after scores of women raised similar accusations and after Cosby's damaging deposition testimony from Constand's lawsuit became public. The judge last week said the deposition was fair game at trial, arming prosecutors with Cosby's testimony about his affairs with young women, his use of quaaludes as a seduction tool and his version of the sexual encounter with Constand the night in question. The judge must walk a fine line in weighing the accusers' testimony, given a 2015 state Supreme Court ruling that threw out a Roman Catholic Church official's child endangerment conviction because the Philadelphia trial judge let too many priest abuse victims testify about the alleged church cover-up. The defense has questioned the women's motivation, noting many are clients of celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred , who has suggested Cosby should put up a $100 million settlement fund for potential sexual assault and defamation claims. Allred said last week her clients have a duty to testify if the court wants to hear from them. She called the defense's dismissal of their accounts \"out of context or just plain wrong.\" Cosby, once known as America's Dad for his top-rated family sitcom, \"The Cosby Show,\" which ran from 1984 to 1992, was noticeably more engaged and animated Tuesday than at previous hearings. Unsolicited, he blurted out \"1937\" and then shouted \"July 12!\" when the judge asked the lawyers for his date of birth. He chimed in again a few minutes later when the judge and the lawyers were trying to figure out the location of a hotel mentioned by one accuser. \"The Drake is in Chicago,\" Cosby interjected. Cosby greeted security officers with a joke before Tuesday's hearing, quipping, \"Don't tase me, bro,\" as they wanded him on his way into court. The AP doesn't typically identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Constand has done. 0 Shares ",

What is the polar vortex? This phrase is once again in the headlines, and worth re-defining. The \u201cpolar vortex\u201d technically refers to a large area of low pressure and cold air that surrounds both of the Earth\u2019s poles, according to the National Weather Service. It\u2019s always existed at the poles, but the polar vortex strengthens in particular during the winter and can send cold air southward.\u00a0 Temperatures dip to dangerous lows when the polar vortex expands, sending thermometers plummeting. There have been a number of notable cold snaps caused by the polar vortex, including in 1977, 1982, 1985, 1989 and 2014, according to the weather service. For now, the Midwest is getting hit the hardest Arctic air from the polar vortex has already brought bitterly cold temperatures to the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest this week, Jamie Yuccas reported for \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Tuesday.\u00a0 Temperatures felt like 20 degrees below zero in Bismark, North Dakota, and minus-18 degrees in Minneapolis on Tuesday. Cold temperatures at this level can cause skin to freeze in less than ten minutes, Yuccas reported, raising serious risks of frostbite and hypothermia . There is little relief in sight. The Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will remain frigid through the end of this week, the National Weather Service said. On Wednesday, the expected highs range from 20 to 30 degrees below average for much of the region. Beyond the Midwest: Severe cold warnings Extreme cold will freeze other regions this week, too. The National Weather Service is warning of frigid temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast and potentially heavy snow in the Great Lakes region Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0 New England in particular should brace for intense cold and wind on Thursday, with the potential for record low temperatures, Eric Fisher, meteorologist at CBS Boston station WBZ reported. Chills originating in the Arctic will bring snow showers and temperatures in the teens and low 20s.\u00a0 That\u2019s about 15 to 20 degrees lower than usual averages for this time of year, Fisher said. Snow is also expected to accumulate across portions of the Great Basin and the Pacific Northwest this week. Severe rain is possible across much of central and northern California.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Tom Burke, EPA\u2019s science adviser and a deputy assistant administrator, said in an interview that the removal of the phrase about \u201cwidespread, systemic\u201d impacts came at the urging of the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. \u201cData gaps did not allow us to quantify how widespread the impacts are,\u201d Burke said. Environmental groups have claimed that the finding of no widespread harm was inserted into the draft report at the insistence of the White House. President Barack Obama supports fracking as part of a wide-ranging energy strategy. An EPA spokeswoman denied any political pressure. \u201cThis is an EPA document, not a White House document,\u201d said spokeswoman Monica Lee. Fracking opponents said the report confirmed what they have long argued - that fracking threatens drinking water. \u201cWe are glad EPA resisted oil and gas industry spin, followed the science and delivered the facts,\u201d said John Noel, national oil and gas campaigns coordinator for Clean Water Action, an advocacy group. \u201cEPA must take action to address these threats now.\u201d But the oil industry called the report an \u201cabsurd\u201d reversal as the Obama administration leaves office. \u201cThe agency has walked away from nearly a thousand sources of information from ... technical reports and peer-reviewed scientific reports demonstrating that ... hydraulic fracturing does not lead to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources,\u201d said Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group. Like the draft study, the final report found specific instances where poorly constructed drilling wells or improper wastewater management affected drinking water. Impacts generally occurred near drilling sites \u201cand ranged in severity, from temporary changes in water quality to contamination that made private drinking wells unusable,\u201d the EPA statement said. The number of contamination cases was small compared to the large number of wells that are fracked nationwide, the EPA said. The EPA assessment tracked water used throughout the fracking process, from acquiring the water to mixing chemicals at the well site and injecting so-called \u201cfracking fluids\u201d into wells, to collection of wastewater, wastewater treatment and disposal. The report identified several vulnerabilities to drinking water resources, including fracking\u2019s effect on drought-stricken areas; inadequately cased or cemented wells resulting in below-ground migration of gases and liquids; inadequately treated wastewater discharged into drinking water resources; and spills of hydraulic fluids and wastewater. Congress ordered the long-awaited report in 2010, as a surge in fracking fueled a nationwide boom in production of oil and natural gas. Fracking rigs have sprouted up in recent years in states from California to Pennsylvania, as energy companies take advantage of improved technology to gain access to vast stores of oil and natural gas under much of the continental U.S. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Anyway, the school district decided it would be best to ban student choirs from taking part in this year\u2019s celebration \u2014 most certainly breaking the hearts of children who wanted to spread a bit of Christmas cheer. \u201cNo one was particularly happy with the outcome of this,\u201d school district spokesman Tim Simmons told The News & Observer . \u201cSome schools had been participating for several years.\u201d The annual event is a three-day \u201ccelebration of the birth and ministry of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,\u201d sponsored by the Church of Latter-day Saints in Apex. \u201cWhen school choirs ask students to attend a church event, a reasonable student will perceive that the school is endorsing religion,\u201d Elliott wrote in his letter. I hardly doubt a grade school choir is going to spontaneously convert to the Mormon faith simply because they were singing \u201cI Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.\u201d I\u00a0reached out to Steven Bodhaine, who oversees nine Mormon congregations in Wake County -- a very nice gentleman. He assured me there has never been any proselytizing at the celebration.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s never been a single incident or concern in the past 13 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, these schools often look forward to this because it\u2019s such a beautiful venue to perform.\u201d Simmons told the newspaper that their legal counsel opined that letting the choirs perform would \u201cput the district in the position of potentially endorsing a religious viewpoint.\u201d According to the nativity event website, it\u2019s a three-day \u201ccelebration of the birth and ministry of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\u201d The Freedom From Religion Foundation says they are dedicated to the \u201cseparation of church and state.\u201d But in reality they are a bunch of mean-spirited Christophobic agitators who prey on small towns and innocent school children. \u201cIf FFRF\u2019s brand of religious hostility was so attractive, they wouldn\u2019t have to bully people into submission,\u201d said Hiram Sasser, with First Liberty Institute - a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases. FFRF said they took action after a \u201cconcerned parent\u201d complained \u2014 obviously someone who has a checkered past with Jolly Old Saint Nick.\u00a0 \u201cPublic schools are a place for all students regardless of religious belief or non-belief,\u201d Elliott told the newspaper in a Tuesday interview. \u201cTo have public schools involved in a Christian event celebrating the birth of Jesus is a problem.\u201d What a heartless thing for someone to do \u2014 setting loose a bunch of godless Grinches so they could bully children.

But investigations have found it to be downright cruel. Drill instructors abusing, humiliating and hazing recruits -- none of it permitted, according to Commanding Gen. Austin Renforth. \u201cYou put your hands on a young man or woman you have crossed the line and we are not going to tolerate it,\u201d Renforth said. But investigations show that behavior was tolerated until last spring, when the abuses came to light. Marine recruits on Parris Island CBS News An e-mail sent to the White House titled \u201cConcerned Loved Ones of Innocent Recruits\u201d described incidents of drill instructors withholding food, drinking on the job, calling recruits \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cfaggots,\u201d and warning them that \u201csnitches get stitches.\u201d Raheel Siddiqui The most notorious case, involving a Muslim recruit named Raheel Siddiqui who allegedly jumped to his death after being slapped and choked by a drill instructor, is still under investigation. In an earlier incident that same drill instructor allegedly ordered another Muslim recruit into a clothes dryer. Renforth was supposed to fix all that when he assumed command last June. He said that choking, slapping and name-calling are not acceptable. \u201cAny allegation of recruit abuses comes directly to me. That is something I implemented when I took over,\u201d he said. But since then, one recruit has been found dead in his bunk, the cause still unknown. Another is in critical condition after jumping from a second floor landing. Commanding Gen. Austin Renforth CBS News Both cases are still under investigation. The Marines have brought charges ranging from lying to cruelty and maltreatment against four Marine sergeants involved in the abuse scandal; All four are slated for courts martial. None of those charges involve Siddiqui\u2019s death. More charges ranging from assault to dereliction of duty are expected to be filed against both officers and drill instructors. But Renforth says the training at Parris Island will remain as tough, though not as cruel, as ever. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, for secretary of the interior, a top transition source told NBC News on Tuesday. Zinke, 55, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee who's described as an avid hunter and fisherman, was an early and consistent supporter of Trump's presidential campaign and was re-elected to a second term last month as Montana's sole representative in the House. If Trump carries through with the appointment, Zinke's nomination would have to be confirmed by the Senate. The Interior Department oversees federal management of about three-quarters of federal land and natural resources, along with programs relating to American Indian and territorial affairs. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, spoke with a supporter in Billings as he campaigned for re-election in October. AP Zinke is a strong supporter of coal, oil, and gas exploration and development with a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters , an environmental advocacy group. But he is also described as an enthusiastic outdoorsman, and he has backed increased funding to preserve open spaces. Zinke is a strong supporter of coal, oil, and gas exploration and development with a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters , an environmental advocacy group. Zinke met with Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York. Trump's communications director, Jason Miller, called Zinke \"a strong advocate for American energy independence,\" saying he \"supports an all-encompassing energy policy that includes renewables, fossil fuels and alternative energy.\" At a congressional campaign debate in 2014 , Zinke hedged when he was asked whether he believed climate change was real. He said that it wasn't a hoax but that it also wasn't \"proven science.\" In a statement Tuesday, the environmental group Greenpeace called Zinke a \"climate change denier\" whose \"real constituency is the fossil industry and coal companies.\" But he is also an enthusiastic outdoorsman, and he has bucked some general Republican policies by backing increased funding to preserve open spaces and opposing the transfer of public land to the states. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, who also had been believed to be up for interior secretary, at Trump Tower in New York on Monday after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Richard Drew / AP Another lawmaker widely believed to have been up for the position, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, ran into fierce opposition from environmental advocates who were angered by her introduction of legislation to sell off public lands. McMorris Rodgers also met Monday with Trump. She didn't address reports that she was under consideration, telling reporters only that \"we talked about a lot of things\" and that \"it was great to spend time with him. Zinke, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, is a highly decorated retired Navy SEAL who served as acting commander of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force in the Arabian Peninsula, leading Special Operations personnel in Iraq. In an interview Monday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Zinke talked at length about his support for Trump's nomination of retired Gen. James Mattis to be defense secretary, calling him the right man for the job. As late as Tuesday afternoon, Zinke was still hiring staffers for his congressional offices. I'm excited to announce @AaronFlint will serve as the new state director for the Congressional office. He's a veteran and a true Montanan. \u2014 Ryan Zinke (@RepRyanZinke) December 13, 2016 Kristen Welker ",

The tunnels were found in an area of warehouses across from Otay Mesa. Prosecutors said Monday that one of the tunnels reached to San Diego, California, and the other was unfinished. The Attorney General's Office said the tunnels were apparently used by the Sinaloa drug cartel to move drugs into the United States. It said it found the tunnels after the U.S. consulate in Tijuana determined the tunnels were being reactivated after apparently falling into disuse. 0 Shares ",

Former NIU police Officer Andrew Rifkin. (DeKalb County Sheriff\u2019s Office) Clifford Ward Chicago Tribune A woman described Tuesday how a sexual encounter with a Northern Illinois University police officer in 2011 turned nonconsensual, as the former officer's trial on sex assault charges began in DeKalb County. The woman, now 24,  was the opening witness in the trial of Andrew Rifkin at the county courthouse in Sycamore.  She was an 18-year-old NIU freshman in October 2011 when she alleges that Rifkin assaulted her at his residence in Cortland, near DeKalb. Rifkin, then a 23-year-old rookie campus cop, and the woman were having intercourse when Rifkin tried to initiate anal intercourse, she testified. \"It was horrible. I never felt that kind of pain before,\" she told jurors. She said she told Rifkin to stop three or four times. \"It felt like it lasted forever, but it was probably only a minute or so,\" she said. She went to his superiors about two weeks later, and Rifkin was fired from the force, which bars officers from having relationships with students. The woman testified that after the alleged assault, she spent the rest of the night at Rifkin's apartment, and Rifkin told her he would \"make her life a living hell\" if she told anyone about their relationship. The woman recounted meeting Rifkin, who was assigned to her residence hall. She said they flirted and kissed in a dormitory computer room, and a day or so later had sex at his home. The alleged assault took place two days after their first sexual encounter, she said, after Rifkin had picked her up from a fraternity party and they went to his residence. ",

By Steven Mufson December 13 at 7:16 PM Follow @StevenMufson When ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson showed up in June at the annual St. Petersburg international economic forum that is dubbed Russia\u2019s Davos, he was asked about the impact international sanctions on Russia were having on his company, which had abandoned ambitious drilling plans there. \u201cIt\u2019s a question for the government \u2014 if you find anyone from the U.S. government who\u2019s willing to answer this question,\u201d he replied to laughter from the audience of Western executives, who had been lavishing praise on their Russian hosts. It was the first time in three years that Tillerson or most other chief executives had attended the confab, for the moment laying aside friction over Russia\u2019s abrupt annexation of Crimea and its backing of violent separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Back in Washington, the State Department was not amused. State Department spokesman John F. Kirby commented that \u201cmost American companies understand\u201d that taking part in the forum \u201csends the wrong message about the acceptability of Russia\u2019s actions.\u201d Six months later, Tillerson\u2019s relationships with autocrats remain a source of friction after his surprise appointment by \u00adPresident-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of state. The ExxonMobil chief\u2019s ties to Russia have alarmed hawks in Congress, who vow to scrutinize Tillerson\u2019s good working relationship with President Vladi\u00admir Putin and the latter\u2019s longtime confidant Igor Sechin, the chairman of the Russian petroleum giant Rosneft. With his nomination, the 64-year-old Tillerson has been thrust into the long-standing U.S. \u00adforeign policy divide separating those who value pragmatism and dealmaking from those who attach greater importance to principles, human rights and democracy. This is a divide that cuts across both parties. The Washington Post's Paul Kane and Steven Mufson explain why Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, might face a few hurdles in his confirmation. (The Washington Post) Should he be confirmed, Tillerson will no longer answer to the more than 93,000 shareholders of ExxonMobil but primarily to a single shareholder named Trump. And he will draw on views refined in industry, not diplomacy. To fans of Tillerson, his relationship with Putin is a sign of his pragmatism, seeking advantage for his company with a blunt, straightforward style that has won respect abroad. Speaking to students from the Texas Tech business school last year, Tillerson said the reason \u201cwhy I\u2019ve been able to gain Vladimir Putin\u2019s trust\u201d is \u201cbecause throughout my career I\u2019ve wanted people to view me as an honest person.\u201d To his critics, however, Tillerson and ExxonMobil come across as arrogant and indifferent to Russia\u2019s record in Ukraine or Putin\u2019s harsh suppression of domestic opposition. The oil giant\u2019s vast enterprise spanning six continents and more than 50 nations has embraced a varied cast of national leaders, including the Saudi oil ministers, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s corrupt Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the autocratic government of Kazakhstan and the emir of Qatar. These contrary views are in some ways connected. Edward S. Verona, who worked for ExxonMobil for two years and spent several more working in Moscow, said one reason Tillerson was respected in Moscow was because of the way the company dealt with Venezuela\u2019s then-president, the voluble Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In 2007, Ch\u00e1vez had wanted to rewrite contract terms for companies operating in the country\u2019s vast, oil-rich Orinoco belt. Exxon said no, abandoning 2 percent of its worldwide reserves and winning arbitration court orders to freeze Venezuelan assets. In the same way, Exxon exited Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta after insurgents disputed operations there. \u201cYou have to be willing to say, \ufffd?No, we aren\u2019t going to do it that way, we are going to do it this way; if we can\u2019t do it this way, we won\u2019t be here,\u2019 \u201d Tillerson said about the company\u2019s strategy of keeping its Ni\u00adger\u00adian exploration to offshore areas, where it was safer. \u201cRex Tillerson gained the respect of Russians, particularly Sechin and Putin, because he was prepared to stand up and push back when he felt his company was being treated unfairly,\u201d said Verona, now a senior adviser to McLarty Associates. The fight coincided with efforts by Russia\u2019s Gazprom, a state-owned company, to horn its way into a Sakhalin Island project off eastern Russia that Tillerson had helped negotiate years earlier. ExxonMobil was able to navigate the dispute with help from Putin and Sechin. The project, built in extremely harsh conditions, remains one of the company\u2019s most lucrative, Tillerson has said. Some of Exxon\u2019s perceived arrogance is rooted in the company\u2019s history as the largest of the corporations split off from the Standard Oil Trust, the enterprise built by John D. Rockefeller. Lifelong Scout Tillerson was born in Wichita Falls, Tex., the son of a Boy Scout administrator. He still lists the rank of Eagle Scout on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and has remained active in the organization. In 2012, he was instrumental in pushing the Boy Scouts board to admit openly gay youths. His experience as a Scout fit well into the company, which insisted on rules that were more detailed than most other oil companies. In 1997, Exxon sent Tillerson, then a promising executive who had been in Yemen, to Moscow to \u201cpick up the relationship and repair it,\u201d Tillerson later recalled . His predecessor had been kicked out of the country. Tillerson met six different prime ministers over the course of 14 months. The last of those was Putin. Nearly 15 years later in Sochi, Putin provided the blessing for what could become Exxon\u2019s largest Russian deal, a joint exploration agreement with Rosneft covering almost 190 million acres, almost halfway across the Arctic shoreline and covering nine time zones. Speaking later at Texas Tech, Tillerson cited the Boy Scout motto and urged students to have honor and integrity. \u201cThose words mean a lot to me,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cAnd I can tell you they mean a lot in any culture.\u201d He added that \u201cintegrity is recognized by every government, every leader. It\u2019s the most valuable asset you have, your personal integrity.\u201d But while Tillerson preaches the value of honesty and integrity, ExxonMobil has not shied away from doing what is good for its bottom line, which has made environmental groups and others suspicious of its aims. While Tillerson has acknowledged human involvement in the warming of the globe and backed a carbon tax to deal with it, the oil giant has continued to fund groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, whose leading members have cast doubt on climate change or its urgency. The relationship contrasted with that of Shell, which also acknowledges climate change but dropped its membership in ALEC last year, citing differences over the issue. The company is also in the midst of a bitter fight with the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts and with more than a dozen nongovernmental organizations that are looking at whether the oil giant failed to disclose what it knew 40 years ago about the damage fossil fuels were doing to the Earth\u2019s climate. The attorneys general issued broad subpoenas for internal Exxon documents, and the NGOs have encouraged them to consider bringing a fraud case similar to the one that extracted billions of dollars from tobacco companies years ago. ExxonMobil has fought back, going to a Texas federal court near its headquarters and winning the judge\u2019s highly unusual backing for discovery on the attorneys general, including with regard to internal emails, to determine whether they were acting \u201cin good faith.\u201d The company also is scrutinizing individuals and organizations. The day after the presidential election, for example, the company hand-delivered a subpoena to Carroll Muffett, the head of the Center for International Environmental Law, a nonprofit organization focused on environmental and human rights issues. \u201cThe subpoena is in fact a fishing expedition that goes far beyond any issue arguably before the Texas court,\u201d Muffett said in an email. \u201cIt is clear that Exxon is trying to leverage this case, outrageous as it is, to intimidate and silence its critics.\u201d Engineering quotient Another important piece of Tillerson\u2019s background is his engineering background. ExxonMobil has been widely seen as a place with a higher \u201cEQ,\u201d for engineering quotient, than IQ, or intelligence quotient. Even the EQ has failed from time to time. The Exxon Valdez oil-tanker accident spilled crude off the pristine coast of Alaska in 1989, and more recently company pipelines leaked in Montana\u2019s Yellowstone River and in Mayflower, Ark. The company has taken tough legal strategies in those instances, too, and it litigated the Valdez spill for 20 years. Still, Tillerson draws on that engineering construct and has applied it to the problem of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s an engineering problem, and it has engineering solutions,\u201d he said at an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2012. As he looked back on his career during the Texas Tech event, Tillerson said that he views the company\u2019s oil and gas operation on Sakhalin Island \u2014 an area beset by poverty, seismic instability, long icebound winters and 100-foot waves in the summer \u2014 as one of his crowning achievements. It might look easy compared to being secretary of state. business ",

    "text": "How a Single Senate Republican Could Tank Rex Tillerson's Nomination By ALI ROGIN Dec 13, 2016, 12:51 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Faces Criticism for Secretary of State Pick 0 Shares Email Marco Rubio is not the only Republican senator to express concerns about President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , over his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin . But Rubio is the only skeptical Republican, so far, who has the power to derail Tillerson\u2019s nomination before it reaches the Senate floor. The Florida senator sits on the upper chamber\u2019s 19-member Foreign Relations Committee , before which Tillerson\u2019s nomination hearing will take place. If all nine Democrats on the panel vote against Tillerson, they would need only one of the committee\u2019s 10 Republicans to join them to prevent the ExxonMobil CEO\u2019s nomination from moving to the full Senate for a vote. In a statement released this morning, Rubio said he had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Tillerson but was committed to giving him a fair hearing. \u201cThe next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America's interests and will be a forceful advocate for America's foreign policy goals,\u201d Rubio said. He was referring to the deals Tillerson\u2019s multinational oil and gas corporation has made with the Russian government, which helped him earn Russia\u2019s 2013 Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors a foreigner can receive there. As Tillerson\u2019s selection seemed increasingly likely this weekend, Rubio tweeted a more pointed reaction: Being a \"friend of Vladimir\" is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState - MR \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 11, 2016 Rubio is not the only Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee whose concerns about Tillerson\u2019s Russia connections might push him to vote no. Members like Jeff Flake of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky could also oppose him, which, in procedural terms, would mean the committee would decline to recommend Tillerson to the full Senate. But Rubio is the only one so far to voice his concerns. A source close to Paul said he was undecided on Tillerson and wants to hear more from him. Paul had publicly said he would adamantly oppose former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton, who is now the likely pick for deputy secretary of state in Trump's administration, sources told ABC News. That former Secretaries of State James Baker and Condoleezza Rice and former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates endorsed Tillerson \u201ccarries considerable weight\u201d Flake said. Baker\u2019s law firm, Baker Botts, represents ExxonMobil, and Rice\u2019s and Gates\u2019 consulting firm, RiceHadleyGates, counts the oil company as a client. 0 Shares ",

However, police say the son is \u201cmisinformed.\u201d The officer was answering a report of a man brandishing a handgun around 12:30 a.m. in Bakersfield, Calif. When a witness pointed to Francisco Serna, who was standing in a neighbor\u2019s driveway, one officer fired and killed him, Bakersfield police spokesman Sgt. Gary Carruesco\u00a0 told CBS Bakersfield affiliate KBAK-TV. No gun was turned up in a search of the scene, Carruesco said. \u201cRight across the street is where the police shot my father with nine bullets to his body,\u201d a man the Los Angeles Times identifies as Rogelio Serna says in the video. \u201cMy dad was not armed.\u201d Carruesco said in an email to CBS News\u2019 Crimesider he can\u2019t yet say how many times Francisco Serna was struck or how many rounds the officer fired, but said his son is \u201cmisinformed.\u201d A coroner was expected to complete an autopsy to determine a cause and manner of death. Carruesco was awaiting interviews with officers to be completed before releasing more information to the media. Rogelio Serna told the paper his father had been suffering from delusions and other early signs of dementia that had appeared to be getting worse in the past month. His father often took late-night walks alone to tire himself out, he said. Serna\u2019s son said his father had worked at a cotton gin in California\u2019s Central Valley until retiring about a dozen years ago. \u201cMy dad did not own a gun. He was a 73-year-old retired grandpa, just living life,\u201d Rogelio Serna told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cHe should have been surrounded by family at old age, not surrounded by bullets.\u201d Family told KBAK-TV that Serna lived with his wife and one of their daughters. \u00a0 Police had visited the house twice before because his confused father activated a medical alarm, Rogelio Serna said. Officials told KBAK-TV that the officer who shot Serna is on administrative leave. Their name has not been made public at this time. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Babson College students Edward Tomasso and Parker Rand-Ricciardi were accused of driving around the nearby all-women\u2019s Wellesley College the day after the election with a Trump flag on their car and saying \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\u00a0 Social media reports indicated the students shouted racial and homophobic slurs near the Harambee House, the center for African-American students.\u00a0 But Jeffrey Robbins, Rand-Ricciardi\u2019s attorney, told The Boston Globe that the Babson College investigation could not back up those allegations or prove they had purposely stopped at the Harambee House. Robbins is threatening a defamation suit against the school.\u00a0 The Boston Herald reported that Babson told the students Sunday the ban had been lifted. Robbins is calling on Babson to retract its statements questioning the duo.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story I cheered for Greg Baxtrom, a product of several famous tasting-menu kitchens, when he brought a similar level of creativity to Olmsted, an affordable neighborhood spot in Brooklyn. And I smiled every time I spotted a bottle of wine for under $55 at Le Coucou, a reformed and refined homage to the fancy old-school French restaurants that have mostly vanished from New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Month after month, I was surprised by the good, resourceful kitchens I found squirreled away in spaces that barely qualified as restaurants: wine bars and bar bars and a nostalgic lunch counter called Mr. Donahue\u2019s, where $20 buys a full dinner of American food my grandmother would have recognized. The cost of running a restaurant is notoriously punishing. Often the pain is passed on to us, but sometimes it inspires chefs to think a little harder. This year, those are the restaurants I want to tell you about. They are presented here roughly in the order of the intensity of my desire to go back again, which diverges here and there from the number of stars that flew above their reviews. 1. Le Coucou The genius of this project from the chef Daniel Rose and the restaurateur Stephen Starr is that it gives us almost everything we loved about New York\u2019s old-line French restaurants without the things we didn\u2019t. The dining room isn\u2019t stuffy, the service isn\u2019t snooty, and people don\u2019t get seated in Siberia if their pronunciation of boeuf bourguignon doesn\u2019t have the right backhand spin. (As far as I can tell, Le Coucou doesn\u2019t have a Siberia.) The wine list covers the historic old appellations of France, but it also embraces emerging ones and exciting regions from other countries while pricing bottles in a range that\u2019s unusually democratic. Meanwhile, Mr. Rose knocks the dust off some archetypal premodern French dishes. Sole V\u00e9ronique gets its peeled grapes and its butter-girded sauce along with a sense of conviction that\u2019s can\u2019t be faked. The fleecy quenelles of pike, half-submerged in a lava flow of sauce Am\u00e9ricaine, have a finer flavor than the ones at La Grenouille , which some people still think of as the city\u2019s standard-bearer. Mr. Rose isn\u2019t simply hauling out museum pieces, though. He\u2019s making them fresh again, and relevant. \u2605\u2605\u2605; 138 Lafayette Street; SoHo 212-271-4252; lecoucou.com . 2. Lilia Look around the concrete-floor dining room, glance at the one-page menu, and you could be at any number of casual Italian restaurants. Start eating, though, and you realize Lilia has something else going on. That something is Missy Robbins, the chef and owner. She\u2019s a sleight-of-hand cook. You don\u2019t see her tricks coming, but you taste them and wonder how she did it. Like Jonathan Waxman at Barbuto , she relaxes the tight grip of Italian cuisine without changing it in ways that are cheap or tortured. It would be easy enough for her to tidy up her seafood appetizers, her main courses of fish and meat grilled on an open fire, and her pastas, which I can never eat without smiling, and serve them in a dressier dining room. It would be hard, though, to make them taste better. \u2605\u2605\u2605; 567 Union Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-576-3095; lilianewyork.com . Video Top New York Restaurants of 2016 Visit the kitchens and dining rooms of New York's best restaurants of the year. By SAMANTHA QUICK, HILARY SWIFT and MAUREEN TOWEY on Publish Date December 13, 2016. Photo by Tony Cenicola/The New York Times. Technology by Samsung. . Watch in Times Video \u00bb 3. Mr. Donahue\u2019s This tiny retro lunch counter has the attentiveness to atmosphere of a period movie. The lighting has a diffuse, analog softness. The music sounds like a Jonathan Schwartz radio broadcast with the soliloquies about Sinatra edited out. The most remarkable bid for nostalgia is the food proffer: an old-fashioned main course like roast beef or a nearly filler-free meatloaf of dry-aged beef, with a good sauce and a choice of two carefully considered sides for $19.99. The counter stools and handful of table seats aren\u2019t as hard to come by as you\u2019d expect, possibly because Mr. Donahue\u2019s isn\u2019t particularly celebratory. It has a contemplative, almost wistful mood. If that happens to be your mood, too, I can\u2019t think of a more congenial place to eat well downtown. \u2605\u2605; 203 Mott Street, NoLIta; 646-850-9480; mrdonahues.com . 4. Le Coq Rico The Alsatian chef Antoine Westermann has built a poultry-focused bistro that\u2019s more compelling and carnally satisfying than any modern steakhouse. His star dish is rotisserie chicken, and his secret is buying old breeds raised by farmers who let them feed and mature longer than usual. The meat has a depth of flavor you rarely encounter. Other birds, like duck and squab, play minor but memorable roles on the menu. The dedication to poultry continues with eggs and livers; the foie gras is very fine, as you\u2019d expect, but a more telling sign of how much care goes into the ingredients is the plate of gorgeous, creamy chicken livers. The prices can make your eyes pop, but so can the portions. And while Mr. Westermann spends half his time in France, he hasn\u2019t hit autopilot on Le Coq Rico. He was in the house one recent night, and new breeds of chicken have strutted onto the menu since my review. \u2605\u2605; 30 East 20th Street, Flatiron district; 212-267-7426; lecoqriconyc.com . 5. Agern The ambitious Nordic invasion of Grand Central Terminal by the Danish entrepreneur Claus Meyer has many facets, including a food hall and a Danish hot dog stall , but Agern is the one that has food worth missing a train for. The chef of this comfortably formal restaurant is Gunnar Gislason, importing the philosophy of cooking with underappreciated ingredients from nearby that he follows at Dill in Reykjavik, Iceland. The beet baked in ashes and salt that is carved at tableside , like a steamship round, may not be as exciting as its ceremony, but like much of the cooking, its flavors are honest and appealing. You can order \u00e0 la carte or amble through the \u201cfield and forest\u201d tasting menu ($140) or a nonvegetarian excursion ($165). Both prices include service and a round and tangy loaf of house-made sourdough with a memorably crackling crust. \u2605\u2605\u2605; Grand Central Terminal, 89 East 42nd Street, Midtown East; 646-568-4018; agernrestaurant.com . 6. Aska \u201cOh, not a New Nordic tasting menu,\u201d I hear you say. \u201cWe had a New Nordic tasting menu last night!\u201d Well, this one has reindeer lichen and the cinders of burned lambs\u2019 hearts \u2014 you didn\u2019t have that last night, did you? It also has a chef, Fredrik Berselius, who has become very adept at broadening and intensifying the flavors of his ingredients. Some of these are imported, like wild wood pigeon from Scotland. Others are grown or foraged nearby. Mr. Berselius is not dogmatic. He does have his share of strange ideas, but even the odd stuff pays off when you eat it. Upstairs in the selectively lighted dining room, the Unabridged Berselius is a 19-course tasting menu for $215, and the abridged, 10-course version is $145. (All prices include service.) Down in the basement is a casual lounge with small plates, none costing more than $16, although you won\u2019t find any blackened hearts down there. \u2605\u2605\u2605; 47 South Fifth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 929-337-6792; askanyc.com . Advertisement 7. Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu\u2019s Kitchen Forget about the name. Tea is never mentioned by the servers (though it should be, because it\u2019s good), and noodles may not always be the best thing on the table. It doesn\u2019t matter. There is skillful, contemporary Chinese food all over the menu, and color photographs to let you now what you\u2019re in for. Most of the dishes are drawn from either Beijing, Shanghai or Chongqing. Peppers are not quite everywhere, but they are strongly represented in many dishes. So many fresh green chiles lurk in Madam Zhu\u2019s Spicy Fish Stew that eating it is a contact sport. There is some shading to the cooking, too. I counted three distinct frying styles, and clearly need to return to finish the survey. \u2605\u2605; 401 Avenue of the Americas, West Village; 212-633-8900; madamzhu.com . 8. G\u00fcnter Seeger NY Two of my meals were stunningly good and pure. A third had a few too many ordinary moments, which kept me from writing a full-blown rave for a restaurant where the only option at the time was a 10-course dinner for $148. Since then, a four-course, $98 menu has been added. If you can swallow either price, then I say: Go. Mr. Seeger, who earned national praise when he was in Atlanta, has a formidable command of classical European techniques, but he keeps his skills in the service of simplicity. Changing the menu every day, he almost seems to undress his ingredients, revealing the beauty of what\u2019s under the surface. It\u2019s high-risk cooking, and watching him pull it off can be thrilling. \u2605\u2605; 641 Hudson Street, West Village; 646-657-0045; gunterseegerny.com . 9. Olmsted One problem with the rise of expensive tasting menus is that a lot of culinary intelligence and imagination is locked up inside restaurants that are hard for most people to afford more than once a year, if that. Olmsted\u2019s chef, Greg Baxtrom, worked at some of those places, but he makes his own smart, inventive food inside a Brooklyn spot where I could imagine eating once a week. The carrot crepe with littleneck clams, an immediate Instagram star, is both a novelty and a fine way to start dinner. Prices are kept in line in part through affordable ingredients like guinea hen, roasted and confitted in a memorable main course. There\u2019s an inviting garden where you can have drinks and elevated bar snacks while inspecting the backyard agriculture. Homegrown kale greens up Olmsted\u2019s take on crab Rangoon, while eggs are supplied, one at a time, by a resident pair of quail. As of Sunday, they\u2019ve weathered their first winter snow. \u2605\u2605; 659 Vanderbilt Avenue, Prospect Heights 718-552-2610; olmstednyc.com . 10. Llama Inn As far as I\u2019m concerned, there ought to be two Peruvian restaurants in every New York neighborhood. One would serve rotisserie chicken, and the other would present more adventurous pieces of that country\u2019s kaleidoscopic cuisine, as Erik Ramirez does at Llama Inn. Mr. Ramirez makes an excellent ceviche and a tiradito whose marinade looks on the plate like lightly reduced Tang and tastes spicy, fruity and quietly thrilling. He also makes the only quinoa salad I\u2019ve ever looked at without feeling pity, either for the salad or for myself. \u2605\u2605; 50 Withers Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-387-3434; llamainnnyc.com .

The unexpected sighting of the \"Gold Digger\" singer at the gold-plated Fifth Avenue home of President-elect Donald Trump was caught on camera, a day after \"Us Weekly\" reported West was seen in various places around New York City, including the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, in one of his first appearances since his illness. West's visit came on the same day Trump announced he would nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, and a day after Trump canceled a long-awaited press conference \u2014 the first in months \u2014 aimed at discussing the president-elect's business conflicts of interest . Donald Trump meets with Kanye West at Trump Tower in New York. NBC News After posing for pictures with West, Trump ignored reporters' questions about the canceled business conflicts of interest press conference and about Tillerson being tapped to head the State Department. Meanwhile, the president-elect's team met with members of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump on Tuesday. Also seen in the Trump Tower lobby was Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon and Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer.

West refused to answer a question from NBC News about whether he still wants to run for president in 2020, something he has mentioned in the past, but told reporters as he stood next to Trump, \"I just want to take a picture right now.\" The two stood side by side \u2014 Trump in a suit and West in a black sweatshirt \u2014 as cameras clicked. \"He's a good man,\" Trump said. \"We've been friends for a long time.\" Last month, West was booed at a concert after he told the crowd that he didn't vote for anyone in the election, but if he had, it would have been Trump. West later tweeted that he wanted to discuss a range of \"multicultural issues\" with Trump. \"These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago,\" he wrote. \"I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.\" I wanted to meet with Trump today to discuss multicultural issues. \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) December 13, 2016 These issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago. \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) December 13, 2016 I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change. \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) December 13, 2016 He also made an apparent change to his earlier vow to run for president in 2020, when Trump will be up for re-election.

Kardashian has rarely been seen in public herself after she was allegedly held at gunpoint and robbed of $10 million in jewels in Paris. West, 39, was hospitalized on Nov. 21, reportedly for exhaustion. The singer is not easy to politically pigeonhole, and he has managed to publicly feud with the two presidents preceding Trump.

Zinke, ex-SEAL, as Interior secretary Published               December 13, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump intends to pick Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke as secretary of the Interior, multiple sources confirmed Tuesday evening to Fox News. Zinke is a first-term House member and a former Navy SEAL commander. \u00a0 Neither the Trump transition team nor Zinke has made a public statement. But Zinke reportedly has accepted the offer. He was purportedly in the running with Washington Rep. Kathy McMorris Rogers, who met at least twice with Trump, a fellow Republican, in recent days. McMorris Rogers has made no official statement either. But she posted a message late Tuesday on her Facebook page that suggested she will remain on Capitol Hill as part of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s leadership team. \u201cIt was an honor to be invited to spend time with the President-elect, and I\u2019m energized more than ever to continue leading in Congress as we think big, reimagine this government, and put people back at the center of it,\u201d McMorris Rogers wrote. Zinke was an early Trump supporter and serves on the House\u2019s Natural Resources Committee. He met Monday with Trump in New York. Fox News\u2019 John Roberts contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has long promised to legalize recreational pot use and sales. If passed, Canada would be the largest developed country to end prohibition of recreational marijuana . Voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted Nov. 8 to approve the use of recreational marijuana , joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, where it had previously been legalized. Big Pot: The commercial takeover The marijuana task force report, headed by former Canadian Liberal Health Minister Anne McLellan, recommended that adults could carry up to 30 grams for recreational purpose and grow up to four plants. It also recommended that that higher-potency pot be taxed at a higher rate than weaker strains. It also said recreational marijuana should not be sold in the same location as alcohol or tobacco. Under the proposals, alcohol-free cannabis lounges would be allowed. Trudeau said they plan to control and regulate the sale so they keep it out of the hands of kids and are able to remove a significant source of revenue for criminal organizations and street gangs. \u201cUntil we change the law the law stands,\u201d Trudeau said. McLellan said they travelled to Colorado and Washington and spoke to government officials in Uruguay to hear directly from those who have enacted policies to legalize pot. \u201cWe are only the second nation to move forward in this way,\u201d McLellan said, urging the Canadian government to use caution. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next U.S. attorney general has raised fears that the new administration could crack down on weed-tolerant states 20 years after California became the first to legalize medical marijuana. Colorado now allows adults 21 and over to have up to an ounce of marijuana, without needing a doctor\u2019s recommendation for the drug. Colorado allows adults to grow up to six plants at home. And Denver has approved a first-in-the-U.S. law allowing people to use marijuana at bars, restaurants and other public spaces. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Clay County Development director Pamela Ramsey Taylor made the post following Republican Donald Trump's election to president, saying: \"It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House . I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\" The Charleston-Gazette reports (http://bit.ly/2hseKc4) a letter from the agency's acting director Leslie McGlothin to the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services says Taylor is on suspension and scheduled to return to work Dec. 23. The nonprofit provides services to elderly and low-income residents in Clay County. It is funded through state and federal grants and local fees. Clay Mayor Beverly Whaling also came under criticism after responding to the post: \"Just made my day Pam.\" Whaling said in a statement sent to news media that she was referencing the change in the White House and said she wasn't racist. But Whaling later resigned following a backlash about the comment. The Clay Town Council accepted Whaling's resignation in a meeting in November. Council member Jason Hubbard issued a brief statement condemning the \"horrible and indecent\" post and said racism and intolerance \"isn't what this community is about.\" He apologized on behalf of the town to Michelle Obama and anyone who was offended. \"This community is a helpful, hopeful, empathetic and God-loving community,\" Hubbard said. \"Please don't judge the entire community for one or two individual acts.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: The Charleston Gazette-Mail, http://wvgazettemail.com. 0 Shares ",

Video provided by AFP Newslook Despite reports that Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., was Donald Trump\u2019s frontrunner\u00a0for the Secretary of the Interior last week, Politico and The Washington Post are reporting that the president-elect has offered the spot to Montana\u2019s Ryan Zinke. Zinke is a former Navy SEAL and a freshman representative. He sits on House Natural Resources Committee and the Armed Services Committee. This summer Zinke resigned as a delegate at the Republican National Convention over his party\u2019s position on federally controlled lands. At the time Zinke called the Republican platform \u201cmore divisive than uniting.\u201d\u00a0The GOP platform called for shifting some of the land controlled by the government over the states, which Zinke opposed. While he was not a delegate, Zinke did give a speech at the convention. McMorris Rodgers posted on her Facebook Tuesday saying that she planned to stay in Congress. A spokesman for Trump\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hL3BiL Most Popular ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Most are immigrants and an unknown share are undocumented, researchers say. While anti-vending laws are seldom imposed, violations can result in misdemeanor charges. City Council members have said decriminalizing the work has become a pressing matter given the statements from Mr. Trump, who has vowed to deport unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. A new proposal would create a permit system for the vendors, regulate where they can set up their carts and require them to abide by health codes long enforced at their brick-and-mortar counterparts. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The plan was advanced by a City Council committee on Monday. It is set to go before the full Council early next year. Parts of the proposal have pleased business owners who have traditionally been wary about what legalized sidewalk vending would mean for them. Notably, it calls for a limit of two vendors per block. But some are also skeptical such a rule would be enforced. Norm Langer, the owner of Langer\u2019s Delicatessen in the Westlake neighborhood, said he had complained to the city repeatedly about a rambling colony of illegal vendors outside his restaurant. The police responded, he said, \u201cNever, never, never.\u201d \u201cAll of this is fine and good if you\u2019ve got enforcement,\u201d he added. \u201cI have no confidence that will happen.\u201d Both sides in the debate acknowledge that the system now is broken. Mr. Vallianatos said the moment appeared ripe to fix it. He cited the political power of the city\u2019s rising Latino population, a growing embrace of urban walkable spaces, and, of course, Mr. Trump. \u201cTo me it\u2019s kind of embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Vallianatos said. \u201cTo have us be the standout in the country with no possibility for legal vending is a betrayal.\u201d California Online \u2022 A wide-ranging federal water bill is being seen as a big win for California\u2019s farmers.

To start things off, Carl Larson, an amateur photographer in Los Angeles, shared this image of a burst of color over the city\u2019s skyline.

Mr. Larson said he hiked a trail behind Griffith Observatory, the domed structure to the left, to take pictures of the sunset on Nov. 7. \u201cIt was a little smoggy out and low-lying clouds and the sky just absolutely lit up,\u201d he said.

Conair, the maker of the Cuisinart food processors, received 69 reports of consumers finding broken pieces of a \"riveted blade\" in their processed food, including 30 reports of mouth lacerations or tooth injuries, a CPSC press release said Tuesday. \"These are in millions of American homes, including my own,\" CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye told ABC News, stressing to consumers how dangerous the product can be. \"You find out that there's a problem when you bite down and you cut your mouth and you break your teeth,\" Kaye added. \"With all the cooking that's going on this holiday season, we're really urging consumers to act immediately.\" The blades in question have four rivets, are silver-colored stainless steel and have a beige plastic center hub. The CPSC and Cuisinart note that only food processors with four rivets in the blades are included in this recall. The recall affects 22 models made in China that were sold from July 1996 to December 2015, at suggested retail prices of $100 to $350. The CPSC encouraged anyone who may have purchased one of these models to check the model number, which can be found on the bottom of the food processor. Affected model numbers begin with the following: CFP-9, CFP-11, DFP-7, DFP-11, DFP-14, DLC-5, DLC-7, DLC-8, DLC-10, DLC-XP, DLC-2007, DLC-2009, DLC-2011, DLC-2014, DLC-3011, DLC-3014, EV-7, EV-10, EV-11, EV-14, KFP-7 and MP-14. Any consumer with the affected blade should immediately stop using the food processor and contact Cuisinart for a free replacement blade.

Analysis of Trump's selection has drawn scrutiny to Tillerson's Russian business ties and possible impacts on the top U.S. diplomatic post. (Dec. 13) AP In a file photo taken Oct. 7, 2015, ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson speaks at a conference in London. (Photo: Ben Stansall, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s choice of\u00a0ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson to be secretary of State is the first of his picks to draw sharp questions from Republicans in the Senate, a sign that his nomination may face the highest hurdles in the confirmation process. But Tillerson may not be the only one facing a tough road to Trump\u2019s Cabinet. The incoming administration can only afford to lose the support of two Republican senators for any confirmation vote, provided no Democrats cross the aisle, which appears unlikely. And Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0already have expressed reservations about Tillerson, in particular about his ties with Russia, the nation intelligence officials\u00a0suspect of hacking and trying to influence the presidential election. \u201cBased upon his extensive business dealings with the Putin government and his previous opposition of efforts to impose sanctions on the Russian government, there are many questions which must be answered,\u201d Graham said Tuesday. \u201cI expect the U.S.-Russian relationship to be front and center in his confirmation process.\u201d Trump, in a sign he won\u2019t shy away from a confirmation battle, held up Tillerson\u2019s experience with Russia as an asset in his selection announcement. The statement lists\u00a0his positions at Exxon since Tillerson began working there in 1975 and notes\u00a0specifically his responsibilities overseeing holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea. Trump announced his pick Tuesday morning. He had been mulling other candidates for weeks for the secretary of State post, including Mitt Romney and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. \u201cRex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none,\u201d Trump said. Who is Rex Tillerson, Trump's secretary of State pick? Tillerson may not be the only Trump Cabinet pick\u00a0facing a challenging road ahead. Winning Senate confirmation is a multi-step process that includes much more than the actual hearings and votes. Each intended nominee must submit lengthy financial documentation, and the FBI does extensive background checks. Max Stier, head of the Partnership for Public Service, a\u00a0nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the federal government, said the wealth of the individuals Trump has picked\u00a0could complicate matters even further. Among them are billionaires Wilbur Ross, a private equity executive\u00a0whom Trump picked to lead the Commerce Department; Betsy DeVos, a philanthropist Trump chose for Education secretary; and Linda McMahon, co-founder of the WWE, whom Trump intends to nominate as head of the Small Business Administration. Tillerson is also at least a multimillionaire. \u201cThis is a place where the Trump team could get themselves into big trouble,\u201d Stier said. \u201cTypically, a\u00a0transition team will do a lot of vetting of candidates prior to announcing them and it\u2019s unclear how much of that is occurring here.\u201d Who has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far? Every president since 1989 has lost at least one Cabinet nominee during the confirmation process. Most withdrew amid criticism; one was voted down outright. A look back at what derailed their nominations provides a glimpse at the types of issues that can come up in the vetting process \u2014\u00a0and that can sink nominees. Here are the seven failed nominees since 1989, according to Senate records: John G. Tower \u2022 Nominated by: President George H. W. Bush on Jan. 20, 1989 \u2022\u00a0Position: Defense \u2022\u00a0Rejected: March 9, 1989 by a vote of 47-53 Tower, who had previously represented Texas in the Senate for 24 years, was the first Cabinet pick rejected by the Senate since 1959. Tower\u2019s nomination failed amid allegations of womanizing and heavy drinking. In this February 1989 file photo, President George H.W.

    "text": "Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson speaks to reporters after the annual Exxon Mobil shareholders meeting in 2014. LM Otero/AP hide caption toggle caption LM Otero/AP Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson speaks to reporters after the annual Exxon Mobil shareholders meeting in 2014. LM Otero/AP Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Trump's nominee for secretary of state, will have his Senate confirmation hearing in January. Before then, experts say, he'll have to think hard about how to divest from a company where he has spent his entire career. Tillerson reportedly owns 2.6 million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, which would be worth about $240 million, as of the Wall Street close on Tuesday. When John Kerry became secretary of state nearly four years ago, he and his wife, Teresa Heinz, divested from a long list of companies to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. For the same reason, George Shultz \u2014 an executive at Bechtel before serving as Ronald Reagan's top diplomat \u2014 set up a blind trust, says Davis Robinson, the State Department's legal adviser at the time. But, Robinson says, \"his was not as complicated as Mr. Tillerson, because Mr. Tillerson owns so much of Exxon Mobil stock.\" Blind trusts and divestment are two of the most common options to meet the requirements of federal ethics laws. And tax breaks allow wealthy appointees to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell off assets so they can serve in government. Article continues after sponsorship Paul Light , the Paulette Goddard Professor of Public Service at New York University, says divestment is the most effective cure to conflict of interest concerns. \"If you are to reassure the public that your negotiations with foreign governments have no tie to your financial interests, you divest,\" he says. For Tillerson, that may not be enough. Even if he divests from Exxon Mobil stock, he will face tough questions on Capitol Hill about his past dealings, especially in Russia. Tillerson opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea, that slowed a joint project between Exxon Mobil and Russian energy giant Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. \"It troubles me greatly that Mr. Tillerson would have reason to advocate for the rolling back of sanctions because that would be the best interests of his company,\" says Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"And it is my hope that he's enough of a patriot to separate his decades-long affiliation with this major oil company and the genuine interest of the American people.\" Russia isn't the only place of concern, Coons says. \"I suspect we will be having discussions about a number of different countries where he negotiated relationships or deals with dictators or authoritarian regimes that worked for Exxon Mobil, but will not work for America's interests,\" he says. Edward Verona, a former Exxon Mobil colleague of Tillerson's in Russia, now with McLarty Associates in Washington, D.C., believes the oil executive will be able to make the switch to the State Department. \"I don't believe that he would, certainly not consciously, do anything that would contravene the interests of the United States for the potential benefit of his former company. That's just my sense of him,\" he says. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, says he will chair a confirmation hearing for Tillerson in early January. But before the nominee meets with any senators, he'll need to answer the committee's questionnaire about whether and how he will sever his business relationships with Exxon Mobil. ",

Related: El Faro Owner Settles With Families of Sunken Ship's Crew Members Back on the ship, Davidson left the bridge around 8 p.m. to get some rest, telling his crew to monitor the weather. As the night progressed, some crew questioned why Davidson didn't take a safer, longer route to San Juan \u2014 the same route it took during Tropical Storm Erika a month earlier. \"Guess I'm just turnin' into a Chicken Little, but I have a feeling like something bad is gonna happen,\" third mate Jeremie Riehm said while on watch at about 10:40 p.m. As the clock ticked past midnight, the crew steering the ship started discussing their survival suits and whether their emergency beacons were working. The El Faro had dipped south a bit to try and skirt the storm, but \"every time we come further south the storm keeps trying to follow us,\" Randolph said, telling a colleague with a laugh that \"all the other ships high-tailed it away.\" Then, a news alert came over the radio: Joaquin had grown into a major Category 3 storm. \"Oh my God,\" she said. Three minutes later, at 1:15 a.m., the ship rolled hard from a big wave. At 2:47 a.m., the ship continued getting battered by large waves. The second mate called Davidson in his state room; it took him a few rings to pick up. He appeared on the bridge at 4:09 a.m., according to the transcripts. He immediately set out to calm nerves. \"Well, this is every day in Alaska,\" he told chief mate Steven Shultz and another able seaman. About a half-hour later, Shultz said the engineer called because the ship was tilting and oil levels were problematic. A crew member said El Faro had never listed like that, but Davidson replied things would get better. They didn't. At 5:43 a.m., one of the ship's cargo holds began flooding. Davidson sent Shultz to pump it out. He also tried turning the ship to get the wind to help stabilize things. A half-hour later, the ship lost propulsion. Davidson called Tote to report the situation as water continued pouring into the hold. The stern of the sunken ship El Faro. The NTSB announced that the data recorder was located northeast of Acklins and Crooked Islands, Bahamas. El Faro, a 790-foot freighter, sank last October after getting caught in Hurricane Joaquin. The data recorder is capable of recording conversations and sounds on the El Faro's bridge, which may help investigators better understand the final moments of the ship's final journey. National Transportation Safety Board / via AP At 7:24, Davidson says: \"We're definitely not in good shape right now.\" Five minutes later, the high frequency ringing of the abandon ship alarm is heard. The captain, Randolph and another crew member discuss grabbing their life vests. But within moments, the captain says: \"Bow is down.\" Davidson tells everyone to get off the ship, but a seaman is paralyzed by fear and says to Davidson: \"Help me. Help me.\" \"Don't panic,\" Davidson says. \"Work your way up here.\" \"I'm a goner,\" the seaman says. \"No you're not,\" Davidson replies. Moments later, at 7:39 a.m., only yelling is heard before the recording stops. Follow Jason Dearen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen The Associated Press ",

(Michael Tercha/Chicago Tribune) How does nitrous oxide (N2O) make whipped cream? Find out! (Michael Tercha/Chicago Tribune) Greg Trotter Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Just in time for the holidays, an industrywide shortage of canned whipped topping, such as Reddi-wip, appears to be looming after a fatal explosion at a Florida nitrous oxide plant in late August stunted the supply chain. Conagra Brands, the Chicago-based food manufacturer that makes Reddi-wip, confirmed Monday that its supply of nitrous oxide \u2014 a propellant for aerosol toppings \u2014 was affected by the blast. Spokeswoman Lanie Friedman said stores still have the product in stock, but supplies may be limited in the peak holiday season, when consumers are indulging in pies, hot chocolate and other desserts that call for whipped cream. \"It's in stores now, but we're encouraging people to buy it early,\" Friedman said. \"There will be a shortage if people buy at the typical levels during the holidays.\" Whipped cream purists would suggest simply making your own, but the canned aerosol products, introduced in the 1940s, still do a brisk business in the U.S. Reddi-wip is the leading aerosol whipped topping, according to sales data from IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. In the 12-month period ending Nov. 27, sales exceeded $278 million, which represented an increase of almost 9 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the IRI retail sales figures, which do not include Costco. Friedman stressed the shortage isn't Conagra's problem alone, but extends to all food products that use nitrous oxide. That would include the spray-can versions of Cool Whip, made by Kraft Heinz, which is headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen declined to comment. Whipped cream hack gets job done in half the time The nation-wide shortage of canned whipped cream may have home cooks panicked. But there's no shortage if you whip the cream yourself. C'mon! It's easy. And, with our kitchen hack, you can cut the whipping time in half. All you need is some dry ice. (Roger Morales/Chicago Tribune) The nation-wide shortage of canned whipped cream may have home cooks panicked. But there's no shortage if you whip the cream yourself. C'mon! It's easy. And, with our kitchen hack, you can cut the whipping time in half. All you need is some dry ice. (Roger Morales/Chicago Tribune) See more videos The explosion at the Airgas-owned Nitrous Oxide Corp. facility in Cantonment, Fla., had far more dire consequences than a whipped cream shortage. One Airgas employee was killed in the blast. A company investigation into the cause of the accident is still ongoing, Airgas spokeswoman Sarah Boxler said in an email. The plant's operations were affected \"indefinitely\" and the company's supply of nitrous oxide \u2014 also used for medical purposes \u2014 was temporarily limited, Boxler said. As Airgas has built its supply back up, the priority has been on meeting the needs of its medical customers, not food manufacturers. \"Airgas Nitrous Oxide is making all possible efforts to remedy the situation as quickly as possible and impacted customers have been notified directly,\" Boxler said. One of Conagra's co-manufacturers is an Airgas customer, hence the impact on Reddi-wip. Friedman declined to disclose the name of the co-manufacturer, citing company policy. ",

John Kasich signed a 20-week abortion ban into law Tuesday, the same day he vetoed legislation outlawing abortions once a fetus's heartbeat is detectable.

John Kasich signed a 20-week abortion ban into law Tuesday, the same day he vetoed legislation outlawing abortions once a fetus's heartbeat is detectable. Above, Kasich in Washington, D.C., last month. Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed a 20-week gestation limit for abortions into law Tuesday, while separately vetoing a measure that would have banned abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable. The so-called heartbeat bill, which Kasich rejected, was considered more vulnerable to legal challenge. Provisions of the measure would have essentially limited the period during which women could get an abortion to about six weeks, when many women don't even realize they're pregnant, reports the Associated Press. Similar measures have faced legal challenges in other states, the news service goes on to say, a fact weighing heavily in Kasich's veto defense . Kasich, himself an abortion-rights opponent, noted bans in two other states had been declared unconstitutional. \"The State of Ohio will be the losing party in that lawsuit and, as the losing party, the State of Ohio will be forced to pay hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to cover the legal fees for the pro-choice activists' lawyers. Furthermore, such a defeat invites additional challenges to Ohio's strong legal protections for unborn life,\" the Republican governor said in a statement. Article continues after sponsorship Fifteen other states have 20-week bans, the AP says. Furthermore, unlike the so-called heartbeat ban, the 20-week ban had the support of the state's most prominent anti-abortion-rights group, who praised the governor for signing the legislation. \"The 20-week ban was nationally designed to be the vehicle to end abortion in America,\" said Ohio Right to Life in a statement. Abortion-rights supporters were quick to decry both bans. \"[Kasich] may hope that by vetoing a six-week ban \u2014 which would have virtually banned abortion with almost no exceptions \u2014 he comes off as moderate,\" said Dawn Laguens of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \"The 20-week ban will force women to travel long distances and cross state lines in order to access safe, legal abortion.\" Also on Tuesday, anti-abortion rules in Oklahoma underwent two drastically different fates Tuesday. The state's Supreme Court threw out a law requiring hospital admitting privileges for doctors working at clinics that perform abortions. The challenge to the law came on behalf of Dr. Larry Burns, who, the AP reports, performs nearly half of all abortions in the state. According to the news service, Burns had applied for admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, but was turned down. Another ruling, from the Oklahoma Board of Health, mandated signs in public restrooms in hospitals, nursing homes, schools and even restaurants directing pregnant woman to services that could reduce their likelihood of seeking an abortion, the AP reports: \"The provision mandating the signs was tucked into a measure the Legislature passed this year that requires the state to develop informational material 'for the purpose of achieving an abortion-free society.' \"The board passed the rules Tuesday. Businesses and other organizations estimate they will have to pay $2.3 million to put up the signs because the Legislature approved no funding for them. \"Board attorney Donald Maisch says the Legislature and governor must ratify the board's signage rules before they are scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2018.\" ",

Time_Sports Fans entering CenturyLink Field for a Seattle Seahawks game are screened by security. (Photo: Elaine Thompson, AP) Some people will do anything to get their names in the news. Even if comes at the expense of the public\u2019s safety. Three Washington legislators are pushing a bill that would force arenas and stadiums to allow fans to bring in weapons if they have concealed carry permits. Because adding guns to a highly charged atmosphere where alcohol already offsets common sense far too often seems like a great idea. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been trying to do is foster bipartisan support for common sense solutions to gun violence,\u201d said Laurie Jinkins, the Tacoma area representative who chairs the Washington House Judiciary Committee. \u201cThis seems to be the antithesis for that.\u201d NFL hot seat rankings: With Jeff Fisher gone, who could be next coach ousted? There was no public groundswell for this proposed legislation nor any event prompting it. Seattle\u2019s professional teams did not ask for it, and the major professional leagues have rules that specifically prohibit fans from bringing weapons into stadiums. I know, it\u2019s been a while since you read the fine print when you entered a stadium. But trust me, it\u2019s there. No, this is grandstanding, pure and simple. Representatives Bob McCaslin, Matt Shea and David Taylor saw an opportunity to pander to the gun lobby and stoke fear in those who see a Second Amendment-repealing Boogeyman around every corner these days, and they jumped on it. Current Washington law prevents possession of firearms at \u201cany stadium or convention center, operated by a city, town, county, or other municipality\u201d unless an individual has a concealed carry permit. But most stadiums are operated by public facilities districts or private entities, and thus, can make their own rules on weapons. The bill proposed by McCaslin, Shea and Taylor would expand the law so it specifically prohibits public facilities districts and public stadium authorities, or any private group that leases a stadium or arena from them, from banning pistols for those with concealed carry permits. None of the three responded to a request for comment Tuesday, probably because they know there\u2019s no good way to defend this. And spare me the argument that a gun would defuse a\u00a0situation or a potential criminal. These stadiums already have security in place screening fans to avoid weapons being smuggled in. Now we want to eliminate that? No one is trying to gut the Second Amendment. But Americans have generally agreed that there are some places where it\u2019s just not smart to have guns. Schools, for example, and public parks. Court rooms. Hospitals. USA TODAY Sports investigation: Holes in stadium security That stadiums and arenas should be part of that list is a no-brainer. There is a reason most stadiums have a drunk tank and a holding cell, and it\u2019s not because of an abundance of storage space. We tend to throw reason out the window when it comes to our favorite teams and players, and that happens a whole lot more quickly when alcohol is involved. Go to any game, and odds are you\u2019ll see at least one fan being escorted out by security if not a group of them. It\u2019s not uncommon for players to complain of being pelted by fans \u2014\u00a0by both physical objects and verbal abuse. And now these Washington legislators want to add guns to the equation. Fortunately, there seems to be little support for McCaslin, Shea and Taylor\u2019s proposal, an example of government overreach\u00a0if there ever was one.

    "text": "Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. Alex Wong/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump has selected Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to be his interior secretary, according to multiple news reports. NPR has not independently confirmed those reports. Zinke is a first-term congressman and a former Navy SEAL commander who served in Iraq and was awarded two Bronze Stars. He was re-elected to a second term last month with 56 percent of the vote. In the House, the Republican lawmaker serves on the Natural Resources Committee and has split with his party before to defend public access to federal lands. Zinke resigned his position this summer as a delegate to the Republican National Convention after the GOP platform supported transferring federal public lands to the states. \"What I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,\" Zinke told the Billings Gazette in July. \"At this point, I think it's better to show leadership.\" Zinke still spoke at the convention in Cleveland in support of Trump, whom he endorsed last May. However, Zinke is overall not praised by environmentalists. He has just a 3 percent voting record with the League of Conservation Voters and is a supporter of coal, oil and gas exploration. He also backs building the Keystone XL pipeline. Article continues after sponsorship The interior secretary is one of the most closely monitored \u2014 and controversial \u2014 Cabinet positions, especially in the American West. The department oversees the management of more than 500 million acres of federal public lands, including close to 400 national parks and federal monuments, not to mention numerous dams and reservoirs. \"I'm always reminded of that old joke that it doesn't matter who's elected president of the United States; it matters in the West when the secretary of interior is appointed,\" said Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota. \"That's the person who has the most direct say over our lives.\" Trahant, who is also a member of the Shoshone Bannock tribe in Idaho, predicted one of the top priorities of the next secretary under Trump will be to develop more oil and gas reserves, especially on tribal lands. Another equally controversial item on the department's agenda could be the federal government's overall role in management of all federal lands in the West. During the Obama administration, fringe Western lands groups on the far right \u2014 including rancher Cliven Bundy and his sons, who staged armed standoffs over cattle grazing in Nevada and Oregon \u2014 pushed for massive amounts of federal land to be turned over to the states and local counties. Zinke told Montana Public Radio recently that he is open to reforms in how the federal government manages lands, but he reiterated: \"I have always been a strong supporter of public lands, and have voted against the transfer or sale of public lands. My position is known and well-established.\" Zinke has a bachelor's degree in geology from the University of Oregon, where he played on the football team. If Zinke accepts the position and is confirmed by the Senate, it could be a setback for Republican hopes to knock off Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018. Tester is a top GOP target and Zinke was considered to be a strong challenger to the Democratic incumbent. Zinke confirmed a few weeks ago that he was considering a bid. In theory, Zinke could still serve but resign early to campaign back in Montana, and even use the position to boost his credentials against Tester. Still, for what's seen as one of the top opportunities for Republicans in two years, the lack of time to build a campaign and raise funds would be a setback. Trump had also considered House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., to lead the Interior Department, and many believed she was the likely pick, but a source close to the congresswoman said Tuesday those reports were driven by the transition team and that she did not receive an offer or a call from the president-elect this evening. In a Facebook post , McMorris Rodgers said it was an honor to meet with Trump last week but that she was looking forward to continuing in Congress, where she is the highest-ranking woman in GOP leadership.

NASA/JPL-Caltech hide caption toggle caption This is the Curiosity rover's robotic arm, which has gotten stuck, endangering its scientific mission. NASA/JPL-Caltech Ever since NASA's Curiosity rover landed on Mars in 2012, it's been slowly making its way along hills, dunes and mesas, collecting rock samples all along the way. But last week, as it started climbing up a gently sloping mountain, called Mount Sharp, it started acting weird . NASA engineers now say that the extendable arm that reaches out and drills into the Martian rock keeps getting jammed. Just as the drill tip hovers a few inches off the ground, the arm stops. \"We said 'go,' and it just didn't go,\" says Ashwin Vasavada , a project scientist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"You can't just go to Mars and take it apart,\" he says. So engineers have been running tests to narrow down the possibilities for what's causing the snag. They've ruled out electrical and software problems and now think it has something to do with a brake inside the motor that moves the drill. Article continues after sponsorship The rover took this photo of purplish rocks at the base of Mars' Mount Sharp on Nov. 10. NASA/JPL-Caltech hide caption toggle caption NASA/JPL-Caltech The rover took this photo of purplish rocks at the base of Mars' Mount Sharp on Nov. 10. NASA/JPL-Caltech Vasavada and his colleagues have managed to get the arm moving again a few times, but it keeps stalling. They need the 7-foot-long arm to reliably fold back into place for the rover to get anywhere in one piece. \"It would be dangerous to move it around,\" says Vasavada, because a heavy set of instruments sits at the end of the arm. Moving the rover with its appendage extended, he says, would be \"kind of like when you go over a speed bump and then everybody shakes.\" So until they can figure out what's going on, Curiosity will stay perched a little way up the mountain, snapping photos.

    "text": "<p>A new analysis of county-level data finds that what causes a person\u2019s death depends in large part on where they live.</p> Close istockphoto People along the southern stretch of the Mississippi River are more likely to die from heart problems than anywhere else in the United States. Suicide and homicide will claim the most lives in the southwestern part of the country. Deaths from chronic respiratory diseases are greatest in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia. And mental and substance abuse disorders cause the most deaths in Alaska, eastern Arizona, New Mexico, eastern Kentucky and southwestern West Virginia. Close Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington in Seattle What\u00a0 causes a person\u2019s death depends in large part on where they spend their lives, concludes a new county-level analysis of U.S. mortality data. Armed with this sort of information, county and city health departments can focus their efforts on the specific problems affecting their communities, said lead researcher Ali Mokdad. He is a professor with the department of global health at the University of Washington, in Seattle. \u201cYou can see what kind of disparities we have, and what are driving these disparities,\u201d Mokdad said. \u201cMany counties, especially rural counties, don\u2019t have the resources to tackle every health problem, and so they need to prioritize. In this way, we\u2019re telling them what to tackle first.\u201d For the study, researchers reviewed more than 80.4 million deaths recorded from 1980 through 2014 in the United States, analyzing mortality rates for 3,110 counties or groups of counties. The investigators found large disparities between counties for every cause of death, both within states and across the country as a whole. For example, the researchers found that people in the southeastern United States are burdened with risk factors like obesity and smoking that increase the risk of dying from heart disease and diabetes, Mokdad said. At the same time, people living in parts of New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and North and South Dakota tend to drink more alcohol, and are more likely to die from cirrhosis or other chronic liver diseases , the findings showed. On the other hand, people in northern and central Colorado benefit from \u201cliving healthier than anywhere else,\u201d Mokdad said. \u201cYou see less death from certain chronic diseases. It\u2019s clear that certain counties are in many ways less behind than the rest of the nation.\u201d There are four issues that mainly impact what researchers see in county-level death trends, Mokdad said: Social and economic factors, where poorer communities are less likely to live healthy. Access to health care, with some counties having many more uninsured people. Quality of health care, where doctors and patients are less likely to work together and follow up on control of risk factors, such as blood pressure or cholesterol. Preventable risky behaviors, including smoking, eating a poor diet, lack of physical activity and use of alcohol or drugs. \u201cThe take-home from this study is that place matters,\u201d said Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cPlace is the still the most important determinant of health,\u201d Hasbrouck continued. \u201cWe need to zoom down to the granular level and look at the things that help drive health outcomes. Counties are going to have to do their own assessment to see what we\u2019re missing here, and what resources we have to confront these issues.\u201d Mokdad hopes the new study will help counties get funding to confront their particular health dilemmas. \u201cNot only do they know what they have, but if they seek funding they can say this is our burden, this is how big the problem is, and we need money for it,\u201d he said. The county-level data also can help drive home specific health problems in communities where residents might be in denial, Mokdad added. \u201cIf you come and say in the state of Washington smoking is high, then people in Seattle will say that\u2019s not my problem, it\u2019s happening elsewhere in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you show it\u2019s happening in Seattle, then people will see it\u2019s their problem, it\u2019s their burden and they have to deal with it.\u201d The study was published Dec. 13 in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association. \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.

Got it President-elect Donald Trump announced Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) By Steven Mufson , Philip Rucker and Karoun Demirjian December 13 at 1:51 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @karoun President-elect Donald Trump has picked as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson , the chief executive of ExxonMobil, Trump\u2019s transition team announced Tuesday, setting up a possible confrontation with members of his own party in the Senate. Since Tillerson\u2019s name emerged as a candidate for the post, leading Republicans have expressed reservations about his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational oil company. But some lawmakers seemed to be signaling they will support him after the announcement was made. Also under scrutiny is Tillerson\u2019s ties with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin amid wider probes of Russian influence following a CIA assessment pointing to Russian computer hacking during the presidential race. After Tillerson\u2019s nomination was official, several Republican senators offered various degrees of support, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). He said in a statement: \u201cI look forward to supporting his nomination.\u201d ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson in 2015. (Evan Vucci/AP) Other GOP senators, including Jeff Flake (Ariz.), who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will first have to approve Tillerson before a Senate floor vote, said that backing for Tillerson from some prominent figures \u2014 former secretaries of state James Baker and Condoleezza Rice, and former defense secretary Robert M. Gates \u2014 \u201ccarry considerable weight.\u201d Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) has called Tillerson a \u201cvery impressive individual.\u201d The one obvious red flag for Tillerson is Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is also a member of Foreign Relations, where only one Republican vote would endanger the nomination. Rubio expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d and vowed to ensure a \u201cthorough\u201d vetting of the nominee on the committee. \u201cThe next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America\u2019s interests,\u201d Rubio said. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) echoed Rubio\u2019s call that Tillerson\u2019s views be \u201cclosely examined,\u201d such as his relations with China and Russia and views on Middle East tensions. And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who wants a bipartisan investigation of Russian influence on the U.S. elections, said he expects \u201cU.S.-Russia relations to be front-and-center in his confirmation process.\u201d While Senate Democrats cannot filibuster Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, Republicans have only 52 votes in the Senate, leaving them in potential jeopardy if Democrats unite in opposition to Tillerson. It will take at least 50 votes to confirm a nominee, plus Vice President-elect Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote. 1 of 23 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration.

Energy secretary\u00a0nominee, Rick Perry Rick Perry, a former Texas governor who ran for president for the past two election cycles, forgot the name of the Energy Department amid\u00a0a 2011 presidential debate even as he vowed to abolish it. As governor, he championed fossil fuels. Kathy Willens/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D.-N.Y.), the Democrat\u2019s incoming Senate leader, urged that Tillerson face several rounds of questioning over issues such as his \u201cdisturbing opposition\u201d to sanctions on Russia and \u201chow he views Putin.\u201d Like others in the new Trump Cabinet , the ExxonMobil chief executive lacks any experience in government but will try to apply his experience in the business world to the realm of diplomacy. And he has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Putin. The Trump team is planning an aggressive public relations campaign to win confirmation for Tillerson and dispel what it sees as a false narrative about his ties to Russia, a person involved in the transition said. In a statement, Trump called Tillerson an \u201cembodiment of the American Dream\u201d and cited the oil executive\u2019s \u201ctenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics.\u201d Trump, however, made no mention of the nomination process in the announcement. [ Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet ] Gates, whose firm Rice Hadley Gates Consulting has ExxonMobil as one of its clients, was the first person to raise Tillerson as a secretary of state possibility with Trump during a meeting at Trump Tower, the transition official added. Trump did not know much about Tillerson but started chewing over the idea. He invited Tillerson for a meeting, and the two global dealmakers hit it off. They recognized similarities in each other, and the more they talked, the more they liked each other, the transition official said. Tillerson \u201cwould bring to the position vast knowledge, experience and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world,\u201d Gates said in a statement, which did not cite any specific countries. Rice also did not mention Russia or other nations in her statement of support, but appeared to answer potential critics of Tillerson by calling him a \u201cpatriot\u201d who would \u201crepresent the interests and values of the United States.\u201d Rice, who has served on the board of Chevron, spoke with Trump about Tillerson by phone Monday as Trump made his final decision. One argument that the defenders of Tillerson will probably make is that he stands firm in business negotiations in Russia and elsewhere. During his career, he has also cultivated leaders of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Qatar. \u201cOne of the things I know about the Russian government: I\u2019m very predictable. And they know if I say no it means no. And talking about it more isn\u2019t going to change that. No is still going to be no,\u201d Tillerson said in a talk last year at the Texas Tech business school. \u201cOver the years we\u2019ve earned each other\u2019s respect. Then when you say yes, you know we\u2019ll follow through. It means something.\u201d [ Putin wants revenge and respect, and hacking the U.S. is his way of getting it ] Weighing whether to lift economic sanctions on Russia will be one of the first things on Tillerson\u2019s plate, given Trump\u2019s desire to smooth relations with the Kremlin. International economic sanctions, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea and gave support to insurgents in Ukraine\u2019s eastern provinces, have fallen heavily on financial institutions and ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil, which has a profitable operation on Sakhalin island in eastern Russia, had begun a drilling program in the Arctic\u2019s Kara Sea, where Exxon made a find, and had agreed to explore shale oil areas of West Siberia and deep waters of the Black Sea. If sanctions are lifted, Tillerson told analysts this year, the Black Sea drilling would probably be the first to be restarted. While ExxonMobil complained privately to the Obama administration about the sanctions, the company has abided by the law. \u201cThey understand the situation. We understand the situation,\u201d Tillerson said of the Kremlin when asked at an oil analysts\u2019 meeting this year about whether Exxon would resume work in Russia if sanctions were lifted. In addition, Tillerson will have to deal with climate issues because the State Department is the lead agency in international climate negotiations. Unlike Trump, Tillerson has said he believes that climate change is real and has favored a revenue-neutral carbon tax of more than $20 a ton. [ If ExxonMobil were a country, it would be the world\u2019s 41st largest economy ] But environmental groups charge that Exxon knew about the harmful effects of fossil fuels as much as 40 years ago and failed to inform investors and the public, possibly in violation of securities laws. The New York and Massachusetts attorneys general and a range of nongovernmental organizations are locked in battle over the charges. Human rights experts are also unhappy about Tillerson\u2019s nomination, noting that ExxonMobil does business in countries ruled by autocrats or dictators, including countries in the Middle East, as well as Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that companies\u2019 role is to play politics,\u201d said Pavel Molchanov, oil analyst at the investment firm Raymond James. \u201cThey\u2019re there to invest in resources. Saying that he personally has some special feelings toward Russia just because Exxon has invested there is probably overstating the case.\u201d But that might not be the way lawmakers see it. At least four Republican senators have already publicly expressed their concerns with Tillerson\u2019s Russia ties. Graham called the fact that Putin awarded Tillerson the Kremlin\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013 \u201cunnerving,\u201d while Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) questioned Tillerson\u2019s judgment on CNN on Monday noting, \u201cI don\u2019t see how anybody could be a friend of this old-time KGB agent,\u201d referring to Putin. Established in 1994 by the president at the time, Boris Yeltsin, the Order of Friendship has been handed out by Russian leaders to figures as diverse as pianist Van Cliburn, former Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt, and Raymond E. Johnson, founder of the Museum of Russian Art in Minneapolis. Earlier Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Putin and his friendly attitude toward Russia, but played down the idea that it would influence policy. \u201cAs to the allegations of whether his attitude to the Russian Federation is good or bad: being secretary of state is very different from leading a company, even a very big one. Therefore, any, so to speak, sympathies become secondary,\u201d Peskov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as telling reporters. \u201cThe only thing that remains here is readiness to demonstrate a constructive attitude and be professional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hoping that this is what will happen.\u201d Peskov said Tillerson and Putin have met on several occasions, but the spokesman offered only measured comments about their relationship. \u201cIndeed, [Tillerson] repeatedly had contacts with our representatives due to his work in the post of one of the world\u2019s largest oil companies; he fulfills his duties very professionally,\u201d Peskov said. David Filipov in Moscow, and Paul Kane, Anne Gearan and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report. Read more: ",

When asked by journalists about the possibility of arranging a meeting with Trump, Put said \"we are ready at any moment. There are no problems from our side,\" according to an interview transcript released by the Kremlin on Tuesday. Putin said that \"it's widely known that the elected president of the United States has publicly called for the normalization of the Russian-American relationship. We cannot but support this.\" He added that \"we understand it will not be a simple task considering the extent of degradation of the Russian-American relationship. But we are prepared to do our bit.\" Putin said, however, that a meeting between the two leaders was more likely after Trump's January inauguration. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Nic Bothma, EPA) Pass the Dramamine. Though it happened three years ago, the world's biggest wave, a 62-foot-tall monstrosity in the North Atlantic, has just been certified by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). \u201cThis is the first time we have ever measured a wave of 19 meters (62 feet). It is a remarkable record,\u201d said WMO Assistant Secretary-General Wenjian Zhang. The wave\u00a0beat the previous record of 59.96 feet, which was also set in the North Atlantic back in 2007. The wave was recorded by an automated buoy on Feb 4,\u00a02013, in the North Atlantic ocean between Iceland and the U.K. It followed the passage of a strong cold front, which produced winds of up to 50.4 mph over the area. The WMO Commission for Climatology\u2019s Extremes Evaluation Committee classified it as \u201cthe highest significant wave height as measured by a buoy.\u201d Wave height is defined as the distance from the crest of one wave to the bottom\u00a0of the next. The term \u201csignificant wave height\u201d means the average of the highest one-third of waves as measured by an instrument. Shocking: World record 199-mile-long lightning bolt reported What about rogue waves? And isn't it likely there have been bigger, unmeasured waves?\u00a0\"There have been many\u00a0less reliable estimates of rogue waves from other platforms, and from satellite radar,\" said wave expert\u00a0Val Swail from Environment Canada. \"These are generally unverifiable, since there is no ground truth for the satellite, and the others tend to be from pitching and rolling platforms such as ships,\" he added. The world's highest waves typically occur in the North Atlantic during ferocious\u00a0winter storms, according to the WMO. 4592 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hKoZES ",

Medina A man takes part in a march with veterans to Backwater Bridge just outside of the Oceti Sakowin camp during a snow fall near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S., December 5, 2016. (C) Lucas Jackson / Reuters / REUTERS Share advertisement A major oil spill just 150 miles from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in North Dakota has validated the concerns of those who spoke out against the project for months, activists said. State officials estimate that more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil has leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline over the past week into the Ash Coulee Creek in western North Dakota. A landowner discovered the spill near the town of Belfield on Dec. 5, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the North Dakota Health Department . Related: Pipeline Spills 176,000 Gallons of Oil Into Creek 150 Miles From Dakota Access Protests The leak was contained within hours of its discovery, Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the Belle Fourche pipeline, told CNBC . But when news of the spill reached the Oceti Sakowin Camp \u2014 where thousands have protested the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline for months \u2014 activists said they felt vindicated.

And the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe believes that a spill would devastate the Missouri River, which is the main water source for the tribe. For Tara Houska, a Native American environmental activist who has resided at the camp since August, the oil spill was \"yet another example of what happens when you have lax regulations written by oil companies and their patrons.\" Related: Dakota Access Pipeline: What's Behind the Protests? \"The spill gives further credence to our position that pipelines are not safe,\" said Houska, National Campaigns Director for Honor the Earth, a nonprofit organization focused on raising awareness and financial support for indigenous environmental justice. \"Oil companies' interest is on their profit margins, not public safety.\" In an interview last month, Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren told NBC News that he could not assure the tribe that an oil spill could not potentially occur. Warren would only say that the Dakota Access Pipeline was prepared to withstand such an event. Warren said the pipeline would cross 90-115 feet below Lake Oahe, a large Missouri River reservoir, with double walled and remote-controlled shutoff valves on each side of the crossing. A spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners declined to comment for this article. Related: What's Next for the Dakota Access Pipeline? Some Protesters Wary of Future \"They can say they have all the latest technologies to safeguard against a leak,\" Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told NBC News. \"But when that leak happens, and it will, all those safeguards will go out the window.\" Archambault said he relayed his concerns to North Dakota Gov.

Police say Welch fired a rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant after reading a malicious conspiracy known as \"Pizzagate.\" Jose Luis Magana/AP hide caption toggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP Edgar Welch faces a federal charge of transporting a firearm across state lines to commit a crime. Police say Welch fired a rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant after reading a malicious conspiracy known as \"Pizzagate.\" Jose Luis Magana/AP Updated 8:30 p.m. ET The man allegedly motivated by an Internet rumor to fire a rifle inside a Washington, D.C., restaurant, was planning a \"possibly\" violent raid, according to court documents released Tuesday. Investigators say 28-year-old Edgar Welch spent days prior to the Dec. 4 incident at Comet Ping Pong planning the confrontation. A federal complaint filed against Welch quotes text messages mentioning \"Pizzagate,\" a baseless rumor claiming the pizzeria housed a child sex ring for Washington elites. Just two days before he entered the restaurant, Welch allegedly texted a friend his plan to raid \"a pedo ring\" where lives could \"possibly\" be lost. \"I'm sorry bro, but I'm tired of turning the channel and hoping someone does something and being thankful it's not my family. One day it will be our families. The world is too afraid to act and I'm too stubborn not to,\" the complaint says, quoting the text. In another instance, he sent a friend a link to a supposed expose on the restaurant. In a federal courthouse on Tuesday, Welch was formally charged with interstate transportation of a firearm to commit a crime. Local authorities opted not to charge Welch for the multiple weapons, including the AR-15 he fired, which he transported to D.C. from his North Carolina home. Article continues after sponsorship The Dec. 4 incident, in which Edgar Welch is accused of entering the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and firing a rifle, has unnerved politicians and Washington locals alike. Jessica Gresko/AP hide caption toggle caption Jessica Gresko/AP The Dec. 4 incident, in which Edgar Welch is accused of entering the Comet Ping Pong restaurant and firing a rifle, has unnerved politicians and Washington locals alike. Jessica Gresko/AP Authorities have maintained Welch was motivated by the online conspiracy theory plaguing a restaurant known for its family-friendly atmosphere and live music. These new details give a sense of how closely he had followed Pizzagate. As we've previously reported , Comet Ping Pong entered the realm of conspiracy after emails uploaded to WikiLeaks showed Clinton campaign manager John Podesta referring to the restaurant. Misguided interpretations concluded \"pizza\" was code for \"pedophilia.\" Fake-news sites and social networks lent the rumor longevity and reach. Even before Welch's plans to investigate, owner James Alefantis had already been receiving death threats. In an interview a week before the gunman entered his restaurant, Alefantis told NPR : \"They would go into our social media accounts and they would take photographs that were on my Instagram of my friends' children or of my associates' children and post them around thousands and thousands of fake-news sites and on reddit and on YouTube and use these images of happily playing, innocent children as proof of some kind of human trafficking scheme led by the Clintons. ... \"In the case of Comet Ping Pong, we're a beloved neighborhood institution. And so we're very strong in a way. We have great community support. If this kind of attack were leveled at an individual or a less strong small business, it would be \u2014 I think could be potentially devastating to some of these people.\" ",

Security Council, saying \u201caccording to the latest information that we received in the last hour, military actions in eastern Aleppo are over.\u201d He said that as a result, \u201cthere is no issue of some cessation of hostilities, or some special humanitarian operation.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Syrian government has re-established control over eastern Aleppo.\u201d Cease-fire deal reportedly reached in war-torn Aleppo Churkin said earlier that \u201call militants\u201d and members of their families, as well as those wounded in the fighting, \u201ccurrently are going through agreed corridors in directions that they have chosen themselves voluntarily, including toward Idlib,\u201d a rebel stronghold. Rebels had said earlier Tuesday that they had reached an agreement with Russia for a cease-fire in Aleppo to evacuate remaining civilians and rebels from besieged districts, just as the U.N. released a report claiming civilians were being slaughtered by government and Russian forces converging on the city. Retaking Aleppo is probably Syrian President Assad\u2019s biggest victory yet in\u00a0 the 5-year-old civil war . Aleppo has long been regarded as a major gateway between Turkey and Syria. But a government win in Aleppo does not end the conflict - significant parts of Syria are still outside government control and huge swaths of the country are a devastated wasteland. More than a quarter of a million people have been killed since the conflict began in 2011 with peaceful protests against the Assad family\u2019s 45-year-long reign over the country. 21 Photos Fighting rages in Aleppo Pro-government forces reportedly killed 82 civilians \u201con the spot\u201d as they closed in on the last rebel enclave in Aleppo Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said earlier in the day. That and other reports of mass killings, which could not be independently confirmed, reinforced fears of atrocities in eastern Aleppo in the final hours of the battle for the city, which has been split between rebel and government control since 2012. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday that the U.N. human rights chief has received reports of civilians, including women and children, in four neighborhoods being rounded up and killed. Ban said it is \u201cwishful thinking\u201d to believe that military advances will solve Syria\u2019s crisis, and called for an immediate end to violence by all sides. Ban said negotiations are taking place among the parties for an evacuation deal facilitated by Russia and Turkey. He said \u201cwe support these efforts and stand ready to help implement and oversee such an agreement, which we understand may now be imminent.\u201d\u00a0 Several residents and opposition activists have told The Associated Press that government forces carried out summary killings of rebels in the streets in neighborhoods captured on Monday, but the Syrian military flatly denied the claims, saying such allegations were \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d to try gain international sympathy. None of the residents reached by AP witnessed the alleged killings. Their statements reflected the deepening chaos in the remaining rebel-held areas. Mohammed Abu Rajab, the administrator of the last remaining clinic in rebel-held parts of the city, said people who were killed or wounded are being left in the streets. Aref al-Aref, a nurse and activist in eastern Aleppo, said civilians had taken cover in a medical center in one of the last rebel holdouts after its staff evacuated two days earlier. He said the army killed them, but pressed for details, he said he only heard it from others. Monther Etaky, a resident of eastern Aleppo, said he also heard reports of summary killings and knows the name of three families who have reportedly been killed.\\ 21 Photos War in Syria \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Bakersfield Police confirmed Tuesday that Francisco Serna was not armed and no gun was found. They have not yet provided details of any confrontation between Serna and officers who were responding to a report of a man with a handgun in a driveway. \"During the contact, one officer fired several rounds, striking the subject,\" police said in a statement, adding that the officer who fired was placed on administrative leave while the shooting is under investigation. Francisco Serna was a father of five, grandfather of 16 and great-grandfather of five. He was diagnosed with dementia in July and his health had taken a recent turn for the worse, his daughter said. \"We had been taking him to the doctor almost two, three days a week this last month,\" Laura Serna said. BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- A Bakersfield police officer answering a report of a man with a gun shot and killed an unarmed 73-year-old as he stood in a neighbor's driveway, authorities said. The man's family said he was in the early stages of dementia.                                  Francisco Serna was declared dead at the scene about 1:15 a.m. Monday, the Kern County coroner said in a statement. Courtesy of Serna Family In the very early hours of Monday morning, Francisco was up late watching television with his wife of 51 years, his family said. She went to gather some laundry and when she came back, he was gone from the room. Before she could figure out where he went, she heard gunshots and ran outside to see police swarming and her husband on the ground, her daughter said. \"My father is laying in the driveway across the street with blood coming out of his leg area and abdomen area,\" said Laura Serna, who lives in her parents' home. She said her father did not own a gun. Dementia made him agitated and aggressive at times, but he had never tried to hit anyone, she said. The family suspects Francisco was having an episode of some sort related to the dementia and police overreacted. \"I'm sure my dad was just scared to death because he had a little paranoia with the dementia,\" the daughter said. Normally, she said, her father was a \"very peaceful, fun-loving, joking kind of person.\" \"He was kind of the life of the party here,\" she said. \"He was just a good, genuine person.\" Shamar Walters ",

By Brady Dennis December 13 at 11:07 AM Follow @brady_dennis A satellite image of Hurricane Otto approaching the coast of Central America on\u00a0Nov. 24. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Alarmed that decades of crucial climate measurements could vanish under a hostile Trump administration, scientists have begun a feverish attempt to copy reams of government data onto independent servers in hopes of safeguarding\u00a0it from any political interference. The efforts include\u00a0a \u201c guerrilla archiving \u201d event in Toronto, where experts will copy\u00a0irreplaceable public\u00a0data, meetings at the University of Pennsylvania focused on how to download as much federal data as possible in the coming weeks, and a collaboration of scientists and database experts who are compiling an online site to harbor scientific information. \u201cSomething that seemed a little paranoid to me before all of a sudden seems potentially realistic, or at least something you\u2019d want to hedge against,\u201d said Nick Santos, an environmental researcher at the University of California\u00a0at Davis, who over the weekend began copying government climate data onto a nongovernment server, where it will remain available to the public. \u201cDoing this can only be a good thing. Hopefully they leave everything in place. But if not, we\u2019re planning for that.\u201d [ Trump taps Montana congressman Ryan Zinke, who frequently votes against environmentalists, as Interior secretary ] In recent weeks, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a growing list of Cabinet members who have questioned the overwhelming scientific consensus around global warming. His transition team at the Department of Energy has asked agency officials for names of employees and contractors who have participated in international climate talks and worked on the scientific basis for Obama administration-era regulations of carbon emissions. One Trump adviser suggested that NASA no longer should conduct climate research and instead should focus on space exploration. The Trump transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation's carbon output. (Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post) Those moves have stoked fears among the scientific community that Trump, who has called the notion of man-made climate change \u201ca hoax\u201d and vowed to reverse environmental\u00a0policies put in place by President Obama, could try to alter or dismantle parts of the federal government\u2019s repository of data on everything from rising sea levels to the number of wildfires in the country. Michael Halpern,\u00a0deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists,\u00a0argued that Trump has appointed a \u201cband of climate conspiracy theorists\u201d to run transition efforts at various agencies, along with nominees to lead them who share similar views. [ Energy Dept. rejects Trump\u2019s request to name climate change workers, who remain worried ] \u201cThey have been salivating at the possibility of dismantling federal climate research programs for years. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think they would want to take down the very data that they dispute,\u201d Halpern said in an email. \u201cThere is a fine line between being paranoid and being prepared, and scientists are doing their best to be prepared. . . . Scientists are right to preserve data and archive websites before those who want to dismantle federal climate change research programs storm the castle.\u201d To be clear,\u00a0neither Trump\u00a0nor his transition team have said the new administration plans\u00a0to manipulate or curtail publicly available data. The transition team did not respond to a request for comment. But some scientists aren\u2019t taking any chances. \u201cWhat are the most important .gov climate assets?\u201d Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist and self-proclaimed \u201cclimate hawk,\u201d tweeted from his Arizona home Saturday evening.\u00a0\u201cScientists: Do you have a US .gov climate database that you don\u2019t want to see disappear?\u201d [ Trump taps former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to head Energy Department he once vowed to abolish ] Within hours, responses flooded in from around the country. Scientists added links to dozens of government databases to a Google spreadsheet . Investors offered to help fund efforts to copy and safeguard key climate data. Lawyers offered pro bono legal help. Database experts offered server space and help organizing mountains of data. In California, Santos began building an online repository to \u201cmake\u00a0sure these data sets remain freely and broadly accessible.\u201d Climate data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u00a0have been politically vulnerable. When Tom Karl, director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and his colleagues published a study in 2015 seeking to challenge the idea that there had been a global warming \u201cslowdown\u201d or \u201cpause\u201d during the 2000s, they relied, in significant part, on updates to NOAA\u2019s ocean temperature data set , saying the data \u201cdo not support the notion of a global warming \u2018hiatus.\u2019\u201d In response, the U.S. House Science, Space and Technology Committee chair, Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Tex.), tried\u00a0to subpoena the scientists and their records . That effort launched by Holthaus is one of several underway to preserve key federal scientific data. [ Trump has picked the most conservative EPA leader since 1981. This one will face much less resistance. ] In Philadelphia, researchers at\u00a0the University of Pennsylvania, along with members of groups such as Open Data Philly and the software company Azavea, have been meeting to figure out ways to harvest and store\u00a0important data sets. At the University of Toronto this weekend, researchers are holding what they call a \u201cguerrilla archiving\u201d event to catalogue key federal environmental data ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u00a0The event \u201cis focused\u00a0on preserving information and data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has programs and data at high risk of being removed from online public access or even deleted,\u201d the organizers said. \u201cThis includes climate change, water, air, toxics programs.\u201d The event is part of a broader effort to help San Francisco-based Internet Archive with its\u00a0 End of Term 2016 project, an effort by university, government and nonprofit officials to find and archive valuable pages on federal websites. The project has existed through several presidential transitions. [ Al Gore just had \u2018an extremely interesting conversation\u2019 with Trump on climate change ] At the American Geophysical Union\u2019s fall meeting in San Francisco, where more than 20,000 earth and climate scientists have swarmed the city\u2019s biggest conference center this week, an air of gallows humor marked many conversations. Some young scientists said their biggest personal concern is funding for their research, much of which relies on support from NASA and other agencies. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Adam Campbell, who studies the imperiled Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica. But\u00a0others also arrived at the meeting with a strengthened sense of resolve. Campbell was planning to join hundreds of other people at a rally Tuesday, organized in part by the activist group ClimateTruth.org, encouraging researchers to \u201cstand up for science.\u201d\u00a0\u201cPeople have felt a call to arms,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe need to be outspoken.\u201d Donald Trump will enter the White House with an environmental policy agenda opposed to that of the Obama administration and many other nations that have pledged support to the Paris climate agreement. The Washington Post's Chris Mooney breaks down what a Donald Trump presidency will mean when it comes to climate change. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Lawyers with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund \u2014 which\u00a0provides legal assistance to researchers facing lawsuits over their work on climate change \u2014 will be holding one-on-one consultations with researchers who think they might need help from a\u00a0lawyer. And the organization\u2019s table in the AGU exhibition hall is piled high with booklets titled \u201cHandling Political Harassment and Legal Intimidation: A Pocket Guide for Scientists.\u201d [ Shrinking mountain glaciers are \u2018categorical evidence\u2019 of climate change, scientists say ] \u201cWe literally thought about it the day after the election,\u201d said Lauren Kurtz, the legal defense fund\u2019s executive director. \u201cI have gotten a lot of calls from scientists who are really concerned. . . . So it\u2019s intended in some ways to be reassuring, to say, \u2018There is a game plan; we\u2019re here to help you.\u2019\u201d The 16-page guide contains advice for\u00a0government researchers who believe their work is being suppressed, as well as how scientists should react if they receive hate mail or death threats. Holthaus, who encouraged scientists to flag key databases, said the effort to safeguard them is mostly precautionary. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that it will happen,\u201d he said of efforts by an incoming administration to obscure or alter scientific data. \u201cBut I think it could happen. . . .\u00a0All of these data sets are priceless, in the sense that if there is a gap, it greatly diminishes their usefulness.\u201d [ Trump says \u2018nobody really knows\u2019 if climate change is real ] That\u2019s the main concern for Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. He said he doubts that even the most hostile administration would try to do away with existing climate data, given the potential backlash. \u201cI think it\u2019s much more likely they\u2019d try to end the collection of data, which would minimize its value.\u00a0Having continuous data is crucial for understanding long-term trends,\u201d Dessler said. \u201cTrends are what climate change is about \u2014 understanding these long-term changes.\u00a0Think about how much better off the people who don\u2019t want to do anything about climate change would be if all the long-term temperature trends didn\u2019t exist.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you can just get rid of the data, you\u2019re in a stronger position to argue we should do nothing about climate change.\u201d Chris Mooney in Washington and Sarah Kaplan in San Francisco contributed to this report.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Jill Stein's rowdy recount push ended with a whimper overnight, giving Donald Trump even more votes than he started with after final certification -- but it wasn't a total wash for the Green Party candidate, who brought in millions and put herself in a position to redistribute the leftover cash. Stein raised about $7.3 million in three weeks to fund recount efforts, more than\u00a0double what she raised for her failed presidential campaign. The money poured in from 161,300 donors across the country. Another 10,000 volunteers signed up to help the drive. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much remains -- millions went to recount costs and legal fees -- but she announced Tuesday she plans to donate leftover funds to election-reform and voting-rights groups. \u201cIt was an amazing affirmation of the power of the American people to have a voice in their voting system and demand elections with integrity,\u201d Stein said in a statement Tuesday. On the surface, the recounts accomplished little. Her attempts to get fresh tallies in Michigan and Pennsylvania were blocked in court. Stein had suggested \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that voting machines in those states and Wisconsin could have been hacked in the November election. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schutte, a Republican, argued in the lawsuit that a hand recount would cost taxpayers around $2 million. Other esimates put it as high as $12 million. Though unsuccessful in Michigan, Stein was able to request and pay for the Wisconsin recount which started on Dec. 1. But that effort resulted in Trump picking up 131 net votes, as his victory was certified in all three states. Trump boasted on Twitter: \u201cThe final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!\u201d The fizzling finish came after Stein faced accusations of wasting time and draining grassroots resources. Stein\u2019s own running mate initially was against the recount, as was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. But Stein insisted all along her goal wasn\u2019t to overturn the results of the presidential election but instead to instill confidence in the election results and voting systems. At the least, the effort has allowed her to stay in the spotlight, and with her announcement Tuesday puts her in charge of distributing the leftover funds she raised. It also connected her with more donors.\u00a0 Jordan Brueckner, a spokeswoman for Stein\u2019s recount drive, told FoxNews.com that all 161,000-plus donors will have a say in where the extra money is donated \u2013 a task perhaps easier said than done. The campaign has pledged to divvy up the funds to a set of non-partisan organizations. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a name for the organizations but we\u2019ll give the donors an option [of where the money will go],\u201d she said during a telephone interview. The amount of cash given to the groups will be based on a ranked-choice vote which will be made public on Stein\u2019s website in the coming weeks, Brueckner said. Democratic strategist Joe Trippi told The Hill he thought recount efforts were a way for Stein \u201cto stay relevant, raise some money and take the stink off of them.\u201d \u201cInstead of everybody screaming, \u2018You made Trump happen,\u2019 she is counting the votes to change that whole narrative.\u2019\u201d Advertisement ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Sandhya Somashekhar December 13 at 5:06 PM Follow @sandhyawp Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in Cincinnati earlier this year. (John Minchillo/AP) Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Tuesday\u00a0 vetoed \u00a0a controversial bill that would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy but signed a measure prohibiting the procedure later in pregnancy. The measure the Republican governor rejected would have barred a woman from obtaining an abortion if a fetal heartbeat could be detected. The legislature passed the measure last week even though it conflicts with Supreme Court decisions upholding the right to abortion at least until the point at which the fetus is viable. The bill he signed, banning the procedure at 20 weeks of pregnancy, may run afoul of these rulings, because viability is generally interpreted\u00a0to be around 24 weeks. In a statement, Kasich said he vetoed what has been called\u00a0the \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d because it was \u201cclearly contrary\u201d to Supreme Court rulings.\u00a0The state would have been forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars trying unsuccessfully to defend the law and would have provoked lawsuits that would end up rolling back other restrictions enacted by the state, he said. In a separate statement, he said he agreed with major antiabortion groups that have preferred to challenge precedent with the 20-week ban, which he said \u201cis the best, most legally sound and sustainable approach to protecting the sanctity of human life.\u201d [ Abortion regulations by state ] Abortion rights groups condemned Kasich\u2019s support for the 20-week ban, which has no exception for rape or incest and has an exception for the life of the mother that rights groups said was too narrow. \u201cHe thinks that by vetoing\u00a0one abortion ban Ohioans will not notice that he has signed another,\u201d Kellie Copeland, NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cKasich\u2019s actions today will fall hardest on low-income women, women of color, and young women. History will not judge Gov. Kasich\u2019s\u00a0disregard for women\u2019s health kindly.\u201d Ohio becomes the 16th state to ban abortion at around 20 weeks, based on the contention that fetuses may be able to feel pain at that stage. Most experts believe that point comes later in fetal development. [ Planned Parenthood fears it may be first casualty of rekindled abortion war ] While abortion rights advocates on Tuesday focused on the bill Kasich signed, the more restrictive measure drew more attention over the past week because it would have banned the procedure before many women realize they are pregnant. Two other states,\u00a0 Arkansas and North Dakota , recently passed abortion bans at a very early point in pregnancy, but the measures were blocked by the courts. Several other states considered such measures but stopped short after some antiabortion groups worried that they would provoke a legal backlash that further cements abortion rights. Still, Ohio lawmakers \u2014 emboldened by the election of Donald Trump \u2014 approved the bill as a new offensive to curb abortion rights. Trump has pledged to appoint justices who oppose Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationally. The law may yet be enacted if the legislature overrides Kasich\u2019s veto. In Ohio, that requires a three-fifths majority in each chamber. national ",

Photos from inside one of the homes\u00a0showed swastikas and Confederate flags adorning the walls, as well as the Peckerwoods\u2019 gang crest. The separate complaints named Johnny Reed and Erik Cutshaw, a known associate of the white supremacist gang, as well as the property owners at each location. Feuer said his office was able to compel \u201cinformal\u201d changes at a third location in Canoga Park by working with the property owner. A gang member detonated a pipe bomb at the third location earlier this year, according to Feuer, but no one was injured. The bombing was the result of an intra-gang feud, and Feuer would not say whether criminal charges were pending in connection with the explosion. If the city attorney\u2019s office wins the abatement orders, they can compel changes to the conditions at each property. Owners will normally comply and find new tenants as a result of the orders, but the residences could be shut down if\u00a0property owners don\u2019t cooperate;\u00a0Feuer described that as a \u201clast resort.\u201d Asked if his office had considered filing a gang injunction against the Peckerwoods, a tactic the city has used repeatedly to tamp down the activities of street gangs across Los Angeles, Feuer declined to comment\u00a0but did\u00a0not rule\u00a0out that possibility. \u201cWe have a very robust series of gang injunctions in the city, and we will pursue appropriate remedies at the right time,\u201d he said. While the investigations were focused on the Peckerwoods\u2019 gang and drug activity, Feuer said the activities of hate groups in Los Angeles County have become an increasing concern in the wake of a reported surge in bias incidents and crimes.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to be protective of people, especially now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no question that we are living in a nation that is experiencing heightened tension.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s secretary of state pick, is an oil tycoon with close ties to Russia , the L.A.

    "text": "CBS/AP December 13, 2016, 8:21 PM Prosecutors detail months leading up to Charleston church massacre Police lead suspected shooter Dylann Roof into the courthouse in Shelby, North Carolina, on June 18, 2015. Reuters/Jason Miczek Email CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Through a dozen witnesses on Tuesday, federal prosecutors reconstructed the activities of Dylann Roof in the months leading up to night he went to a black Charleston church and shot nine members to death during a Bible study session. Using data from a Garmin GPS found in Roof\u2019s car when he was arrested, Joseph Hamski, the lead FBI agent on the case, testified that Roof left Columbia at 6:13 p.m. on the night of the shootings at Emanuel AME Church, arriving in downtown Charleston an hour and a half later.\u00a0 Prosecutors could soon wrap up their case against Dylann Roof in the Charleston church shooting. CBS News correspondent Mark Strassman has the la... At 8:16 p.m., church surveillance images show him walking into the church. By 9:06 p.m., he\u2019s seen walking out, a black gun in his hand. Roof, who is white, faces 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion. Roof\u2019s attorneys have said repeatedly in both federal and state court that their 22-year-old client is willing to plead guilty if capital punishment is taken off the table, a request prosecutors have refused. Roof faces another death penalty trial next year in state court. Prior to that night, Hamski testified, Roof made multiple trips to Charleston, stopping at plantations in the area and posing for photographs on a beach. Images of Roof\u2019s travels around the Charleston area were shown in court and previously appeared on his website, lastrhodesian.com, along with his racially inflammatory writings and photographs of Roof posing with a Confederate flag. An AT&T employee testified a call was made to the church from Roof\u2019s home in February.\u00a0 Nine people were killed, including the pastor, in a historic black church in Charleston late June 17, 2015; the suspect, Dylann Roof, was charged... Justin Britt, a Richland County sheriff\u2019s deputy, also testified that Roof\u2019s mother collapsed when authorities came to her home the day after the shootings and started asking questions about her son. After recovering, Britt said Roof\u2019s mother led him to her son\u2019s bedroom, where she showed him a digital camera on which Britt said he saw pictures of Roof with a Confederate flag. \u201cShe said, \u2018There\u2019s something that I think you need to see,\u2019\u201d Britt testified. Another officer who helped search the home testified she recovered dozens of spent ammunition rounds, saying relatives told her Roof and others would practice shooting in a nearby wooded area. Kristen Polis also testified she photographed a white pillowcase cut into a triangle because \u201cto me, it represents what could be a Ku Klux Klan hood.\u201d Prosecutors also played video of Roof practicing shooting his gun at various objects in his backyard and quickly reloading the weapon. Witness testimony is expected to wrap up Wednesday, with the government calling a medical examiner to discuss details of the victims\u2019 injuries. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson opened his case with Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the June 2015 shooting at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church. He has said he plans to close with testimony of another survivor, Polly Sheppard. Defense attorney David Bruck, who has previously said he might not call any witnesses, said Tuesday he would likely call some after all.\u00a0 A look at the people killed in Emanuel AME Church, a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina If Roof is convicted, jurors would decide if he should be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. While he has a defense team at the moment, Roof has said he wants to be his own lawyer for the penalty phase.\u00a0 Surveillance video from the day of the attack \u00a0in June 2015 showed people walking into the church. Then, in walks Roof, carrying a 45 Glock pistol and seven magazines. Once inside, he opened fire as the faithful rose and closed their eyes to pray. Malcolm Graham, whose 54-year-old sister Cynthia Hurd was murdered,\u00a0 spoke to CBS News . \u201cThis was an attack on a race of people and an attack on the Christian church and an attack on humanity,\u201d Graham said. In Roof\u2019s confession video, an FBI agent asked Roof, \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d \u201cI had to do it because somebody had to,\u201d Roof said. \u201cBlacks are raping and killing white people on the streets every day... What I did is still minuscule to what they\u2019re doing to white people every day.\u201d Roof\u2019s lawyers have conceded that he carried out the attack, and are focused on persuading jurors to spare his life in the penalty phase of the trial. They said in opening statements they will call few or no witnesses. Testimony continues next week, and prosecutors said they may rest their case Wednesday.\u00a0 Along with the overt racism, Roof\u2019s confession and notes show the then-21-year-old as naive and immature. He wrote a note apologizing to\u00a0 his mother \u00a0and saying \u201cas childish as it sounds, I wish I was in your arms.\u201d\u00a0 But Roof meticulously prepared for the shootings. He carried eight magazines that could each hold 13 rounds, but loaded only 11 each so that he could shoot 88 times. That\u2019s a revered number among white supremacists, standing for \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.\u00a0 At one point, an agent asked if Roof had thought about killing more blacks.\u00a0 \u201cOh, no. I was worn out,\u201d Roof said.\u00a0 Roof said he left bullets in a magazine so that he could kill himself after the slayings, but changed his mind when he didn\u2019t immediately see any police.\u00a0 ",

USA TODAY A still from a video post Monday by @linashamy. (Photo: @linashamy / Twitter) A\u00a0Syrian activist described a \u201cgenocide\u201d unfolding in the streets of Aleppo Monday, hours before reports surfaced that pro-government forces had executed civilians on the besieged city\u2019s streets, including women and children. Lina Shamy, who describes herself as an Aleppo-based member of the \u201cSyrian Revolution,\u201d said in a video that more than 180 people had died at the hands of forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo\u2019s eastern half, an area once controlled by rebel fighters. \u201cTo everyone who can hear me: We are here exposed to a genocide in the besieged city of Aleppo,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may be my last video. More than 50,000 of civilians who rebelled against the dictator al-Assad are threatened with field executions or dying under bombing.\u201d \u2014 Lina shamy (@Linashamy) December 12, 2016 The message marked one of many by Syrians who prepared for possible death \u00a0as the United Nations received reports of pro-government forces killing men, women and children in summary executions and heavy bombing.\u00a0Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0human rights office, recounted reports of\u00a0 at least 82 \u00a0civilians killed, including\u00a011 women and 13 children. So is it genocide? The United Nations defines genocide in Article 2 of its Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as \u201cacts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\u201d Nearly half a million Syrians have been killed \u00a0since the nation\u2019s civil war began five years ago, with millions displaced. In a 2015 video from the Holocaust Museum, Holocaust survivor Margit Meissner lamented the actions of Assad\u2019s regime, comparing it to the mass slaughter she lived through in the 1930s and '40s. \u201cI find it most disheartening that again, 80 years after the end of World War II, the world is faced with a regime that targets its own people for destruction,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cOne of the major differences it that the destruction of the Jews in Europe was secret. The humanitarian crisis in Syria is certainly not a secret.\u201d By late Tuesday, the Associated Press had reported that Syrian rebels reached a cease-fire deal allowing them to evacuate eastern Aleppo as Russia declared the area to be under Syrian government control.

By Juliet Eilperin December 13 at 8:38 PM Follow @eilperin President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to head the Department of the Interior. Here's what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Danielle Kunitz,Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Republican\u00a0Rep. Ryan Zinke, who has represented Montana\u2019s at-large congressional seat for one term, to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior, according to an individual with firsthand knowledge of the decision. Zinke, who studied geology as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon and served as a Navy SEAL from 1986 to 2008 before entering politics, campaigned for his House seat on a platform of achieving North American energy independence. He sits on the House Natural Resources Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee. A lifelong hunter and fisherman, the 55-year-old Zinke has defended public access to federal lands even though he frequently votes against environmentalists on issues ranging from coal extraction to oil and gas drilling.\u00a0This summer, he quit his post as a member of the GOP platform-writing committee after the group included language that would have transferred federal land ownership to the states. \u201cWhat I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,\u201d Zinke said at the time. \u201cAt this point, I think it\u2019s better to show leadership.\u201d Trump also opposes such land transfers, but the provision made it into the official Republican platform. Zinke recently criticized an Interior Department rule aimed at curbing inadvertent releases of methane from oil and gas operations on federal land as \u201cduplicative and unnecessary.\u201d \u201cClean air and clean water are absolute top priorities when we talk about responsible energy development, however the final rule issued by the Obama administration does nothing to further protect our resources,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis rule is a stark reminder that we need to invest in infrastructure projects like the Keystone pipeline, so we don\u2019t need to flare excess gas.\u201d [ Environmentalists and scientists brace for a future clash with Trump ] During his time in Congress, Zinke has established a 3 percent voting score with the League of Conservation Voters. But he has broken ranks with the panel\u2019s GOP majority on occasion, opposing a measure by Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) that would have allowed each state to buy up to 2 million acres in U.S. Forest Service land to boost timber production. He has also pushed for full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a high priority for outdoors groups. Land Tawney, president and chief executive of the Montana-based Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, described Zinke on Tuesday as \u201ca straight shooter\u201d who has established credibility with outdoors enthusiasts in the state. During a recent meeting with him at a distillery in Whitefish, the congressman\u2019s home town, Zinke walked into the\u00a0place in flip-flops. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019s a congressman,\u201d Tawney said. \u201cHe really prides himself on being a Theodore Roosevelt Republican, and he lives that a little bit more than other people.\u201d [ Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump ] Outdoors activities such as mountain biking and skiing are a major economic driver in Whitefish as well as in Montana overall, where roughly 200,000 residents have big-game hunting licenses and 300,000 have fishing licenses. Zinke, who has been endorsed by\u00a0the Outdoor Industry Association, has embraced that sector of the state\u2019s economy. \u201cHunting and fishing isn\u2019t something we do in Montana, it\u2019s a way of life,\u201d said Tawney, a fifth-generation Montanan. Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership President Whit Fosburgh, whose hunters and anglers group has worked with Zinke, said in an interview that it would be \u201cvery supportive of Ryan Zinke\u201d as a Cabinet nominee. \u201cHe\u2019s shown courage and commitment to public lands and conservation and [is] someone we think would be an excellent secretary of interior,\u201d Fosburgh said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed a lawsuit late Monday on behalf of several ministers, rabbis and organizations that provide abortion counseling services to women. The lawsuit filed in a federal court in Tallahassee contends that the law violates constitutional rights by requiring groups to register with the state and pay a fee if they advise or help women seek abortions. The lawsuit also challenges a provision already in state law that requires groups to tell women about alternatives to abortion. \"The state cannot tell citizens what they can and cannot say, or require that they register with the state before they can speak, especially about something as personal and private as reproductive choice,\" said James Greene, one of the attorneys working on the case. Legislators passed the sweeping abortion measure during their 2016 session and most of the debate centered on other parts of the law, including one that would have affected Planned Parenthood . Planned Parenthood wound up suing over the law, which included a provision that prevented any state or local funds from going to an organization for other types of services if that organization also provided abortions. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle this summer blocked that portion of the law, as well as another one that increased inspection requirements for clinics. The administration of Gov. Rick Scott decided to forgo any additional legal action and did not appeal Hinkle's ruling. The new lawsuit was filed against Attorney General Pam Bondi and a top official in the state's Agency for Health Care Administration who reports to Scott. McKinley Lewis, a spokesman for Scott, said the governor's office had not seen the lawsuit yet but stressed that Scott is \"clear in his support of legislation which protects the sanctity of life and the life of an unborn child.\" In a statement, Bondi said she had no enforcement authority under the abortion law and should not have been sued. The court action this week was just a new chapter in a long-running battle over abortion in the Sunshine State. Since the GOP assumed control of the Florida Legislature two decades ago, legislators have enacted a series of bills, only to see many of them overturned in the courts. The Florida Supreme Court in April suspended a 24-hour waiting period for abortions while it decides whether that law is constitutional. 0 Shares ",

Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife, Sandi, are sentenced Aug. 14, 2013, for separate felonies related to misspending campaign funds. Nereida Moreno Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. filed for divorce Monday from former Ald. Sandi Jackson , according to Cook County court records. Jackson Jr., 51, cited in the filing irreconcilable differences after 25 years of marriage. He requests that the couple's two children, age 16 and 12, \"reside with him, subject to Sandi's exercise of reasonable parenting time.\" His attorney could not be reached for comment Monday evening. The Jacksons were a Democratic power couple until being brought down by a federal investigation that led to convictions and prison time for both. He was found guilty of looting about $750,000 from his federal campaign treasury, spending the money on vacations, furs, celebrity memorabilia and two mounted elk heads, among other things. Sandi Jackson left a federal prison camp in West Virginia in September, where she had been serving a one-year sentence for filing false income tax returns. She began her prison sentence after her husband finished serving 22 months of a 30-month sentence. Jackson Jr. was in Congress from 1995 until he quit in 2012 amid the criminal investigation and treatment for bipolar disorder and depression. He is the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Sandi Jackson was Chicago's 7th Ward alderman from 2007 until she resigned in 2013. ",

Robert Bibbs, a cousin of Heather Mack's boyfriend arrives at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse building Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Elyssa Cherney Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The cousin of Heather Mack 's boyfriend, who federal prosecutors allege helped the couple murder Mack's mother in Bali in 2014, pleaded guilty Tuesday to his role in the bloody killing that garnered international attention. A grand jury in October 2015 indicted Robert Bibbs on three counts, all having to do with conspiracy to commit the murder of a U.S. citizen on foreign soil. Bibbs, 26, pleaded guilty to one count in the indictment, conspiracy to commit foreign murder of a national of the United States. He would not be sentenced to more than 20 years under the plea deal. Sentencing is scheduled for March 23. The charges stem from the Aug. 12, 2014, killing of Oak Park resident Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, while she was on a luxury vacation in Bali with her daughter, Heather. The younger Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer planned the attack, carried it out and stuffed von Wiese-Mack's bloody body in a suitcase left at the resort. Mack, 21, is serving a 10-year prison term and Schaefer, 23, is serving 18 years after an Indonesian jury convicted them. According to the criminal complaint against Bibbs, the Chatham resident coached both his cousin and Mack before the Bali trip on how to commit the murder without getting caught. He offered suggestions of a drug overdose made to look like an accident or suffocation during sleep. Bibbs remained in contact with the couple after they went to Bali too. Prosecutors allege Bibbs took part for a share of von Wiese-Mack's multimillion-dollar inheritance. She was bludgeoned to death with a metal pole from a fruit stand. In electronic messages obtained by investigators, Schaefer texted Bibbs that \"for some reason\" he didn't feel bad, according to the charges. Sheila von Wiese- Mack 's body was discovered by Indonesian police Aug. 12, 2014, stuffed into a suitcase at a resort in Bali. Her daughter, Heather Mack, of Chicago, and Heather's boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer , of Oak Park, were tried and found guilty in her\u00a0murder. \"She wasn't a good person,\" Bibbs allegedly responded. \"There wasn't any positive energy released from her body.\" Bibbs on Friday filed to change his plea. He had pleaded not guilty Oct. 30, 2015, after being indicted a month before. Bibbs, who works at a nursing home doing maintenance, has no serious criminal record prior to the case. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer last month rejected requests from Bibbs to dismiss the charges, affirming the case would go to trial Jan. 30, court records show. ",

Here's what you need to know about this new listening device. AirPods. (Photo: Apple) After months of delays, Apple's wireless earbuds are finally available for purchase. In what some Apple fans may consider a small holiday miracle, Apple on Tuesday released its new AirPods, wireless earbuds first announced back in September alongside the headphone jack-less iPhone 7. The $159 earbuds were delayed in October, with Apple telling tech news site TechCrunch at the time\u00a0that \"we\u00a0don\u2019t believe in shipping a product before it\u2019s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.\u201d Report: Apple delays AirPods It is unclear what exactly has been changed or fixed, but it does appear that the earbuds will be in short supply. Within a few hours, Apple's online store has already listed the AirPods as shipping in four weeks, taking them well past Christmas delivery. Apple will be bringing the AirPods to its retail stores, authorized resellers (such as Best Buy) and some wireless carrier stores\u00a0next week, making that likely the best option for finding the wireless headphones before the holidays. Apple had previously provided pre-production AirPods to tech reviewers to test alongside iPhone 7, with several praising the earbuds even though their design was a bit surprising. USA TODAY's\u00a0Ed Baig\u00a0found they \"sounded quite good and were a breeze to pair and charge.\" Follow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal 59 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hBx2Id ",

Mikhail Klimentyev / Kremlin Pool Photo via AP Share advertisement Donald Trump laid out a wholesale rethinking of American foreign policy during his campaign. Now it falls on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who the president-elect tapped as secretary of state on Tuesday, to implement that vision. That work will likely include efforts to ease tensions between the U.S. and Russia, withdrawing from global agreements on climate change and Iran's nuclear weapons program, limiting the number of refugees coming to America, and ending the American-backed push to force Syria's Bashar Assad from power.

But in Trump's view, Tillerson has the kind of global deal-making experience he is looking for. \"The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments,\" the president-elect said in a Twitter message on Tuesday. What does Trump want Tillerson to do? Here is how the real estate mogul described his foreign policy vision in a major speech in September. \"We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground,\" Trump said . \"I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.\" He added, \"We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.\" Here's a closer look at some of the key issues Tillerson will handle if he is confirmed by the Senate. Russia The most controversial part of Tillerson's nomination is his connections to Russia and Vladimir Putin, who in 2013 presented the oil and gas company executive an Order of Friendship, an award the Russian government gives to non-citizens who it wants to honor. Play Should Tillerson's relationship with Putin be concerning? 3:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161213210842if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/832042563929\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Relations between the U.S. and Russia are at perhaps their worst right now since the end of the Cold War. The European Union and the United States enacted a series of sanctions against Russia in 2014, after Russia took control of Crimea, a region that had been part of Ukraine. The Russian government has strongly backed Assad in Syria's civil war, despite Obama calls for him to step down and American support for civil rebels. Most importantly, the U.S. government has concluded that Russia intentionally interfered in the 2016 American elections by hacking and releasing e-mails from the Democratic National Committee and a top Hillary Clinton adviser. The CIA says that Russia was intentionally trying to get Trump elected. Trump calls that assertion \"ridiculous.\" Trump says that America can have a less tense relationship with Russia. In a press conference in July, the businessman suggested he would consider both lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia and formally recognizing Russian control of Crimea. He could accomplish both through his executive authority. And on this issue, Trump's secretary of state choice was telling. Mitt Romney, who Trump also considered for the post, has blasted Putin's government. Tillerson, on the other hand, in his role at Exxon, expressed skepticism about the sanctions against Russia. China During the campaign, Trump called for a more aggressive posture toward China, at least on economic issues. He frequently suggested he would rethink American trade with the world's most populous nation, arguing current policy allows China to \" rape our country \" and threatening tariffs on Chinese-made goods imported to the U.S. Donald Trump and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. STAFF / AFP - Getty Images In the weeks after Election Day, Trump had an unprecedented phone conversation with Taiwan's president and said he would also reconsider the American \"One China\" policy that does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. China will also be influential in U.S. efforts, which Trump says he will continue, to prevent North Korea from further developing its nuclear weapons program. The Middle East Trump has said he broadly wants a pullback from U.S. engagement in the Middle East. In a interview last month with the Wall Street Journal , Trump suggested the U.S. should better hone in on fighting ISIS, rather than supporting rebel efforts to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia factors into his calculations given that nation's support of the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war. If if the U.S. attacks Assad, Trump said, \"we end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria.\" Play ",

By Karoun Demirjian December 13 at 5:50 PM Follow @karoun Congressional leaders are vowing to vigorously probe allegations that Russia interfered in the elections to benefit President-elect Donald J. Trump, but they are already arguing over who should do so and how any examination should be conducted. Senior Republicans want to channel any investigation through the House and Senate intelligence committees, over which they have greater control. But some Democrats, fearing that the results of such an investigation would never be released to the public, are pushing the formation of an independent body of outsiders modeled on the Sept. 11 commission. Still other Republicans would like to see a bipartisan investigation in Congress -- or better yet, form entirely new congressional committees and subcommittees to dig into the matter. A different group of Democrats would like to see a very unusual bicameral probe into whether Russia allegedly hacked the Democratic National Committee emails and leaked them to WikiLeaks in a concerted effort to damage Hillary Clinton. The cacophony of competing voices on Capitol Hill could hamstring the rare, near-universal commitment to dig into allegations Russian interfered with the 2016 election. It may also allow Trump to discredit lawmakers\u2019 efforts as overly partisan \u2014 the president-elect has called charges \u201c ridiculous \u201d that Russia interfered in the election to benefit his candidacy. In public statements, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have both focused on channeling any Russia investigation through their intelligence committees. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) speaks to the media after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, U.S. December 9, 2016. REUTERS/Mark Kauzlarich (Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters) McConnell on Monday said the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 of which he is a symbolic member as the chamber\u2019s GOP leader -- is \u201cmore than capable of conducting a complete review of the matter.\u201d Ryan agreed, saying that a special panel is unnecessary because the House Intelligence Committee is \u201cworking diligently on the cyber threats posed by foreign governments and terrorist organizations.\u201d But if history is any guide, those investigations could be highly classified and damaged by partisan infighting. Their findings may be subject to presidential review and closely held by top lawmakers, the intelligence community and senior aides in the Trump White House. \u201cThere certainly is a danger in this being swept under the rug,\u201d said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden (D), an Intelligence member. \u201cThere must be urgency and transparency in getting facts out into the open, whether they\u2019re being investigated by the intelligence committees, other standing congressional committees, a joint committee or an independent commission.\u201d The closest parallel may well be the so-called \u201ctorture report,\u201d produced in 2014 by the Senate Intelligence Committee documenting CIA treatment of suspected terrorist detainees in the wake of Sept. 11. Despite then-chairwoman Dianne Feinstein\u2019s (D-Calif.) intense desire to see the full 7,000-page report released, all but the 548-page executive summar y has remained private. [ Senate report on CIA program details brutality, dishonesty ] That panel devolved into near chaos when the torture report was released without the support of Republicans, including the incoming chairman of the Intelligence committee, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.). When he became chair, Burr demanded the return of all copies of the report, apparently concerned it could be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. President Obama just this week made moves to preserve the report when he leaves office without ensuring it immediately becomes available to the public. Vice President-elect Mike Pence gestures to reporters during a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill on Nov. 30, 2016. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) Obama has also taken steps to collect information about the CIA allegations before he leaves office on Jan. 20, ordering a \u201cfull review\u201d of the charges be delivered to him before he leaves office. Separately, a group of senior Democratic senators is pushing Obama to declassify information about Russia\u2019s alleged election-related hacking operations before Trump is inaugurated. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman on Tuesday issued a blunt denial of U.S. allegations that the Kremlin intervened to help Trump win the presidency, and expressed hope that Moscow will be able to \u201creset\u201d its relationship with the new administration. In an interview with RT television, Peskov dismissed the findings by the CIA that the Russian government aided Trump \u2014 or that it was interfering in upcoming German elections \u2014 as \u201cabsolute nonsense.\u201d The battle over how to investigate Russian influence is likely to bleed over into the confirmation hearings of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson , who was nominated on Tuesday by Trump to be his secretary of state. Several Republican senators, who must vote to confirm Tillerson, expressed concern over ties Tillerson has to Russia\u2019s President Vladi\u00admir Putin, who decorated him with the Kremlin\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013. \u201cWhile Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will hold confirmation hearings, said in a statement. \u201cThe next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America\u2019s interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America\u2019s foreign policy goals to the president, within the administration, and on the world stage.\u201d McConnell, however, backed Tillerson, saying \u201cI look forward to supporting\u201d his nomination. The House and Senate intelligence panels have already had briefings from various officials pertaining to allegations Russia interfered in the elections. But in the House, Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has also criticized Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper for presenting the committee with a different take on Russia\u2019s hacking activities than the CIA assessment saying the Kremlin interfered to help Trump win. The committee \u201chas an urgent need to accurately understand the current IC assessment of alleged Russian cyberactivities relating to the election, and any disagreements among IC components,\u201d Nunes wrote in a letter to Capper on Monday. In a separate statement Monday, Nunes also said that he \u201cdo[es] not see any benefit in opening further investigations.\u201d But so far, those committees haven\u2019t made any of their current information public, and may not do so if they broaden their reach. [ Secret CIA asseessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win the White House ] Top avoid such a situation, Senate Democrats \u2014 including Feinstein -- have called for an independent commission of experts, appointed by congressional leaders, to investigate the charges. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also supports that idea in which both sides would have subpoena power. Such a committee would be structured like the Sept. 11 commission, with both parties\u2019 leaders appointing one to two non-lawmakers to sit on it. The president would not be allowed to appoint panel members, a courtesy often extended during the creation of other commissions, as Democrats believe Trump would have a conflict of interest because of the nature of the charges. Democrats want a report made public 18 months after such a panel begins its work. McConnell, Ryan, and other committee leaders \u2013 including Trump\u2019s most vocal critics on the Hill \u2013 have been dodging direct questions about whether they believe the CIA\u2019s assessment that President Vladi\u00admir Putin, who Trump frequently praised during the campaign, was behind the hacks the CIA believes were intended to help Trump prevail. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has said \u201cthere\u2019s very little doubt\u201d Russia intervened in the elections and has derided Trump for casting doubt on that conclusion, suggested that in this one instance, maybe the CIA is wrong. \u201cThe CIA has not always been exactly right, to say the least,\u201d he said. In the wake of the CIA allegations, however, McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) joined calls from incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) to initiate a bipartisan probe. For McCain, the election is one part of a larger examination that must focus on national security risks posed by cyber threats, particularly related to the military. Officials already suspect that Russia may have been behind a major email breach at the Pentagon last year. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, has also pledged to dig into the allegations of Russian hacking next year. And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who chairs two subcommittees on the Judiciary and Appropriations committee, has also committed to investigating Russia\u2019s alleged intervention in the elections, as well as other nefarious activities across the globe, including in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

Obama signed the bill at a ceremony on the White House campus flanked by Vice President Joe Biden and key lawmakers. (Dec. 13) AP President Obama signs the 21st Century Cures Act Tuesdayin the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildingin Washington. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama signed a $6.3 billion bill to fund drug treatment, a precision medicine initiative\u00a0and Vice President Biden's signature effort to \"end cancer as we know it.\" In an emotional bill signing ceremony \u2014 likely the last one of this presidency \u2014 Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act in\u00a0a White House auditorium.\u00a0The signing brought full circle Obama's State of the Union challenge to Congress to \"surprise the cynics\" by tackling some of the biggest health priorities facing the country. \"We are bringing to reality the possibility of new breakthroughs to some of the biggest health challenges of our time,\" Obama said. \"We're tackling cancer, brain disease, substance abuse disorders and more, and none of this would have been possible without bipartisan cooperation from both houses of Congress,\" he said, thanking a delegation from Capitol Hill.\u00a0The bill passed the House of Representatives 392 to 26 and the Senate 94 to 5. For Obama, fewer bill-signing ceremonies reflect years of gridlock The bill was a personal project for Biden. The section of the bill allocating $1.8 billion in cancer research funding was named for his son, Beau, whose death from brain cancer in 2015 inspired what the White House called its\u00a0\"Cancer Moonshot.\" \"This bill will literally save lives,\" said a somber Biden. \"Just its mere signing, Mr. President, as you know better than I, gives millions of Americans hope.\" In addition to the added funding, Biden said that the bill would \"fundamentally change the culture of our fight against cancer\" by adding a sense of urgency to the effort. Joe Biden delivers cancer 'moonshot' recommendations The bill also authorized seven years of funding for other health-related initiatives: $1.5 billion for a brain research initiative, $1.4 billion for precision medicine, and $1 billion for substance abuse treatment targeting heroin and opioid addiction. Obama was introduced by David Grubb, a former West Virginia state senator who told first\u00a0met the president in Charleston last year, telling him the story of his daughter Jessie's battle with heroin addiction. She was in recovery then,\u00a0and Grubb was optimistic. But Jessie died this March after being given painkillers following a surgery. \"When I first met them in Charleston, their story was unfortunately more common than we would have liked,\" Obama said. \"I\u00a0think it reflects the power of this issue and how deeply it affects every family in America.\" \"This is an epidemic that can touch anybody \u2014 blue collar, white collar, college students, retirees, kids,\u00a0moms, dads,\" Obama said.

The L.A. City Council settled lawsuits brought by his relatives over the killing. Brendon Glenn lived near the Venice boardwalk and often spent days skateboarding at the skate park before he was shot and killed during an altercation with Los Angeles police. The L.A. City Council settled lawsuits brought by his relatives over the killing. (Mike Costanza) Families devastated by the death of a loved one. Frayed public trust. Frustrated protesters camped outside City Hall. On Tuesday, Los Angeles\u00a0was reminded of another consequence of shootings by police officers: the financial fallout.\u00a0 In a unanimous vote, the City Council agreed to pay more than $8 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the fatal LAPD shootings of three unarmed men. The settlements are among the highest paid by the city for\u00a0\u00a0deadly police shootings in the last decade. Two of the shootings thrust the LAPD into a firestorm of criticism: the spring 2015 killing of Brendon Glenn in Venice\u00a0and the 2011 shooting of Reginald Doucet Jr., a former college football player. Glenn\u2019s family agreed to settle their case for $4 million; Doucet\u2019s, for $1.65 million. The third shooting, which left 35-year-old Sergio Navas\u00a0dead after a car chase that ended in Burbank, drew less public attention but raised questions among some within the LAPD. His family will receive $2.5 million from the city. After Tuesday\u2019s vote, Councilman Paul Koretz called the spate of payouts\u00a0from shootings by officers \u201cvery distressing.\u201d \u201cIt seemed for years that we had a better relationship with the community. We weren\u2019t having fights over whether shootings were in policy or out of policy,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re going in the wrong direction, and it appears that police departments across the country are having the same problem.\u201d Much of the national criticism of police, stirred by a list of controversial shootings,\u00a0has centered on how officers interact with African Americans.\u00a0Two of the men killed in the shootings that were settled Tuesday \u2014\u00a0Glenn and Doucet \u2014 were black, as are\u00a0the officers who shot them. In recent months, the civilian board overseeing the LAPD has directed the department\u00a0to find ways to reduce the number of police shootings by\u00a0 revamping department rules , revising training and emphasizing the use of less-lethal devices. The LAPD declined to comment on the settlements Tuesday. On a series of 12-1 votes, the City Council took the first step toward paying\u00a0the settlements by issuing judgment obligation bonds, a form of tax-exempt borrowing that must be repaid over 10 years. Councilman Mitchell Englander cast the lone vote against that strategy, calling the bonds \u201cone of the worst forms of debt.\u201d \u201cIt is akin to paying for your utilities with a credit card in order to keep cash in your savings account,\u201d Englander said. \u201cIf we cannot pay for our operational costs, then we should be cutting our spending where necessary.\u201d If the council ultimately decides to issue the bonds, it will have to cast another vote next year. City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana, the high-level budget adviser, said the city has previously relied on such borrowing to resolve especially expensive legal cases, such as ones filed in 2007 over allegations of police misconduct at an immigration rally in MacArthur Park. Using the bonds could\u00a0prevent the city from raiding its reserve fund, which is needed in case of an economic downturn, Santana said. The high payout for Glenn\u2019s family comes\u00a0after\u00a0LAPD Chief Charlie\u00a0Beck recommended that the district attorney file criminal charges against the officer \u2014 the first time as chief that he has recommended such charges in a deadly on-duty shooting.\u00a0The Police Commission sided with the chief earlier this year,\u00a0finding the officer\u00a0 violated LAPD rules for using deadly force. The $4-million settlement approved Tuesday\u00a0will be split between Glenn\u2019s mother and 4-year-old son, their attorney said. Charlie Beck has recommended criminal charges against an officer who killed an unarmed homeless man in Venice, marking the first time as chief that Beck has called for charges in a fatal on-duty shooting. LAPD investigators concluded that Brendon Glenn was on his stomach,... Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has recommended criminal charges against an officer who killed an unarmed homeless man in Venice, marking the first time as chief that Beck has called for charges in a fatal on-duty shooting. LAPD investigators concluded that Brendon Glenn was on his stomach,... (Kate Mather) \u201cThere\u2019s just no way to undo this wrong,\u201d said the lawyer, V. James DeSimone. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring someone\u2019s life back.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office is still weighing whether to charge the officer who shot Glenn.\u00a0 Glenn was fatally shot May 5, 2015, during a struggle with police near the  Venice boardwalk. Officer Clifford Proctor told investigators that he opened fire because he saw the 29-year-old\u2019s hand on his partner\u2019s holster and thought he was trying to grab the officer\u2019s gun, according to an LAPD report made public earlier this year. But video from a nearby bar and statements from Proctor\u2019s partner disputed that account, according to the report. The video has not been made public. A memo to City Council members about the case\u00a0offered new details. According to the memo, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times, the video showed Glenn reaching back \u2014\u00a0not for the officer\u2019s gun. The holstered weapon was on the opposite side of the officer\u2019s body that Glenn appeared to be reaching toward, the memo said. In the second case, Navas was shot and killed at the end of a car chase in March 2015.\u00a0Police tried to stop Navas\u00a0after they spotted him speeding in a Mercury\u00a0Sable in Toluca Lake, but investigators said he\u00a0took off toward Burbank. Six minutes later, Navas came to an abrupt halt on National Avenue, a dead-end street. The police SUV stopped alongside the Sable. ruled an officer violated LAPD\u00a0policy \u00a0in fatally shooting an unarmed man in Burbank, his family and their attorney called on prosecutors to file manslaughter\u00a0charges against the cop.

A day after the Los Angeles Police Commission ruled an officer violated LAPD\u00a0policy \u00a0in fatally shooting an unarmed man in Burbank, his family and their attorney called on prosecutors to file manslaughter\u00a0charges against the cop. Flanked by Sergio Navas' parents and the mother of his children, the... (Kate Mather) Officer Brian Van Gorden told investigators he was sitting in the passenger seat when Navas got out, slammed the Sable\u2019s door and turned to face him, according to an LAPD report released earlier this year. Fearing Navas was trying to ambush him, Van Gorden said, he opened fire. The Police Commission agreed with Beck\u2019s conclusion that an officer with similar training and experience \u201cwould not reasonably believe Navas\u2019\u00a0actions presented an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d\u00a0The district attorney\u2019s office is still reviewing the case. The settlement approved Tuesday\u00a0will go to Navas\u2019 parents and children, attorney\u00a0Luis Carrillo\u00a0said. \u201dIt\u2019s some measure of justice,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this will lead to improved training of LAPD officers so that these tragedies will not continue to be repeated.\u201d The third shooting settled by the city Tuesday happened in January 2011, when officers went to Playa Vista to investigate reports of a disturbance and possible theft after a cab driver called police to complain that a customer had walked away without paying his fare.\u00a0Officers found the customer \u2014 Doucet, a 25-year-old athletic trainer and model who had played defensive back at El Camino College and Middle Tennessee State University \u2014 on a sidewalk, naked. Doucet initially cooperated with police and put his hands behind his head as if surrendering, according to a report Beck submitted to the Police Commission. When Officer Aaron Goff tried to handcuff him, however, Doucet balled his hands into fists and broke free from police, the report said. A memorial for Reginald Doucet sits not far from where he was fatally shot by a Los Angeles police officer in January 2011. Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times A memorial for Reginald Doucet sits not far from where he was fatally shot by a Los Angeles police officer in January 2011. A memorial for Reginald Doucet sits not far from where he was fatally shot by a Los Angeles police officer in January 2011. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Two officers chased him to the front door of his apartment building, where Goff told investigators he tried to grab Doucet from behind. Doucet turned and punched the officer, later grabbing the handle of his gun and trying to yank it out of the holster, according to Beck\u2019s report. Police say Doucet continued to punch both officers.\u00a0As they continued to struggle with Doucet, Goff drew his gun and fired. The shooting sparked an outcry from Doucet\u2019s friends and family, who questioned how an unarmed man could have overwhelmed two officers and why police didn\u2019t try to use a Taser\u00a0to subdue him. Police commissioners determined Goff was justified in using deadly force . The district attorney\u2019s office declined to charge the officer, saying he acted lawfully to defend himself and his partner. Lawsuits related to the shooting\u00a0have wound their way through court in recent years.\u00a0This fall,\u00a0a\u00a0jury sided with Doucet\u2019s family, according to one of their attorneys. The settlement was reached before the panel could weigh potential damages. A memo to council members cited the jury\u2019s initial finding, saying the case was settled out of concern that a\u00a0\u201clarge damage award was forthcoming.\u201d The settlement\u00a0will go to Doucet\u2019s daughter, who is now 8 years old, said her attorney, Brian Dunn. He said the money will give her some financial security and\u00a0a good education \u2014\u00a0\u201cthings that any father would want for his child.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really not a sense of victory, because you can\u2019t ever feel like you won something when someone died,\u201d Dunn said.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t bring that person back.

Opponents predicted that it would be found unconstitutional, a concern Kasich shared. Ohio lawmakers still have the option to override his veto. Doing so would require a three-fifths majority of each chamber. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, pictured in September, indicated he believed the abortion 'heartbeat' bill was unconstitutional. Carolyn Kaster / AP Kasich, an abortion-rights opponent, chose instead to sign off on a 20-week ban similar to those now in effect in 15 states and blocked from enforcement in two others. The measures are based on the assertion that fetuses can feel pain then. Opponents have challenged the \"pain-capable\" characterization as scientifically unsound. Ohio lawmakers rejected a Democratic amendment that would have added exceptions for rape and incest. Republican lawmakers in numerous states \u2014 including Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky \u2014 plan to push for new anti-abortion legislation. Their efforts are being supported by a national anti-abortion group, Americans United for Life, which released a report Tuesday contending that many abortion clinics are in violation of state health and safety standards. In Congress, Republicans are expected to advance legislation banning most abortions after 20 weeks and halting federal funding for Planned Parenthood as long as it performs abortions. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to support both measures. Associated Press ",

The likely confirmation fight could be an early test of Trump's sway over Congress, and demonstrate how much appetite there is among Republicans to stand up to their president. For now, three Republican senators have publicly voiced concerns about the Tillerson nomination: Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida. All have cited the Exxon Mobil executive's history of making deals in Russia and his close ties with Vladimir Putin , which include opposing sanctions sought by the U.S. and Europe against Russia after it invaded Crimea. However, none of the three has said thus far that he will oppose Tillerson. And only Rubio sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing in early January to consider the nomination. \"While Rex Tillerson is a respected businessman, I have serious concerns about his nomination. The next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity, is free of potential conflicts of interest, has a clear sense of America's interests, and will be a forceful advocate for America's foreign policy goals,\" Rubio said. \"I will do my part to ensure he receives a full and fair but also thorough hearing.\" Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. The committee currently has 10 Republican and 9 Democratic members, meaning Tillerson needs support from every Republican to get a successful committee vote, presuming Democrats all oppose him. Yet even if the panel rejects him, there is precedent for the full Senate to take up his nomination. The Senate will be divided 52-48 next year in favor of the Republicans, meaning Tillerson could lose only two Republicans if all Democrats voted \"No.\" That scenario would produce a 50-50 split and require a tie-breaking vote from Mike Pence, who by then will be the new vice president. It's also possible, though, that Tillerson could garner support from one or more of the moderate Democrats. The last time the Senate rejected a presidential Cabinet pick was in 1989 when it voted down John Tower as George H.W. Bush's defense secretary after he had already been rejected by the Armed Services committee. More frequently, nominees have withdrawn from consideration when opposition built, as happened in 2009 with Tom Daschle , President Barack Obama's first pick for Health and Human Services secretary. It was unclear Tuesday whether the fight over Tillerson would turn into a major brawl in the Senate or just a minor skirmish. One question is how hard Democrats, who've made clear they want to focus on economic issues, will fight. Several issued statements Tuesday angrily denouncing the nomination, but the Democrats' incoming leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, was more measured, pointing to Tillerson's Russia ties and calling for a thorough and lengthy confirmation hearing \"given these serious concerns.\" Donald Trump 's choice to lead the State Department , has close ties to Russia through years of deal-making that will serve as valuable experience \u2014 but also raise concerns. Tillerson has claimed to have a \"very close relationship\" with Russian President... ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump 's choice to lead the State Department , has close ties to Russia through years of deal-making that will serve as valuable experience \u2014 but also raise concerns. Tillerson has claimed to have a \"very close relationship\" with Russian President... (Tribune news services) Tillerson immediately picked up support from the top two Senate Republicans, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. McConnell praised Tillerson's \"decades of experience\" and concluded: \"I look forward to supporting his nomination.\" The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, who was himself passed over for the job at State, also issued a favorable statement, though without saying how he planned to vote. Several other GOP committee members issued statements praising Tillerson or sounding open to his nomination. Still others were taking a wait-and-see approach, including Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who said: \"Congress has the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent and we will rigorously exercise it.\" For congressional Republicans and Trump, a major question hanging over their emerging relationship is what steps Trump may take to keep party members in line, and how Republicans will respond in turn. Few GOP lawmakers, especially those up for re-election, want to be on the receiving end of a critical tweet from Trump. The Tillerson confirmation may offer clues to how that dynamic will play out throughout Trump's administration, including when Trump takes policy stances contrary to GOP dogma, such as pushing for stiff tariffs on imports or a massive infrastructure bill. Electoral considerations may already be playing into lawmakers' posture toward Trump. GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, was one of the most outspoken Republicans against Trump ahead of the election, including challenging him to his face during a Capitol Hill visit in July.

By Juliet Eilperin and Steven Mufson December 13 at 4:29 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @StevenMufson Former Texas governor Rick Perry has been picked to head the Energy Department. Here's what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rick Perry to head the Energy Department, said two people familiar with the decision, seeking to put the former Texas governor in control of an agency whose name he forgot during a presidential debate even as he vowed to abolish it. Perry, who ran for president in the past two election cycles, is likely to shift the department away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels, whose production he championed while serving as governor for 14 years. The Energy Department was central to the 2011 gaffe that helped end his first presidential bid. Declaring that he wanted to eliminate three federal agencies during a primary debate in Michigan, Perry then froze after mentioning the Commerce and Education departments. \u201cThe third one, I can\u2019t. Sorry. Oops.\u201d [ Trump taps Montana congressman Ryan Zinke, who frequently votes against environmentalists, as Interior secretary ] Later during the debate, Perry offered: \u201cBy the way, that was the Department of Energy I was reaching for a while ago.\u201d Speaking to reporters once the event was over, he said, \u201cThe bottom line is I may have forgotten energy, but I haven\u2019t forgotten my conservative principles, and that\u2019s what this campaign is really going to be about.\u201d Despite its name, most of the Energy Department\u2019s budget is devoted to maintaining the nation\u2019s stockpile of nuclear warheads and to cleaning up nuclear waste at sites left by military weapons programs. The department runs the nation\u2019s national laboratories, sets appliance standards and hands out grants and loan guarantees for basic research, solar cells, capturing carbon dioxide from coal combustion and more. Four years after his first Oval Office bid, the former governor\u00a0sought it once again in the big Republican field that included Trump. Perry touted the high rate of job growth and the low tax rate his state enjoyed under his leadership. At one point, he dismissed Trump\u2019s campaign as a \u201cbarking carnival act.\u201d [ What Rick Perry\u2019s wink says about his own art of the deal ] The child of a cotton farmer and county commissioner from west Texas, Perry immersed himself in politics from a young age. He was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature but switched to the GOP when he ran for Texas agriculture commissioner. As governor, he recruited out-of-state firms to Texas. In 2013, he starred in an ad that aired in California in which he declared that companies should visit his home state \u201cand see why our low taxes, sensible regulations and fair legal system are just the thing to get your business moving. To Texas.\u201d Salo Zelermyer, who served as a senior counsel at the Energy Department\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office under President George W. Bush and is now a partner at the Bracewell law firm, said Perry has proven \u201cit is indeed possible to successfully balance appropriate environmental regulations with domestic energy production and use.\u201d \u201cDuring his time in office, Perry embodied the type of \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach to U.S. energy production that many have advocated on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Zelermyer said. \u201cRick Perry\u2019s Texas was not only a world leader in oil and gas production; it was also a global leader in wind power and renewable energy investment. This approach is a big reason Texas experienced such enormous job growth during Perry\u2019s tenure.\u201d [ Trump says \u2018nobody really knows\u2019 if climate change is real ] But environmentalists take a dim view of Perry. The former governor has repeatedly questioned scientific findings that\u00a0human activity is helping drive climate change. In 2011 during a presidential debate, he compared the minority of scientists who challenged this assumption to 17th-century astronomer Galileo , who was persecuted by the Catholic Church after suggesting that the Earth revolved around the Sun, rather than the reverse. \u201cThe science is not settled on this. The idea that we would put Americans\u2019 economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that\u2019s not settled yet to me is just nonsense,\u201d Perry said at the time. \u201cJust because you have a group of scientists who stood up and said here is the fact. Galileo got outvoted for a spell.\u201d In his 2010 book, \u201c Fed Up! \u201d Perry described the science showing that climate change was underway and caused by humans as a \u201ccontrived phony mess,\u201d writing that those who embraced this idea \u201cknow that we have been experiencing a cooling trend, that the complexities of the global atmosphere have often eluded the most sophisticated scientists, and that draconian policies with dire economic effects based on so-called science may not stand the test of time.\u201d [ Yes, Trump met with Al Gore. But his transition tells a very different climate story ] \u201cAl Gore is a prophet all right, a false prophet of a secular carbon cult, and now even moderate Democrats aren\u2019t buying it,\u201d he added, referring to the former vice president and environmentalist. Gore met with Trump recently to discuss climate change. Later, during the 2012 presidential campaign, Perry said, \u201cThere are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.\u201d In fact, the top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880. The 2014 summary report for policymakers by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was endorsed by officials from nearly 200 countries, stated,\u00a0\u201cHuman influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic [human caused] emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history.\u201d [ Trump has picked the most conservative EPA leader since 1981. This one will face much less resistance. ] \u201cThere is no doubt that Rick Perry is completely unfit to run an agency he sought to eliminate \u2014 and couldn\u2019t even name. Perry is a climate change denier, opposes renewable energy even as it has boomed in Texas, and doesn\u2019t even believe CO2 is a pollutant,\u201d League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said in a statement. \u201cNot only that, he is deep in the pocket of Big Polluters, who have contributed over $2.5 million to his presidential campaigns, a disturbing sign that they expected him to protect their profits in office, not do what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d Bill Richardson, who was energy secretary under President Clinton, said that Perry was a deal maker, political presence and good manager, and therefore a \u201csensible choice.\u201d\u00a0 But he said that \u201cmy big concern is that he\u2019s too tied to the fossil fuel industry and because of Donald Trump\u2019s positions he will try to dismantle the very valuable renewable energy and climate change programs and policies that are a huge part of the DOE.\u201d Wind power did expand under Perry during his tenure in Texas \u2014 from 200 megawatts in 2000 to 14,098 megawatts in 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association \u2014 and he supported the construction of transmission lines nearly a decade ago that helped bring wind-generated electricity to market. \u201cHe created an environment conducive to economic investment through robust infrastructure and competitive power markets that allowed new technologies to enter,\u201d said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the American Wind Energy Association, in a statement. \u201cThe Texas model under Gov. Perry\u2019s leadership enabled the growth of low-cost wind energy that made the grid more diverse and reliable while saving consumers money.\u201d [ Energy Dept. rejects Trump\u2019s request to name climate change workers, who remain worried ] \u201cThe fact that Gov. Perry refuses to accept the broad scientific consensus on climate change calls into question his fitness to head up a science-based agency like DOE,\u201d said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. But, he added, as governor Perry \u201cincreased the ambition of the state\u2019s Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a \u2018Competitive Renewable Energy Zone\u2019 that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.\u201d However during a 2015\u00a0Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines, the former governor said he opposed extending\u00a0the federal tax credit for wind power. \u201cI do if a state wants to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t at the federal level. I think all of these need to be looked at, whether it\u2019s oil and gas, whether it\u2019s the wind side, whether it\u2019s the [Renewable Fuel Standard program] \u2014 I think all of them need to be put on the table, prove whether or not these are in fact in the best interest of this country.\u201d Referring to renewable sources, Jennifer Layke, the World Resources Institute energy program director, said: \u201cThe Department of Energy leads essential programs that drive innovation and fill important gaps to get new technologies off the ground. These are vital to keep the U.S. at the frontier of energy technology. In recent years, the Department of Energy has given U.S. businesses a significant boost to accelerate the development of battery storage, solar panels and electric vehicles. These programs must continue.\u201d Perry sits on the board of Energy Transfer Partners , the firm that is trying to complete work on the Dakota Access Pipeline on the Great Plains. Under President Obama, the Army Corps of Engineers recently decided to withhold a key permit from the company that is needed to finish the oil pipeline. The pipeline has drawn protests from activists who say that segment of the pipeline would disturb American Indian burial grounds and pollute the drinking water of the nearby Indian reservation. The Energy Department has not played a role in that decision-making process, however, and Trump has indicated he would allow the project to move forward once he takes office. [ DOE leaders refuse to identify specific climate change employees for Trump transition team ] The Energy Department Perry would take over has changed substantially since its creation in 1977 under President Carter on the heels of the oil crisis that struck after the Arab countries of OPEC imposed an embargo on the United States. In the 1970s, the agency focused on weapons maintenance and regulations. In the 1980s, nuclear weapons research took center stage. In the 1990s, arms control and anti-proliferation took priority. But the last two secretaries, physicists Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, have moved laboratories and other\u00a0 energy programs toward finding ways to slow climate change. The much derided loan and loan guarantee program \u2014 which stumbled with a half billion loss linked to solar panel maker Solyndra \u2014 has as of September had issued $31.98 billion in loans and loan guarantees for 30 projects, which have leveraged $50 billion in total project investment and created or saved 56,000 jobs. More than $1.65 billion in interest payments have already been paid. Moniz also used his knowledge of physics and nuclear weapons, and the department\u2019s national laboratories to play a key role in talks aimed at limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Perry brings lacks that knowledge. If\u00a0confirmed, Perry would walk into an agency where many career civil servants are likely to be wary of him, not only because of his past pledge to abolish the department. Employees there are already on edge, given the fact that Trump\u2019s transition team gave a questionnaire to DOE officials asking that they identify which employees have worked on either international climate negotiations or domestic initiatives to cut carbon. Current DOE leaders have declined to provide any individual names of employees to Trump transition team members. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration needed to resist \u201cwhat certainly could have been an attempt to target civil servants, career federal government employees\u2026 who are critical to success of the federal government\u2019s ability to make policy, and their work transcends the term of any one president. That\u2019s by design.\u201d \u201cOur principle\u2013this is principle that presidents of both parties have long abided by\u2013is that we should observe the protections that are in place, that ensure that career civil servants are evaluated based on merit, and not on politics,\u201d Earnest added, before tweaking Trump for his latest Cabinet pick. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure the president-elect used the same kind of criteria when choosing his new Department of Energy Secretary as well. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d Dan Balz contributed to this report. Read more at Energy & Environment: ",

Perry dropped out of the race and endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz, a fellow Texan. Before he left the race , he denounced Trump's candidacy as \"a cancer on conservatism\" and criticized Trump, himself, as a \"barking carnival act.\" By May, however, as it became clearer that Trump was likely to win the Republican nomination, Perry had retreated from his criticism , saying that \"I will be open to any way I can help\" and that \"I believe that Donald Trump should be our guy.\" Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry smiles Monday as he leaves Trump Tower, where he met with President-elect Donald Trump. AP Perry also ran for president in 2012, which led to a gaffe during a debate in November 2011 in which he forgot that he'd named the Energy Department \u2014 the agency Trump now wants him to head \u2014 as one of three Cabinet departments he'd eliminate . The memory loss became known as Perry's \"oops\" moment. As governor, Perry championed the oil industry , questioning science that shows that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and deriding what he called \"the secular carbon cult.\" At a presidential town hall in 2011 , he said, \"I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.\" Perry is also likely to be questioned during confirmation hearings about the Dakota Access Pipeline. He serves on the board of directors of Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the controversial project near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The Obama administration recently denied part of the pipeline that would run beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the tribe, meaning the project is temporarily on hold .

A team of scientists now believe they have solved the mystery of the exact cause and nature of the fog. Buzz60 A deer looks out into fog before sunrise at Richmond park in south west London on Nov. 29, 2016. (Photo: JUSTIN TALLIS, AFP/Getty Images) LONDON \u2014 The decades-old\u00a0mystery of what caused a killer fog that claimed the lives of\u00a0thousands of people here\u00a0appears to have been solved by a team of international scientists. The Great Smog, which blanketed the British capital for five days in December 1952, is estimated by some experts to have killed more than 12,000 people and hospitalized 150,000. Thousands of animals also died. During a cold snap on Dec. 5 that year, sulphur particles mixed with fumes from burning coal\u00a0and made the yellow fog smell like rotten eggs. Some Londoners reported being unable to see their feet, and\u00a0transportation was canceled with the exception of the London Underground. Birds flew into buildings, and robberies increased as thieves were able to make an easy getaway. The smog eventually lifted on Dec. 9, after cold winds swept the fumes out to the North Sea. The incident eventually led to the Clean Air Act of 1956, restricting the burning of coal in urban areas in the United Kingdom. A team of scientists now believe they have solved the mystery of the exact cause and nature of the fog, through lab\u00a0experiments and measuring the atmosphere\u00a0in China, which is home to 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world. Their work was published in\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cPeople have known that sulfate was a big contributor to the fog, and sulfuric acid particles were formed from sulfur dioxide released by coal burning for residential use and power plants, and other means,\u201d lead author Renyi Zhang, a scientist at\u00a0Texas A&M University, said in a statement. \u201cBut how sulfur dioxide was turned into sulfuric acid was unclear. Our results showed that this process was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning, and occurred initially on natural fog.\u201d The study said that similar conditions often occur in China. \u201cThe difference in China is that the haze starts from much smaller nanoparticles, and the sulfate formation process is only possible with ammonia to neutralize the particles,\u201d Zhang said. He said sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants in China, while nitrogen dioxide comes\u00a0from power plants and vehicles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and vehicles. \u201cAgain, the right chemical processes have to interplay for the deadly haze to occur in China. Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral,\u201d he added. 7599 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 60 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hBpQvm ",

    "text": "Dec 12 2016, 9:15 pm ET Why the CIA Thinks Russia Wanted Trump to Win by Ken Dilanian and Pete Williams Share President-Elect Trump Rejects Analysis of Russia Behind Election Hacks 2:39 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161214024504if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/831297091937\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> In the weeks after Donald Trump was elected president, CIA analysts who work on Russia updated their assessment about Russian cyber meddling. They previously had assessed that Russia was trying to undermine the U.S. presidential election, but after Nov. 8 they came to believe that Russian interference was ultimately designed to help Trump win. Related: CIA Concludes Russia Mounted Hacks to Help Trump Win This latest finding fed an already blazing public dispute between the U.S. intelligence agencies and the president-elect over Russian interference in the election. \"I don't believe it,\" Trump said in an interview broadcast Sunday on Fox News, disputing the notion that the Russians wanted to help him. \"I think it's ridiculous.\" Play Donald Trump dismisses claims that Russia interfered in 2016 election 3:33 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161214024504if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/829781571807\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump and his aides reject not just the CIA's updated assessment about Russian intentions, but the earlier consensus reached by all 17 agencies, and released in a rare joint public statement by the heads of the DHS and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, that Russia was meddling in the election in the first place. The seriousness of the gulf can hardly be overstated: many foreign policy experts and lawmakers believe Russia's behavior was an attack on the nation. One former CIA leader, Hillary Clinton supporter Michael Morell, likened Russia's intrusion into U.S. politics Friday to \"the political equivalent of 9/11.\" Related: U.S. Intel Agencies Prepping Dossier to Prove Russian Hacks In fact, the CIA's latest take is not the unanimous view of the intelligence community. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, had enough confidence to relay the CIA's assessment to Congress in a secret briefing last week. But no similar assessment has leaked from any of the other 16 intelligence agencies. The FBI, for its part, assesses that Russia's main goal was to sow chaos and undermine American democracy, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News. Helping Trump served that purpose, the official said, but Russia didn't expect Trump to win the election.

Instead, it was the result of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial evidence more detailed than anything the public has seen. Human sources, communications intercepts and other intelligence have allowed analysts to piece together the identities of some of the players, and the steps they took to hurt Clinton's candidacy while boosting Trump's, officials said. The CIA also noted that while Russian hackers gathered information on Republicans, they didn't release any of it, the way they did with Democratic emails leaked to WikiLeaks. The Republican National Committee denies its systems were hacked, but the emails of individual Republicans were collected \u2014 something NBC News reported in October . Related: Trump Was Told Russia to Blame for Hacks Long Before First Debate The FBI believes the Russians didn't find anything explosive in the Republican material they obtained, the official said, although it's not clear whether any U.S. agency knows the full extent of what data Russian hackers were able to steal. The CIA also tracked a campaign of anti-Clinton news stories amplified by social media, some of which originated with Russian state media outlets, officials told NBC News.

Other intelligence agencies have not endorsed the CIA view, but no entity is known to oppose it. However, the question of motive \u2014 why the Russians allegedly meddled in the election \u2014 is entirely separate from the more basic question of whether the U.S. has strong evidence that the Russian government sponsored the covert campaign. On that score, every intelligence agency in the government agrees: The Russians did it. Related: Russia Hack of U.S. Politics Includes Republicans In October, DNI Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued an extraordinary joint statement that \"the U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\" One source familiar with the intelligence said it included profiles of some of the suspects with pictures, and could lead to eventual indictments of specific Russian actors, if the Justice Department decides to pursue them. The evidence on that score simply doesn't support Trump's recent comments that \"It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" That is why the two Trump supporters who lead the Congressional intelligence committees, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California, have each issued statements in recent days expressing concern about Russian hacking.

Nunes said Friday that \"Russia's cyber attacks are no surprise to the House Intelligence Committee, which has been closely monitoring Russia's belligerence for years.\" On Monday, the top Republicans in Congress \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 each issued statements pledging to investigate Russian meddling in the election. Related: Intelligence Agencies Distressed by Trump's Rejection of Findings on Russia Ryan called Russia \"an aggressor,\" and McConnell made a point of saying he has \"the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially the Central Intelligence Agency.\" On Monday, Sen. John McCain of Arizona renewed his call for a bipartisan hearing, but said he didn't believe Russians were trying to engineer a Trump victory: \"That's the reason we need a full investigation, but I have seen no evidence of that.\" It's unclear whether Trump has been briefed on the same evidence top Republicans have seen, because he has had only a handful of intelligence briefings since the election. Trump not only said he didn't believe the intelligence community's assessment \u2014 he suggested that the CIA was not to be believed in general, issuing a statement Friday night noting that \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Related: Mitch McConnell Condemns Russian Breaches of U.S. Political Organizations Several intelligence officials told NBC News they were deeply disturbed by that statement. There is no historical precedent for a president-elect publicly maligning the intelligence agencies he is about to lead. One big question now is how Trump's pick as CIA director, Mike Pompeo, will bridge the acrimonious gap between his boss and the agency he leads. President Obama does not intend to make it easy on Trump: He has ordered that a dossier be assembled on the evidence about the Russian covert operation. A senior Obama administration official told NBC News that portions of that will be made public before January 20. Related: Hackers Target Election Systems in 20 States Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC News that can't happen soon enough. The way to thwart Russian information campaigns is to publicize them, he said. He warned, though, that the U.S. Is not going to be able offer the sort of proof many skeptics are demanding. \"If you provide proof, you provide a roadmap to show the Russians how we caught them,\" he said, \"including intelligence sources and methods.\" Ken Dilanian ",
