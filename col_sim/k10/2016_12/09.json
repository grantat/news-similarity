Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the dangers of the promulgation of fake news on Thursday after conspiracy stories involving her campaign spurred violence recently. \"The epidemic of malicious fake news and fake propaganda that flooded social media over the past year, it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences,\" Clinton said. Man Fires Rifle Inside D.C. Pizzeria, Cites Fictitious Conspiracy Theories She was referring to the \"Pizzagate\" incident in D.C. this weekend, which came to a terrifying head. A man believing a fake news story that Clinton and her aides were running a child sex ring out of a D.C. pizzeria entered the restaurant Sunday and fired a gun; no one was injured. \"This isn't about politics or partisanship \u2014 lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days, to do their jobs, contribute to their communities,\" Clinton said in a speech at the Capitol where she and other lawmakers were honoring retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Other businesses around Comet Ping Pong have also received threats after conspiracy theories were peddled online, including by Infowars' Alex Jones, whom President-elect Donald Trump has praised. Abdel Hammad, owner of neighboring Besta Pizza, said he has also received threats amid allegations his business is also involved in child trafficking, and he told NPR member station WAMU that even though he voted for Trump, he is now rethinking that decision. Article continues after sponsorship Radio Conspiracy Theorist Claims Ear Of Trump, Pushes 'Pizzagate' Fictions \"It's a danger that must be addressed, and addressed quickly,\" Clinton continued. \"Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda, and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news. It's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives.\" The pointed comments from Clinton came amid a rare public appearance for the former nominee over the past month since she lost the election. At the outset of her speech, she made a joking nod to her reclusiveness. \"This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be giving after the election, but after a few weeks of taking selfies in the woods, I thought it would be a good idea to come out,\" she said, laughing.

Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, center, flanked by his attorney Nathan J. Hochman, left, and wife Carol Chiang, as he arrives at federal court this week for his obstruction of justice trial. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Joel Rubin and Victoria Kim Contact Reporters It\u2019s a tried and true technique of prosecutors to go after low-level criminals and turn them against their bosses. In federal court Thursday, a onetime Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy took the witness stand in the case against his former top boss: retired\u00a0Sheriff Lee Baca . Mickey Manzo, who now works at a Home Depot, said he was testifying in exchange for a potential reduction of the 24-month sentence he received in 2014 when he was convicted, along\u00a0with\u00a0five others, of\u00a0taking part in a plot to thwart an FBI investigation into abuse and corruption in the sheriff-run county jails. Manzo is expected to start serving his sentence early next year. Through Manzo and other witnesses, prosecutors are attempting to establish that Baca was personally aware of and involved in the events of the summer of 2011, when they allege the sheriff and his subordinates conspired to obstruct federal authorities. A lawyer for Baca told jurors this week that the evidence does not connect the former top lawman to any crimes committed by the rank-and-file deputies and pinned the blame on former Undersheriff Paul Tanaka , who has also been convicted in the case and sentenced to a five-year prison term. Manzo recounted from the witness stand the steps he took after deputies found a cellphone on an inmate at Men\u2019s Central Jail, who they discovered was feeding information to the civil rights squad at\u00a0the FBI office in Los Angeles. Manzo testified that he was ordered by a lieutenant to interview the inmate and to record the conversation, so that the lieutenant could play the tape for \u201cthe executives.\u201d \u201cWho did you understand the executives to mean?\u201d Assistant U.S. Atty. Brandon Fox asked. \u201cThe sheriff and the undersheriff,\u201d Manzo responded. When the recording was played at a meeting the following morning, Manzo recalled Tanaka becoming\u00a0enraged over the FBI\u2019s investigation.\u00a0Baca, he said, was not openly angry but did give a clear set of orders to the\u00a0group of subordinates before departing. The sheriff ordered that the inmate was to be \u201cisolated and protected\u201d and that the group should\u00a0learn \u201ceverything about the FBI investigation,\u201d Manzo testified. Speaking clearly and confidently, Manzo said Baca was kept in the loop as sheriff\u2019s officials tried to interfere with the FBI.\u00a0 After a sheriff\u2019s deputy did not adhere to an order from Tanaka restricting visits to the inmate and allowed FBI agents into the jail to speak with the man, Manzo said he watched as his supervisor\u00a0nervously walked into Baca\u2019s office to alert him of the mistake. Manzo testified that his supervisor later said Baca had not been upset by the news \u2014\u00a0a description defense attorneys indicated they will home\u00a0in on when they cross-examine Manzo on Friday. Throughout Manzo\u2019s testimony, Fox played audio excerpts from\u00a0the many interviews sheriff\u2019s officials conducted with the inmate informant as they tried to decipher what the FBI was investigating. While Baca was not present for the interviews and\u00a0is\u00a0never mentioned, Fox hopes jurors will conclude he had set the operation in motion and was guiding it. Earlier on Thursday, jurors heard from Bob Olmsted, a retired Sheriff\u2019s Department commander and an early whistleblower about problems with excessive force in county jails.\u00a0 Olmsted, who unsuccessfully ran to replace Baca after the sheriff announced his retirement in 2014,\u00a0testified that he spoke to Baca three times to alert the sheriff about \u201csignificant problems and force issues\u201d at Men\u2019s Central Jail in 2010 and 2011.\u00a0Baca brushed him off and never gave him a chance to fully lay out his concerns, Olmsted told jurors. \u201cThe force issues that are going on are out of control,\u201d Olmsted said he cautioned Baca in a 10-minute meeting in the sheriff's office. \u201cThere are going to be lawsuits like crazy.\u201d Under cross-examination by a defense attorney, Olmsted said Tanaka had told him of ambitions\u00a0to \u201cone day be sheriff and be sheriff for the next 15 years,\u201d and that the undersheriff and other department\u00a0brass sometimes colluded to keep Baca in the dark about goings-on in the department.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Many Oakland warehouse fire questions are still unanswered , how will Hollywood speak to Trump\u2019s America , meet Wilbur Ross, the man Trump has tapped him to lead the U.S. Department of Commerce , and the\u00a0 L.A.

    "text": "(Anna M. Phillips, Jack Dolan and Paige St. John) City spokeswoman Karen Boyd explained the discrepancy Thursday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear until later that there were two properties and that the inspector\u2019s inability to gain access referred to the lot, not the warehouse building,\u201d she said. Questions about the competence of Oakland\u2019s building inspection agency arose five years ago.\u00a0An Alameda County Grand Jury in 2011 released a scathing report accusing the city\u2019s building services division of mismanagement and having haphazard policies about conducting building inspections. The grand jury found that agency was riddled with \u201cpoor management, lack of leadership, and ambiguous policies and procedures.\u201d It added that the agency had inconsistent standards on code violations and that the violation notices sent to property owners were late and hard to understand. In addition, inspectors treated property owners in an \u201cunprofessional, retaliatory and intimidating\u201d manner. Schaaf, who was a city councilwoman at the time of that report,\u00a0said many of those concerns were quickly addressed, and she noted that the city also has been criticized in the past for being too aggressive with building code inspections. The Ghost Ship warehouse was\u00a0owned by\u00a0Oakland resident Chor N. Ng\u2019s trust and zoned exclusively for commercial use.\u00a0It housed an artists\u00a0collective and, according to former residents and those who frequented the building, had\u00a0unpermitted\u00a0living quarters inside and hosted concerts and other events. The catastrophic fire appears to have triggered a wave of warehouse inspections by Oakland code enforcers. Inspectors were sent to the addresses of five warehouses allegedly used as alternative housing. Most of the properties had records of past\u00a0complaints that included blighted conditions, unpermitted work\u00a0and illegal squatting. By Thursday, public records show, one of those properties had been cited for unspecified violations. The other buildings\u00a0include a 6,600-square-foot warehouse on Oakland\u2019s west end industrial center that local residents call \u201cDeath Trap\u201d \u2014\u00a0a label they said a city inspector used when inside the building in 2011. The records show the Magnolia Street property, built in 1925 and zoned for industrial use, was the subject of repeated complaints and investigations in 2011. It\u00a0had alleged alterations without permits, graffiti, trash and debris\u00a0and \u201csubstandard\u201d housing. The case regarding the blight complaints was closed in September 2011 when the property was cleaned up.\u00a0However, a housing habitability complaint remained open until January 2014 when it was closed as \u201cunable to verify.\u201d Building inspectors had not been inside Oakland warehouse in 30 years, officials say The city's planning and building department only goes into buildings when the owner seeks a permit or if officials receive a complaint. \u00a0 The city's planning and building department only goes into buildings when the owner seeks a permit or if officials receive a complaint. \u00a0 See more videos A new inspection was conducted Thursday after the city Fire Department filed a complaint. Oakland records show another warehouse blocks away also was listed for inspection Monday. On Wednesday the 1,000-square-foot building, a single-story green structure built in 1930, was found in violation of housing codes. A violation notice was mailed to the owner on Thursday. The property, last zoned to house a hydroponics office, was cited twice in 2015 for illegal habitation, including a complaint of \u201c20 squatters occupying the site.\u201d \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 , Al Gore might have gotten played, \u00a0 South Korean lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, \u00a0and the American Dream is more elusive than ever, a study finds .

    "text": "By Karoun Demirjian December 8 at 6:55 PM Follow @karoun Congress is doubling down on promises to investigate Russia, after President-elect Donald Trump dismisses evidence that Russia was involved. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Leading\u00a0Senate Republicans are preparing to launch a coordinated and wide-ranging probe into\u00a0Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the U.S. elections and its potential cyberthreats to the\u00a0military, digging deep into\u00a0what they view as corrosive interference in the nation\u2019s\u00a0institutions. Such an aggressive approach puts them on a direct collision course with President-elect Donald Trump, who downplays the possibility \u00a0Russia had any role in the November elections\u00a0\u2014 arguing that a hack of the Democratic National Committee emails\u00a0may have been perpetrated by \u201csome guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d The fracture could become more prominent\u00a0after Trump is inaugurated and begins setting\u00a0foreign policy. He has already indicated the country should \u201cget along\u201d with Russia since the two nations have many common strategic goals. But some of Trump\u2019s would-be Republican allies on Capitol Hill disagree. Senate Armed Services Chair John McCain (Ariz.) is readying a probe of possible Russian cyber incursions into U.S. weapons systems, and said he has been discussing the issue with\u00a0Select Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (N.C.) with whom he will be \u201cworking closely\u201d to investigate Russia\u2019s suspected interference in the U.S. elections, cyber threats to the military and other institutions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been apprised of the discussions.\u00a0Burr did not respond to requests for comment. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman\u00a0Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)\u00a0also said he intends to hold hearings next year into alleged Russian hacking. Corker is on Trump\u2019s shortlist for secretary of state, according to the Trump transition team. Trump transition officials could not be reached for comment. The loudest GOP calls for a Russia probe are coming from McCain and Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham (S.C.). Both have taken a hard line on Russia and have been highly\u00a0critical of Trump, particularly his\u00a0praise of President Vladimir Putin. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election, amongst claims that Donald Trump's rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \u201cThey\u2019ll keep doing more here until they pay a price,\u201d Graham said of Russia. He\u00a0plans to spearhead legislation and\u00a0hold a series of investigative hearings next year into \u201cRussia\u2019s misadventures throughout the world,\u201d including\u00a0Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. [ Republican lawmakers move to restrain Trump on Russia ] \u201cI\u2019m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia. I think they\u2019re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections and I want Putin personally to pay the price,\u201d Graham said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. McCain said his Armed Services Committee will launch a probe in the 115th Congress into Russia\u2019s cyber capabilities against the U.S. military and weapons systems,\u00a0\u201cbecause the real threat is cyber,\u201d he explained. But McCain said he expects the investigation will also dovetail with the topic of Russia\u2019s suspected hacking of the DNC and state-based election systems \u2014 which include a hack that took place in McCain\u2019s home state of Arizona. \u201cSee, the problem with hacking is that if they\u2019re able to disrupt elections, then it\u2019s a national security issue, obviously,\u201d McCain said Thursday. He added that the Armed Services Committee was \u201cstill formulating\u201d exactly how to address the issue during hearings. But despite Trump\u2019s dismissal, McCain said that \u201cthere\u2019s very little doubt\u201d Russia interfered in the U.S. elections, which he called \u201cvery worthy of examination.\u201d The U.S. government in October officially accused Russia of hacking the DNC\u2019s emails during the presidential campaign. The emails were posted on web sites like WikiLeaks, and caused embarrassment for the party, including forcing the resignation of the DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.). And U.S. military officials\u00a0officials are concerned about Russia\u2019s capacity to steal military secrets and corrupt operations: Officials already suspect Russian hackers are behind a major email breach at the Pentagon last year. And the military could be a target for backlash, after an NBC News report widely circulated by Russian media stated U.S. military hackers were ready to launch cyberattacks against Russia in the event of an obvious election hack. Trump continued to downplay Russian involvement in the elections\u00a0in an \u00a0interview released this week for\u00a0Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d feature. In the interview,\u00a0the president-elect disputed the Obama administration\u2019s accusation that Russia interfered in the election. [ U.S. government officially accuses Russia of interfering with elections ] \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.\u201d Some Republicans delicately demurred, while still defending Trump\u2019s ability to negotiate with Putin. \u201cThe Democratic National Committee \u2026 the intelligence community is of pretty much one mind that Russia was involved in that, was behind that,\u201d Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said in an MSNBC interview. King is a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and chairman of the Homeland Security subcommittee on intelligence and counter-terrorism. King added that he was \u201cconfident\u201d Trump \u201cwill not be taken in by Putin.\u201d Democrats have also taken issue with Trump\u2019s desire to pursue more friendly relations with Moscow, as well as his affinity for Putin. \u201cThe primary area of discomfort for the Republicans here and the Trump administration, in foreign policy and national security, is over Russia,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, who accused Trump of becoming \u201ca propaganda piece for the Kremlin\u201d on MSNBC this week.\u00a0\u201cThey may be giving him breathing space right now, but I don\u2019t expect that to last.\u201d Since\u00a0the election, Republican lawmakers have\u00a0voted to reestablish a U.S. hard line against Russia\u2019s global ventures, with a House-passed measure to\u00a0sanction anyone who supports the Syrian government in its ongoing civil war \u2013 a category that primarily includes Russia and Iran. There is also language\u00a0in the annual defense policy bill to provide millions of dollars in lethal aid to Ukraine, where the government in Kiev is engaged in open hostilities against Russian-backed separatists. But many Democrats are impatient with Republicans for not taking faster and more concrete steps against Russia after\u00a0the Obama administration\u00a0 officially accused Moscow of meddling in the elections. Corker expressed early interest in holding hearings on Russia. But months later, those hearings have not been held. \u201cWe\u2019re getting no pressure from anyone \u2013 we just feel like it\u2019s something we should do,\u201d Corker said in an interview Wednesday, when asked if there president-elect had pressured him not to raise the topic. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we attempted to set a classified briefing up this week.\u201d Obama administration officials maintain that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other officials were ready to brief senators about Russia\u2019s suspected role in the DNC hack on Thursday. Administration officials said that at the last minute, the committee dramatically broadened the scope of the hearing, forcing them to cancel. A spokeswoman for Corker said the hearing was postponed because State Department officials were unavailable due to previous travel commitments. She\u00a0added that Corker and Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, received a classified briefing on cyber threats prior to the election. Corker pledged on Wednesday that hearings investigating Russia\u2019s role in the elections would be forthcoming next year. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to look at it,\u201d he said. An aggressive probe of Russia\u2019s activities may not extend to the House, where leading Republicans say they have already been investigating Russia and will continue their efforts\u00a0regardless of Trump\u2019s stance. \u201c[Russia]\u2019s always been a priority for me and it will remain a priority for me,\u201d House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said. The House Armed Services Committee Mac Thornberry stressed that his committee has been looking at Russian cyber threats to the military for the last two years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to all pay more attention to cyber and to Russian activities to influence things through cyber,\u201d Thornberry said. Democrats, meanwhile, are going to use whatever power they have to ensure that suspected Russian activities in the elections and beyond get attention. Seven top-ranked Democrats sent a letter to President Obama on Tuesday asking for classified briefings \u201cregarding Russian entities\u2019 hacking of American political organizations,\u201d including the\u00a0DNC hack, emails released by WikiLeaks and fake news. \u201cRegardless of whether you voted for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else, Russia\u2019s attacks on our election are an attempt to degrade our democracy and should chill every American \u2013 Democratic, Republican, or Independent \u2013 to the core,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings,\u00a0the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Relations Committee. powerpost ",

Osorio / Chicago Tribune A new rule for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will require retailers authorized to accept food stamp benefits to offer a wider variety of healthy food. Retailers will have to stock at least seven varieties in the fruits and vegetables category, for example. A new rule for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will require retailers authorized to accept food stamp benefits to offer a wider variety of healthy food. Retailers will have to stock at least seven varieties in the fruits and vegetables category, for example. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Greg Trotter Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune For the foreseeable future, pizza will continue to count as a staple food item in the federal food stamp program. In a compromise with political and business interests, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has scaled back its new rule requiring stores participating in the federal food stamp program to carry a greater number of healthy food items. Once the law goes into effect, the more than 265,000 retailers authorized to accept food stamp benefits \u2014 including many corner stores in Chicago's poorest neighborhoods \u2014 still will be required to carry a greater variety of healthy food, though not as many items as originally proposed. The final rule filed Thursday by the USDA Food and Nutrition Services, the agency that manages the $74 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , requires 84 food items \u2014 half of the 168-item mandate that had been proposed, though still a significant increase from the current minimum of 12. Other provisions of the proposed rule were eliminated altogether, including one that excluded items with multiple ingredients, such as pizza or chicken pot pie, from counting as a staple food item. And another provision that would have excluded retailers from the food stamp program if they had more than 15 percent of food sales coming from food that's cooked or heated on premise was essentially scrapped and replaced with a more specific threshold intended to close a loophole in the law. Englewood resident on healthy food in corner stores Lee Smith, a 28-year-old Englewood resident who has diabetes, embraces the idea of healthier food in corner stores. Lee Smith, a 28-year-old Englewood resident who has diabetes, embraces the idea of healthier food in corner stores. See more videos The final rule represents an attempt to balance the goal of increasing access to healthy food alongside concerns that small stores in low-income rural and urban areas wouldn't be able to comply, said Kevin Concannon, USDA undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. \"These are very implementable changes that are long overdue. ... This is a way of nudging access (to healthy food) in the right direction,\" Concannon said in a phone interview Thursday with a handful of reporters. Concannon called the final rule on \"a step forward\" that will have the most positive impact in small convenience stores in low-income communities with limited access to healthy food. More than 1.9 million people in Illinois receive SNAP benefits via Link cards, the modern version of food stamps. The vast majority of purchases made with SNAP benefits, more than 80 percent, are made at large grocery stores and supermarkets that will have no problems with the new rule because they already comply. But many owners and operators of small stores felt that the changes initially proposed would be too onerous because of limited space and other constraints. ",

GALLAGHER Dec 8, 2016, 3:29 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Second Officer Dies From Shooting in Georgia 0 Shares Email The Georgia Southwestern State University police officer who was critically injured Wednesday while responding to a domestic dispute call has died from his injuries -- one of two officers killed in the incident, the university announced. \u201cWe have just received word that GSW Public Safety Officer Jody Smith has succumbed to his injuries and has passed away,\" said Georgia Southwestern State University Interim President Charles Patterson. \"We offer our deepest condolences to his family during this very difficult time. Officer Smith was a bright, young and energetic officer, and he will be sorely missed.\u201d Americus Police Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr, 25, also was killed in the incident. Courtesy Georgia Bureau of Invesitgation Americus Police Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr, 25, died after he was shot while responding to a domestic dispute call on Wednesday morning. \"It's a tragedy beyond words,\" Americus Police Department Chief Mark Scott said of the shooting. \"It's one of our family members [who] has been taken from us.\" Smith had been with the Georgia Southwestern State University Police Department since August, the university said. In a statement, the university commended Smith for showing \"extreme bravery in the line of duty as he responded to a call for backup.\" Smith was enthusiastic about joining the department since it offered him an opportunity to pursue a college degree while working in law enforcement, according to the university. The man who allegedly shot the two police officers in Georgia is now dead, police said. After a manhunt that lasted more than 24 hours, police said they received a tip Thursday morning that the suspect, identified as 32-year-old Minquell Kennedy Lembrick, was inside a residence on Allen Street in the city of Americus. Officers heard a gunshot while setting up a security perimeter around the home before attempting to enter. They opened the house door with a robot and found Lembrick inside, dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police. AP This undated photo released by the Americus Police Department shows Minguell Kennedy. Scott said the tip came from someone who was near the property where the suspect was found. Lembrick's precise location after the shooting and up until he was found dead remains unknown, Scott said. \"The caller actually knew the gentleman and was there when he came to the house,\" the police chief told reporters at a press conference Thursday afternoon. Investigators said Lembrick was wanted in connection to a shooting that happened Wednesday morning around 9:40 a.m. local time at an apartment complex in Americus, near the Georgia Southwestern State University campus. Officers Smarr and Smith were simultaneously responding to a 911 call regarding a domestic dispute at the complex on South Lee Street when they encountered the suspect and shots were fired, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Scott said the slain officer was wearing a police body camera during the shooting, but the footage will not be released at this time. The two officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, but it's unknown whether Lembrick was also struck. The man remained at large and was considered to be armed and dangerous until Thursday afternoon when authorities confirmed his death. Prior to Wednesday's domestic dispute call, police said Lembrick was wanted on kidnapping charges and others from a previous domestic incident. ABC News' Brandon Baur, Darren Reynolds, Devin Villacis and Jason Volack contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Donald Trump's EPA Pick Has Repeatedly Challenged the Agency By Meghan Keneally Dec 8, 2016, 4:49 PM ET 0 Shares Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images WATCH President-elect Trump Picks Scott Pruitt to Head EPA 0 Shares Email The selection of Scott Pruitt as Donald Trump 's choice to lead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has raised concerns among some scientists and people who\u2019ve worked with the EPA. Pruitt, the Republican attorney general for Oklahoma since 2011, has interacted most directly with the EPA by suing it over what he sees as over-reaching federal regulations. Some scientists have also questioned his fitness to run the environmental agency considering he has publicly stated that he believes the debate over the cause of global warming is \u201cfar from settled.\u201d His nomination to now lead the agency is akin to putting \"someone in charge of the Defense Department who doesn't believe we should have a military, or someone in charge of the Transportation Department who doesn't like roads,\" said Dan Kanninen, a former White House liaison at the EPA. But Pruitt, 48, appears to pride himself on his work against the EPA, describing himself as a \"leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda\" in his biography on the official Oklahoma state website. \u201cI am deeply grateful and honored to serve as President-elect Trump\u2019s EPA Administrator,\u201d Pruitt said in in a Trump transition team statement today announcing his selection, which requires Senate approval. \"The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses.\u201d Here is where he falls on some of the issues: He Believes the Global Warming Debate Is Unsettled Pruitt co-authored a May op-ed piece for the National Review, a conservative publication, saying \"global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time,\" but \"that debate is far from settled.\" \"Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind,\" the article reads. But the vast majority of scientists in this field disagree, according to multiple studies cited by NASA. It says those studies claim 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that \u201cclimate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.\u201d Rob Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, told ABC News that it should come as no surprise that Trump's EPA pick has \"an anti-regulation\" stance, but that shouldn't automatically rule out established science\u2019s conclusion that mankind is contributing to global warming. \"The greatest concern that I have and that a lot of scientists have in response to this is the fact that this individual seems to have an anti-science agenda as well, and one can acknowledge the role that humans are playing in changing the chemistry of our atmosphere and changing the temperature on the planet and still disagree about what you do about it, and that's a policy discussion,\" Young said. Oklahoma Joined a Challenge to the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan Pruitt and his office this year helped prepare a lawsuit, which included other states and was led by the West Virginia solicitor general, in which the plaintiffs are fighting the EPA to stop its plan to reduce power plant carbon dioxide emissions (the Clean Power Plan). \"This administration continues to treat states as mere vessels of federal will, abusing and disrespecting the vertical separation of powers defined by our Constitution,\u201d Pruitt said after a day of hearings in the West Virginia v. EPA case in September. \u201cThat is why attorneys general, senators and congressmen from across the country have joined together today to maintain rule of law and checks and balances in this very process. I am committed to ensuring the ultimate payer in this matter is not overlooked \u2013 the consumers.\u201d This position is in keeping with his overarching commitment as Oklahoma attorney general to eliminate what he calls \u201cunwarranted regulation and overreach by the federal government,\u201d according to his biography on the state website. The case, West Virginia v. EPA, is still open and ongoing in the D.C. Court of Appeals. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt arrives at Trump Tower in New York, Dec. 7, 2016. Oklahoma\u2019s Own Lawsuit Was Dismissed Pruitt had filed a similar lawsuit pre-emptively last year trying to stop the EPA from enforcing the same Clean Power Plan, saying it exceeded the agency\u2019s authority and was already doing \"irreparable harm\" to Oklahoma. \"Whether the State of Oklahoma adopts a state plan to meet EPA\u2019s goals or EPA promulgates a federal implementation plan, the EPA Power Plan forces the State of Oklahoma to undertake substantial legislative, regulatory, planning, and other activities,\" the suit alleged. The case was dismissed in July 2015 and the appeal was dismissed in September 2015, according to the court docket. He Supports the Keystone XL Pipeline Pruitt released a statement in May saying the controversial pipeline would \"continue to create jobs\" and slammed President Obama and his administration for \"continu[ing] to interfere with the completion of the pipeline.\" \"The president\u2019s own State Department has concluded, after years of study, that the pipeline will do little to directly harm the environment or increase greenhouse gas emissions, so his actions to prohibit the pipeline are solely an attempt to place his 'legacy' and political ambition above our country\u2019s ability to move closer to energy independence,\" Pruitt said in a statement . He Has Ties to the Oil and Gas Industry Beyond taking a public stance against the EPA and raising doubts about the scientifically established cause of global warming, Pruitt has financial alliances to the oil and gas industry that trouble some opponents. The connection largely comes from the various oil and natural gas extraction projects that are underway in Oklahoma, which have come under scrutiny amid the rise in fracking and earthquakes in the landlocked state. While defenders of the projects argue that the increase in earthquakes is unrelated to fracking, Young, of Western Carolina University, says that when water released in the process is forced back into the ground, it frequently plays a major factor in causing earthquakes. J Pat Carter/Getty Images Oil field workers pull pipes from a fracking well, March 31, 2016, near, Crescent, Oklahoma. The New York Times reported on Pruitt's ties to oil and gas in 2014 when it claimed that a letter from Pruitt to the EPA that was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, an oil and gas company based in Oklahoma. In response to the Times report, Pruitt provided a statement to Oklahoma station KFOR : \"The article did not accurately reflect what motivates my service and how we seek to make decisions on advancing these cases,\" the statement read. \"Our responsibility is to protect Oklahoma\u2019s interest when any federal agency seeks to displace the authority granted to the state under federal law. This administration has given us plenty of opportunity to litigate those matters in regards to energy, the environment, and health care and that is what is driving us, nothing more or nothing less.\" \"It should come as no surprise that I am working diligently with Oklahoma energy companies, the people of Oklahoma and the majority of attorneys general to fight the unlawful overreach of the EPA and other federal agencies,\" the letter read. Kanninen, who has worked in several Democratic political positions, including his time at the Obama White House and working as a Wisconsin state director for Obama's campaign during the 2008 election, said Pruitt \"is someone who has been in the belly of the oil and gas industry; that\u2019s where he comes from.\" \"He's well known as an antagonist to the environmental community. Someone who's repeatedly taken the side of the oil and gas industry,\" Kanninen said. Campaign finance records show that Pruitt received $5,000 in contributions from the Koch Industries PAC during his 2010 campaign for attorney general, and BP donated $500. He also received contributions from the Marathon Oil Company Employee's PAC for $1,000, the Chevron Employees PAC for $1,000 and the OGE Energy Corp. Employee's PAC for $3,500, according to Oklahoma state records. Trump, however, praised Pruitt's work and said in a statement announcing his pick that Pruitt would \"reverse this trend\" of how he alleges the EPA spends \"taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs, while also undermining our incredible farmers and many other businesses and industries at every turn.\" 0 Shares ",

Puzder, who heads the California-based CKE Restaurants, has been a strong proponent of rolling back regulations within the restaurant industry. He has also argued against the Affordable Care Act and raising the federal minimum wage, insisting that doing so would diminish job opportunities. Trump, in a statement, applauded Puzder as someone whose \"extensive record fighting for workers makes him the ideal candidate to lead the Department of Labor.\" Puzder said, in a statement, that he believes \"the right government policies can result in more jobs and better wages for the American worker.\" CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder speaks at a news conference on Aug. 6, 2014, in Austin, Texas. Jack Plunkett / AP Images for Carl's Jr. Puzder, 66, has served as a senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign. And like his fellow businessman, Puzder hasn't been afraid to offend or take on controversial positions. He has flirted with the idea of replacing some fast-food employees with robots to combat rising minimum wages. Related: Trump's Cabinet Picks Have a Combined Wealth of $14.5B In March, he told Business Insider : \"They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.\" He has also fiercely defended controversial ads for Carl's Jr. that have featured women in bikinis eating burgers in a suggestive manner. \"I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it's very American,\" Puzder told Entrepreneur last year. \"I used to hear, brands take on the personality of the CEO. And I rarely thought that was true, but I think this one, in this case, it kind of did take on my personality.\" Puzder frequently praised Trump during the campaign, calling him a \"pragmatic centrist.\" Play ",

The former military intelligence officer told \u201c CBS This Morning \u201d co-host Norah O\u2019Donnell that she has no ill will against Petraeus, but just wants to move on with her life and career.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been strongly advised to not talk to the press, and I understand that. Sometimes it\u2019s better to remain silent. I\u2019ve had that philosophy for the last five years,\u201d Broadwell said. \u201cBut I \u2013 I\u2019ve reached a point where I feel like, \u2018You know what? I need to fight back for my life.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou want to move on,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d Broadwell said.\u00a0 David Petraeus' biographer Paula Broadwell speaks out about \"double standard\" But moving on has been difficult for Paula Broadwell.\u00a0 Broadwell and Petraeus admitted to an extramarital affair in 2012. Prosecutors found that Petraeus mishandled classified information while Broadwell was writing his biography \u201cAll In.\u201d\u00a0 Petraeus pleaded guilty last year in federal court to \u201cunauthorized removal and retention of classified documents.\u201d He was fined $100,000 and remains on probation. Broadwell was never criminally charged. \u201cDo you think he should be allowed to serve in a top-level post in the Trump administration?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cNorah, I think he\u2019s unequally qualified for many positions, but that\u2019s not my position to say. I think the president-elect would have to decide and members of the Senate,\u201d Broadwell said. \u201cAs I woke up to the news, you know, it was a bit of a shocker that he was being considered for a Cabinet position, and I was -- I was both shocked that I\u2019m still in this tenuous position, and yet happy because I think he should be able to go on with his life. He\u2019s earned it, and so should his family. But then it begged the question of, \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t I be able to go on?\u2019\u201d She served 21 years in the U.S. military and 13 years in the Army Reserves. After the affair, she was demoted from lieutenant colonel to major, lost her top secret security clearance and recently received a formal reprimand. Petraeus found out in January that he won\u2019t face any military discipline. \u201cWhat is your status now with the U.S. Army?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cI am waiting for my resignation paperwork to be approved,\u201d Broadwell said. Paula Broadwell on the impact of her \"massive mistake\" \u201cAnd when do you expect that to happen?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cWell, I\u2019d love a Merry Christmas present,\u201d Broadwell said, laughing. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know... I thought earlier this year when David Petraeus was pardoned, for lack of a better word, that I would hear something soon. And so, it\u2019s 10 months later and I\u2019m hopeful that the end is here.\u201d\u00a0 What she really wants is equality, she said. While Petraeus has seen new opportunities, Broadwell said she\u2019s been denied them, including a position at a prominent bank.\u00a0 \u201cSo I think I was qualified for this position. But I was told by the military recruiter that it would be front page news if I got hired at the bank, and the bank wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that,\u201d Broadwell said. \u201cIf the bank hired Paula Broadwell?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cExactly. And I realized that\u2019s probably true, but it was hard to stomach at the time,\u201d Broadwell said. \u201cI have a degree from the University of Denver in international conflict resolution. I have a degree from Harvard in public policy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a West Point graduate,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\u00a0 \u201cI went to West Point undergraduate. Sometimes I try to forget those days, but I\u2019m also very proud of it and it\u2019s shaped the person I am,\u201d Broadwell said. \u201cIt\u2019s shaped me into a fighter, which is why I\u2019m fighting to take back my own narrative and my life. But I also believe, on principle, I\u2019ve got something to offer the world and I\u2019m not a benchwarmer. That\u2019s not my personality. Put me in, coach.\u201d Senators from both parties have expressed support for Broadwell. Democrat Claire McCaskill told the political website The Hill, \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be two standards.\u201d Republican Lindsey Graham has been a vocal supporter of Petraeus. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t convicted of anything. No one\u2019s ever brought charges against her. I think she should be treated fairly in terms of, you know, what they did,\u201d Graham said. Still, Broadwell said the uncertainty over her future has made for some very difficult years.\u00a0 \u201cWhat has this been like for your family?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked. \u201cWell, they\u2019ve been incredibly supportive, and I frankly owe my life to my husband and my children. They know I made a mistake and that it hurt daddy. And what I talk about with them is that when you make a mistake, you acknowledge it. Yet you don\u2019t dwell on it. And you need to move forward at some point,\u201d Broadwell said. \u201cSo we apply that mantra in pretty much everything in our household.\u201d \u201cBut have you been able to move forward professionally?\u201d O\u2019Donnell asked.\u00a0 \u201cNot on the path that I had planned for myself or hoped for. But I\u2019m hopeful, Norah. I think -- I think time heals everything. And I -- you know, I\u2019m wiser now. I\u2019m humbler now\u2026 But I\u2019m always proud to be an optimist,\u201d Broadwell said. Broadwell said the Justice Department has notified her it doesn\u2019t intend to file criminal charges. Before CBS News learned of her military reprimand, the Army sent us a statement, saying it evaluates \u201call allegations of misconduct on a case-by-case basis, and determines what type of disciplinary or administrative action is appropriate in a particular case based on the facts and circumstances of that case.\u201d\u00a0 Broadwell founded an organization called the Think Broader Foundation to target what she sees as social and gender bias in the media. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "CBS News Dec 8, 2016 7:18 PM EST The remarkable thing is that in November, we had widespread record warm across nearly all North America. At the same time, major cold and snow descended on Siberia and Russia, reports CBS Boston chief meteorologist Eric Fisher. Now all that air that was cooking in the dark and the cold is moving across the Pole and heading right into the spots that were warmest last month. It\u2019s a complete 180 degree change in the pattern. How cold are we talking? Low temperatures, certainly subzero in the Plains, the 20s all the way down to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia Thursday night. By Saturday morning, we could be seeing 20s all the way down to North Florida and freeze warnings will likely be needed there.\u00a0 At the same time, another winter storm is moving to the Northwest, and this one isn\u2019t just bringing mountain snow, but lowland snow. We\u2019re getting snowfall into the cities of Seattle and Portland Thursday evening. As we look toward next week, there\u2019s another blast of cold and it might be even colder than what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u00a0 Freezing Arctic air heading for much of U.S. The dangerously cold weather that\u2019s been blowing across the country this week turned deadly on Thursday, CBS News\u2019 Omar Villafranca reports. Blinding snowstorms caused major pileups in the Midwest. A snow squall and slick roads are being blamed for the deadly pileup of mangled cars, trucks and eighteen-wheelers. Three people were killed and 11 people injured after dozens of vehicles careened off of Michigan\u2019s I-96 just north of Lansing . A pile-up caused by inclement weather on Dec. 7, 2016. Close CBS News Three hundred miles east in Lake County, Ohio, another pileup, with \u00a0as many as 50 vehicles occurred after a truck jack-knifed due to icy road conditions.\u00a0 Farther east in upstate New York, the moving system dropped nearly 17 inches of thick, sticky, lake-effect snow an hour north of Syracuse, New York. Roads quickly became treacherous, testing the skills of any driver who dared to get behind the wheel. Wintry weather moved across the country on Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016. Close CBS News North Dakota residents are still cleaning up after the one-two punch of snow and howling wind tore through the state. Icy roads were too slippery for even the toughest four-wheelers. Dan Boschee\u2019s truck slid into a ditch, but luckily his dad Reed showed up to pull him back on track. Tim Kunz of Ace 24-hour towing starting working earlier this week pulling dozens of cars and even Big Rig trucks off of the roads around Bismarck. \u201cThe ones that are empty, winds pushes the trailer off, and they get jack-knifed and stuck,\u201d Kunz said.\u00a0 Since Monday, tow trucks have pulled roughly 400 stranded or damaged vehicles into this yard alone. They expect to stay busy because there is more snow and sub-zero temperatures in the forecast. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

USA TODAY Sports Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott (21) prior to the game against the Baltimore Ravens at AT&T; Stadium. (Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) 8 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE With each passing day, it becomes less likely the NFL will resolve its investigation into domestic violence allegations against Dallas Cowboys star Ezekiel Elliott and potentially impose discipline before the season ends. But the league says the NFL calendar isn\u2019t a factor in the timeline on such probes. Speaking generally in an email to USA TODAY Sports on Thursday, league spokesman Brian McCarthy wrote: \u201cIf any investigation indicates a violation of the personal conduct policy, the player or club employee would be held accountable once the entire process is completed. The timing of an investigation and disposition of a case is not contingent on the football season.\u201d In other words, there is no rush to make a ruling on Elliott, whose attorney issued a statement demanding the NFL drop its case Nov. 1 \u2013 one day after USA TODAY Sports reported the lead attorney who investigated a woman\u2019s claims that Elliott abused her five times in July believes there were a series of violent interactions between the two. NFL sought information on Florida incident allegedly involving Ezekiel Elliott The Columbus (Ohio) City Attorney\u2019s Office announced Sept. 6 it would not pursue criminal charges against Elliott, citing conflicting and inconsistent information across all incidents. But the NFL has the authority to impose discipline absent criminal charges \u201cif the credible evidence establishes that you engaged in conduct prohibited\u201d by the personal conduct policy, which specifically bans \u201cactual or threatened physical violence against another person.\u201d The league says its investigation of Elliott remains active and ongoing. Even once that process is complete, there are several more steps under the policy \u2013 all of which make it increasingly unlikely to affect Elliott\u2019s availability as the 11-1 Cowboys continue their push for a No. 1 seed and deep playoff run behind Elliott, the NFL\u2019s leading rusher. \u201cEmployees who are subject to discipline will be given notice of the potential violation for which discipline may be imposed,\u201d the policy says. \u201cThe employee will be furnished with the records and other reports that the disciplinary officer has relied on in addressing the matter, including records from law enforcement and a copy of any investigatory report and any documents relied upon by a league investigator in generating the report. \u201cThe employee will be permitted to submit information in writing to rebut or otherwise respond to the report. In addition, the employee will have the opportunity to meet with the investigator and disciplinary officer in advance of discipline being imposed. \u2026 Once the record is complete, the disciplinary officer will issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for as well as the amount and nature of the discipline to be imposed.\u201d Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott's accuser also alleged there was incident in Florida If disciplined, Elliott also would have the right to appeal and almost surely would do so, given his repeated proclamations of innocence. Last month, USA TODAY Sports reported the same woman called police on Elliott in February in Florida, alleging she suffered left shoulder pain after Elliott \u2013 then training for the NFL Draft, in which the Cowboys drafted him No. 4 overall \u2013 shoved her up against a wall during an argument that turned physical. No charges were filed in that case either. But it could be considered an aggravating factor if the league decides to discipline him for the July allegations. Authorities in Florida and Ohio have told USA TODAY Sports that NFL investigators reached out to request information on the case. Elliott was interviewed, too. And an email from an NFL investigator to the Aventura (Fla.) Police Department indicates Elliott\u2019s accuser has cooperated with the league\u2019s investigation. USA TODAY Sports does not name alleged victims of domestic violence. Follow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero . ",

    "text": "'Rogue' GOP Elector Says Others Will Join in Opposing Trump By ROBIN GRADISON Dec 8, 2016, 5:18 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH House Republican Criticizes Donald Trump Over Potential Business Conflicts of Interest 0 Shares Email Meet one of the real 538 electors, Christopher Suprun a Republican from Texas. Suprun has decided to vote for someone other than Donald Trump when he casts his electoral college vote later this month. He believes other electors are right there with him. \"At this point there are people who have reached out to me. Again it wouldn\u2019t be my place to name who they are,\" he said, though he indicated he was talking about Republican electors. \"I am confident in saying, at this point,\" he continued,\"I don\u2019t think I will be the only one voting for someone other than Donald Trump who is carrying a Republican elector seat.\" Suprun told Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein on the Powerhouse Politics Podcast that he is not sure which former candidate will earn the vote since his choice, Ohio Governor John Kasich , has said he is not interested. \"As electors come forward, and I have had conversations with other Republican electors in particular, I think we will start discussing names specifically and see who meets the test that we could all get behind,\" he said. \"The point of this isn\u2019t just to go down and raise a little ruckus it is to vote for the person we think would best be able to hold the position.\" Suprun says he has received both positive and negative reactions. On the positive side are people who say his actions restore their faith in the country. On the other side he has \"received several twitter threats directly.\" \"I have been told that this type of action leads to insurrection, which I think is unfortunate,\" Suprun said. \"There has been some backlash. Unfortunately there are some Trump backers who think violence is the answer.\" Suprun had been a Trump supporter but said he \"started having very serious doubts two weeks ago when on the Sunday talk shows Mr. Trump started talking about a phantom three million illegal votes, where he was attacking members of the press for exercising their first amendment rights.\" \"I think he is the only candidate I am aware of who ever asked a foreign country to hack his political opponent\u2019s e mail account to find out what is in them, which I consider almost an invitation to espionage. We know he has been a demagogue. He has not attempted to unite the country. Even when Time Magazine made him their Person Of The Year they called him 'President of the Divided States of America.' And, finally, most objectively, he seems to have financial conflicts of interest which he won\u2019t resolve.\" Suprun said he is in favor of an electoral college, but doesn\u2019t think it should be \"a rubber stamp.\" As he wrote in his recent New York Times article, he believes his actions fall squarely in the Hamiltonian tradition. He wrote that \"the United States was set up as a republic. Alexander Hamilton provided a blueprint for states' votes. Federalist 68 argued that an Electoral College should determine if candidates are qualified, not engaged in demagogy, and independent from foreign influence.\" 0 Shares ",

The quake\u00a0occurred about 100 miles\u00a0off the coast of Eureka, near the Oregon border, about 6:50 a.m. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The quake was about 6.2 miles deep,  according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which issued no tsunami warnings in connection with the temblor. According to USGS mapping, the quake, while strong, did not produce violent shaking on land. The morning jolt was followed by another quake. A magnitude 5.0 temblor hit at 8:32 a.m.\u00a0 about 108 miles west of Ferndale, which is fewer than 20 miles south of Eureka.\u00a0 There were no reports of damage in the communities of Fortuna\u00a0or Ferndale, Fortuna Police Lt. Matthew Eberhardt told The Times.\u00a0 \u201cThe radio is quiet,\u201d he said. Eberhardt said he felt the quake while getting ready for his shift Thursday morning. \u201cIt kind of felt like a rolling than a jerking,\u201d he said. Your Basic Guide to Earthquakes Earthquakes occur all over the world, mostly around plate edges, on faults. Here are three things to keep in mind to ensure safety in an earthquake. Earthquakes occur all over the world, mostly around plate edges, on faults. Here are three things to keep in mind to ensure safety in an earthquake. Cities along the northern coast\u00a0also reported the shaking. \u201cNice shaker,\u201d Eureka Police Chief Andrew Mills said . \u201cNo damage reports, no #tsunami.\u201d The quake off Eureka\u00a0was felt from southern Oregon south into the Bay Area. It was also felt inland in the Sacramento Valley, the USGS said. By 8 a.m., nearly 2,000 people reported feeling the quake with light shaking, according to the USGS \u201cDid You Feel It? map. Soon after the quake, Bay Area residents took to social media to report the shaking. Some residents said they were rattled from their sleep. Bay Area Rapid Transit trains ran 10 minutes slower and at reduced speeds in San Francisco because of \u201c seismic activity .\u201d The north coast of California is one of the state\u2019s most seismically active areas, regularly producing major earthquakes.\u00a0There had been other smaller quakes in the area in recent days. In January 2010, a\u00a06.5 quake hit the area, snapping power lines, toppling chimneys, knocking down traffic signals, shattering windows and prompting the evacuation of at least one apartment building. But in 2014,\u00a0a\u00a06.9 earthquake in the same area, which, like Thursday\u2019s temblor, was miles off the coast,  did little damage. The north coast sits along the Mendocino Triple Junction, where the Pacific, North American and Juan de Fuca tectonic plates collide. Seismologist Lucy Jones\u00a0 said \u00a0the earthquake early Thursday was on the Pacific-Gorda plate on the end of the San Andreas Fault.\u00a0 Generally, seismologists say, a major quake like this will be followed by numerous smaller aftershocks. Perhaps\u00a0local dairyman Dennis Leonardi\u00a0summed up the quake best in an interview with the\u00a0Ferndale Enterprise. \u201cThe cows were dancing to the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Many Oakland warehouse fire questions are still unanswered , how will Hollywood speak to Trump\u2019s America , meet Wilbur Ross, the man Trump has tapped him to lead the U.S. Department of Commerce , and the\u00a0 L.A.

By Amber Phillips December 7 Follow byamberphillips During the presidential campaign, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) was one of the most passionate and eloquent defenders of House Republicans' multipronged investigations of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's actions as secretary of state. When some accused Republicans of clamoring for investigations of Clinton's emails and family foundation just to undermine her campaign, Ryan reframed the inquiries as a matter of principle: \u201cI think it goes without saying we should treat people fairly. No one should be above the rules, no one should be above the law, and that's what we're looking for, equality,\u201d Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper in a July interview. \u201cSo that people should be held to the same set of standards. That's the problem with Washington, is people think there's self-dealing and they think that everybody is being held to different standards. And the problem is that that's true!\u201d Now that Donald Trump won, those words could come back to haunt Ryan. With each passing day, Trump\u00a0is tangling himself in a\u00a0knot of potential business and family conflicts of interest while he runs the country. That means Republicans in Congress could soon find the tables turned: Democrats clamoring for ethics investigations of the president. And what's more, they'd be able to point to Ryan's own argument \u2014 that no one should be above the law \u2014 to make their case. Donald Trump has a lot of potential conflicts of interest as president \u2013 but there's no law that specifically requires a commander in chief to remove themselves from all of their business interests. The Fix's Peter W. Stevenson explains why presidents usually put their assets in a \"blind trust\" to avoid problems. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) It probably won't surprise you to hear that Ryan is not nearly as bullish on investigating Trump as he was Clinton. He has been repeatedly asked over the past week or two how he feels about Trump's potential for conflicts of interest, and his answer has boiled down to: It's not my problem. \u201cHow do you want him to address his business conflicts?\u201d CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Ryan in an interview Wednesday. Ryan responded: \u201cHowever he wants to. You know, this is not what I'm concerned about in Congress.\u201d When pressed on it again, Ryan said: \u201cI have every bit of confidence he's going to get himself right with moving from being the business guy that he is to the president he's going to become. I'm focused on getting this agenda passed so that we can turn around and tackle this country's big problems before they tackle us. That is what I'm focused on. And not the legal details of how he divorces himself from his business, which I know he will.\u201d In other words: As long as Trump is signing my tax reform and Obamacare repeal bills into law, and there's no legally verified\u00a0conflicts of interest, no problem. [ Paul Ryan says he and Donald Trump are 'fine.' But are they really? ] To some degree, that's politics: You hit the\u00a0opposition when you can, and you duck when they're hitting you, even if it's for arguably the same thing. The problem for Ryan is that Trump is giving no indication that he plans to divorce himself from his business at all, at least not in a way that most government ethics experts think is sufficient to prevent a situation in which Trump could make a decision based on his checkbook. And that means\u00a0accusations of Trump's conflicts of interest probably won't be going away . Presidents have had conflicts of interest before, of course. But most of them have put their assets in a\u00a0blind trust (i.e. NOT in the hands of their family members) to avoid it. As to how this compares with Clinton, those same government watchdog experts questioning Trump's family business setup were also asking questions about how Clinton as president would separate herself from her family's Clinton Foundation . But the Clinton Foundation is a nonprofit. Trump's business is very much for profit, and it very much affects his personal wealth. And that underscores the dilemma Trump could be backing himself (and Hill Republicans) into: We've never before had a president with so many financial interests in so many countries. On top of that, we'll soon have a president who wants to have his family run those interests while simultaneously appearing to advise him on his presidency. Already, Trump's phone call with Taiwan's president was dissected not just for its geopolitical dominoes, but for its effect on his bottom line: Trump apparently considered hotel investments in Taiwan earlier this year. And Ivanka Trump's decision to hold a meeting on climate change with Al Gore (a meeting Trump participated in) raised eyebrows , given that she's supposed to be handling\u00a0her father's financial interests as well. Ryan is allowed to have different opinions on different politicians' potential conflicts of interest; that's politics. But\u00a0brushing off Trump's may not be an option for Ryan for much longer, especially given the\u00a0moral high ground he took when the tables were turned. politics ",

Time Astronaut John Glenn wears a Mercury pressure suit during training for his 1962 space flight. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) John Glenn's death has sparked remembrances of the\u00a0man whose varied life as an astronaut and U.S. senator made him an American icon. But he was more than a risk-taker and statesman. He was better than all of us. Here are some interesting facts about the American hero: He orbited\u00a0the globe more than 100 times Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, would do it more than 100 times. He first circled the globe in 1962, when he went around the world three times and then plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. In a later trip, he would circle the globe another 134 times. He's the oldest person to go into space In 1998, the\u00a077-year-old\u00a0climbed aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest\u00a0person ever to go into space.\u00a0NASA did a number of medical tests on Glenn in preparation for the flight and after the trip. He flew 149 military combat missions Glenn, who got his first taste of\u00a0flying\u00a0as an 8-year-old, flew 149 combat missions in World War II and the Korean War. His plane was hit by enemy fire 12 different times. Some thought his eyes would change shape Posted!

Huh/AP The U.S. surgeon general warns that e-cigarette smoking has the potential to cause young people lasting harm. Nam Y. Huh/AP The U.S. surgeon general said Thursday that e-cigarette use poses a significant and avoidable health risk to young people. \"We already know that e-cigarettes have the potential to cause lasting harm to the health of young users,\" said Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. \"Most contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug that can damage normal development of the brain \u2013 a process that continues until about age 25.\" Murthy's comments were part of a report released Thursday on rising e-cigarette use by people under 25. No, You Can't Vape On Commercial Flights, Transportation Department Says According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , while use of most tobacco products \u2014 such as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \u2014 by high school students has declined in recent years, the use of e-cigarettes increased dramatically between 2011 and 2015. In April, the CDC estimated nearly 2.4 million high school students and about 620,000 middle school students were using e-cigarettes at least once a month. Murthy said advertising was partly to blame, writing in a statement: \"As [e-cigarettes] have been advertised more heavily, they have become much more popular among youth in middle and high school, and among young adults ages 18-25. One of every 6 high school students has used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days, and these products are now more popular with middle and high school students than traditional cigarettes.\" A 2014 survey of 22,000 middle and high school students found children who are exposed to e-cigarette advertising are more likely to use e-cigarettes. The CDC reported earlier this year that spending on e-cigarette advertising rose from $6.4 million in 2011 to an estimated $115 million in 2014. Article continues after sponsorship The surgeon general's report also emphasizes that e-cigarettes can lead young people to use other tobacco products such as cigarettes, potentially as a result of becoming addicted to nicotine. \"Some studies show that non-smoking youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try conventional cigarettes in the future than non-smoking youth who do not use e-cigarettes,\" the report says, and notes that \"among high school students and young adults who use tobacco, more use both e-cigarettes and burned tobacco products than use e-cigarettes alone.\" The Food and Drug Administration tightened regulations on e-cigarettes earlier this year, as we have reported . The new regulations require people to prove they are 18 in order to buy e-cigarettes and require companies to disclose the ingredients in the vapor, and warn consumers if they contain nicotine. FDA Acts To Regulate E-Cigarettes And Cigars For The First Time Unlike regulations on cigarettes and chewing tobacco, the FDA did not ban the targeting of minors in e-cigarette advertisements, or prohibit the sale of candy-flavored vapors that could appeal to children. Another reason young people should refrain from using e-cigarettes is that many the potential health risks of e-cigarettes have not been adequately studied, and so shouldn't be used by people whose brains are still developing, the surgeon general's office argues. Unlike other tobacco products that have been proved to cause potentially lethal health problems, \"scientists are still working to understand more fully the health effects and harmful doses of e-cigarette contents when they are heated and turned into an aerosol,\" the report says. \"Your kids are not an experiment,\" Murthy concludes in an accompanying public service video . \"Protect them from e-cigarettes.\" FDA Issues First Regulations On Electronic Cigarettes FDA Issues First Regulations On Electronic Cigarettes ",

Several crashes also have been reported on Detroit-area freeways. Forecasters say cold air that's moved into the region is boosting conditions for lake-effect snow Thursday. Mid-Michigan is expected to get a few inches and southeastern Michigan, including the Detroit area, could get an inch or less depending on the location. ",

A school district police officer shot the boy Wednesday during a confrontation witnessed by more than 40 classmates at Hug High School in Reno, authorities said. They said the boy got into an altercation with a classmate and began threatening other students with a knife. The boy remained in critical condition Thursday at Renown Medical Center, police told NBC News, which isn't naming him because he's a juvenile. \"There are many questions to be answered as to what happened and what could have been done to avoid the use of lethal force,\" the boy's family said in a statement it released through an attorney Thursday. A Reno, Nevada, police officer stands guard outside Hug High School after a shooting on campus Wednesday. AP \"We believe options were available to law enforcement that were not pursued,\" the family said, adding: \"All matters will be fully investigated and all answers necessary sought out.\" But Traci Davis, superintendent of the Washoe County School District, praised the officer for having acted quickly \"to protect the safety of our students.\" \"I truly believe that the outcome could have been much worse,\" Davis said. School district Police Chief Jason Trevino said the shooting was under investigation by the Reno Police Department, and he cautioned against drawing conclusions from videos circulating on the internet that recorded parts of the episode. The officer was placed on administrative leave pending the investigation. Authorities wouldn't provide any other details about the shooting or about policies governing officers' firing their guns at or around students. Parents wait outside Hug High School after a shooting on campus caused a lockdown Wednesday in Reno, Nevada. Andy Barron / AP But at least one parent said that while it was unfortunate that a child was shot, she was fine with how the confrontation was resolved. \"I was very comfortable with the fact that there's police officers there, because the kids like to fight,\" said the woman, whom NBC News also isn't naming to protect the identity of her 17-year-old son, who attends the school. \"They are there to protect the kids \u2014 which is what he did,\" she said. \"I'm glad the situation got handled the way it did. My kid was right there. He could have been stabbed.\" The U.S. Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics says (PDF) that 43,770 public schools in the United States, including 16,700 public high schools, were staffed with armed officers at least one day a week during the 2013-14 school year, the last term for which complete data are is available.

It was an anxious nation that watched and listened that February morning, as Mr. Glenn, 40 years old, a Marine Corps test pilot and one of the seven original American astronauts, climbed into Friendship 7, the tiny Mercury capsule atop an Atlas rocket rising from the concrete flats of Cape Canaveral in Florida. The Cold War had long stoked fears of nuclear destruction, and the Russians seemed to be winning the contest with their unsettling ascent into outer space. Two Russians, Yuri A. Gagarin and Gherman S. Titov, had already orbited Earth the year before, overshadowing the feats of two Americans, Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom, who had been launched only to the fringes of space. What, people asked with rising urgency, had happened to the United States\u2019 vaunted technology and can-do spirit? Photo John Glenn with the Friendship 7 in 1962. He was hailed as a national hero and a symbol of the space age as the first American to orbit Earth. Credit NASA The answer came at 9:47 a.m. Eastern time, when after weeks of delays the rocket achieved liftoff. It was a short flight, just three orbits. But when Mr. Glenn was safely back, flashing the world a triumphant grin, doubts were replaced by a broad, new faith that the United States could indeed hold its own against the Soviet Union in the Cold War and might someday prevail. No flier since Lindbergh had received such a cheering welcome. Bands played. People cried with relief and joy. Mr. Glenn was invited to the White House by President John F. Kennedy and paraded up Broadway and across the land. A joint meeting of Congress stood and applauded vigorously as Mr. Glenn spoke at the Capitol . Advertisement Continue reading the main story In his political history of the space age, \u201c\u2026The Heavens and the Earth,\u201d the author Walter A. McDougall described Mr. Glenn\u2019s space mission as a \u201cnational catharsis unparalleled.\u201d \u201cIt seemed that he had given Americans back their self-respect,\u201d Mr. McDougall added, \u201cand more than that \u2014 it seemed Americans dared again to hope.\u201d Mr. Glenn was reluctant to talk about himself as a hero. \u201cI figure I\u2019m the same person who grew up in New Concord, Ohio, and went off through the years to participate in a lot of events of importance,\u201d he said in an interview years later. \u201cWhat got a lot of attention, I think, was the tenuous times we thought we were living in back in the Cold War. I don\u2019t think it was about me. All this would have happened to anyone who happened to be selected for that flight.\u201d Mr. Glenn did not return to space for a long time. Kennedy thought him too valuable as a hero to risk losing in an accident. So Mr. Glenn resigned from the astronaut corps in 1964, became an executive in private industry and entered politics, serving four full terms as a Democratic senator from Ohio and in 1984 running unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination. Finally, 36 years after his Mercury flight, in the last months of his final Senate term, he got his wish for a return to orbit. Despite some criticism that his presence on the mission was a political payoff, a waste of money and of doubtful scientific merit, the hero of yesteryear brought out the crowds again, cheering out of nostalgia and enduring respect as he was launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on Oct. 29, 1998. At 77, he became the oldest person to go into space. Photo After weeks of delays, Mr. Glenn climbed into Friendship 7 on Feb. 20, 1962, and at 9:47 a.m. Eastern time, the rocket achieved liftoff. Credit NASA In retirement from the Senate, Mr. Glenn lived with his wife of 73 years, Anna (he always called her Annie), in a suburb of Washington in addition to Columbus. Ohio State University is the repository of papers from his space and political careers. \u201cJohn always had the right stuff,\u201d President Obama said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cinspiring generations of scientists, engineers and astronauts who will take us to Mars and beyond \u2014 not just to visit, but to stay.\u201d The Making of a Hero John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the only son of a railroad conductor who also owned a plumbing business, and the former Clara Sproat. A few years later, the Glenns moved to New Concord, a small town in southeastern Ohio with a population of little more than 1,000. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt was small but had a lot of patriotic feeling and parades on all the national holidays,\u201d Mr. Glenn once said. \u201cWanting to do something for the country was just natural, growing up in a place like New Concord.\u201d Like most everyone else there, the Glenns lived through the hard times of the Depression, instilling in their son a rigid moral code based on their own God-fearing example and saw him through an apple-pie boyhood. He played trumpet, sang in the church choir, washed cars for pocket money and worked as a lifeguard. In high school (now named for him), he was an honor student and lettered in football, basketball and tennis. He still had time to court his high school sweetheart, Anna Margaret Castor, the doctor\u2019s daughter. It did not matter that she stammered; she was his girl, and he loved her. They married in April 1943, and he often called her \u201cthe real rock of the family.\u201d From the time they came to public attention, and throughout the turbulence of spaceflight and politics, John and Anna Glenn each seemed the other\u2019s center of gravity. Not until much later did she undergo intensive therapy that virtually cured her stammer, enabling her even to give speeches in public. Photo Mr. Glenn with President John F. Kennedy and General Leighton I. Davis during a parade in Cocoa Beach, Fla., after his spaceflight. No flier since Charles Lindbergh had received such a cheering welcome. Credit NASA Mr. Glenn is survived by his wife; two children, Carolyn Ann Glenn of St. Paul and John David Glenn of Berkeley, Calif.; and two grandsons, Daniel and Zach Glenn. Mr. Glenn began his journey to fame in World War II. In 1939, he enrolled at Muskingum College in his hometown to study chemistry, but he took flying lessons on the side. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he signed up for the Naval Aviation cadet program and after pilot training opted to join the Marines. As a fighter pilot, he flew 59 combat missions in the Pacific, earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and other decorations. Mr. Glenn saw more action in the Korean War, flying 90 combat missions and winning more medals. He put his life on the line again as a military test pilot in the early days of supersonic flight. In 1957, just months before the Soviet Union launched its first Sputnik satellite, he made the first transcontinental supersonic flight, piloting an F8U-1 Crusader from Los Angeles to New York in record time: 3 hours 23 minutes 8.4 seconds. Then, in 1959, newly promoted to lieutenant colonel, he heeded a call for test pilots to apply to be astronauts for the fledgling National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He and six other pilots were selected in April of that year. (The original Mercury 7 included Mr. Glenn, Mr. Shepard, Mr. Grissom, Walter Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton and Scott Carpenter. Mr. Glenn was the last surviving one.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story All seven men were eager, competitive and ambitious, but none more so than Mr. Glenn. Tom Miller, a retired Marine general and close friend since they were rookie pilots in World War II, recalled that Mr. Glenn was so determined to be an astronaut that he applied weight to his head to compress his height down to the 5-foot-11-inch maximum for the first astronauts. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to miss a trick,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019d be sitting down reading with a big bunch of books sitting on his head.\u201d But his determination did not win him the assignment to be the first American astronaut to fly. He had to wait out the suborbital flights by Mr. Shepard and Mr. Grissom in 1961 before his turn came. Patience, Then Liftoff In his 1999 memoir, written with Nick Taylor, he admitted he was sorely disappointed when Mr. Shepard was tapped for the first flight. As the oldest and most articulate of the astronauts, Mr. Glenn had attracted a big share of the publicity. He said that he had \u201cworked and studied hard dedicating myself to the program\u201d and that he thought he had a \u201cgood shot\u201d at being first. In a letter to a NASA official, Mr. Glenn wrote, \u201cI thought I might have been penalized for speaking out for what I thought was the good of the program.\u201d At this time, as Mr. Glenn often recalled, he never anticipated that his orbital flight would be the one that most excited the public, satisfying the nation\u2019s hunger for a hero. Tom Wolfe wrote of that time in the best-selling 1979 book \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d a phrase for coolness in the face of danger that has passed into the idiom. He described Mr. Glenn as excessively pious, scolding his fellow astronauts about their after-hours escapades while openly lobbying to be the first of them to fly. \u201cHe looked like a balding and slightly tougher version of the cutest-looking freckle-faced country boy you ever saw,\u201d Mr. Wolfe wrote. \u201cHe had a snub nose, light-hazel eyes, reddish-blond hair and a terrific smile.\u201d ",

Back Story Photo Credit The New York Times On this day in 1917, the First World War was entrenched in some of its darkest days. The Allies were in a stalemate on the Western Front, and good news was in short supply.

Until he arrived, the mayor of Jerusalem had been scrambling to find a British official to whom he could cede control. An army cook who got lost while looking for food was initially asked. He declined, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want the city; I want eggs.\u201d _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?

TheStreet's Scott Gamm reports from Wall Street. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 5,  2016.  EPA/ANDREW GOMBERT (Photo: ANDREW GOMBERT, EPA) Wall Street is melting \u2014 \u00a0up! Market meltdowns get more attention, but the U.S. stock market is ripping higher and breaking records. All four major U.S. stock indexes broke out to fresh record highs Thursday, a day after stocks posted their biggest gains since the presidential election. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average (which is up more than 1,400 points since Election Day and is up 12.6% this year), the large-company Standard & Poor's 500, the tech-stock packed Nasdaq\u00a0and small-company Russell 2000 all closed at\u00a0new highs Thursday, a rare event that happened back in November for the first time since 1999. Call it a moonshot. Or\u00a0Wall Street euphoria. Or\u00a0a \"Trump Rally,\" as investors are pricing in better earnings and economic growth, thanks to the president-elect's promises to cut corporate taxes, reduce business red tape and spend heavily on infrastructure. Whatever you call it, the market melt-up is real. Here's five theories that explain why stocks are in rally mode. 1. Money managers playing catch-up. 2016 is almost over and stock fund managers that are trailing\u00a0the benchmarks they're measured against have to buy stocks or get left further behind in the performance race, says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at\u00a0Commonwealth\u00a0Financial Network. 2. Bond sell-off eases. The sell-off in U.S. government bonds, which pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up from a low of 1.32% in July to nearly 2.5% at the start of December, has stalled. Thursday, the 10-year note was trading at 2.4%, reducing fears that a massive spike in borrowing costs would put pressure on a stock market most market pros say is overvalued, says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. 3. Cash flooding back to stocks.\u00a0\"Tons of cash on the sidelines is coming off,\" says Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum Capital Management. Money that had been invested in bonds is also moving back to stocks in search of bigger returns, adds Ann Milletti, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management. Cash exiting bond funds in the most recent five-week period hit a 3-1/2 year high, Bank of America says, while stock funds enjoyed their biggest four-week inflows in two years. Ask Matt: Should I sell all of my stock like Donald Trump did? 4. \"Trump Effect.\"\u00a0The market is still driven by momentum inspired by Trump's business-friendly policies, says David Kelly, chief global strategist at\u00a0J.P. Morgan Funds. Investors are pricing in better corporate earnings based on Trump's promise to lower the federal corporate tax rate to 15% or 20%, from 35%, he says. 5. A trend signal says \"buy.\" The Dow Jones Transportation Average, which is filled with stocks like package delivery companies United Parcel Service and Fed Ex\u00a0as well as railroads and airlines, hit fresh all-time highs\u00a0for the first time in two years. The\u00a0new peak\u00a0triggered a bull signal, says Bittles. The \"Dow Theory\" says the market uptrend is \"confirmed\" when stocks in the Dow that make\u00a0stuff, like Apple, and stocks in the Dow Transportation Average\u00a0which ship stuff, hit record highs at the same time, says Bittles. 35 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hpQzH4 ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Dec 8, 2016 4:50 PM EST LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles prosecutors on Thursday sued four national retailers, accusing them of duping shoppers into believing they got bigger discounts than they actually did. The separate lawsuits alleging deceptive advertising were filed against J.C. Penney, Sears, Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, according to the Los Angeles city attorney\u2019s office. \u201cCustomers have the right to be told the truth about the prices they\u2019re paying - and to know if a bargain is really a bargain,\u201d Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. 9 retail sales tricks to get you to spend more Feuer said the retailers falsely advertised higher regular prices for merchandise so customers believed they were getting bigger bargains. California law bars retailers from advertising a higher original price unless the product was sold at that price within three months of the ad. Sears and J.C. Penney declined to comment. Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s did not immediately respond to messages for comment. The lawsuits seek civil penalties up to $2,500 for each violation and injunctions to stop so-called false reference pricing to increase sales.\u00a0 Prosecutors said thousands of \u201csale\u201d items were advertised at false reference prices. One of the lawsuits said\u00a0 J.C. Penney was selling a maternity bathing suit top online for $31.99 in February, down from a so-called original price of $46. The top was later marked down further but still compared to the $46 price point, even though the item was never actually sold for $46. 12 ways Amazon gets you to spend more Another suit claims that Kohl\u2019s last year adverstised a sale on belted cargo shorts at a price of $35.99, which the company said was down from an original price of $60. But Kohl\u2019s allegedly never priced the item at that higher price, according to prosecutors.\u00a0 Macy\u2019s is accused of claiming that a sterling silver necklace that the retailer advertised with a sale price of $30 was originally priced at $120. That, too, was a false reference price, the suit charges.\u00a0 Feuer wants to bar the retailers from using such tactics, and is also seeking civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation. Prosecutors said J.C. Penney and Kohl\u2019s previously faced class-action lawsuits alleging similar deceptive business practices and had agreed to stop. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: Americus Police Dept. via AP) The suspect in the shooting of two south Georgia police officers shot and killed himself Thursday as\u00a0heavily armed officers surrounded a\u00a0house in Americus, Ga., where he was holed up. Police heard a single gunshot inside the house and tried for more than an hour to make contact with the suspect, 32-year-old Minquell Lembrick. Police eventually used a robot to open the door of the residence and found Lembrick dead of what authorities said was a self-inflicted\u00a0gunshot wound. Lembrick was the subject of a massive manhunt after he allegedly shot and killed an Americus, Ga., police officer, Nicholas Smarr, 25, and critically wounded\u00a0Georgia Southwestern State University officer Jodi Smith, who were responding to a report of domestic violence Wednesday morning. The two officers were grade school\u00a0friends who had attended the\u00a0police training academy\u00a0together. Following Wednesday's\u00a0shooting, Lembrick made a series of posts to what appears to have been his Facebook page, including a four-second video that indicated he did not expect to be taken alive:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss y\u2019all folk, man.\" The post was later taken\u00a0down. Officer Nicholas Smarr. \u00a0(Photo: Americus Police Department via AP) Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, described Lembrick as a \"career criminal.\" He said Lembrick's death means the community\u00a0can move forward with healing after the shooting of the two officers. \"It is over with,\" he said. \"The perpetrator is not here.\" The tip that led to Lembrick's hideout came from a local resident who reached out to Chief Deputy Col. Eric Bryant, of the Americus police department. A $70,000 reward had been offered for information on Lembrick's whereabouts. Bryant told reporters in the small Georgia town 130 miles south of Atlanta that the informant was at the house when Lembrick arrived. \"The\u00a0caller actually knew the gentleman and was there when he came to the house,\" Bryant said. The tipster was also aware\u00a0that Lembrick was being sought by police. \"He wanted to get away and contact law enforcement as quickly as he could,\" Bryant said. 8122 CONNECT TWEET 9 LINKEDIN 128 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hoo2BX ",

University police Officer Jody Smith died Thursday, the university told NBC News, a day after he was shot in a confrontation near the campus in Americus. Americus police Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr died Wednesday, and the body of the suspected gunman , Minquell Kennedy Lembrick, 32, was found with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound Thursday morning inside a local residence, police said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation confirmed that the body was that of Lembrick, who was alone in the house. Americus police Officer Nicholas Ryan Smarr and Georgia Southwestern State University police Officer Jody Smith. Georgia Bureau of Investigation Authorities said Lembrick, 32, escaped after having shot Smarr and Smith at an apartment complex Wednesday morning near the campus in Americus, which is in Sumter County about halfway between Columbus and Albany. More than 200 state and local officers launched a massive search for Lembrick, who was considered armed and extremely dangerous. Officials had offered $70,000 in rewards for his capture. Smarr, 25, was responding to a call for a domestic disturbance when he was shot, police said, and Smith was providing backup. The two officers had been best friends since high school and went to the same police academy together, police said Thursday. Smith, who joined the university police department in August, previously was Sumter County sheriff's deputy and a part-time officer with the Plains Police Department, authorities said. \"When Jody heard the call and he knew that Nick was on his way \u2014 even though we had Americus police officers on their way as backup \u2014 he heard that call over the radio, and he took it upon himself to respond and back up his friend,\" Americus Police Chief Mark Scott said. Minquell Kennedy Lembrick in a wanted poster issued Wednesday. Georgia Bureau of Investigation \"I can't say enough about them. They are model officers,\" Scott said. \"They're both heroes, in my opinion.\" The university, meanwhile, resumed normal operations Thursday after it was announced that Lembrick was dead. It had been on lockdown since the shootings Wednesday morning. State prison records show that Lembrick has several previous convictions, including one in 2003 for false imprisonment. Details of the case, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison, weren't immediately available. Police confirmed reports that a Facebook account under the name \"Minguell Gstreet Lembrick\" belonged to the suspect. In a video, Lembrick said, \"I'm gonna miss y'all folks, man.\" Accompanying posts said he didn't plan to be taken alive. Alex Johnson ",

Donald Trump speaks to a crowd in Cincinnati as part of his \"thank you\" tour. (Evan Vucci / AP) Becky Yerak Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune In the list of potential risk factors that companies include in their regulatory filings, a new one has surfaced: Donald Trump . Methode Electronics, a Chicago-based designer and maker of parts for automotive, appliance and other industries, on Thursday added the president-elect to its list of potential \"risk factors.\" Disclosures of a wide range of concerns that public companies face are common in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and some of the risks never materialize. But Methode, in a filing about its financial results for the quarter ended Oct. 29, said it was adding Trump's comments on the North American Free Trade Agreement as a cause for concern. \"Any attempt by President-elect Trump to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA and certain other international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,\" said Methode, in bold letters. \"A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and China.\" Methode isn't the first publicly held company to mention the incoming Trump administration as a risk factor. Arizona-based wind blades-maker TPI Composites mentioned Trump by name in a Nov. 9 filing that included new risk factors. \"Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, as well as the Republican Party maintaining control of both the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States in the congressional election, may create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector and wind energy sector,\" TPI said. \"During the election campaign, President-elect Trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail global warming.\" The hard-eyed view along the Tug Fork River in West Virginia coal country is that President-elect Donald Trump has something to prove: that he'll help bring back Appalachian mining, as he promised time and again on the campaign trail.

The hard-eyed view along the Tug Fork River in West Virginia coal country is that President-elect Donald Trump has something to prove: that he'll help bring back Appalachian mining, as he promised time and again on the campaign trail. Nobody thinks he can revive it entirely \u2014 not economists, not... Read the story That same day, Texas-based Adeptus Health also mentioned Trump's possible repeal of Obamacare as a risk. Of Methode's $809 million in sales in the fiscal year ended April 30, more than 60 percent was in the U.S., according to its most recent annual report. About 15 percent was in China. The company identifies its major manufacturing locations as Shanghai; Cairo; Mriehel, Malta; and Monterrey, Mexico. \"During the campaign, President-elect Trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including NAFTA,\" Methode said. It's unclear, however, whether any changes will in fact be made to international trade agreements, the company said. Methode, whose annual report also mentions Chicago as one of its manufacturing locations, couldn't be reached for immediate comment. The company has about 4,345 workers, of which about two-thirds are in Malta and Mexico. The election also has been mentioned in some recent SEC filings. ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Kelsey Snell and Mike DeBonis December 8 at 6:16 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Follow @mikedebonis In a Nov. 18, 2014 file photo, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) talks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Senate Democrats are threatening to force a brief government shutdown this weekend to pressure Republicans to support policies they say match promises President-elect Donald Trump made on the campaign trail to help coal country and boost American manufacturers. Government funding is set to run out at the end of Friday and lawmakers are considering a stopgap spending bill that would keep federal agencies funded through April 28. The angry Democrats are not threatening to block the spending measure, but to threaten to miss the Friday deadline in hopes they can entice Republicans into further negotiations. The tension over the spending bill is\u00a0a sign of the possible scrambled alliances to come when Trump is inaugurated and how they could prove to be a headache for Republican leaders. The senator fighting to have more generous medical and pension benefits for retired coal miners included in the spending bill is West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin III, whose state Trump won handily, in part, by promising to renew the coal industry. Manchin is one of several red state Democrats expected to face a tough reelection bid in 2018.\u00a0He is set to meet with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Friday morning and it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll discuss the issue. The Democratic senator has been floated as a possible member of Trump\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI want to shut her down,\u201d Manchin\u00a0said Wednesday about the government, pointing to his anger over concerns about the miner provisions. \u201cI mean this is ridiculous . . . You can\u2019t throw 16,000 people out.\u201d About 12,500 former union miners and their families have been told their health benefits will lapse come Jan. 1, and an additional 10,000 are in danger of losing benefits at a later date. Many are also facing potential cuts to their retirement benefits due to declining coal companies being unable to make required contributions to pension funds. Manchin is demanding a vote on an amendment to extend miners\u2019 medical benefits for one year. The spending bill includes a four month extension, which critics of the proposal say is inadequate. Democrats are playing up Trump\u2019s support for coal country as they try to pressure Republicans. They\u00a0said health care for miners has bipartisan support and would easily pass if Republican leaders would allow a vote on the measure. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters the issue could unite Democrats and Trump. \u201cI hope our new president-elect, who talked and got to know the miners, will speak out,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about partisanship.\u201d Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) called out Trump by name as she left a Thursday meeting between Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and several of the Democrats who represents states where Trump won. \u201cWe think there has been a renewed interest in these kind of issues with president-elect Donald Trump,\u201d said Heitkamp who recently met with him\u00a0in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to get relief and be able to deliver a Christmas present to some of the most sympathetic working people in America.\u201d Senate Democrats also want funding for the \u201cBuy American\u201d program included in a water resources bill that is slated to come up for a Senate vote after the spending bill is complete. Republicans have been willing to support the provision as part of temporary spending bills but resisted including it in more permanent legislation like the water bill. That tension puts Republicans at odds with Trump, who backed the concept at a rally last week. \u201cWhether it\u2019s producing steel, building cars or curing disease, we want the next generation of innovation and production to happen right here in America and right here in Ohio, right?\u201d Trump said in Cincinnati. One Republican, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said Thursday she will oppose the stopgap unless the miners provision is addressed. Six other GOP senators signed a letter last month supporting a long term fix to the health care issue. House Republicans have shown little interest in negotiating on the issue. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said the House is set to leave Washington after voting Thursday afternoon and does not plan to consider any further legislation until January The House on Thursday passed the spending bill on a 326\u00a0to 96 vote. The Senate will now\u00a0need to vote on the legislation by the end of Friday to avert a government shutdown. But there would need to be unanimous consent to take up the bill in time to meet that deadline and Democrats are threatening to withhold their support for such a procedural move. The Senate would still be able to vote Sunday to pass the appropriations measure without this\u00a0consent, but it\u00a0would force a roughly one-day government shutdown. The effort by Democrats to stick together to force action for miners and steelworkers has also sparked intraparty tensions \u2014 specifically, because the spending bill and an accompanying water projects package include funding to\u00a0address the water crisis in Flint, Mich. \u2014 which has been a priority for Democratic lawmakers for more than a year. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: It feels like there\u2019s always a reason not to do Flint,\u201d said Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), who urged his Senate colleagues to pass both bills. \u201cPeople who live in Flint and places like Flint get kind of accustomed to being left behind. They get kind of accustomed to having other priorities supersede theirs. And you know what? Enough of that . . . Their interests have to sometimes come before other important priorities.\u201d powerpost ",

(Photo: Michael E. Keating, Cincinnati Enquirer) 61 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Aeronautics and cultural leaders on Thursday hailed the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the earth as a pioneer who conquered space when science knew much less about its effects on the body, and as a military hero and all-around family man. As word spread about the death of former astronaut and U.S. Sen. John Glenn at the age of 95, those who knew him and admired him had only glowing words to share about the former Congressional representative from Ohio. Ohio State University president Michael Drake remembered Glenn, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1975 to 1999, as \"Ohio's consummate public servant and a true American hero.\" Glenn was an adjunct professor until recently at the school's John Glenn College of Public Affairs. \"He was an authentic hero whose courage, integrity, sacrifice and achievements inspired people,\" Drake said in a statement. \"He leaves an undiminished legacy as one of the great people of our time.\" Before Glenn, a Democrat, was a lawmaker he was an astronaut and the world of science remembered him for his contributions there. \"Godspeed, John Glenn,\" tweeted the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. \"Ad Astra,\" the agency continued, offering the Latin phrase that means \"to the stars.\" Tweeted astrophysicist Neil\u00a0deGrasse Tyson, \"There aren't many heroes left: WWII Korean War Fighter Pilot. Marine Colonel. NASA Astronaut. Senator. Married 73 yrs. John Glenn RIP 1921-2016.\" Astronaut Peggy Whitson said via Twitter, \"This is a tremendous loss for our nation and for the world.\" Glenn also served in the U.S. Marine Corps, completing training in 1943 and serving as a fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War. \"The Corps lost a legend today,\" the United States Marine Corps said in a statement. \"Semper Fi,\" the corps added, the phrase short for \"semper fidelis,\" the motto of the Marines, which means \"always faithful.\" Tweeted Oliver North, the former\u00a0U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant colonel known for the Iran-Contra affair, \"John Glenn had all the right stuff.\" The reference harkened back to the 1983 movie \"The Right Stuff\" that detailed the first manned spaceflight by the United States and the story of the test pilots involved in aeronautical research at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Actor Jason Alexander of \"Seinfeld\" fame wished Glenn \"Godspeed.\" \"Your legacy is eternal,\" Alexander said via Twitter. ",

    "text": "Boeing pledges $1 million for Donald Trump's inaugural events Fredreka Schouten , USA TODAY 6:11 p.m. EST December 8, 2016 Air Force One departs Andrews Air Force Base on Tuesday. \u00a0(Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attack on Boeing isn\u2019t keeping the aircraft builder from writing a big check to back his inaugural festivities. The company already had committed $1 million to help underwrite inaugural events when Trump took aim at the manufacturer this week, according to a Boeing official familiar with the planning, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about the discussions. The donation matches the amount Boeing gave to President Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration, Federal Election Commission records show. On Tuesday, Trump lashed out at the manufacturing giant on Twitter and called for the government to cancel its deal with Boeing to develop the next generation of Air Force One, citing cost overruns. \u201cBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cCancel order!\u201d Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 In a statement, Boeing countered that its current deal with the Air Force is for $170 million in design work. But the Defense Department has indicated it could spend\u00a0nearly $3 billion over five years to design and develop replacements for the pair of jets that serve as Air Force One. And defense experts say a $4 billion total price-tag is a reasonable estimate of total costs. Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One By the end of the day Tuesday, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenberg had spoken with Trump and had promised to work with the new administration to rein in costs, Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe told The Washington Post this week . In an interview Wednesday on NBC, Trump called Muilenberg a \"very good man\" and said, \"we're going to work it out.\" When asked about donations to inaugural activities, Johndroe said in an email to USA TODAY: \u201cWe are pleased to continue our tradition of supporting presidential inaugurations.\u201d Trump\u2019s inaugural fundraising committee has not released a budget but aims to raise as much as $75 million, according to media accounts. The New York Times this week reported that organizers already have collected some $50 million , putting the Trump team on pace to exceed the $53 million Obama raised from private sources for his first inauguration in 2009. Big benefactors will enjoy big benefits, according to a widely circulated fundraising brochure. Among the perks for \u201cunderwriters\u201d who contribute $1 million or more: eight tickets to a candlelight dinner at which Trump and his wife Melania will appear.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) were still possible along the coast of the Solomon Islands and smaller tsunami waves could hit Papua New Guinea . There were reports of some power outages in the Solomon Islands, although there were no immediate reports of widespread damage or injuries from the quake. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. The epicenter was relatively deep at 48 kilometers (30 miles) below the surface. Deeper quakes generally cause less damage on the ground. The Solomon Islands are located in the Pacific's geologically active \"Ring of Fire.\" 0 Shares ",

GALLAGHER Dec 8, 2016, 11:31 AM ET 0 Shares South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP WATCH Escaped South Carolina Inmate Captured by Police 0 Shares Email An inmate serving a life sentence in a South Carolina prison who escaped from custody Wednesday night has been captured, according to police. The inmate, identified as 47-year-old Michael Alan Williamson, escaped from the McCormick Correctional Institution, a medium/maximum level prison in McCormick, South Carolina, at approximately 8:50 p.m. local time. Williamson is believed to have then traveled dozens of miles to Columbia, the state capital, where he allegedly stabbed a female police officer who was responding to a shoplifting call at a Walmart just before 10 p.m., authorities said. Police said the officer, whose name has not been released, was transported to a local hospital. She was treated for two stab wounds to her left arm and shoulder. She is in stable condition and is expected to recover, police said. \u201cShe\u2019s ready to get back in the fight,\u201d said Columbia Police Chief William \u201cSkip\u201d Holbrook. Williamson was captured Thursday morning before 11 a.m. local time on Sunset Boulevard in the town of Lexington, according to the Columbia Police Department. A parent at a middle school in Lexington notified the school resource officer that she had seen a \"suspicious male\" dressed in black and wearing a mask walking on a nearby street, according to the Lexington Police Department. After the school resource officer notified police, a responding officer saw the man walking in the roadway and asked him to remove his black mask. When he did, the officer recognized him as Williamson, who then fled into the woods. Police eventually captured Williamson and took him into custody after he attempted to enter another school in town. Lexington Police Chief Terrence Green commended the witness who alerted the school resource officer to Williamson. \"I am pleased that our officers were able to arrest this dangerous felon and bring to a close the extensive search that had been going on since last night,\" Green said. \"For our citizens, this also highlights the importance that when you see someone or something that just doesn\u2019t look right, please call the police. Like in today\u2019s arrest, it can make all the difference.\u201d Holbrook thanked law enforcement partners for assisting in the hours-long manhunt. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d he said at a press conference. Authorities said Williamson will not return to the McCormick facility. Suspect Williamson was found before 11:00 a.m. at 4300 block of Sunset Blvd. SCDC Director says Williamson will not go back to McCormick. pic.twitter.com/iN1mjcgwKr \u2014 Cola Police Dept. SC (@ColumbiaPDSC) December 8, 2016 Authorities concluded that the escaped inmate and the suspect in the assault on the officer are the same person. \u201cIn working with Columbia law enforcement officials, it was determined that inmate Williamson is a suspect in a shoplifting incident and assault on a Columbia police officer at a Walmart on Bush River Road on Wednesday night,\u201d South Carolina Department of Corrections representative Sommer Sharpe told ABC News. According to correctional records, Williamson was sentenced to life in prison in 1998 for armed robbery and was also convicted in 1997 of assault and battery with intent to kill. His prison records also show several disciplinary actions for use or possession of unauthorized drugs, smuggling of contraband and other infractions.

    "text": "The Comet Ping Pong Gunman Answers Our Reporter\u2019s Questions By ADAM GOLDMAN Photo Edgar M. Welch surrendered to the police in Washington on Sunday. Credit Sathi Soma, via Associated Press WASHINGTON \u2014 Edgar M. Welch, 28, of Salisbury, N.C., was arrested Sunday after firing a gun inside a pizza restaurant in Washington as he investigated false claims in online articles that the pizzeria was at the center of a child sex slave ring, the police said. No one was injured by the gunfire, and Mr. Welch surrendered peacefully. The pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, had been swept into a conspiracy theory, which linked the supposed ring to Hillary Clinton, because its owner had corresponded with the Clinton campaign about a fund-raising dinner. On Wednesday, I spoke with Mr. Welch, who goes by his middle name, Maddison, by videoconference at an old hospital building adjacent to the city\u2019s jail. In his first news media interview since his arrest, Mr. Welch appeared downcast and at times distracted as he answered questions for 45 minutes, the maximum time allowed by the jail. \u201cI just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,\u201d he said. OPEN Document What was his original plan? Mr. Welch, the father of two daughters, said he woke up Sunday morning and told his family he had some things to do. He left \u201cSmallsbury,\u201d a nickname for his hometown, for the 350-mile drive to Washington with the intention of giving the restaurant a \u201ccloser look\u201d and then returning home. He wanted to \u201cshine some light on it.\u201d As he made his way to Washington, he felt his \u201cheart breaking over the thought of innocent people suffering.\u201d Once he got to the pizzeria, there was an abrupt change of plans. Mr. Welch would not say why he took a military-style assault rifle inside the restaurant and fired it. According to court documents, Mr. Welch said he had come armed to help rescue the children. What did he think when he discovered there were no children at the pizzeria? \u201cThe intel on this wasn\u2019t 100 percent,\u201d he said. However, he refused to dismiss outright the claims in the online articles, conceding only that there were no children \u201cinside that dwelling.\u201d He also said that child slavery was a worldwide phenomenon.

An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Privacy Policy Where did he learn about the fake news involving Comet? He said it was through word of mouth. After recently having internet service installed at his house, he was \u201creally able to look into it.\u201d He said that substantial evidence from a combination of sources had left him with the \u201cimpression something nefarious was happening.\u201d He said one article on the subject led to another and then another. He said he did not like the term fake news, believing it was meant to diminish stories outside the mainstream media, which he does not completely trust. He also said he was not political. While once a registered Republican, he did not vote for Donald J. Trump. He also did not vote for Mrs. Clinton. But he is praying that Mr. Trump takes the country in the \u201cright direction.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story What was he like? Mr. Welch was soft-spoken and polite, and said he liked the outdoors. He was cautious when speaking about what happened, sometimes citing advice he had received from his lawyer. He said he did not believe in conspiracy theories, but then added that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks needed to be re-examined. He has listened to Alex Jones, whose radio show traffics in conspiracy theories and who once said that Mrs. Clinton \u201chas personally murdered and chopped up\u201d children. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit eccentric,\u201d Mr. Welch said. \u201cHe touches on some issues that are viable but goes off the deep end on some things.\u201d Mr. Welch likes to read. A favorite is \u201cWild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man\u2019s Soul,\u201d by John Eldredge, about masculinity in evangelical Christianity. He said he did not do drugs but drank the occasional beer. He misses his children: \u201cThey are in my thoughts every second of the day.\u201d He said he had grown religious in the last few years. Tattooed on his back are Bible verses: \u201cEven youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.\u201d Does he have any regrets? Mr. Welch said that he had acted in haste and that, if he could, he would do a lot of things differently. \u201cI regret how I handled the situation,\u201d he said.

Sanders told jurors about the horror of seeing her son and her aunt shot to death and sheltering with her granddaughter beneath a table. At one point, she looked across the courtroom toward Roof and called him \"evil, evil, evil.\" Bruck asked her on cross-examination whether she remembered Roof saying anything in the aftermath of the shootings. \"He said he was going to kill himself,\" she said. \"I was counting on that. There's no place on Earth for him other than the pit of hell.\" Related: Death Penalty Trial of Accused Shooter to Begin U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel denied the mistrial request and said he interpreted Sanders' testimony as \"a religious comment.\" He instructed jurors that any decision on guilt or a sentence is up to the jury \u2014 not the attorneys or witnesses in the case. Also Thursday, jurors watched surveillance footage of Roof leaving a Charleston church with a gun in his hand. Charleston police Sgt. Dan English showed the jury more than 20 video clips taken from cameras at the church on June 17, 2015. The clips showed many of the victims and Roof entering the church. Roof is seen leaving the church 52 minutes later, and a final clip taken about 25 minutes after that showed one of the victims carried out on a stretcher. Play ",

(Photo: STR, AFP/Getty Images) 9 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 As Christmas approaches, experts suggest an extra dollop of caution before clicking on email package delivery notices. Fake notifications are proliferating, bringing not holiday cheer \u2014 but holiday ransomware. The holiday phishing season began just before Thanksgiving and will likely extend until after Christmas, said Caleb Barlow, vice president for IBM Security. \u201cThis is a $445 billion business. These are campaigns, run by the criminal equivalent of marketers,\u201d he said. Security company FireEye sees a significant increase in fake package email alerts beginning in November, an almost 100% increase from the average of September-October. Common subject lines the company has been tracking include: - We could not deliver your parcel, #00556030 - Please Confirm Your DHL Shipment - Problems with item delivery, n.000834069 - Delivery Receipt | Confirm Awb no:XXX830169 - Your order is ready to be delivered -\u00a0Courier was unable to deliver the parcel, ID00990381 - Your DHL isher\u00a0please download\u00a0attachment to view\u00a0detail and\u00a0confirmation of your \u00a0address x Share Phishing scams are proliferating as intensely as ever; it's up to you to avoid getting hooked. Let the clicker beware It\u2019s important to remember that legitimate shippers such as Amazon, FedEx and UPS have nothing to do with this and haven't done anything here. \u201cIt\u2019s the bad guys trying to trick you into thinking it\u2019s them, not the companies themselves,\u201d said Barlow. UPS \u00a0keeps a page on its site \u00a0showing various examples of fake delivery notices, with tips on how to spot fraud. The Federal Trade Commission also has information up on how consumers can protect themselves. The fake messages tend to come in two main types. Some contain malware that invades your computer and either allows it to be used by a botnet or attempts to find and extract personal information about you that could be sold, or login information for your financial accounts. The most damaging can contain ransomware. This is software that allows criminals to remotely lock up your computer. They then send a message demanding payment in\u00a0untraceable\u00a0digital currency such as Bitcoin. These campaigns can be enormous. IBM's X-Force security team began tracking a\u00a0massive spam campaign \u00a0on Nov. 21 that flooded millions of inboxes with fake delivery notifications carrying the subject line \"Your Amazon.com order has dispatched.\" Instead of a package update, they carried a malicious zip attachment that downloaded the Locky ransomware program. At its\u00a0peak, the campaign involved 44% of all incoming spam emails to IBM's decoy accounts designed to gather information about potential threats. Security firms globally are always on alert for this type of attack and quickly identify and block new malware variants. That, too, was visible in the IBM data. \u201cEvery time the good guys figure it out, the bad guys pivot, tweak their code and try again,\u201d Barlow said. Phishing attacks all have a common objective, to get people to trust the receiver and follow instructions, which are usually to click on a URL or open an attachment, said Paul\u00a0Calatayud,\u00a0chief technology officer at the security firm FireMon. Check it twice To protect yourself,\u00a0look, carefully\u00a0at any emailed package delivery notice. Do they\u00a0include your full name, customer number and actual\u00a0information from the company? Is the email address it came from actually the company or some odd variant? For example, an email purporting to be from FedEx that came to this reporter on Wednesday was actually from FedEx-intl.com, a non-existent address. If there\u2019s any doubt\u00a0don\u2019t click, say experts. Take the time to actually type in the Amazon or UPS or FedEx address. It won't take that much longer but will protect you. \u201cTo a malicious actor, this is optimal phishing season and the phishing is good!\u201d said Thomas Pore, director of IT for security company Plixer International. \u201cAs much as you want to click and open, just don\u2019t do it.\u201d \u00a0 9 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2h1P998 ",

The Peninsula Daily News reported that the Port Angeles turbines, which haven\u2019t yet been turned on, are expected to generate $1.39 per day in electricity, or roughly $42 per month. The turbines were meant to help illuminate a local park. Now, some city council members are having second thoughts about their unanimous approval for the project. \u201cI did not realize they would produce so little energy. I wouldn\u2019t have voted for it knowing it was that little,\u201d City Councilwoman Sissi Bruch told\u00a0 The Peninsula Daily News . Bruch said she was disappointed in the savings, though did \u201cappreciate\u201d the fact it \u201cwould educate folks about wind power.\u201d The city, though, challenged some details in the newspaper report. Nathan West, director of Community and Economic Development for the city, told FoxNews.com in an email that daily savings could be as high as $5.44 \u201cat peak windspeed\u201d but cautioned that \u201cdetermination of actual benefit in dollars at this time would be speculative because the spires are not yet operational.\u201d He also defended the city\u2019s investment in the turbines, saying: \u201c[T]he City did not purchase these spires for the purpose of energy creating infrastructure but rather as a park element. There are however many other \u00a0thoughts that went into the decision making regarding purchase of the spires.\u201d He said they add to a \u201cpositive aesthetic\u201d in the park and \u201csymbolize energy creation.\u201d\u00a0 The city council voted in October 2015 to approve $107,516\u00a0out of a total $285,952 county funding grant to purchase the turbines from Urban Green Energy. While they were supposed to be turned on two months ago, a dispute over safety inspection of the project has resulted in delays. The electricity that is produced would be used to power 31 lights in the newly built Waterfront Park. The lower-than-anticipated savings could be even lower depending on the eventual cost of maintaining the turbines in the harsh and salty environment, Port Angeles Deputy Power Systems Manager Shailesh Shere told the\u00a0newspaper. Though some members of the council may not be sold on the alternative energy initiative, there were those who never bought into the promised cost savings in the first place. \u201cMy fundamental objection to these is that they are not cost-effective and it\u2019s a waste of money,\u201d former deputy director of power systems Phil Lusk told the paper.

    "text": "Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Two Chicago police officers have resigned in the face of firing over their off-duty beating of a restaurant patron on the Northwest Side more than a decade ago. Brian Murphy and Jason Orsa, both 12-year department veterans, stepped down effective Dec. 1, said police spokesman Frank Giancamilli. Their resignations came a little more than a week after the Illinois Supreme Court denied an appeal of their dismissals and before the Chicago Police Board could move to fire them as soon as its monthly meeting Thursday night. Even though the police board had originally dismissed the two officers in January 2011, both still remained on the force more than a decade after the incident because a Cook County judge had overturned their firings in 2012. They were reinstated on the force and given back pay. Murphy, Orsa and another officer, Daniel McNamara, had allegedly just been drinking at a nearby bar when they went to eat at the Taco Burrito King restaurant at Higgins and Harlem avenues during the early morning of March 24, 2006. The trio, along with a Marine friend who had just returned from Iraq, were sitting at a table when Obed \"OJ\" DeLeon walked inside the restaurant and complained about a car blocking the parking lot. Murphy jumped up from his seat, pointed his service pistol at DeLeon's head and shoved him against a wall, surveillance video shows. Orsa, McNamara and their friend also joined in. DeLeon was punched, knocked down twice, kicked, hit and held facedown on the floor of the crowded restaurant. His shirt was ripped off, revealing gang tattoos on his body. Five years later, the police board fired Murphy and Orsa after two eyewitnesses and video confirmed they had started the fight. Pantle reversed the board's decision, pointing to the delayed, four-year investigation by Chicago's police oversight agency, saying the officers were unable to track witnesses closer to the time of the attack. She also blasted DeLeon as a gang member. But in August, a three-judge panel of an Illinois appeals court upheld the dismissals, noting that Murphy could have been fired just for pulling out his service weapon \"unprovoked\" in the restaurant. The court held that Orsa had repeatedly and unjustifiably kicked DeLeon and that the two officers attempted to cover up what happened. The court also rejected their contention during the police board hearing that DeLeon started the conflict by yelling the gang slogans and boasting he was a cop killer. A front-page Tribune article about the appeals court reversal quoted two eyewitnesses who were also arrested as expressing surprise to learn from a reporter that both officers were still then on the force. The officers appealed to the state Supreme Court, but it was denied on Nov. 23, according to a spokesman for the court and Max Caproni, the police board's executive director. In its original ruling in 2011, the police board found insufficient evidence to prove McNamara took part in the beating but suspended him for 18 months for failing to tell supervisors of his and the other officers' involvement in the altercation. The board also gave one of two sergeants who responded to the restaurant, Louis Danielson, a six-month suspension for not going inside the restaurant or trying to find out who had a gun. But the city dropped Danielson's suspension after Murphy and Orsa won their jobs back, clearing his record and awarding him back pay. After the appellate court reversed the judge's decision, however, the city chose not to pursue Danielson's suspension, said Giancamilli, the police spokesman. A few days after the beating, DeLeon lodged a complaint against the police. But it wasn't until a year later that the officers were questioned by investigators for the Independent Police Review Authority , Chicago's much-maligned agency that investigates the most serious allegations of police misconduct. In those interviews, the officers alleged for the first time that DeLeon had threatened police and yelled gang slogans in the restaurant. Eighteen more months passed before IPRA tried to interview the sergeant who approved the criminal charges against DeLeon and two eyewitnesses, but he had retired by then, records show. Records also show the IPRA investigation limped along for years. One investigator asked supervisors for extensions on deadlines at least 23 times, according to the records. Finally, in 2010, four years after the incident, then-police Superintendent Jody Weis brought formal charges against the officers, seeking their dismissal, before the police board. ",

    "text": "AMERICUS, Ga. \u2013 The second officer shot responding to a domestic violence call in southern Georgia Wednesday has died, officials say. Georgia Southwestern State University Officer Jody Smith, 26, died Thursday at a Macon hospital where he was being treated for his injuries, according to a statement from the university\u2019s interim president. Smith was shot along with an Americus police officer, 25-year-old Nicholas Smarr, who died Wednesday. The officers were\u00a0 reportedly best friends \u00a0and had graduated from high school and the police academy together. The suspect in the shooting, 32-year-old Minquell Kennedy Lembrick, killed himself Thursday after barricading himself inside a home, officials said. Minquell Kennedy Lembrick CBS affiliate WMAZ \u201cWe have just received word that GSW Public Safety Officer Jody Smith has succumbed to his injuries and has passed away,\u201d the interim president, Charles Patterson, said in a statement. \u201cWe offer our deepest condolences to his family during this very difficult time. Officer Smith was a bright, young and energetic officer, and he will be sorely missed.\u201d Speaking Thursday before Smith\u2019s death, Americus police chief Mark Scott said that typically, two Americus police officers respond to domestic violence calls. Smarr was awaiting backup from another Americus officer when Smith heard the radio call and responded to assist, Scott said. \u201cHe took it upon himself to respond and back up his friend,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThey are model officers. They\u2019re heroes, in my opinion.\u201d Scott said Wednesday that Lembrick had an outstanding arrest warrant charging him with kidnapping and other counts when the two officers encountered him at an apartment complex where a domestic dispute had been reported. But officers didn\u2019t know whom they were dealing with when they responded to the 911 call. Scott said Thursday the domestic violence victim was a woman with whom Lembrick had a relationship and said there was \u201cclear evidence of violence\u201d inside the home. The woman and her child were taken to a safe place. After the shootings, Smith was airlifted to a hospital in Macon with critical injuries. Fellow officers who knew them weren\u2019t surprised that Smith, who worked on the college campus near the shooting scene, went to assist Smarr. The two men had been lifelong friends. \u201cThey\u2019ve been close friends since grade school,\u201d said Lt. Chuck Hanks of the Sumter County Sheriff\u2019s Office, where both officers had previously worked as deputies. Hanks said the two men were still roommates, sharing a home in the county. Sumter County Sheriff Pete Smith told reporters both officers were engaged to be married in the coming months. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Hanks said. \u201cWe\u2019re a small community. You see these people every day. You work with them every day.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "text": "Former astronaut and US Senator John Glenn dies at 95 Published               December 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 John Glenn, the all-American astronaut and senator who rocketed into history on flights 36 years apart as the first American to orbit the Earth and the oldest person in space, died Thursday at age 95. \"We are saddened by the loss of Sen. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth. A true American hero. Godspeed, John Glenn,\" NASA tweeted immediately after his death was anounced. Glenn died at the James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where he was hospitalized for more than a week. \u00a0 \"With John's passing, our nation has lost an icon and Michelle and I have lost a friend. \u00a0John spent his life breaking barriers, from defending our freedom as a decorated Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, to setting a transcontinental speed record, to becoming, at age 77, the oldest human to touch the stars,\" President Obama said in a statement . President-elect Donald Trump tweeted, \"Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed.\" Glenn, who was known for his small-town decency and calm heroics, was the last of the original Mercury 7 astronauts who launched the US space program. He later served for four terms as a Democratic senator from Ohio. LAWMAKERS REACT TO JOHN GLENN'S DEATH In the early 1960s, the Mercury 7 were American superstars, constantly written about and unabashedly idolized. In \"The Right Stuff,\" a 1983 film about them based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling book, Glenn was portrayed by Ed Harris. Glenn, a Marine pilot who flew 149 missions in World War II and Korea, was America's third man in space (after Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom) but the first to orbit the Earth. On February 20, 1962 he piloted the \"Friendship 7\" spacecraft on a three-orbit mission some 100-162 miles from Earth that lasted four hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds. Afterwards, acclaimed a national hero, he received a ticker-tape parade and addressed a joint session of Congress. More than three decades later, at 77 and about to retire as a senator, Glenn lifted off on the space shuttle Discovery on October 29, 1998, becoming the oldest person ever to fly in space. His participation was designed to study the effect of space flight on the elderly. Once again, he \u2013 and his crewmates \u2013 received a ticker-tape parade on their safe return. For the 50th anniversary of his historic flight on Feb. 20, 2012, Glenn was feted with a number of events, including a dinner with approximately 125 surviving veterans of NASA's Project Mercury. In typical self-effacing fashion told them, \"We may be up on the point of that thing and get a lot of the attention, and we had ticker-tape parades and all that sort of thing. But ... you're the ones who deserve the accolade.\" The quintessential national hero was born July 18, 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio but moved at age two to New Concord, Ohio where his father operated a plumbing business. Years later he would write of his early years, \"a boy could not have had a more idyllic early childhood than I did.\" It was in New Concord that he met Annie, his wife of 73 years when both were toddlers and their parents were friendly. In his autobiography, he wrote, \"she was a part of my life from the time of my first memory.\" By the time they were in high school, they were a couple and were married April 6, 1943 in New Concord. Annie, who had a long public struggle with a speech disability, wore the $125 engagement ring Glenn bought her in 1942 for the rest of her life. The couple had two children, John and Carolyn , who survive him, along with his wife. Glenn, who received a degree in engineering from Muskingum College in New Concord, resigned from the space program in early 1964 to enter politics. But a fall in the bathtub, when he suffered a concussion and injured his inner ear, delayed his political plans and in early 1965 he became an executive for Royal Crown Cola. Nine years later, in 1974, he was elected as a Democrat to the US Senate, where he served until 1999. Glenn's only brush with negative publicity came in 1989, when he was one of five US senators embroiled in the Lincoln Savings and Keating Five Scandal, accused of improperly intervening two years earlier on behalf of Charles F. Keating, Jr., chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Glenn was later exonerated but a Senate Commission found he had exercised \"poor judgment.\" After retiring, Glenn and his wife founded the John Glenn Institute for Public Service at Ohio State University.

Mistrial declared for cop in Walter Scott shooting That\u2019s what Dorsey Montgomery said Thursday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d But after reviewing evidence, including cellphone video of the shooting, Montgomery said that he thought the 35-year-old Slager was guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of Walter Scott. Jurors deliberated more than 22 hours over four days before a mistrial was declared Monday. The white former officer was charged with shooting Scott, who was black, five times in the back as he fled a traffic stop in April 2015, an incident captured by a bystander on cellphone video that was shared online and horrified many. At one point late last week, a juror wrote a note telling the judge that he couldn\u2019t \u201cin good conscience\u201d convict Slager. That same day, Montgomery, as the jury foreman, told the judge the jury wasn\u2019t able to agree but thought a weekend off of deliberations would help, a request the judge granted. But that note, Montgomery said Thursday, didn\u2019t mean the other 11 jurors all thought the officer was guilty. In fact, he told \u201cToday,\u201d five of them weren\u2019t decided on how they\u2019d vote. Walter Scott's brother \"disappointed\" in juror after mistrial \u201cWe had one individual who was just deadlocked ... but yet we had five other individuals who were undecided,\u201d said Montgomery, the sole black member of the jury. \u201cHe just had his own convictions, and I\u2019ll leave that right there,\u201d Montgomery said, when asked what exactly the juror said about why he felt that way. State prosecutors have said they plan to try Slager again. He has also been charged with civil rights violations in federal court. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

By Christian Davenport December 8 at 7:28 PM Follow @wapodavenport A day before President-elect Donald Trump threatened one of Boeing\u2019s most high-profile defense procurements, the deal to build the new Air Force One, the company had finalized a deal to pledge $1 million for his inaugural festivities, the company said Thursday. Boeing has a long history of helping defray the costs of inaugurations, and the company gave the same amount for Obama\u2019s second inauguration in 2013. The company finalized the contribution with the inaugural committee on Monday. Then on Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the cost of the Air Force One program was too high and should be canceled. He tweeted that costs \u201care out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\u201d Later, he told reporters that he thought the cost was \u201cridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d Hours after the tweet, Trump spoke with Boeing chief executive Dennis A. Muilenburg, who assured him that the company would work to keep costs down and work with the administration on the program. Trump then called Muilenburg \u201ca good man\u201d and \u201ca terrific guy\u201d on the \u201cToday\u201d show and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work it out.\u201d Of the deal, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get the prices down, and if we don\u2019t get the prices down, we\u2019re not going to order them. We\u2019re going to stay with what we have.\u201d Despite the tension, Boeing said it is committed to supporting the festivities in January. USA Today first reported the pledge. \u201cWe are pleased to continue our tradition of supporting presidential inaugurations,\u201d said Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman. business ",

    "text": "By Jennifer Griffin, Lucas Tomlinson Published               December 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 By choosing retired Marine General John Kelly to serve as Homeland Security Secretary, President-elect Donald Trump appears to be assembling a 'Band of Brothers' rather than a 'Team of Rivals,' the model used by President Obama to form his first cabinet. Reached by phone in Canberra, Australia, Kelly told Fox News, \"I have been asked and would consider it an honor.\" In addition to three-star General Michael Flynn, a former Army Ranger, Trump has now chosen two Marines - both close friends - to lead the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. A third Marine, General Joe Dunford, is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Trump tapped Gen James Mattis to be Defense Secretary pending Senate confirmation and Thursday crossed a hurdle in Congress with the House passing language as part of a budget bill that would allow for a one-time exception to the law that states that a person needs to be off active duty for seven years before serving as Defense Secretary, a role typically reserved for civilians. Dunford ,now the chairman of the joint chiefs, is a longtime friend of Kelly's. In fact, Dunford delivered the news that Kelly's son, then 2nd Lieutenant Robert. M. Kelly, also a Marine, had been killed in Afghanistan six years ago. He appeared at Kelly's front door wearing his full dress uniform. Dunford was assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time. Kelly said when he saw his old friend at the door, he knew immediately his son was dead. Kelly is the highest ranking military officer to have a child killed in combat. Four days after his son was killed, he delivered an emotional speech in St. Louis to the Semper Fi Society, a speech that has become iconic within the military and among military families. He called out the fact that so few families serve and so few are protecting so many. \"We are in a life-and-death struggle, but not our whole country,\" Kelly said in the November 2010 speech. \"One percent of Americans are touched by this war. Then there is a much smaller club of families who have given all.\" Dunford and his wife Ellyn attended a gala dinner that Veterans' Day. Earlier in the day, they accompanied Kelly and his wife to Dover to retrieve their son's remains. There is no underestimating the bond that these two Marines feel for each other. They will now be in a very senior advisory role to President-elect Trump. When asked about losing his son at his final Pentagon press conference, Kelly spoke for all Goldstar families: \"I think the one thing they would ask is that the cause for which their son or daughter fell be -- be carried through to -- to a successful end, whatever that means, as opposed to 'this is getting too costly,' or 'too much of a pain in the ass,' and 'let's just walk away from it.' Because that's when they start thinking it might have been not worth it.\" Kelly served as then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates' senior military adviser when the current DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson was General Counsel at the Pentagon. Kelly has been advising Johnson in recent months. He served as the commander of the U.S. Southern Command from 2012 to 2016, when he oversaw the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. southern border and worked with the DEA on drug interdictions. At his final press conference in the Pentagon, Kelly told reporters that one of his frustrations was having the military's hands tied in some ways when it came to interdicting drugs, including note enough helicopters and surveillance. \"I don't need an awful lot,\" Kelly told reporters at the Jan. 8 press conference. \"But drones would be nice, because they can stay up forever and they don't get tired, and they're less expensive to operate. But no, we have not seen anything, any increases -- certainly no drones.\" He expressed concerns at the time that the U.S. had rushed to release certain prisoners who might return to the battlefield. \"Well, I mean, they're all bad boys. We have dossiers on all of them. Some of them were more effective in being bad boys than others. You know, you -- we can -- I think we can all quibble on whether 13 or 12 or 8 years in -- in detention is enough to have them -- having paid for whatever they did, but they're -- they're bad guys,\" Kelly said. He is not afraid to speak his mind. Here's what Kelly said when asked about the military being told to open all combat positions to women last year: \"It will be the pressure for not probably the generals that are here now, but for the generals to come, and admirals, to lower standards because that's the only way it'll work in the way that I hear some people, particularly, the agenda-driven people here in Washington -- or in the land, the way they want it to work,\" Kelly told reporters Jan. 8 at the Pentagon.

The life of former astronaut and U.S. senator John Glenn (1921-2016) View Photos Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962 and, in 1998 at 77, became the oldest man in space. Caption Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962 and, in 1998 at 77, became the oldest man in space. \u00a0Jan. 16, 1998 Sen. John Glenn sits next to a portrait of himself as he waits to be introduced at a news conference announcing his return to space aboard the shuttle Discovery, making him the oldest person in space. Robert Giroux/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue. By Matt Schudel December 8 at 4:39 PM John Glenn, who captured the nation\u2019s attention in 1962 as the first American to orbit the Earth during a tense time when the United States sought supremacy over the Soviet Union in the space race, and who rocketed back into space 36 years later, becoming the oldest astronaut in history, died Dec. 8 at a hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Glenn, who in his post-NASA career served four terms as a U.S. senator from Ohio, was 95. The death was confirmed by Hank Wilson, communications director at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University. Mr. Glenn had a stroke after heart-valve replacement surgery in 2014, but the immediate cause was not announced. Mr. Glenn was one of the seven original astronauts in NASA\u2019s Mercury program, which was a conspicuous symbol of the country\u2019s military and technological might at the height of the Cold War. He was not the first American in space \u2014 two of his fellow astronauts preceded him \u2014 but his three-orbit circumnavigation of the globe captured the imagination of his countrymen like few events before or since. Mr. Glenn was the last survivor of the Mercury Seven. \u201cJohn always had the right stuff,\u201d President Obama said in a statement, adding that Mr. Glenn \u201creminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there\u2019s no limit to the heights we can reach together.\u201d In an era when fear of encroaching Soviet influence reached from the White House to kindergarten classrooms, Mr. Glenn, in his silver astronaut suit, lifted the hopes of a nation on his shining shoulders. When he emerged smiling from his Friendship 7 capsule after returning from space, cheers echoed throughout the land. In this clip from a 1962 NASA documentary, John Glenn launches into space aboard the Friendship 7 on the first orbital flight by an American astronaut. (NASA) \u201cYou had to have been alive at that time to comprehend the reaction of the nation, practically all of it,\u201d author Tom Wolfe, who coined the phrase \u201cthe right stuff\u201d to describe Mr. Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts, wrote in a 2009 essay. \u201cJohn Glenn, in 1962, was the last true national hero America has ever had.\u201d [ What happened when John Glenn orbited the Earth ] After he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1974, Mr. Glenn served on Capitol Hill for 24 years and made a halfhearted run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984. When he was 77 and completing his fourth Senate term in 1998, he had one final flight of glory, returning to space as a crew member aboard the space shuttle Discovery. [ Buzz Aldrin being treated by a doctor named David Bowie after South Pole evacuation ] As heroes go, the freckle-faced Mr. Glenn appeared unassuming and seemed to embody the middle-American values of modesty, steadiness and hard work. He had climbed the ranks of the Marine Corps, becoming a full colonel, by accepting the most dangerous assignments and never flinching under pressure. He flew 149 combat missions in two wars and was a test pilot in the 1950s, when faster-than-sound airplanes often veered out of control and crashed in smoking heaps. When he joined the astronaut corps in 1959, no one knew whether a human being could survive the ordeals of space travel. Yet for all the risks he faced, Mr. Glenn was a man of careful preparation and quiet responsibility. John Glenn in 1998 next to a portrait of himself from his earlier days. (Robert Giroux/Reuters) \u2018Godspeed, John Glenn\u2019 On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union made a bold advance on the Cold War chessboard by launching Sputnik, the first man-made satellite to orbit Earth. In response, the U.S. government formed NASA in 1958 amid widespread fear that the country was falling behind the Soviets in technology and military strength. Of the seven original astronauts of the Mercury program \u2014 the others were M. Scott Carpenter , L. Gordon Cooper Jr., Virgil I. \u201cGus\u201d Grissom, Walter M. \u201cWally\u201d Schirra Jr., Alan B. Shepard Jr. and Donald K. \u201cDeke\u201d Slayton \u2014 Mr. Glenn was the oldest and the lone Marine. A lieutenant colonel at the time, he also had the highest rank and the most combat experience. He did not drink, smoke or swear and maintained a disciplined, straight-arrow manner while training in Cocoa Beach, Fla., near NASA\u2019s space center at Cape Canaveral. Comfortable in front of cameras \u2014 which followed the astronauts everywhere after they signed a $500,000 deal with Life magazine for a series of exclusive stories \u2014 Mr. Glenn was in many ways the public face of NASA. Privately, however, there was friction among the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d as the Mercury astronauts were dubbed in the news media. Concerned that some of his colleagues\u2019 dalliances with women could lead to bad publicity and jeopardize the manned space program, Mr. Glenn confronted his fellow astronauts, admonishing them to avoid any semblance of wrongdoing. \u201cThere was no doubt whatsoever that Glenn meant every word of it,\u201d Wolfe wrote in his 1979 book, \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d \u201cWhen he got his back up, he was formidable. He was not to be trifled with.\u201d Not all of the astronauts were pleased with Mr. Glenn\u2019s righteousness, however, and Shepard told him to mind his own business. \u201cHis moralizing led to colorful and heated exchanges among the pilots, and it wasn\u2019t pleasant banter,\u201d Shepard and Slayton wrote in their 1995 book, \u201cMoon Shot.\u201d When the astronauts voted among themselves to confer the honor of being the first American in space, they chose Shepard. On May 5, 1961, Shepard had a 15-minute suborbital space flight, followed two months later by Grissom on a similar mission. But two Soviet cosmonauts had already circled the Earth by August 1961. Mr. Glenn\u2019s turn came on Feb. 20, 1962. After 11 delays because of bad weather or faulty equipment, he sat in his tiny space capsule, the Friendship 7 , atop an MA-6 rocket that had failed in 40\u00a0percent of its test flights. After liftoff at 9:47 a.m., backup pilot Carpenter said on national television, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn.\u201d The moment was shared by practically the entire nation, as a television audience of 135\u00a0million \u2014 the largest up to that time \u2014 witnessed the launch. The flight plan called for seven orbits, but after the first, the capsule began to wobble. Mr. Glenn overrode the automatic navigation system and piloted Friendship 7 with manual controls for two more orbits, reaching a height of 162 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. Midway through the flight, a warning light indicated that the heat shield, which would protect the capsule during its reentry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, may have come loose. Without a heat shield, it was possible that Mr. Glenn could burn up inside the capsule as it raced back from space. As Friendship 7 was descending, all radio contact was lost. Shepard, acting as \u201ccapsule communicator\u201d from Cape Canaveral, tried to reach Mr. Glenn in his spacecraft, saying, \u201cHow do you read? Over.\u201d After about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of silence, Mr. Glenn could finally be heard: \u201cLoud and clear. How me?\u201d \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Shepard asked. \u201cOh, pretty good,\u201d Mr. Glenn casually responded, later adding, \u201cbut that was a real fireball, boy.\u201d Exterior pieces of the capsule\u2019s had broken off during reentry and burst into flame. A defective warning light caused much of the panic, but during those four tense minutes, it was feared that Mr. Glenn had been lost \u2014 along with the promise of the space program. When he splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean after 4 hours 56 minutes aloft, Mr. Glenn emerged as an almost mythic figure who had scaled heights no American had reached before. \u201cI was fully aware of the danger,\u201d he said in 1968. \u201cNo matter what preparation you make, there comes the moment of truth. You're playing with big stakes \u2014 your life. But the important thing to me wasn\u2019t fear but what you can do to control it.\u201d He was greeted upon his return by President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. After an estimated 1\u00a0million spectators crowded the streets of Washington, Mr. Glenn insisted that the other six Mercury astronauts join him for a parade before 4\u00a0million people in New York. \u201cDuring his ticker-tape parade up Broadway,\u201d Wolfe wrote, \u201cyou have never heard such cheers or seen so many thousands of people crying.\u201d From pilot to politics John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, and grew up in New Concord, Ohio. His father ran a plumbing supply business and later had a Chevrolet dealership. His mother taught at an elementary school. Mr. Glenn was an honor student in high school, lettered in three sports and played trumpet in the band. At Muskingum College in New Concord, he was a reserve center on the football team. He took flying lessons in his teens and left college early in 1942 to enter a Navy pilot training program before transferring to the aviation branch of the Marine Corps. On April 6, 1943, he married Anna \u201cAnnie\u201d Castor, whom he had known since childhood. During World War II, Mr. Glenn flew 59 missions as a fighter pilot and took part in the Marshall Islands campaign in the Pacific. He was stationed on Guam in the Western Pacific and was a flight instructor in Texas before returning to action in the Korean War. He was in the same squadron in Korea as baseball star Ted Williams and flew 90 missions as a jet fighter pilot. He once returned with more than 200 holes shot through the fuselage and wings of his plane. Attached to an Air Force unit, Mr. Glenn shot down three Soviet-made MiGs during the final nine days of the war in 1953, leading his crew to paint \u201c MiG Mad Marine \u201d on the side of his F-86 Sabre jet. After Korea, Mr. Glenn was a test pilot at the naval air station at Patuxent River, Md., and set a transcontinental speed record on July 16, 1957, by flying an F8U-1 Crusader jet coast to coast in 3 hours 23 minutes. He worked at the Navy\u2019s Bureau of Aeronautics and eventually was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree by Muskingum. He also found time in 1957 to appear on the game show \u201cName That Tune\u201d with child actor Eddie Hodges. They split $25,000 in prize money, which was more than Mr. Glenn\u2019s annual pay as a test pilot. When NASA began recruiting a team of astronauts, it sought skilled pilots who could withstand rigorous physical and psychological testing and who \u2014 to fit into cramped space capsules \u2014 were shorter than 5 feet 11 inches tall. (Mr. Glenn was 5-foot-10 1 / 2.) With their courage and know-how, the Mercury astronauts embodied the spirit of the \u201cNew Frontier\u201d espoused by Kennedy, and Mr. Glenn became friends with the youthful president and his brother Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general. Encouraged by the Kennedy family, Mr. Glenn resigned from the astronaut corps in 1964 to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio. He dropped out after slipping on a rug and striking his head on a bathtub, resulting in inner-ear problems that required extensive medical treatment. In 1965, he retired from the Marine Corps, having received six Distinguished Flying Crosses and 19 Air Medals. He then became an executive with Royal Crown Cola, invested in real estate and worked with a management company that operated Holiday Inns, particularly around Orlando. Within a few years, he was a millionaire. Mr. Glenn stayed close to the Kennedys and was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. He accompanied five of Kennedy\u2019s 10 children (an 11th was born after his death) back to their home in McLean, Va. The next morning, Mr. Glenn informed the other children that their father had been killed. \u201cWhen Bob died, I had to sit on the edge of the bed as each child was waking up and tell them their dad was not coming home,\u201d Mr. Glenn told a Muskingum audience in 1997. \u201cIt was one of the hardest things I ever did.\u201d He was a pallbearer at Robert Kennedy\u2019s funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and handed the flag from the coffin to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). Soon afterward, Mr. Glenn helped organize a group that successfully lobbied for passage of a national gun control act in 1968. \u2018I have held a job, Howard\u2019 Making a second bid for the Senate in 1970, Mr. Glenn called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, but he lost the Democratic primary in Ohio to businessman Howard M. Metzenbaum . Then-Rep. Robert Taft Jr., a Republican, won the general election. Early in 1974, Metzenbaum was appointed to the Senate to fill the expiring term of William B. Saxbe, who resigned to become U.S. attorney general. When Metzenbaum ran for a full Senate term that year, Mr. Glenn challenged him again in the primary. At a time when the military was unpopular, Metzenbaum repeatedly called Mr. Glenn \u201ccolonel\u201d and questioned his ability as a leader, saying he had never \u201cmet a payroll.\u201d The comment was widely seen as an insult, insinuating that Mr. Glenn had never held a \u201creal\u201d job. In a debate with Metzenbaum, the retired Marine flashed the steel beneath his benign Midwestern smile. \u201cI served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cI was through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by antiaircraft fire on 12 different occasions. \u201cI was in the space program. It wasn\u2019t my checkbook, it was my life that was on the line. . . . I ask you to go with me . . . to a veterans hospital, and look those men with their mangled bodies in the eye and tell them they didn\u2019t hold a job. \u201cYou go with me to any Gold Star mother, and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job. \u201c. . . Stand in Arlington National Cemetery \u2014 where I have more friends than I like to remember \u2014 and you watch those waving flags . . . and you tell me that those people didn\u2019t have a job. \u201cI tell you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men \u2014 some men \u2014 who held a job. . . . And their self-sacrifice is what has made this country possible. \u201cI have held a job, Howard.\u201d The powerful \u201cGold Star Mother\u201d speech, recognizing families that had lost children in foreign wars, quickly turned the polls in Mr. Glenn\u2019s favor. He defeated Metzenbaum in the primary and then easily won the November general election, sweeping all of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties. Reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992, Mr. Glenn was the first senator from Ohio to win four consecutive elections. A senator in space On Capitol Hill, Mr. Glenn was a strong supporter of the military and an authority on intelligence issues. He supported a woman\u2019s right to abortion and was an advocate of campaign finance reform, national health insurance and medical research. He sponsored bills to improve the safety of nursing homes, reduce government paperwork and limit nuclear proliferation. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee from 1988 to 1994, he helped create the Department of Veterans Affairs . In the late 1980s, Mr. Glenn\u2019s political action committee accepted a contribution from financier Charles H. Keating Jr. , who was at the center of a nationwide savings-and-loan scandal. The Senate Ethics Committee ruled that Mr. Glenn \u201cexercised poor judgment,\u201d but he was cleared of any wrongdoing. He made a run for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination but proved to be an awkward campaigner and quit the race early, saying, \u201cI humiliated my family, gained 16 pounds and went millions of dollars into debt.\u201d On Feb. 20, 1997, the 35th anniversary of his spaceflight, Mr. Glenn announced that he would not run for reelection in 1998. He established a public policy institute at Ohio State University and wrote his memoirs . In 2012, Mr. Glenn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. In addition to his wife, of Columbus and Bethesda, Md., survivors include two children, J. David Glenn of Berkeley, Calif., and Carolyn \u201cLyn\u201d Glenn of St. Paul, Minn.; and two grandsons. Revered for his heroism as an astronaut, Mr. Glenn remained close to the space program long after leaving NASA. In 1986, immediately after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, he made a little-publicized trip to Cape Canaveral to comfort the families of astronauts killed in the disaster. Every year, he sent the results of his physical exams to NASA, just in case. At 75, he could still do 75 push-ups. In 1996, he set a flying record by piloting a twin-engine plane from Dayton, Ohio, to Washington in 1 hour, 36 minutes. When Mr. Glenn was named to the crew of the space shuttle Discovery, skeptics said NASA was awarding him a vanity flight to make him, at 77, the oldest person ever to go into space. During the nine-day mission in 1998, Mr. Glenn helped film the flight and took part in experiments on aging. He made one of his final public appearances in June 2016, when the Columbus airport was renamed in his honor. His return to space was a reminder of what he had accomplished more than three decades earlier, when he soared into the heavens and gave renewed hope to a grateful nation. \u201cPeople are afraid of the future, of the unknown,\u201d he said in 1962. \u201cIf a man faces up to it and takes the dare of the future, he can have some control over his destiny.\u201d ",

    "text": "Union members march in Seoul with an effigy of South Korean President Park Geun-hye. (Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji) GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b South Korea\u2019s parliament introduced an impeachment motion against Park Geun-hye,\u00a0setting up a vote that will likely be delivered by the end of the week. ( AP ) Syrian government forces swept through the Old City of Aleppo, expanding Assad\u2019s control to some three-quarters of east Aleppo. The push comes as John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Germany to discuss a last-ditch agreement that would allow the city to be evacuated. ( Louisa Loveluck and Karen DeYoung ) Ohio lawmakers passed a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d that would prohibit abortion at the first sign of a fetal heartbeat \u2013 drastically reducing the legal time for abortion to just\u00a0six weeks (before many women even realize they are pregnant). Many\u00a0GOP lawmakers say they are energized by the promise of a more conservative Supreme Court that could actually overturn Roe v. Wade. ( Sandhya Somashekhar ) Life expectancy for Americans has declined for the first time in more than two decades, according to brand new health statistics, with a spike in fatalities caused by heart disease, strokes, diabetes, drug overdoses and more. In all, death rates rose for eight of the top 10 leading causes of death. ( Lenny Bernstein ) The surgeon general calls\u00a0the skyrocketing use of e-cigarettes among young people a \u201cmajor public health concern,\u201d urging policymakers to help keep the nicotine products away from young people as health officials continue to research possible detrimental effects.

Gen. John F. Kelly awards a Purple Heart to an injured Marine in San Antonio in 2011. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) TRUMP STOCKS HIS CABINET WITH GENERALS AND BILLIONAIRES: -- Trump selected retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security, recruiting a third former member of the military\u2019s brass to serve at the highest levels of his administration. From Philip Rucker and Mike DeBonis : \u201cTrump\u2019s choice of Kelly \u2014 and his continued deliberations about tapping as many as two more military figures for other posts \u2014 has intensified worries among some members of Congress and national security experts that the new administration\u2019s policies may be shaped disproportionately by military commanders. Despite making regular remarks on the campaign trail disparaging the nation\u2019s generals, Trump has long shown an affinity for them. In shaping his administration, Trump has prioritized what one adviser described as \u2018can-do, no-bull types,\u2019 which the president-elect sees as a deliberate contrast from the personnel choices President Obama has made.\u201d If confirmed, Kelly and defense secretary nominee James Mattis, a retired Marine general with the nickname \u201cMad Dog,\u201d would join retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s pick for White House national security adviser. Meanwhile, retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus is under consideration for secretary of state, and Navy Adm. Michael S. Rogers is a contender for director of national intelligence. Other figures with military backgrounds are populating the administration as well, including Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who graduated from West Point and served in the Army in the Gulf War, is Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, while Stephen K. Bannon, a former naval officer, will serve the president in the West Wing as chief strategist and senior counselor. -- A chorus of Senate Democrats decried the reliance on former brass: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee: \u201cI\u2019m concerned. Each of these individuals may have great merit in their own right, but what we\u2019ve learned over the past 15 years is that when we view problems in the world through a military lens, we make big mistakes.\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.): \u201cFor a guy who got four or five deferments from the draft, he seems pretty impressed with the military.\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.): \u201cIt\u2019s the G&G cabinet. It does seem to be fairly limited to Goldman Sachs and generals.\u201d -- But William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a Democrat who served as a White House policy adviser to former president Bill Clinton, said the concerns about generals \u201ccharging ahead\u201d with no regard for legal or constitutional constraints \u2014 or without a willingness to challenge the president\u2019s decisions \u2014 are misplaced. He told Rucker that modern-day generals are trained to navigate a minefield of potential conflicts and legal concerns. \u201cThey\u2019re schooled to believe that if they or any subordinates receive an unlawful order, it\u2019s not to be obeyed,\u201d Galston said. \u201cIf you asked me, would I prefer a government of generals or a government of lawyers, that\u2019s not an easy choice. We\u2019ve experimented with a government of lawyers, and that hasn\u2019t been so fantastic, has it? Maybe it\u2019s time to give the generals a chance.\u201d -- Trump will nominate wrestling magnate and twice-failed Senate candidate Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. \u201cLinda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the country\u2019s top female executives advising businesses around the globe,\u201d Trump said in the announcement. \u201cAnd while McMahon won\u2019t have a \u2018titantron,\u2019 or video package that plays as wrestlers enter the ring, when she steps into the White House for the first time, if she did, it probably would not look all that different from the one she used at WWE,\u201d WaPo sports reporter Marissa Payne notes.

Trump told the crowd at Cipriani that his fellow real estate developers could have negotiated a better deal for the Air Force One program \u2026 At Wednesday's over-capacity fundraiser, which was expected to raise at least $4 million for the nonprofit running Trump's transition effort, the president-elect indicated that he will continue to use his post to put pressure on individual corporations.

But economists and analysts \u2026 suggest it might be a bigger win for the Japanese telecom and Internet conglomerate, SoftBank, and its billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son. Analysts said the Japanese company could be angling for lucrative benefits, including the regulatory approval to carry out one of the largest telecom mergers in recent history, between Sprint, which SoftBank owns, and rival carrier T-Mobile. It could also be cultivating a friendly environment for further technology investments Son is seeking to make in the United States.

He appears likely to push the group to embrace the opportunities of the shifting political landscape, including possible cooperation with Trump \u2026 on lowering corporate taxes and rolling back environmental, financial and other regulations issued by the Obama administration. He also appears set to push the business community, and Trump, to work together on issues meant to help working-class Americans, such as investing in job-training programs. Dimon\u2019s champions inside the Roundtable say he is also likely to steer the group to confront Trump on several issues, most notably trade and immigration, where his campaign promises have broken with long-standing goals of the business lobby.\u201d Oklahoma Gov.

Last spring he even affirmed his endorsement of Trump while calling him out for racism. \u2026 Behold leadership at its most gelatinous. Discussing Trump on \u201860 Minutes,\u2019 he had a manner that was borderline coquettish. He said that Trump, with his tweets, was \u2018basically giving voice to a lot of people who have felt that they were voiceless.\u2019 Sometimes, yes. But many times, Trump is giving a green light to kooks and the finger to the dignity that Americans rightly expect of a president and that Ryan should demand of him. Ryan is sacrificing too much for too little, and it\u2019s time he rummaged through his wobbly endoskeleton and made fresh acquaintance with his spine. Until that happens, this sadly groveling Boy Scout will be lost in the woods.\" -- George F. Will says Trump\u2019s Carrier deal is the opposite of conservatism: \u201cSo, this is the new conservatism\u2019s recipe for restored greatness: Political coercion shall supplant economic calculation in shaping decisions by companies in what is called, with diminishing accuracy, the private sector. This will be done partly as conservatism\u2019s challenge to liberalism\u2019s supremacy in the victimhood sweepstakes, telling aggrieved groups that they are helpless victims of vast, impersonal forces, against which they can be protected only by government interventions. Although the president-elect has yet to dip a toe into the swamp, he practices the calculus by which Washington reasons, the political asymmetry between dispersed costs and concentrated benefits. \u2026 What formerly was called conservatism resisted the permeation of society by politics, and particularly by the sort of unconstrained executive power that has been wielded by the 44th president. The man who will be the 45th forthrightly and comprehensively repudiates the traditional conservative agenda and, in reversing it, embraces his predecessor\u2019s executive swagger.\" -- New York Magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait says Trump has proven liberals right about the Tea Party movement:\u00a0\"When the tea party appeared on the scene in 2009, an intense partisan dispute broke out as to just what this movement represented. Conservatives insisted that what spurred protesters into streets and town halls were the timeless principles of conservative movement thought: advocacy of balanced budgets, adherence to a strict constructionist version of the Constitution, opposition to 'crony capitalism,' and skepticism of Keynesian economics. Liberals suggested a different explanation. The tea party was an expression of ethno-nationalist rage centered around a black president and the belief that his coalition stood for redistribution from older, white America ... One could not have devised a sequence of events more perfectly designed to prove the liberal theory of the case than the election of Trump. It\u2019s one thing to suspect tea-party rhetoric was phony, quite another to believe the entire GOP could disregard every single putative principle of the movement even before it had its hands on power.

Andrew Harnik/AP With Donald Trump's choices for secretaries of transportation and of Housing and Urban Development \u2014 Elaine Chao and Dr. Ben Carson, respectively \u2014 there may be hints about the urban agenda Trump's administration may be shaping. Some big-city mayors say they're worried about potential cuts in federal funding that candidate Trump warned about on the stump, and they are reaching out to the president-elect. They say they have plenty of ideas they want to share about the country's cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to President Obama, met Wednesday with Trump, at his invitation. It gave Emanuel a chance to hand-deliver a letter from mayors of some of the country's largest cities. Mayor Rahm Emanuel: 'Chicago Always Will Be A Sanctuary City' The letter asks Trump to continue the Obama administration policy that prevents the deportation of so-called DREAMers \u2014 young immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16 years old and so named for meeting the requirements under the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act proposal that would have created a pathway to citizenship for them. \"We are clear as mayors that these are DREAMers who are seeking the American dream, and we should embrace them rather than do a bait-and-switch,\" Emanuel says. Article continues after sponsorship Trump Vows To End 'Sanctuary Cities,' But No One Can Agree What That Label Means During his campaign, Trump said he would reverse protections, but recently said he would work to find a solution for DREAMers.

    "text": "The Screen Age The next level Video games are more addictive than ever. This is what happens when kids can\u2019t turn them off. Photos by Mark Abramson Published on December 7, 2016 It was nearing midnight when she slipped out of bed, padded across the wood floors and peered into the room across the hall. Her 15-year-old son was still awake, like she knew he would be, sitting in his bed, staring at his laptop screen. This had long been his nightly ritual: After hours spent playing video games \u2014 riveted by a world of guns and gore, adrenaline pumping \u2014 he would unwind by watching videos of other gamers playing. Turn it off, she said. I need to finish, he said. No, she said. Their voices got louder. She doesn\u2019t remember exactly what made him reach for the glass on his bedside table. He threw it with such force that it spun across the room and shattered against his closet door, carving a two-inch gash in the white painted wood. Tiny shards glinted on the striped rug. By then, the family\u2019s stately home in New York was riddled with such scars \u2014 nicks in the walls, scratches in the floor, a divot in the marble countertop lining the kitchen sink. All remnants of the boy\u2019s outbursts, which had intensified over the years, almost always triggered by a simple request from his parents: Byrne, please turn off the game. Please get off the computer. When Byrne threw the glass, his mother, Robin, didn\u2019t panic; she mostly felt numb. For five years, she and her husband, Terrence, had felt their son slipping away \u2014 descending deeper and deeper into a realm they didn\u2019t like or understand, consumed by the virtual worlds shared by millions of strangers, all reachable through his Xbox and his computer. Robin and Terrence had conferred with therapists, medical experts and school counselors to try to help their son. Just weeks before, they had turned to an education consultant, who helped them come up with a plan: Byrne had to go away \u2014 first, to a summerlong wilderness therapy program, where he could reconnect with himself and the real world around him, and then to a boarding school. He had to start over, in a place with strict structure, where he couldn\u2019t spend his days immersed in video games. His parents knew it was their last option. If this new plan couldn\u2019t save their son, maybe nothing could. Byrne plays Overwatch. (Mark Abramson/for The Washington Post) Video games are nothing new, and neither are reports of game addiction. But today\u2019s most popular games are wholly immersive: Vast digital landscapes unfold in eye-popping detail, nuanced characters evolve from one level to the next. These games are deliberately designed, with the help of psychology consultants, to make players want to keep playing, and they are available on every platform \u2014 gaming consoles, computers, smartphones. Today\u2019s teens are more tethered to this technology than any previous generation; these so-called \u201cdigital natives\u201d have been playing more sophisticated games at younger ages than their parents ever did. The games have been criticized as an escape from human interaction, but some offer a different sort of social connection: MMOs \u2014 or massively multiplayer online games \u2014 allow gamers to play together from any place at any time, and many describe a powerful sense of attachment to those who share this virtual realm. Logging off is that much harder for kids who feel a very real bond to their online friends and teammates. The result, experts say, is a steep rise in the number of parents worried that their kids are in fact addicted, or at least compulsively devoted, to the games. A residential facility called reSTART, the nation\u2019s first therapeutic retreat devoted specifically to Internet addiction, launched a new adolescent program last month after receiving a barrage of calls from parents desperate to separate their children from video games, consoles, computers and smartphones. A small but growing number of psychologists across the United States have begun to specialize in treating children who struggle with compulsive gaming and screen use. [ This dark side of the Internet is costing young people their jobs and social lives ] \u201cI don\u2019t think we know exactly how many are suffering from this, but we know it\u2019s a big problem,\u201d said psychologist Kimberly Young, founder of the Center for Internet Addiction . \u201cA modest estimate might be 5 percent. But 5 percent of American kids is a lot.\u201d Boys tend to be more susceptible to compulsive gaming than girls, but any kid who is trying to avoid overwhelming stress \u2014 bullies at school, a difficult home environment, social anxiety \u2014 might be especially drawn to video games. Experts also see a correlation between obsessive video game use and traits associated with autism, attention deficit disorders, anxiety and depression, although the exact nature of the connection is not fully understood. Whatever the causes behind this unhealthy attachment, at least one common factor comes through, said Kim McDaniel, a therapist and parent coach who specializes in the compulsive use of electronics. \u201cThe biggest impression I get,\u201d she said, \u201cis that we have this generation of teens and kids who are just so lonely.\u201d Terrence holds a letter and drawing Byrne made as a small child. (Mark Abramson/for The Washington Post) Terrence and Robin say they were never the kind of parents who parked their children in front of the TV or relied on computer games and electronic gadgets to keep them occupied. Terrence, a pragmatic government employee, and Robin, an artistic owner of a small business, made it a priority to spend uninterrupted time with their two boys. They read books with Byrne and his brother, who is three years older, every day. The family cooked meals together and often took long outdoor walks. The couple revisited their memories of Byrne\u2019s childhood on a recent November evening, sitting together at their dining room table in the 1920s-era house where Byrne and his older brother grew up, nestled behind a row of tall pines on a quiet, small-town street. They both spoke thoughtfully, often completing each other\u2019s sentences. They asked that their family be identified using middle names to protect their privacy. The first signs of Byrne\u2019s anxious and obsessive behavior surfaced at 4, when he would agonize over which book to read at bedtime: \u201cIt had to be the just right\u00a0book,\u201d Robin recalled. In first grade, he excitedly brought his class roster home and called his classmates over and over to set up play dates, with such persistence that the families on the other end of the line rarely obliged. Byrne was 6 when he first saw a therapist. At 10, he was hospitalized in a pediatric psychiatric unit; doctors told his parents that their highly intelligent, highly sensitive son had severe anxiety. Soon after, his therapist diagnosed him with ADD. Byrne had trouble making friends, partly because of his obsessive behavior, partly because of his strong personal convictions. In fourth grade, when Byrne heard a couple of classmates complain that the school\u2019s celebration of Black History Month was unnecessary, he launched into a passionate and eloquent rebuke. His teachers were impressed; his peers shunned him even more. It was around that time when a relative gave Byrne and his brother an Xbox. Gaming was deemed a privilege Byrne would lose if he misbehaved. But that structure soon proved hard to implement. \u201cHe was relentless about asking when he could play \u2014 it was a continuous negotiation,\u201d Robin said. The routine grew exhausting, she added, and sometimes she and Terrence caved in to Byrne\u2019s demands. \u201cThe games were his refuge.\u201d The pattern worsened after Byrne entered middle school. \u201cIn seventh grade the downward spiral began, after having maintained High Honor Roll for one quarter, I was given a laptop. This is when my addiction to screens began.\u201d Byrne wrote these words years later as part of a reflective essay assignment while he was away at the wilderness therapy program. \u201cIn eighth grade, my grades continued to be high, but my parents began to notice my addiction to xbox and my laptop worsening.\u201d Robin and Terrence take a walk together near their home. Byrne had frequent arguments with his brother, who had once enjoyed playing games with him, and the two began to spend less time together. One by one, Byrne quit the sports teams that he\u2019d once loved \u2014 football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, sailing. He protested whenever his family made plans to leave the house. \u201cAnything other than video games,\u201d Robin said, \u201che called \u2018a waste of time.\u2019 \u201d At the height of his obsession, Byrne\u2019s games of choice were from the \u201cCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\u201d series \u2014 first-person shooter games that are every bit as absorbing and nerve-racking as a real military battle simulation or an action movie, replete with stunning graphics, sound effects and atmospheric theme music. The gamer becomes the soldier: Leaves crunch beneath his combat boots as he stalks through an open field, gun raised. There is the sound of a thumping heartbeat when an enemy guard appears in the crosshairs, the soft ping\u00a0of the bullet firing, a sharp inhalation of breath and a burst of dark blood as the guard falls. Every movement, every shot fired, every victory within the game is accompanied by real-life physical and neurological responses: The gamer\u2019s muscles tighten, the pulse pounds, and the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex \u2014 its pleasure center \u2014 is activated. [ Instagram, Wattpad and YouNow aren\u2019t just apps \u2014 for many teens, they\u2019re more than that. ] Researchers are still trying to figure out exactly how and why video games affect the brain. One 1998 study showed that video games raise the level of dopamine in the brain by about 100 percent, roughly the same increase triggered by sex. (And that was nearly 20 years ago \u2014 today\u2019s games have evolved far beyond what was available then.) More recent research found measurable changes in the parts of the brain linked to cognitive function and emotional control after study subjects spent one week playing violent video games. After Byrne\u2019s prolonged periods of play, his parents noticed that his temperament was unusually volatile. The muscles in his back and neck felt tense and tight. His eyes would sometimes twitch. Lines of dialogue from the games would pop into his mind unbidden. At school, the class dismissal bell occasionally sounded just like the two-tone chime that signaled a new friend joining a game online \u2014 a sort of auditory hallucination that researchers refer to as Game Transfer Phenomena (GTP), in which the boundaries between reality and the game begin to blur. Nicholas Kardaras, a New York psychotherapist and author who specializes in addiction, still remembers the very first gamer he treated who suffered from GTP: a teenage boy in a Metallica T-shirt who appeared frightened and confused as he sat in Kardaras\u2019s office. The boy blinked, looking up at the ceiling, then down at the floor. \u201cDo you know where you are?\u201d the psychotherapist asked him. The boy was quiet for a moment. Then he asked: \u201cAre we still in the game?\u201d Byrne plays video games at his family\u2019s home. \u201cWhen ninth grade rolled around, I began to ignore my responsibilities as a student for screens. I began to [make] more friends, however I did not notice that these people were making fun of me nonstop.\u201d Byrne\u2019s classmates only really hung out with him through video games \u2014 each in their separate homes, connected online and through headsets that allowed them to chat while they played. But the same social hierarchy followed Byrne from his school hallways into the games, where the other boys continued to tease him. Byrne tried to laugh it off; being mocked still seemed better than being ignored altogether. His parents noticed that he was often upset when the games ended. But he insisted on going back, because he felt he had nowhere else to go. [ How to protect kids online: Apps and tactics used by experts \u2013 and real parents ] When Byrne started failing classes and refusing to go to school in 10th grade, his parents knew their situation had grown dire. They hired the education consultant who urged them to enroll Byrne in a private boarding school. The thought of sending him away was wrenching \u2014 but also hopeful. \u201cFinally, we had a path,\u201d Terrence said. \u201cWe just had to figure out how to pay for it.\u201d Because video-game addiction isn\u2019t recognized as an official diagnosis by the guidebook of American psychiatry, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \u2014 which cites \u201cInternet Gaming Disorder\u201d as a condition warranting more research \u2014 medical insurance doesn\u2019t cover treatment, which can quickly climb into the tens of thousands. Byrne\u2019s parents said they took out a second mortgage on their home, raided their savings, ran up their credit cards and applied for financial aid to help cover the $25,000 summer-long therapy program and the annual $50,000 private school tuition. \u201cWe knew, if we do this, and it doesn\u2019t work, then we know we\u2019ve done everything,\u201d Robin said. \u201cAnd you will do anything for your kid.\u201d Byrne wanted to go to the boarding school; he was eager to get away, to start over. He was less thrilled about the wilderness program but understood that it was mandatory. When his family dropped him off for 10 weeks in Vermont in June 2015, he handed over his phone and said goodbye. His parents returned to a quiet house, filled with memories of a painful past that they wanted to leave behind. So Robin gathered years\u2019 worth of files \u2014 towering stacks of teachers\u2019 reports, special education plans, insurance forms and her own notes \u2014 and carried them into the sunny living room. She knelt beside the brick-lined fireplace and struck a match. Then she fed the papers to the flames, watching as they withered and crumbled to ash. Byrne relaxes with his mother during a visit at home over fall break. Byrne is 17 now, a sweet-natured, soft-spoken kid with glasses and a mop of tousled brown hair. He speaks with his father\u2019s baritone voice and his mother\u2019s thoughtful eloquence. He lives on a sloping, wooded campus in New England, where his days are filled with classes and organized outings. Now in his junior year \u2014 he had to repeat 10th grade \u2014 he earns mostly A\u2019s and B\u2019s. He has a circle of friends and a roommate he describes as \u201chilarious\u201d and \u201ccompassionate.\u201d On Saturdays, Byrne goes sailing with the school team. On Sundays, he does his homework and orders pizza for dinner with his friends. And, once or twice a week, he allows himself to play video games. This concerns his parents; they worry that his struggle to distance himself from the games isn\u2019t over, that the risk of relapse always looms. Byrne feels he has a healthier relationship to the games now. \u201cI have to do my work, then I can play,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more like, \u2018I can do this for a treat.\u2019 \u201d But he knows he\u2019ll always have to monitor himself carefully. He wants to go to college to become a counselor, to help other kids who are struggling like he has. He is repairing his relationship with his big brother, who began to drift away from Byrne when he became consumed by the games. Lately, he\u2019s been into a game called Overwatch, a multiplayer first-person shooter game\u00a0made by the creators of World of Warcraft, the most lucrative online video game in history. Set in a future version of Earth, Overwatch has an intricate story line and a cast of \u201cheroes,\u201d each with different skills and detailed biographies. Byrne plays the game with online friends and has become close to many of them: \u201cEveryone likes me there,\u201d he said. He plays at his desk in the corner of his dorm room, a bright, messy space strewn with shoes and laundry and smelling faintly of microwave popcorn and gym socks. On a recent Sunday afternoon, he settled into his chair and opened his laptop, a model specifically designed for gameplay. The screen was a blur of chaotic motion as his character stormed from one level to the next, through bright streets and towering canyons and apocalyptic underworlds. The illuminated keyboard bathed Byrne\u2019s fingers in rainbow-colored lights. The speakers blasted the sounds of grunts, gunfire and shouts. The world is worth fighting for! said the character he\u2019d chosen for the game, a nerdy but powerful female scientist named Mei. Byrne smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the lines that pops into my mind sometimes,\u201d he said, and repeated it as his right hand furiously clicked the mouse. \u201cThe world is worth fighting for.\u201d Outside the tall windows, the day faded to late afternoon, the shadows of trees lengthening over the yellowed grass. Soon it was four o\u2019clock, and Byrne had been playing for several hours. The guys would be ordering pizza soon, before evening study hall. Byrne had final exams to prepare for. The sound of his friends\u2019 laughter echoed in the hallway. On the computer, a countdown ticked: Next game starts in 20 seconds \u2026 19 \u2026 18 \u2026 His hand moved across the glowing keyboard, and with a soft click, the world on the screen disappeared. Byrne visits his family at home during fall break from school. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story And any scaling back of fuel-economy goals by the Trump administration, if Mr. Pruitt\u2019s climate change skepticism and embrace of fossil fuels translates to policy, could also influence the types of vehicles the industry plans to build in coming years \u2014 and where it builds them. Bigger models like sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are less fuel-efficient than cars but more profitable for automakers. And their steeper price tags can help pay for the higher labor costs of making them in the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a move that underscored the new psychology since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ford Motor \u2014 which had been a target of his criticism \u2014 in mid-November decided to keep building a Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky rather than Mexico. And yet, for a capital-intensive industry that routinely makes billion dollar bets on new factories and products, the uncertainty is unnerving. \u201cOur membership is just perplexed right now,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, vice president for public affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen carmakers, including General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota, on safety and environmental issues. \u201cThis is all uncharted territory.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was studded with promises that could upend the status quo, including some to relax policies intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has yet to detail any coming changes. But pursuing policies similar to those he promoted in his campaign could change the entire manufacturing industry by penalizing companies for investing overseas or by stifling free-flowing global trade. Mr. Trump has yet to specify changes he might make to Nafta or other industrial policies. But his cabinet appointments, particularly the selection for commerce secretary of the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. , who has suggested that he is receptive to some of the antitrade views favored by Mr. Trump, indicate that the incoming president may take an aggressive approach to modifying trade deals and other tenets of the outgoing Obama administration. One industry analyst, Ron Harbour of the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said many voters in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio backed Mr. Trump primarily because of his promises to restore manufacturing jobs in the United States. \u201cSo there probably will be pressure to do something,\u201d Mr. Harbour said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t do anything, they probably are not going to be too thrilled.\u201d Mr. Trump will inherit an auto industry that is far healthier than when President Obama took office and industry officials could push back strongly on disruptive changes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But auto executives generally support Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of a former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, Elaine Chao \u2014 who is also the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell \u2014 to head the Transportation Department. The department oversees fuel-economy and safety rules that affect the types of vehicles that automakers produce. \u201cWe all have a common interest, and that is to maximize the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy,\u201d the auto alliance said in response to Ms. Chao\u2019s appointment. No change would be more consequential to the auto industry than applying steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and elsewhere. Companies could be forced to radically change how and where they get commodity parts, the production of which has been migrating to low-wage nations for decades. Consumers could see a change in the types of cars available. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, the American automotive industry and auto jobs have been buoyant since the Obama administration\u2019s bailout. Since 2010, vehicle production has doubled in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been hired. Last year, a record 17.4 million cars and trucks were sold in the United States, and analysts forecast strong demand for several years. \u201cYou have record levels of production and record levels of demand,\u201d said Mike Jackson of the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThere is every reason for the industry to emphasize that it\u2019s in a very strong position.\u201d Still, the industry is anticipating changes from Mr. Trump. Ford, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker after General Motors, uncharacteristically made public a decision to keep production of the Lincoln S.U.V. in Kentucky, after Mr. Trump had singled out the company for its growing investments in Mexico. Ford, like G.M., Fiat Chrysler and nearly every foreign automaker, has a huge stake in protecting the interlocking network of factories and parts suppliers made possible by Nafta. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Plants in Mexico are crucial to meeting surging demand for new vehicles in the United States. Beyond that, automakers have already committed big investments to new plants in Mexico to take advantage of its cheaper labor and export-friendly trade agreements. While Mr. Trump has yet to specify how he would renegotiate Nafta, his emphasis has been on increasing American jobs and discouraging automakers from using foreign plants to supply the American market. His proposal to put tariffs of as much as 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico has stunned auto executives who have built their business models on open borders for cars, trucks and the thousands of parts in them. \u201cA tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Mark Fields, chief executive of Ford. Imported vehicles are an integral part of the American market and account for more than 40 percent of its annual volume. Last year, about eight million cars, trucks and sport utilities sold in the United States were built elsewhere, primarily in Mexico, Canada, Japan and Korea. Nearly all of them enter the market free of tariffs that would increase sticker prices significantly. Increasing the price of an imported vehicle with tariffs could reduce overall vehicle sales and exert economic pressure on manufacturers as well as on freight haulers, dealerships and independent service centers. And if Mr. Trump chooses to impose tariffs on auto parts produced abroad and shipped to plants in the United States, the impact will spread further. Last year, auto parts worth $143 billion were imported into the United States, about 35 percent of them from Mexico, compared with $81 billion in parts that were exported, according to the Commerce Department. Many big suppliers, however, are global and make parts in every region of the world. The parts industry\u2019s largest American trade group, the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, said its member companies employed more than 734,000 workers in the United States, and generated another 2.9 million jobs in related businesses. The industry is acutely sensitive to changes in trade policies that could have a ripple effect on its ability to ship parts in and out of the country. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And like automakers, parts manufacturers are anxious to know what Mr. Trump has in store for them. \u201cNow that the election is over, we can begin to explore what to expect in the months to come,\u201d the trade group\u2019s president, Steve Handschuh, wrote in a letter to its members, adding that he was eager \u201cto express our priorities\u201d to the Trump transition team. In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on trade issues, the industry is expecting policies that diverge from the Obama administration\u2019s enthusiastic support of electric cars, including the $7,500 tax credits that encouraged consumers to buy them, and for the testing and development of self-driving vehicles. In a Nov. 10 letter to the Trump transition team, the auto alliance asked for clarity on policy changes as soon as possible. \u201cAuto manufacturing is a highly capital-intensive business, and because of that we rely on long-term certainty,\u201d Ms. Bergquist wrote. Yet the industry has proved to be adaptable to shifts in government, whether by building more fuel-efficient vehicles to meet new regulations, or increasing investments in Mexico because of Nafta. It is also more focused on self-interest than politics. In its eight-page letter, the auto alliance laid out several goals \u2014 including repeating its position that the government re-evaluate its timetable for automakers to achieve fleetwide fuel economy of 54.5 miles a gallon. But while the letter was perceived as tailored to Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, Ms. Bergquist said it was composed before the election and would have been sent to an incoming Clinton administration had the outcome been different. \u201cOur position was the same, no matter who won,\u201d she said.

    "text": "Photo Credit Getty Images Until recently, many scientists believed that exercise reduces the body\u2019s ability to fight off infections. Past studies had found, for example, that after workouts, especially strenuous ones, people had fewer infection-fighting white blood cells in their bloodstreams than before working out, suggesting that their immune response had been weakened. But a timely new review of studies about exercise and immunity indicates that the interactions between exercise and immunity are far more intricate than scientists once suspected. Some types of workouts may hinder the immune response, according to the review, while others bolster it. Encouragingly, it also seems that a few simple precautions, including consuming carbohydrates during exhausting workouts, might help to keep our immune systems robust. To learn more about the latest science concerning exercise and immunity, I contacted two of the authors of the new review, which was published last week in the Journal of Applied Physiology . Jonathan M. Peake is a lecturer in sports science at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, while his co-author Oliver Neubauer is a senior research fellow at the same university. What follows are edited excerpts from our conversation. Q. Why would exercise affect the immune system in the first place? Jonathan Peake: Exercise is a form of stress. The immune system responds to stress. Q. What actually happens to the immune system during a workout? Dr. Peake: White blood cell numbers typically increase in the blood during exercise, much as they would during an infection. Body temperature rises, and immune cells move from the lymph nodes, spleen, the walls of blood vessels, and the bone marrow into the bloodstream. The stimulus here is obviously not infectious, but occurs because of a rise in stress hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and growth hormone, which all can increase during exercise. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Q. And after exercise? Dr. Peake: The number of white blood cells in the bloodstream, especially a type of cell that is particularly good at fighting infections known as natural killer cells, rapidly falls. People often have fewer natural killer cells in their blood after exercise than before they started. For many years, it was thought that exercise was destroying these cells and causing immunodepression. Q. But it isn\u2019t? Dr. Peake: We now believe that the cells are not destroyed. Instead, it\u2019s more likely they move out of the bloodstream and to other regions of the body, such as the lungs, gut, skin and mucous membranes of the respiratory system. This occurs in part because we can breathe in or ingest microorganisms that wind up in these tissues and require an immune response, but also because the stress of exercise causes physiological and biochemical changes within these tissues. As a result, signals go out from the tissues to the immune cells in the blood telling them that there is a potential threat to the body there, and the immune cells move to those tissues. Q. So although we get more infection-fighting cells in our bloodstream during a workout, many of them wind up diverted afterward into other parts of the body? Can this development leave us particularly vulnerable to infections after a stressful workout? Dr. Peake: Yes. Q. What if the exercise is relatively moderate, like a brisk walk or easy jog, instead of a more intense workout? Dr. Peake: Epidemiological evidence suggests that regular moderate exercise protects against upper respiratory illnesses, whereas regular intense exercise increases the risk of upper respiratory illnesses. Q. Because moderate exercise likely results in less physiological stress throughout the body than more vigorous exercise? Dr. Peake: That\u2019s fair to say. The stress hormones that regulate activity of the immune system respond to intensity and duration. Generally speaking, the more strenuous the exercise, the longer it takes for the immune system to return to normal afterward. Q. For people who train hard and would prefer not to repeatedly catch colds, is there any way to maintain a healthy immune response? Advertisement Oliver Neubauer: Ingesting carbohydrates during vigorous exercise may help, because carbohydrates maintain blood sugar levels. Having stable blood sugar levels reduces the body\u2019s stress response, which in turn, moderates any undesirable mobilization of immune cells. Q. How much carbohydrate? And when? Dr. Neubauer: Most people only need carbohydrates during high-intensity or prolonged exercise that lasts for 90 minutes or more. For them, between 30 and 60 grams \u2014 which is 1 or 2 ounces \u2014 of carbohydrates per hour during exercise could minimize immune disturbances related to exercise. Consuming carbohydrates in the first few hours immediately after strenuous exercise also helps to restore immune function. Q. Any additional advice for those of us who work out and wish to stay well? Dr. Peake: Washing your hands often and avoiding contact with sick people will also help. ",

Hundreds of thousands of protestors marched in Seoul for the sixth straight week on December 3, to demand the ouster and arrest of scandal-hit President Park Geun-Hye ahead of an impeachment vote in parliament. Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images South Korea's national legislature is preparing to vote on the possible impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, who has been engulfed in a massive scandal involving allegations of corruption, influence-peddling and ties to a cult. The measure is coming up for a vote on Friday, a week and a half after Park said she would be willing to step down \u2014 but declined to resign . The complex scandal has destroyed Park's public support; her approval rating has fallen to 4 percent, according to a recent Gallup Korea poll, Reuters reports. Swirling Scandal Involving Shamanistic Cult Threatens S. Korean President Protests have brought hundreds of thousands of South Koreans onto the streets to demand Park's resignation. As NPR's Elise Hu has explained, the revelations that have caused uproar in North Korea involve a close friend of Park's, and a tangle of allegations of undue influence and access to confidential information. \"This scandal involves not only tens of millions of dollars and charges of influence-peddling, but of spiritual guides from a 'Shamanistic prophet,' voices from the dead and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 dressage, the competitive form of horse-dancing,\" Elise wrote in October . The president's friend, Choi Soon-sil, is the daughter of a man who ran a church that's been described as a cult. She runs nonprofit foundations and is accused of using access to the president to put pressure on Korean conglomerates to rake in millions for private benefit. Some of the money allegedly went to cover equestrian training supplies for her daughter. Special prosecutors have concluded that the president colluded in her friend's alleged crimes, Elise has reported \u2014 but Park is immune from criminal indictment as long as she's in office. Article continues after sponsorship S. Korean President Named As A Criminal Suspect In Cronyism Scandal Park has also been criticized for her handling of the sinking of the Sewol ferry, a disaster that killed more than 300 people, most of them high school students. Reporting for The Washington Post, Anna Fifield writes that every president in South Korea's history as a democracy has been caught up in some kind of bribery or corruption scandal. \"But those scandals were centered on relatives \u2014 usually brothers and sons \u2014 of the presidents, while this one is focused directly on the president herself, causing widespread public anger,\" Fifield writes. \"Park, who is estranged from her siblings and has no children, campaigned for the presidency by saying that her lack of family meant she could be free from corruption.\" The scandal has driven the calls for Park's resignation \u2014 or barring that, her impeachment. S. Korean President Says She's Open To Stepping Down, But Doesn't Resign \"Impeachment is a tricky and lengthy process,\" Elise explains. \"The national legislature would have to approve an impeachment measure by a two-thirds vote. That would require more than two dozen votes from Park's ruling Saenuri Party. ... Then, a constitutional court including justices appointed by Park would have to approve the impeachment.\" The first step \u2014 the impeachment measure \u2014 is what's now on the table at the National Assembly. If the measure fails, the opposition lawmakers have vowed to resign their seats, Xinhua reports . The measure has been introduced but is currently in a mandatory 24-hour waiting period. The vote could happen as soon as 3 p.m. Friday local time (1 a.m. EST). ",

(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) It took astronaut John Glenn a decade to get to Washington, but once he was here, he mostly stayed put for the next 2\u00bd decades \u2014 at least, when he wasn't back in orbit. From 1974 to 1999, Glenn, who died Wednesday at 95 , served four terms in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat from Ohio. In contrast\u00a0to his flashy, heroic space career, he had a reputation in Washington as more of a behind-the-scenes bipartisan lawmaker; his Senate record is a throwback to an era when dealmaking\u00a0was still the norm in Washington. \u201cFor all his nine years in Washington, the Senator is still better known as an icon of the Space Age than as a compelling leader whose speeches and legislation shape public and Congressional opinion,\u201d wrote the New York Times Magazine in 1983. There were low moments, of course, like a Senate Ethics committee declaring he had used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d for associating with savings and loan shark Charles Keating in the 1980s deregulation crisis. (In total, five senators were caught up in the scandal.) There was a 1976 Democratic National Convention address that fell flat and cost him the vice presidency, and his failed 1984 run for president that ended with his campaign millions in debt for two decades. Glenn was also on hand with\u00a0Robert Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. But Glenn's Senate career featured some big highlights. Here are three of the biggest. 1. \u201cIt wasn't my checkbook, it was my life that was on the line\u201d In\u00a01974, during Glenn's third attempt running for U.S. Senate in Ohio, he was again facing his nemesis Sen. Howard Metzenbaum in the Democratic primary. Metzenbaum, a self-made millionaire, had started referring to\u00a0Glenn as someone who had never held a job. In response, at a city club debate, Glenn delivered one of the most memorable speeches of his political career \u2014 and, arguably, the one that made it. Here it is: I have spent 23 years in the U.S. Marine Corps. I was in two wars. I flew 149 missions. I was in the space program. It wasn't my checkbook, it was my life that was on the line. You go with me as I went the other day out to a veteran's hospital, look at those men out there with their mangled bodies in the eye and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star Mother and you look her in the eye and you tell her that her son did not hold a job. You go to Arlington National Cemetery where I have more friends than I like to remember, and you think about this nation, and you tell me that those people didn't have a job. I tell you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men \u2014 some men \u2014 who held a job. And they required a dedication to purpose and a love of country and a dedication to duty that was more important than life itself. And their self-sacrifice is what has made this nation possible. I have held a job, Howard. The crowd erupted in applause. Glenn went on to defeat Metzenbaum in the primary by eight points and win the Senate seat he'd hold for 2\u00bd more decades. (A decade later, Metzenbaum was again running for Senate and facing a strong challenge from George Voinovich. Glenn \u2014 then the most popular politician in Ohio, said Brooklyn College history Professor Robert David Johnson \u2014 appeared\u00a0in an ad defending his old rival\u00a0and helping him seal a win.) 2. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act is the defining piece of legislation in Glenn's career and of the U.S. commitment to nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The law basically required that the United States work with countries that had signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if they wanted to import U.S. nuclear energy. It was\u00a0the first U.S. law aimed specifically at promoting global nuclear nonproliferation, and Glenn, along with a handful of other bipartisan lawmakers, wrote it. When he signed it into law in 1978, President Jimmy Carter said the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act was \u201ca major step forward toward fulfillment of an objective which the United States shares with other nations \u2014 a halt in the spread of nuclear weapons capability while preserving the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\u201d 3.\u00a0A return to space John Glenn gets ready to blast off one more time in October 1998. (Pat Benic/Reuters) During his political career, Glenn never stopped looking to the stars. Thirty-six years after his first spaceflight, Glenn eventually convinced NASA to send him up to space again. In 1998, after two years of lobbying, he convinced them to include\u00a0him in\u00a0a Discovery space shuttle flight as\u00a0\u201c a human guinea pig for geriatric studies.\u201d So on\u00a0Oct. 29, at age 77, Glenn blasted off again. He was the oldest person to fly in space and the only sitting member of Congress to do so. (The flight took place several months before Glenn retired from Congress.) Along with six other astronauts, Glenn spent\u00a0nine days in space, where NASA studied the similarities between aging in space and on Earth \u2014 knowledge that may be crucial\u00a0if humans ever want to live\u00a0in space for years at a time. After stepping down in 1998, Glenn founded and occasionally taught at an\u00a0institute for public policy at Ohio State University, which is now the John Glenn College\u00a0of Public Affairs. One of his last trips to Washington came in 2012, at age 90, when President Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \u201cHe reminds everybody, don't tell him he's lived a historic life,\u201d Obama said as he draped the nation's highest civilian honor around Glenn's neck.\u00a0\u201cHe says '[is] living,' don't put it into the past tense because he still has a lot of stuff going on.\u201d politics ",

The Marine Corps identified Captain Jake Frederick as the pilot who ejected from his F/A-18C+ fighter aircraft after it went down 120 miles off the coast of Iwakuni, Japan. The Japanese Defense Ministry had announced earlier in the day that a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force ship had recovered Frederick. \"He is pronounced deceased,\" Marine Corps said in a statement today. \"We will provide more releasable information after the 24-hour window. Our deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of the pilot. The cause of the crash is still unknown.\" A timeline posted on the Japanese ministry's website indicated that the missing pilot was spotted at 1:05 a.m. ET by the 71st Air Division and rescued five minutes later. Frederick was taken to the base at Iwakuni, Japan, officials said, but no details of the pilot's condition were provided. Initial efforts to locate Frederick on Wednesday proved unsuccessful leading U.S. and Japanese officials to broaden the search radius and increase the number of search assets. A search-and-rescue operation was launched on Wednesday after Frederick ejected from his F/A-18 aircraft during a scheduled training mission. Search Underway for Marine Pilot Who Ejected Near Japanese Coast Frederick had ejected at about 4:40 a.m. ET, 120 miles southeast of Iwakuni, Japan, according to Marine Corps Base Camp Butler in Okinawa. The F/A-18 was assigned to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Okinawa and was conducting \"regularly scheduled training at the time of the mishap,\" Marine Corps Base Camp Butler said. Another F/A-18 fighter that was flying alongside Frederick's aircraft remained in the area until it had to leave because it was running out of fuel, officials said. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Wednesday that a number of U.S. and Japanese air and surface vessels were involved in the search-and-rescue efforts. The USS Montford Point, an expeditionary Transfer Dock, was searching the area and the guided missile destroyer USS Wilbur Curtis was moving to the search area, officials said at the time the search-and-rescue efforts were launched. Three Japanese ships and multiple Japanese fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft also assisted in the search, officials said. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "John Glenn dies at 95; hero was first American to orbit Earth John Glenn on past, future of space program Former astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his past missions and the future of the U.S. space program. (AP) Former astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn sat down with the Associated Press to discuss his past missions and the future of the U.S. space program. (AP) Geraldine Baum and Valerie J. Nelson When his bell-shaped capsule splashed into the ocean after orbiting Earth again and again, John Glenn emerged an instant hero \u2014 the fighter-jock pilot of few words who in just five hours of circling the planet helped cement America\u2019s faith that it could lead the race into outer space. He walked across the deck of the aircraft carrier where Friendship 7 had been lowered as casually\u00a0as a guy who\u2019d just returned from running a crosstown errand, exuding a confidence and swagger later mythologized in Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d Decades later, at the age of 77, Glenn would return to space on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery after selling himself as a human guinea pig who would demonstrate the effects of space travel on the elderly. \u00a0 Glenn, who also served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Ohio, died Thursday at the age of 95 after being hospitalized Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cWhen John Glenn blasted off from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas rocket in 1962, he lifted the hopes of a nation. And when his Friendship 7 spacecraft splashed down a few hours later, the first American to orbit the Earth reminded us that with courage and a spirit of discovery there\u2019s no limit to the heights we can reach together,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. Glenn was the last surviving astronaut of the original Mercury 7 group, preceded in death by Alan B. Shepard Jr., Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton and Scott Carpenter. In his first historic flight, Glenn circled Earth for nearly five hours in a tiny spaceship on Feb. 20, 1962, the first American to orbit the planet. When he returned to space in 1998, his voyage did nearly as much to revive interest in America's space program as his first pioneering voyage had to ignite the country's fascination\u00a0in space exploration. Glenn first earned broad public attention in 1962 in the bell-shaped space capsule Friendship 7 \u2014 a flight that NASA 's mission control worried might burn up upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere. A war hero and test pilot who earned fame even before he was named to the Mercury team, Glenn seemed to have the right stuff and more. Not only did Glenn \u201chave courage and ambition, but he also had supreme confidence in himself and his own abilities,\u201d qualities that distinguished him from most mortals, said Frank Van Riper, who wrote the 1983 biography \u201cGlenn: The Astronaut Who Would Be President.\u201d \u201cThat type of confidence can let him sit atop a rocket and have his blood pressure not change at all.\u201d The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. Associated Press The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. The original seven Mercury astronauts pose in their spacesuits in this 1961 file photo provided by NASA. (Associated Press) After his first space flight, Glenn, then 40, was elevated to celebrity status as much by his personal charm and heroics as he was by the pioneering era that he helped define. Before Glenn made his three loops around Earth in a four-hour, 56-minute flight, only Soviet astronauts, test dummies and dogs had made historic \u201cfirsts\u201d in space. Almost a year before Glenn defied gravity, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become the first man in space. Glenn was neither the first nor second American in space. Those distinctions belonged to Shepard, whose entire voyage lasted 15 minutes and who was followed months later by Grissom. Yet Glenn's flight raised the most passion and publicity in America. Glenn stayed aloft for hours, focusing Americans' rapt attention on his every orbit and ultimately restoring America's confidence in its technological prowess. President Kennedy was apparently so relieved that Glenn helped put America back in the space race, and so concerned about the astronaut's well-being, that he vetoed a return to space by Glenn. Rather, Kennedy marked Glenn as an American with a political future. After a few early political defeats, the astronaut was elected to the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1974. Although Glenn remained a supporter of NASA, he tried to steer clear of being seen as the Senate \u201castronaut,\u201d preferring to make his mark in other areas. He was perhaps best known as the author of bills to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. He also helped pass legislation to clean up radioactive waste at the nation's nuclear weapons sites. Yet his drive to return to space never fully abated, and he relentlessly lobbied the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for another space flight. Glenn insisted that he was not driven to return to space for the thrill of the ride or as a passenger with a congressional free pass but as a scientist-explorer. What you're up there for is to accomplish something for the country that may break us into some new areas of research that may benefit an awful lot of people. \u2014 John Glenn \u201cWhat you're up there for,\u201d he said, \u201cis to accomplish something for the country that may break us into some new areas of research that may benefit an awful lot of people.\u201d After his late-in-life flight, dozens of tests done on his body showed that he handled the rigors of space as well as astronauts roughly half his age, NASA scientists said when results were released in 2000. In 2012, Glenn and Carpenter received a hero\u2019s welcome when they returned to the Cape Canaveral launchpad to mark the 50th anniversary of Glenn\u2019s orbital flight. The national attention after the 1962 flight was \u201calmost unbelievable,\u201d Glenn said at the event, and added that he and his colleagues learned to live with the acclaim \u201cor tried to anyway.\u201d John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio. His mother, Clara, a teacher, and father, John, soon moved to the tiny town of New Concord, where his father opened a plumbing business. At 3, he met Anna \u201cAnnie\u201d Castor, the 4-year-old daughter of the town dentist. The pair started dating in high school and married in 1944. In high school, Glenn was an honors student who excelled in sports and student politics \u2014 and played the lead in the senior class play. A religious young man, Glenn enrolled in Muskingum College, a small Presbyterian school in New Concord, where he sang in the church choir and played football. While there, Glenn learned to fly through a civilian program run by the Navy. When it came time to enlist, he joined the Marines, leaving college behind after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. During World War II, he rose to the rank of captain and decided to make a career in the military. By the end of the war, he had flown 59 missions with F-4U fighters, and was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses and 10 Air Medals. The Korean War meant 90 more missions for the Marine aviator, and many more medals, including a third and fourth Distinguished Flying Cross. \u201cGlenn grew up with the archetypal Protestant work ethic and the idea that good things happen to people who work hard,\u201d Van Riper said. \u201cAdd to this sense of confidence and the idea in the military that you succeed if you work hard, and it explains why he pursued tougher and tougher assignments.\u201d As a test pilot, Glenn pushed his bosses to let him attempt a transcontinental flight in an F8U-1 Crusader fighter aircraft. On July 16, 1957, he set a speed record of 3 hours 23 minutes and 8.4 seconds flying from Los Angeles to New York, picking up a fifth Distinguished Flying Cross and a taste for fame. Two years later, Glenn volunteered for an elite corps of pilots who would become the country's first astronauts, riding rockets into space. NASA pared an original list of about 500 test pilots down to 110 and then to the Mercury Seven. Training was rigorous and tedious. In addition to studying astrophysics and biology, the new astronauts were exposed to high heat, strong forces of gravity and the sense of weightlessness. Glenn became a pacesetter in training and moral leadership. He would run extra miles in a morning workout and lecture the others against carousing. When Glenn took his pioneering turn in space, astronaut Carpenter spoke for all Americans when he radioed from launch control just before liftoff, \u201cGodspeed, John Glenn.\u201d Carpenter later said he had tried to keep the mood light by playfully telling Glenn: \u201cRemember, John, this was built by the low bidder.\u201d NASA cut the flight short \u2014 Glenn was supposed to orbit Earth seven times \u2014 when mechanical failure created concern that Friendship 7's heat shield might fall off during re-entry and cause the capsule to burn up. Although he remained calm, Glenn later told Life magazine that he had been prepared to die. The heat shield held. After Glenn's safe return, he became a national hero. Bathed in the spotlight, Glenn was typically low key. \u201cIt's been a long day,\u201d he said after being fished out of the Atlantic Ocean by helicopter, \u201cbut it has been very interesting.\u201d Back on Earth, Glenn was greeted by Kennedy; 4 million New Yorkers showered him and his family with ticker tape; and the New York Times called him \u201cAmerica's first flesh-and-blood Buck Rogers.\u201d John Glenn parade Associated Press Astronaut John Glenn in car at left, the first American to orbit the Earth, got a massive ticker tape parade welcome along lower Broadway on March 1, 1962.

A partly constructed building at right served as a grandstand for a cheering crowd. Sitting beside the astronaut is Annie Glenn, his wife.\u00a0 (Associated Press) Reflecting on that moment decades later while sitting in his third-floor office at the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at Ohio State University , Glenn was at a loss to explain the adulation: \u201cIt\u2019s true we got more attention. It wasn\u2019t something we planned. Truth is, I just don\u2019t know why it happened.\u201d After his ambition to fly again was scratched, Glenn retired from the military in 1965 and entered private business, serving first as vice president of corporate planning and then as president of the Royal Crown Cola Co. He also made a fortune with business investments that included building Holiday Inns in Florida. But within a few years, he decided to try politics. After losing the 1970 Democratic primary in Ohio for a U.S. Senate seat to Howard Metzenbaum, Glenn ran against him again in 1974. During the campaign, Metzenbaum contrasted his business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials, saying his opponent had \u201cnever worked for a living.\u201d Glenn's reply came to be known as the \u201cGold Star Mothers\u201d speech. He challenged Metzenbaum to tell wounded veterans \u201cthey didn't hold a job\u201d and tell any Gold Star mother \u2014 women with a child who died while serving in the military \u2014 that \u201cher son did not hold a job.\u201d Glenn won the nomination and the general election. Jimmy Carter considered making Glenn his running mate in the 1976 presidential race but after Glenn gave an uninspired address to the Democratic National Convention, Carter chose Walter Mondale. A decade later, Glenn ran for president and racked up $3 million in debt but didn't make it out of the primaries. \u201cHe was never really a coalition builder,\u201d Van Riper said. And if he was considered a bit of a square by the other Mercury astronauts, that image intensified in the U.S. Senate, where he served until 1999. His relationships with others on Capitol Hill was always cordial if not distant. But in Glenn's post-Watergate class of 1974, he was always a respected colleague, considered a sincerely decent man. His Norman Rockwell character and reputation for unparalleled principle were\u00a0severely tested in 1989 during the so-called Keating Five scandal. He was one of five senators investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for using clout to keep federal regulators out of the way of savings-and-loan mogul Charles Keating Jr. The committee said Glenn used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting a $200,000 donation from Keating but cleared the senator of wrongdoing. Through all the years after his famous flight in space, Glenn continued flying. Almost every weekend he would escape Washington for Ohio in his Beechcraft Baron, with his wife as his co-pilot. When he sold his plane in early 2012, Glenn noted that he still held a valid pilot\u2019s license. In 1995, he had started campaigning to return to space. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aging, he had learned that the aging process on Earth, in many ways, is similar to the effects of weightlessness, and he decided he wanted to know why. Glenn approached NASA chief Dan Goldin and pressed to serve as a crew member on a Discovery flight as a test subject for geriatric experiments. Goldin gave the go-ahead after aging experts insisted that Glenn's mission might produce good science and NASA's own doctors found Glenn in good health. He had kept fit throughout the decades, running in his youth and power-walking in his later years around his Bethesda, Md., neighborhood. He lifted weights, ate well, took vitamins and kept trim. The day after returning to Earth on the space shuttle, Glenn admitted he had felt \u201ca little woozy\u201d upon landing but relayed a message aimed at other senior citizens. \u201cOld folks have ambitions and dreams too, like everyone else. ... Why don't they go for them? Don't sit on a couch someplace,\u201d he said. But age did catch up.

Major portions of two interstates have now reopened. (Dec. 8) AP Chase Tavernier climbs to the snow-covered summit of Spencer Butte Dec. 7, 2016 in Eugene, Ore.

(Photo: Andy Nelson, AP) If you think it's cold now, just wait until next week: Winter's favorite whipping boy, the Polar Vortex, will again rear\u00a0its ugly head. After a chilly, snowy weekend and a brief stretch of slightly milder weather early next week, the next cold blast will invade the northern Plains and Upper Midwest by the middle of the week. The frigid air will\u00a0eventually make its way to the East Coast and Southeast by week's end. The cold will be similar in scale and magnitude to the infamous January 2014 Polar Vortex, meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherBell Analytics, tweeted Wednesday. The Polar Vortex is a large area of cold air high up in the atmosphere that normally lives over the poles (as its name suggests) but \u2014 thanks to a meandering jet stream \u2014 parts of the vortex can slosh down into North America, helping to funnel unspeakably cold air into the central and eastern U.S., like what's forecast next week. Just how cold could it get?\u00a0High temperatures may only reach the single digits for much of the upper Midwest, including Chicago, on Wednesday and Thursday, the Weather Channel said. ",

Reuters/Mohammed Salem WASHINGTON -- A senior U.S. military official for the first time says the U.S.-led coalition has killed 50,000 militants with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, in the last two years in Iraq and Syria. The Battle for Mosul The official said it was a conservative estimate, but it\u2019s a bit more than what others have stated before. U.S. leaders have expressed reluctance to disclose specific numbers, and note that ISIS has been able to replace fighters rapidly, particularly early on. In August, Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland said about 45,000 combatants have been taken off the battlefields. The official says coalition airstrikes could be more aggressive in places like Mosul , where Iraqi troops are battling to retake the city, but civilian casualties are a risk. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the U.S. was concerned about ISIS fighters going into hiding, CBS Radio News correspondent Cami McCormick reports. \u201cThese are the guys that went to ground before when they were under a lot of pressure in the 2009-2010 time frame. Literally went to ground in the sanctuary of eastern Syria and western Iraq - Anbar, Ninewah - and then in two years\u2019 time came back manifested as ISIL,\u201d the official said, referring to another name for ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \u201cThey are more than skilled at \u2018we\u2019re under a lot of pressure right now, guys, let\u2019s go low.

Engaging with Trump brings risk for the left BESTPIX - President-Elect Donald Trump Holds Meetings At Trump Tower Kevin Hagen / Getty Images Former Vice President Al Gore arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. Former Vice President Al Gore arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. (Kevin Hagen / Getty Images) Evan Halper Contact Reporter When Al Gore emerged from his surprise meeting at Trump Tower earlier\u00a0this week to suggest the president-elect was a good listener and maybe was keeping an open mind on climate change, there was hardly universal relief on the left. But there was a lot of suspicion that Gore had been played. Within 48 hours, Donald Trump deepened those suspicions, naming Scott Pruitt , the attorney general of Oklahoma and a prominent climate-change skeptic,\u00a0to run the Environmental Protection Agency . The editor of the progressive news outlet ThinkProgress, Judd Legum, posted an analysis of Google searches showing that the Gore meeting had gotten substantially\u00a0more Internet attention than the choice of an official who is a favorite\u00a0of the\u00a0oil industry to run the new administration\u2019s environmental policies.\u00a0 \u201cThese meetings are entertainment to distract you while [Trump] guts Obama\u2019s climate policy,\u201d Legum tweeted. Prominent Democrats and their allies\u00a0are navigating uncharted waters as they look for openings to persuade Trump not to dismantle every policy they won\u00a0under President Obama.

Fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pick to be the next Labor Department secretary,\u00a0turned\u00a0around the Southern California-based parent company of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s with help from\u00a0scantily clad women hawking\u00a0oversized burgers in racy ads. More recently, he\u2019s\u00a0raised... (Jim Puzzanghera) Not since Ronald Reagan assumed office 36 years ago\u00a0have they had to deal\u00a0with a president-elect who is both\u00a0so reviled by their core voters and masterful at using the television cameras to co-opt them \u2014 even in those cases where they arrive at his doorstep to school him on why he is wrong. When they have made\u00a0overtures, they have been met\u00a0with sustained \u2014\u00a0loudly expressed\u00a0\u2014\u00a0skepticism from\u00a0progressives. Many on the left oppose\u00a0any moves that they see as lending\u00a0legitimacy to a president-elect they view as a fraud and a danger.\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) got a scolding from allies when he suggested that there was room to cooperate with Trump on economic matters. So did Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The pushback from the left already has shifted the tone on Capitol Hill, with some prominent Democrats voicing a more confrontational approach than they did immediately after the election. \u201cDemocrats and liberals are genuinely trying to figure out what to do with this president-elect,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. \u201cSome have tried saying, \u2018I am going to work with him on issues I believe in.\u2019 But that kind of testing the waters is getting a lot of pushback.\u201d Among progressive activists, there is both a tactical concern about Trump\u2019s ability to outmaneuver Democrats on specific issues and a broader worry\u00a0that if their leaders engage Trump as they would any other Republican, they will \u201cnormalize\u201d everything that they see as coming along\u00a0with him: denigration of\u00a0Mexican immigrants and Muslims, dog whistles to white supremacists, false statements of fact\u00a0and so on. \u201cMany on the left are making a moral argument that you can\u2019t disassociate Trump\u2019s economic populism from all the racist and nationalist issues,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cThis is a tension that is not going to go away.\u201d Some who have been invited to ride the elevator up to Trump\u2019s office in New York have managed to do so without creating a media moment that works in Trump\u2019s favor. Mayors Bill de Blasio of New York and Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, both Democrats,\u00a0drew praise from the left for using their time with Trump to confront him on issues of immigration and to\u00a0warn that many of the nation\u2019s big cities would stand in defiance of his agenda. Emanuel\u00a0delivered a letter from 15 mayors imploring Trump to reconsider his plan to put\u00a0hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought illegally to the country as children back at risk of deportation. That more confrontational approach is necessary, liberal activists insist. These conversations with Trump need to make clear that little if anything can be done together unless he rejects ... the bigoted agenda he ran on. \u2014 Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America \u201cThese conversations with Trump need to make clear that little if anything can be done together unless he rejects in an open fashion the bigoted agenda he ran on,\u201d said Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, a progressive advocacy group with more than a million members. Leaders of the American Bridge super PAC, a multi-million-dollar hub of opposition research and media attacks on the GOP, are also warning Democrats against too eagerly engaging. Even on the issue of infrastructure spending, which they have long supported, Democrats \u201cwill have a hard time\u201d collaborating with Trump, warned David Brock, the group\u2019s founder. \u201cWe won\u2019t know how he will benefit from it financially,\u201d Brock said, noting Trump\u2019s refusal to allow the public to see his tax returns.

Here is some background on Puzder. (Dec. 8, 2016) President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Andy Puzder to be Labor secretary. Here is some background on Puzder. (Dec. 8, 2016) Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporter Fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pick to be the next Labor Department secretary,\u00a0turned\u00a0around the Southern California-based parent company of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s with help from\u00a0scantily clad women hawking\u00a0oversized burgers in racy ads. More recently, he\u2019s\u00a0raised his own profile by becoming\u00a0an outspoken national advocate on behalf of\u00a0businesses, railing against increased government regulation, bemoaning the costs of the Affordable Care Act\u00a0and\u00a0serving as an economic advisor to Trump.\u00a0 On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to nominate Puzder to head the department charged with ensuring workers\u2019 rights and safety\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and likely to lead an effort to undo many Obama administration initiatives. \u201cAndy will fight to make American workers safer and more prosperous by enforcing fair occupational safety standards and ensuring workers receive the benefits they deserve, and he will save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth and suppressing wages,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Puzder said he shared Trump\u2019s belief that \u201cthe right government policies can result in more jobs and better wages for the American worker.\u201d Puzder, 66, has criticized new federal rules expanding overtime pay and opposes the push for a $15 minimum wage. He has raised eyebrows by musing about deploying increased automation to his restaurants and once slammed California\u2019s\u00a0regulatory climate, saying the state sometimes treats\u00a0businesses as if \u201cwe have kids working in coal mines or women working in sweatshops.\u201d Puzder also is a strong supporter of Trump, writing on his blog \u00a0on election day: \u201cIf you\u2019re a small or mid-sized business, a working or middle-class American and you want someone in your corner, Donald Trump is your candidate.\u201d Unlike Trump,\u00a0Puzder has advocated for providing legal status \u2014\u00a0but not citizenship \u2014 to the millions of immigrants in the country illegally, saying massive deportation is not a practical option and that the Republican resistance to broad-based reform was hurting the party. Beginning as the personal attorney to the former CEO and Carl\u2019s Jr. founder,\u00a0 Carl Karcher , Puzder helped CKE Restaurants Inc.\u00a0overcome severe financial difficulties in the 1990s, caused in part by the purchase of the troubled Hardee\u2019s franchise. He took over as chief executive in 2000. \u201cAndrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,\u201d said David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, which represents chain restaurants and a variety of other businesses. But Democrats and advocates for U.S. workers balked at Trump\u2019s intention to nominate Puzder to head a federal department that is focused on increasing employment opportunities, improving working conditions and protecting employee rights. Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group, said Thursday that \u201cbased on Mr. Puzder\u2019s own comments, it\u2019s hard to think of anyone less suited for the job of lifting up America\u2019s forgotten workers.\u201d \u201cHe opposes raising the minimum wage, threatens to replace restaurant workers with machines, has consistently opposed long-standing rules that protect workers and law-abiding employers, and demonstrated that he prizes corporate welfare and profits over workers\u2019 well-being,\u201d Owens said. Under Puzder\u2019s leadership, CKE defied a trend toward healthier fast-food fare by focusing on jumbo-sized hamburgers. And he pitched them to customers through provocative advertisements, including\u00a0 one in 2005\u00a0starring Paris Hilton eating a burger amid soap suds while washing a luxury car. \"I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it's very American,\" Puzder said in a 2015 interview with Entrepreneur magazine.\u00a0 Complaints about the advertising campaign, \u201caren\u2019t necessarily bad for us\u201d because the attention led to increased sales, Puzder said. But Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, said Thursday that Puzder\u2019s views on women \u201cwere deeply troubling.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s objectified and undermined women in an effort to sell hamburgers,\u201d she said of Puzder. CKE, headquartered in Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, has more than 3,300 locations in 42 U.S. states and 28 countries. It was acquired by private equity firm Apollo Global Management in 2010 and taken private. The company is currently in the process of relocating its headquarters to Nashville, Tenn., near Puzder\u2019s home. If confirmed by the Senate, Puzder would lead a department that includes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks and reports on job growth, wages and unemployment benefits. Under President Obama, the Labor Department was aggressive about protecting workers through new rules and enforcement actions. Obama\u2019s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, which was blocked by a federal judge this fall, made it tougher for companies to win federal contracts if they violated workers\u2019 rights. Puzder could lead an effort to scrap Obama administration initiatives, particularly the overtime rules, which seek to broaden the number of Americans who are compensated for extra work by doubling the salary level below which hourly workers must receive overtime. Those rules also recently were blocked by a federal judge.\u00a0 \u201cThe real world is far different than the Labor Department\u2019s Excel spreadsheet,\u201d Puzder wrote in an opinion article in Forbes this spring about the overtime rule. \u201cThis new rule will simply add to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama administration has imposed on employers, forcing many to offset increased labor expense by cutting costs elsewhere,\u201d said Puzder, \u00a0co-author of\u00a0a 2010 book, \u201cJob Creation: How It Really Works and Why Government Doesn\u2019t Understand It.\u201d On the minimum wage, Puzder told the Los Angeles Times in March\u00a0that \"there's nothing wrong with rational increases in the minimum wage that don't kill jobs.\" \"But we're talking about entry-level jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAre people going to want to hire entry-level employees for these very high minimums, which come with Obamacare, which come with mandatory sick leave or other benefits which the government imposes on business for these individuals?\u201d\u00a0 Puzder told CNBC in May that the minimum wage could be raised to $9 \u201cwith minimal impact\u201d but that a \u201cbetter alternative\u201d to a boosting incomes would be to expand the earned-income tax credit, which helps low-income workers. Fast-food industry workers and liberal groups have been pushing to increase the minimum wage to $15 and have convinced some cities and states \u2014 most notably California \u2014 to push their minimum wages to that level over the next several years. Puzder was criticized for telling the Business Insider website\u00a0this spring that he would like to try a fully automated restaurant. That led to reports that he wanted to replace fast-food workers with robots. He responded by writing an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal saying technology could replace certain functions, but full automation was not on the menu at CKE Restaurants. He noted that employees at Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s \u201cmake biscuits from scratch\u2026. bread chicken tenders by hand, prepare complex burger orders, hand-scoop the ice cream for milkshakes.\u201d \u201cNone of these tasks can be effectively automated, and we wouldn\u2019t want them to be,\u201d Puzder wrote. Puzder earned his law degree from Washington University School of Law in St. Louis in 1978 and was a trial lawyer in the city until 1991. While practicing law there, he met Karcher, who had turned a single hot-dog cart in Los Angeles into the Carl\u2019s Jr. fast-food chain.

USA TODAY NETWORK Despite being the president-elect, Donald Trump is not getting fired from his spot as the executive producer of NBC\u2019s Celebrity Apprentice, according to Variety. Early next year the Celebrity Apprentice will return with a new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Trump won\u2019t be entirely uninvolved. According to Variety, the confirmation that Trump would remain one of multiple executive producers came from MGM, which owns the Apprentice franchise. It is not clear what Trump's exact role as executive producer will be as the role can range widely. Some executive producers are given the title but do not have to actively work on the project. \u201cMr. Trump has a big stake in the show and conceived of it with Mark Burnett,\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. It is not clear if Trump will be paid for his work on the series. Trump is facing increasing pressure to separate himself from his business as he becomes president to avoid conflicts of interest. A Pew Research poll released Wednesday found that 45% of Americans are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about potential conflicts of interest and 20% feel \u201csomewhat concerned.\u201d He has promised to announce his plans for dealing with his business empire while being president in detail next week.

But his trajectory to greatness was set years earlier, as a Marine Corps pilot. Glenn flew 59 combat missions in World War II and 90 combat missions in the Korean War. Here we see Glenn climbing out of the cockpit of his F-8-UI Crusader jet at Brooklyn's Floyd Bennett Field in 1957, after making the first nonstop, supersonic flight from Los Angeles to New York. The flight was called \"Project Bullet\" because Glenn traveled faster than a bullet. The 3-hour, 23-minute trip set a transcontinental speed record, and put Glenn on the radar screen for selection as an astronaut a couple of years later. Anthony Camerano / AP 2. Glenn and six other military fliers were selected in 1959 to become the first American astronauts as part of Project Mercury. NASA put the \"Mercury 7\" through a grueling series of medical and psychological tests. Glenn is seen here being outfitted with a biosensor during astronaut training activities at Cape Canaveral, Fla., in 1961. NASA 3. The seven Mercury astronauts pose for a photo in their spacesuits in 1962. Front row, left to right, are Wally Schirra, Deke Slayton, John Glenn and Scott Carpenter. Back row, from left, are Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom and Gordon Cooper. NASA advertisement 4. By 1962, astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom had flown on suborbital Mercury missions. Those flights set the stage for John Glenn's orbital odyssey. Glenn took a no-nonsense, straight-arrow approach to his physical training program, including frequent runs like this one in 1962. NASA 5. During Friendship 7's three-orbit flight, NASA controllers saw indications that the capsule's heat shield had come loose - which could be a fatal flaw for re-entry. They told Glenn not to jettison the craft's retro-rocket pack, as an added precaution. Glenn ended up making a safe splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, and it turned out that the apparent heat-shield problem was merely due to a sensor failure. Here you see Glenn's capsule attached to a retrieval cable hanging down from a helicopter. The capsule released green dye into the water to help searchers find it from the air.

NASA made it clear that John Glenn would not be going back into space anytime soon - he was just too important as a national hero. Glenn left the astronaut corps in 1964 and decided to get into politics. At a 1969 news conference in Columbus, Ohio, he announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for U.S. senator. He lost out to fellow Democrat Howard Metzenbaum in the 1970 primary, but in 1974, Glenn prevailed and finally entered the Senate. Gene Herrick / AP 12. Sen. John Glenn confers with a fellow Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden, during a 1981 hearing on the sale of an AWACS radar plane to Saudi Arabia.

Glenn says he believes an \"unattractive\" elections process discourages the best people from pursuing public service.

    "text": "American Dream collapsing for young adults, study says, as odds plunge that children will earn more than their parents Workers littlehenrabi / Getty Images/iStockphoto Jim TankersleyThe Washington Post Rising income inequality has eroded the ability for American children to grow up to earn more than their parents, according to groundbreaking new research from a superstar team of economists that carries deep implications for President-elect Donald Trump 's policy agenda. The research from a team of economists led by Stanford's Raj Chetty , and also including researchers from Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley, estimates that only half the children born in the 1980s grew up to earn more than their parents did, after adjusting for inflation. That's a drop from 92 percent of children born in 1940. The fall-off is particularly steep among children born in the middle class. Competition for engineering talent remains fierce in Silicon Valley. The megaplayers offer recruits lavish offices and gourmet cafeterias along with all the usual corporate perks, such as gym memberships and expense accounts. But there's nothing like good, old-fashioned money to entice top talent. ... ... (Polly Mosendz) \"If we simply care about absolute mobility,\" Chetty said in an interview, \"these results show, you have to care about inequality.\" Previously, Chetty's team has studied a different measure of mobility: the ability of children to move up or down America's income ladder as they grow up, when compared to other Americans. The new research attempts, for the first time, to quantify so-called \"absolute mobility,\" which people often associate with the American Dream: the odds of a child earning more as an adult than his or her parents earned at the same age. The economists say rising concentration of income among the richest Americans explains 70 percent of what has been a steady decline in absolute mobility from the baby boom generation to millennials, while a slowdown in economic growth explains just 30 percent. Absolute mobility \"is something that was a feature of the American economy for kids born around 1940, that baby boomer generation,\" said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist who is one of the authors of the study. \"As we look forward, there's just been a dramatic decline in that measure\" - which, he said, runs parallel to a decades-long stagnation in earnings for typical American workers, even as earnings for the very rich have soared. (Tribune news services) \"If you don't have that kind of widespread economic growth across the income distribution, it's tough to grow up and earn more than your parents,\" Hendren said. For policymakers, \"This is a distinct reason to focus on inequality.\" That finding suggests Trump's tax-cut plans would do little to improve economic mobility for struggling blue-collar families, even if they help accelerate growth, because analysts predict the cuts would benefit high earners disproportionately. Put another way: Trump has promised his cuts would help workers by supercharging growth, but the new research suggests past growth has done little to boost the absolute mobility of middle-class Americans. Trump did not make inequality a focus of his presidential campaign, but he appealed directly to the anxieties of workers who feel the economy is not delivering for them in the same way it did for their parents. The paper highlights several sources of those anxieties in the Trump coalition. It finds barely 2 in 5 men born in the mid-80s grew up to earn as much, at age 30, as their father's did at the same age. It shows average rates of mobility falling particularly fast in Rust Belt states, most notably Michigan and Indiana. And it finds a much steeper drop in absolute mobility for the middle class than for the poor. The calculations come from a novel approach by the authors to marry data from anonymous tax records and detailed statistics on the distribution of income in the United States from the Census. Using those sources, the authors estimate the chances that a particular child will grow up to earn more than her or his parents. The large decline in the past half-century remains steady even if they change how they calculate inflation over time, or take into account demographic shifts such as the changing size of U.S. households over time. The surge in inequality over the past half-century is well documented. New research this week, from economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, shows the bottom 50 percent of U.S. income earners only gained 1 percent in earnings from 1962 to 2014, after adjusting for inflation. From 1980 to 2014, they found, nearly 70 percent of income gains went to the top 10 percent. Even knowing the data on rising inequality, Chetty said, the mobility researchers were surprised by their new findings. \"We thought mobility would be lower,\" he said. \"We didn't realize how much lower it would be. And we didn't realize that the distribution of growth would matter more than the level of GDP growth.\" ",

President Barack Obama's home in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago is shown on Oct. 25, 2006. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune It's guarded by the Secret Service and Chicago police around the clock, but President Barack Obama 's Chicago mansion seems unlikely to ever be his family's permanent home again. So what's to become of the Georgian residence the Obamas paid $1.65 million for back near the top of the housing bubble in 2005? As the president kicks off his shoes, wraps himself in a Snuggie, settles into the sofa and flicks through daytime property television shows post-Jan. 20, he might be tempted to sell. After all, the couple plan to stay in a rented Washington, D.C., home for at least a couple of years until their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school, and they are rumored to have bought homes in Rancho Mirage in the California desert and in Hawaii. Even allowing for the Obamas' ongoing ties to the planned presidential library in nearby Jackson Park, and the president's enhanced earning potential post-White House, they may see the approximately $7,500 per month in mortgage payments they are required to make on the $1.3 million loan they took out in 2005 on their Kenwood home as an unnecessary expense. \"The question for most buyers who bought at that time is, 'Am I going to take a loss?'\" said real estate agent Hasani Steele, who is selling a somewhat grander mansion two doors down from the Obama home for $2.6 million.

Government officials can defer capital gains taxes on assets they sell to avoid conflicts, providing they reinvest the money in government securities or certain approved mutual funds. But the bill comes due if those assets are sold after a person leaves office. Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump , who grew up in their father\u2019s business and are currently executive vice presidents, have told people that complaints about appearances of impropriety could be a continuing distraction for their father as he puts together his administration. Jan W. Baran, a leading Republican ethics lawyer, said that even though the law was clearly on Mr. Trump\u2019s side, there were no easy answers on what he should do about his financial holdings. If he keeps a stake in his company, persistent questions about whether he is acting in the country\u2019s interest or his business interest will be \u201cunavoidable,\u201d Mr. Baran said. On the other hand, Mr. Baran said, if Mr. Trump decides to divest, that raises other questions. \u201cWho are you going sell it to?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes selling his stake eliminate the ethical issues, or does it compound them?\u201d Photo Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s sons, in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York last week. He serves as an executive vice president of development and acquisitions for his father\u2019s company. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times There will also be lingering questions related to Mr. Trump\u2019s children, depending on the structure the family settles on for running the company, Mr. Baran added. As outlined, the plan could leave in place many of the potential conflicts of interest growing out of a real estate and licensing business that spans at least 20 nations, in places like India, Indonesia and Turkey.

Bush from 2005 to 2007, and who is planning to police the Trump administration in a role with the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, noted that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits government officials from accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments or corporations controlled by foreign governments. Investments or loans from foreign state-controlled financial institutions, even diplomats staying at or hosting events at Trump hotel properties, could run afoul of that clause, Mr. Painter said. Mr. Trump will also have to take care to ensure that concessions that benefit his company are not construed as a bribe intended to influence official action. Mr. Painter said that even setting aside the legal questions, everything Mr. Trump does will be filtered through the lens of how he stands to benefit financially. \u201cThere are ways to make it work legally, but the appearances are going to be terrible and it\u2019s going to be a four-year ethical challenge,\u201d Mr. Painter said. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and both Mr. Bush and his father held their assets in blind trusts while in office. President Obama did not use one, but he had minimal investments and they were unlikely to pose direct conflicts. His wife, Michelle Obama, gave up her professional responsibilities before he took office. While it is unclear what structure Mr. Trump proposes to set up to wall himself off from decision-making, the continuing involvement of two of his children in the business would complicate matters. And for a trust to be truly blind, experts say that the assets would have to be liquidated \u2014 and that Mr. Trump, who will be the wealthiest president in American history, would have to have no knowledge of how the proceeds were invested.

Lockheed Martin and Boeing are the two major companies involved in discussions to build fighter aircraft production plants in India as part of that country\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, which is essentially a mirror-image of President-elect Trump\u2019s aggressive desire to keep manufacturing jobs within the United States. Trump has made retaining blue-collar jobs a post-election priority, and he\u2019s already had a high-profile success in preventing the loss of several hundred jobs at Indiana\u2019s Carrier plant. \u201cThe U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequences, is WRONG!\u201d Trump said in a series of Sunday tweets. BUDGET CUTS LEAVE MARINE CORPS AIRCRAFT GROUNDED Trump earlier this week also showed a willingness to go after jet maker Boeing, in particular, when he publicly sparred with the company over the cost of a new Air Force One fleet. The \u201cMake in India\u201d program, which is the brainchild of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to eventually increase the country\u2019s manufacturing base to a quarter of the gross domestic product. So when the Indian government required new jets to replace its aging fleet, any corporation that wanted to be involved knew the planes \u2013 an F-16 by Lockheed or F/A-18 by Boeing \u2013 would have to be built in India. \u201cBut this is not oursourcing socks here, this is outsourcing military fighter jets,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice. expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 Sekulow\u2019s group has already started a \u201cPetition to Stop Giving Control of our Fighter Jets to Foreign Nations,\u201d and he plans to deliver the demand to Congress later this week. Sekulow told FoxNews.com his office has already received calls from Lockheed workers in Fort Worth who\u2019ve said they\u2019re being given notice, offered severance packages or told they can apply to work on the F-35 program \u2013 though, with no guarantee of being accepted. A Lockheed spokesperson, however, told FoxNews.com the Fort Worth plant was ramping down production anyway as the U.S. Air Force moved on from the antiquated F-16 and switched to the newer F-35 jet. \u201cSo if you look at the big picture here, thousands of jobs have already gone away as we close out the building of F-16s. That\u2019s a given at this point; there\u2019s nothing we can do to change this,\u201d said Randy Howard, the director of business development for Lockheed\u2019s integrated fighter group. \u201cSo what our offer does is seek to mediate that. To remedy that. To bring back those jobs as much as possible. It adds jobs in India, but it also brings back jobs in Fort Worth and across the U.S.\u201d Howard said opening up a plant in India would actually reinstate about 500 Lockheed staff positions that support F-16 production, \u201cpredominantly\u201d in the United States. He also guaranteed \u201call F-16 workers will have a job available to them on the F-35 production line.\u201d Boeing, too, told FoxNews.com that it\u2019s F/A-18 production line in St. Louis \u201ccontinues to have a solid future.\u201d \u201cOur proposal to meet the needs of the Indian Air Force\u2019s fighter requirements entails creating a separate new Super Hornet production facility in India where Boeing has had a presence for more than seven decades,\u201d Boeing said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the opportunity to continue our work in St. Louis and add a new production line in India which would also create more opportunities for our entire Super Hornet supply chain.\u201d The \u201cMake in India\u201d program is supported by President Obama\u2019s outgoing administration, which is looking to strengthen ties with India. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Thursday visited India and an official statement said the two countries\u2019 continued cooperation \u201cwill strengthen India\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.\u201d A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment more specifically on the program. Sekulow, who said he was first alerted to the India news by former military officers who are a part of his group\u2019s national security team, said he was all for increasing trade and relations with India, but that military manufacturing was a step too far. \u201cPresident [Obama] is not very good with lines in the sand,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cBut here\u2019s one he should draw.\u201d Advertisement ",

The recount lasted three days in more than 20 of the state's 83 counties. Some counties hadn't planned to start until later. Federal Judge Mark Goldsmith said Wednesday he must follow a decision by the Michigan appeals court, which found that Green Party candidate Jill Stein couldn't seek a recount. She got 1 percent of the vote and presented no evidence of fraud. Republican Donald Trump narrowly won. The Michigan elections board stopped the recount because of Goldsmith's ruling. It then canceled a planned Thursday meeting because it became moot. A recount is ongoing in Wisconsin, and Stein is seeking one in Pennsylvania. Trump won those states, too. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy The legislation began with an effort by State Representative Ling Ling Chang to broaden a 1992 law about sports memorabilia. She joined forces with Mark Hamill, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor who kept seeing signed posters that were fake. Booksellers say they didn\u2019t realize they were vulnerable until after Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure in September. Ms. Chang, who was unavailable for comment, has published on her Facebook page a statement that both \u201cthe letter and spirit of the law\u201d do not apply to booksellers. Her reasoning is that the law is aimed at \u201cdealers,\u201d who are mostly in the business of selling signed collectibles. Since booksellers sell all kinds of books, many of them unsigned, Ms. Chang argues that leaves them off the hook. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But some booksellers worry that is not true. If a bookseller does not vouch for a signed book in the form of a \u201ccertificate of authenticity,\u201d he is liable for a civil penalty equal to 10 times actual damages, plus court costs and other charges. Even those who keep an eye on the memorabilia trade don\u2019t think the law will do much good. \u201cReal criminals can circumvent the law with little effort, and yet the measure creates a huge disincentive for honest businesses,\u201d said Jason DeBord, who runs a blog about the market for movie and television props. The booksellers hope the next Legislature will clarify the law. That will not be easy though. Ms. Chang, a Republican, narrowly lost her bid to join the State Senate, and will be out of office.

John Glenn was the last surviving member of the original Mercury astronauts. He would later have a long political career as a U.S. senator, but that didn't stop his pioneering ways. Glenn made history a second time in 1998, when he flew aboard the shuttle Discovery to become the oldest person to fly in space. Glenn was 95 when he died; he had been hospitalized in an Ohio State University medical center in Columbus since last week.

Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Glenn had been battling health issues since a stroke a few years ago. His death Thursday was confirmed by Hank Wilson, communications director of the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. President Obama said that Glenn's trailblazing showed \"with courage and a spirit of discovery there's no limit to the heights we can reach together.\" The president said, \"John always had the right stuff, inspiring generations of scientists, engineers and astronauts. ... On behalf of a grateful nation, Godspeed, John Glenn.\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, \"Senator Glenn's legacy is one of risk and accomplishment, of history created and duty to country carried out under great pressure with the whole world watching. The entire NASA Family will be forever grateful for his outstanding service, commitment and friendship.\" An early explorer On Feb. 20, 1962, when John Glenn rocketed into space, it was momentous and nerve-wracking. Space travel was in its infancy. Every launch and mission captivated the imagination of America. A few minutes after liftoff, Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule reached orbit. People listened in with excitement and awe. \"Roger, zero G and I feel fine,\" Glenn relayed from space. \"Capsule is turning around. Oh, that view is tremendous!\" Article continues after sponsorship So much about space in those days was unknown. Scientists designed experiments to study whether astronauts could eat or drink in space. Doctors were concerned that human eyes would change shape, making it hard to operate during re-entry. Then there was the technology. Rockets exploded during testing, sometimes with the astronauts watching. In 2012, on the 50th anniversary of his Mercury flight, Glenn reflected on the danger. \"It was important because of the Cold War,\" Glenn said at a Smithsonian forum. \"It was a new step forward, and we were proud to be representing our country there. And so ... you made it as safe as you possibly could, and what little bit of risk was left, we accepted that.\" Any trip to space is risky, and Glenn's mission was no exception. During his five hour, three-orbit flight, there were some tense moments after faulty warnings about his heat shield. At a post-flight news conference, Glenn was characteristically cool. \"So there were some moments of doubt there as to whether the heat shield had been damaged and whether it might be tearing up itself. And this ... this could have been a bad day all the way around if this had been the case.\" After the flight, he became a national hero. He befriended President John F. Kennedy and received a ticker-tape parade in New York City. \"I think John Glenn will be remembered as an actual hero at a time when heroes are often called heroes but are not,\" says Francis French, the author of many books on the space program's early days. French says Glenn was basically an all-American boy with a photogenic smile and a quick wit. \"I think John Glenn is one of those people that's going to stay in the history books,\" he says. \"And even the most cynical of history readers is going to go, 'This guy actually is what everybody says he was.' \" French says Glenn was \"exactly at the right place at the right time for when America needed somebody to not only become the first American to orbit the Earth but to actually project what it meant for America to put a person into space.\" A life in flight and politics Glenn was a highly decorated Marine who flew 59 combat missions in the South Pacific during World War II. During the Korean War, he flew 90 combat missions, using different models of new jet fighters. He remained in the military through the 1950s, testing supersonic aircraft and other military models. In all, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross five times. In 1958 he was one of 508 pilots tested for what became the Mercury program, an accelerated response to the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first satellite in 1957. Portrait Of U.S. Sen.

Glenn Jr. in 1998, when he served as Payload Specialist For Space Shuttle Sts-95. NASA/Getty Images He left NASA in 1964. Later he would learn that at the time, NASA and Kennedy had deemed him too valuable to fly in space again. In 1974, he was elected to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate. Two years later, Glenn's name was among those mentioned as a running mate for Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter, but Carter ended up picking Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Glenn campaigned in the Democratic primary for the 1984 presidential election, but ended up losing to Mondale. But he remained in the Senate, serving four six-year terms. During his Senate career he was noted for his attention to NASA and to national defense. He was also remembered for his support for the Panama Canal treaty in the late 1970s and for his resistance to the decision to televise the Senate floor debates on C-SPAN. He warned that the Senate's reputation for deliberation would suffer if it became, in effect, a TV show. He retired from politics in 1999. A pioneer once again But as his political career was ending, he wanted to go back into space. In 1998, he lobbied NASA to fly again. Glenn spent nine days aboard the shuttle Discovery \u2014 for science. \"For four days, I had 21 different leads \u2014 brainwaves and respiration and EKG \u2014 21 different body parameters being recorded and sent down to the ground,\" Glenn said in 2011. As a 77-year-old, he became the oldest person to fly in space. His flight revived public interest in NASA. When NASA canceled the shuttle program and scaled back its ambitious exploration efforts, Glenn lamented the loss. He spoke during a 2011 forum at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. \"The average person [was] better educated ... back years ago than most people in the world. And then we put more into basic research and learned the new things first,\" he said. \"That little combination is just as true today. If we lose that edge in research and education, we won't be a leading nation in the world. It's that simple.\" Ron Elving contributed to this story. ",

Angeli Kakade (@angelikakade) has the story. Buzz60 On 'Broad City' and 'Girls,' the female stars clearly have pubic hair. (Photo: Patrik Giardino) 106 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE To shave or not to shave down there? It's usually a private question women ask, but it's one that's gotten attention this week in the wake of a recent study suggesting that those who remove all of their pubic hair are more likely to report having an STI than non-groomers. Possible health benefits aside, pubic hair has been a part of the public discourse lately.\u00a0At least when it comes to 20-somethings on TV. Broad City's\u00a0Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer certainly didn't want Ilana's character\u00a0to be seen with a hairless \"baby vagina,\" as Glazer termed  it. 'Broad City' stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, here at Comedy Central upfront, made sure their character didn't appear to have a bare vagina on TV. \u00a0(Photo: Bryan Bedder) \"I'm an adult. I have boobs, I have pubic hair,\" she said on\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel , hence her Broad City\u00a0persona's appropriately-colored blur over her genitals in a nude scene in\u00a0the show's\u00a0 Season 2 premiere . After talking with Comedy Central, Jacobson and Glazer got the OK to change the pixels from skin-color to dark brown. (\"In a way, you're not just doing a show, you're fighting for civil rights,\" Kimmel joked.) On\u00a0Girls,\u00a0Lena Dunham's character Hannah flashed her unshaven vagina on the fifth season of the show. Dunham's one regret for that scene?\u00a0\"I wish that I had a fuller bush, I just think it would look better, the whole thing would work better,\" she said on HBO's\u00a0Behind the Episode. Why Millennials are going braless Off-screen, other actresses have made their grooming habits known. In her\u00a0Body Book,\u00a0released three years ago, Cameron Diaz has an entire chapter\u00a0called\u00a0\"In Praise of Pubes.\" In it, she writes that maintaining a \"lovely curtain of pubic hair that surrounds that glorious, delicate flower of yours\" makes you more \"enticing and mysterious.\" That's a sentiment Miley Cyrus would likely agree with. A year ago, the singer proudly revealed her pink pubic hair in\u00a0Instagram photos of herself (and a\u00a0 doll outfitted in her likeness ) and in\u00a0a nude\u00a0Paper Magazine\u00a0photo shoot. Gwyneth Paltrow has also admitted that she works \"a '70s vibe\" which had \"everyone scrambling for a razor\" when she had to go commando on the runway three years ago. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore go makeup-free for 2017 Pirelli Calendar It's not just stars who are keeping hair down there. Laura Schubert, CEO of high-end pubic haircare company Fur, launched her brand last year when she saw that all Google searches of \"pubic hair\" led to sites about\u00a0removal. Now, her company's signature Fur Oil product , $39, is sold in dozens of stores in the U.S. and abroad, to customers who have varying grooming habits. High-end brand Fur sells pubic haircare products. \u00a0(Photo: Courtesy Laura Schubert) It's not necessarily that the full bush is back, Schubert says, but that pubic grooming is following the \"natural\" movement that has also recently influenced the\u00a0 braless trend \u00a0and\u00a0 makeup-free look . \"Modern beauty is really about redefining our old standards of care (and) moving\u00a0away from a world where bare is what you had to be,\" she says. \"You get to decide what\u2019s sexy.\" 106 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hpQIdQ ",

Jurors on Thursday saw horrific photos of the church basement at the trial of Dylann Roof, accused of hate crimes in the killings of nine black people at the church last year. Stephen B. Morton/AP In Charleston, S.C., federal court Thursday, a jury got a look inside Emanuel AME Church in the aftermath of last year's mass shooting that left nine black worshippers dead. They were gunned down during Wednesday Bible study as they bowed their heads for the closing prayer. Prosecutors say Dylann Roof, a self-avowed white supremacist, targeted the historic church to start a race war. Testimony from crime scene investigators involved graphic, bloody photos, including a panoramic view of the church basement. It was the most unnatural scene. A fellowship hall set up as if for Sunday supper: tables draped in white linen, an organ in the corner. Notes and Bibles, some still open, on tabletops. But on the floor, bodies of the victims and pools of blood. Spent gun magazines and cartridge cases strewn about. Bullet holes through chairs, and tablecloths, in the floor and through the church walls. There was so much to document, investigator Britany Burke testified, that officials ran out of evidence markers and had to use index cards to finish the job. They found seven magazines, and 74 casings. The medical examiner collected 54 bullets or fragments from the nine victims, she said.

In an op-ed published by The Washington Post, Jennifer Palmieri revisited the bitter public confrontation with top Trump campaign aides at the Harvard event . The forum, held quadrennially at the Kennedy School of Government, includes aides and strategists from each presidential campaign, who review the highlights and turning points of the campaign. It\u2019s billed as a kind of \u201cfirst draft of history,\u201d and last week, the event erupted into an ugly war of words between Palmieri and Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant strategist, a brilliant tactician, I am glad to have lost,\u201d Palmieri declared at the event, adding that she \u201cwould rather lose than win the way you guys did.\u201d \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t, that\u2019s very clear today,\u201d Conway retorted. \u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Conway asked Palmieri at the forum. \u201cAre you going to look me in the face and tell me that?\u201d \u201cYou did, Kellyanne,\u201d said Palmieri. \u201cYou did!\u201d In the op-ed, Palmieri explained that while she knew you had to be gracious at this post-election forum, \u201cI decided this was a year where normal rules don\u2019t apply. Speaking the truth was more important\u201d she wrote, and that meant telling Conway that she had run a campaign \u201cthat gave white supremacists a platform.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTrump winning the election doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d Palmieri continued. \u201cTo my mind, his win makes it all the more important that the truth be acknowledged.\u201d Palmieri accused Trump of giving the white nationalist movement a platform by retweeting its members, and she said the website that Trump adviser Steven Bannon previously ran, Breitbart, gave that movement a platform to spread their ideas. Clinton supporters took Trump\u2019s words literally, Palmieri said. \u201cYou know who else took his words literally? White supremacists. The white supremacists who lauded Trump with cries of \u2018 Hail, Trump! \u2019\u201d Palmieri wrote. Many Clinton supporters -- Muslims, Hispanics, parents -- \u201cwere sincerely frightened by his campaign\u2019s embrace of the alt-right,\u201d Palmieri asserted, referring to the extreme right wing movement that favors white supremacy. The Trump team, Palmieri wrote, likes telling Clinton supporters \u201chashtag \u2018he\u2019s your president.\u2019\u201d She went on to say, \u201cIf Trump expects the Americans who did not vote for him to accept him as president, he needs to show that he accepts all of them as Americans. He needs to show that he understands their concerns and hears their fears.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Related: Trump Kicks of Victory Lap by Touting Carrier Deal Jones has accused Trump of \"lying his a\u2014 off\" and taking credit for saving 1,100 jobs in the deal to keep a Carrier plant in Indianapolis, when 300 of those jobs were never scheduled to be lost in the first place and hundreds of others workers will still be laid off. A spokesperson for Carrier confirmed to NBC News Thursday that the deal with the state that includes $7 million in incentives will keep 800 jobs in Indianapolis that were scheduled to be lost under a planned move to Mexico. The previously announced plan would have shed 1,400 jobs. The company said 600 workers will still lose their jobs when the company moves a fan coil manufacturing line. Trump responded to Jones' criticism late Wednesday with a pair of Tweets in which the president-elect said Jones \"has done a terrible job representing workers\" and that \"if United Steelworkers was any good they would have kept those jobs in Indiana.\" Related: Post-Election, Trump Continues to Show Knack for the Unpredictable Jones said on MSNBC that \"maybe I could have phrased it in a different manner,\" but he doesn't regret speaking out. \"You know, I got to give the guy credit. He's got a little bit of spunk to him,\" he said of Trump. Jones said he appreciated Trump saving as many jobs as he did under the deal, but he told CNN Wednesday, \"I just wish that he'd have had the numbers down.\" Jones repeated praise for the president-elect's role in saving 800 jobs Thursday as well.

But meteorologists are warning about a second, perhaps even colder chill that could spread into the East Coast and possibly portions of the South late next week. A shift in a weather system known as the Polar Vortex may be partially to blame, according to The Weather Channel . For now, parts of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and the Dakotas were bearing the worst of it, with temperatures as low as minus-14 overnight Wednesday. Heavy snow was also falling around the Great Lakes region, and parts of Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania and New York could see up to 2 feet of snow. Before dawn, Rick Velasquez shovels fresh snow during a winter storm in Boulder, Colorado on Dec. 7, 2016. Brennan Linsley / AP By Friday night, the frigid air was expected to have swept most of the U.S. with temperatures in the 20s from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Buffalo, New York, and from Atlanta to Seattle. New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston were also expected to flirt with freezing temperatures late Friday. \"It's going to be a shock,\" said Kevin Roth, senior meteorologist at The Weather Channel. \"The fall was closest to the warmest on record so this is really back to reality.\" No, these are not forecast low temperatures. These are high temperatures for the second half of next week.

After a brief reprieve following the weekend, temperatures could plunge into the minus next Friday in Midwestern cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis, into the teens across the North East and possibly back into the 20s in the South. According to Roth, temperatures are expected to drop because of a shift in a stratospheric weather system known as the Polar Vortex. Play ",

Clinton thanked Reid for his 30 years of public service and lauded his efforts to fight on behalf of working families in Nevada and across America.

(Michael Tercha/Chicago Tribune) Phil Thompson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Cubs have opened a team store on Michigan Avenue and on Friday it will host a special guest: The World Series trophy. Its stop at the temporary pop-up shop on the Magnificent Mile marks the start of the team's trophy tour. Fans will be able to take photos with the hardware between noon and 3 p.m. at the store (663 N. Michigan Ave.). The trophy makes its next appearance at City Hall on Dec. 15 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. From there, it will visit several unspecified locations across Chicago before going on the road across the state to Bloomington, Champaign, the Quad Cities, Rockford and Springfield. After that it's on to South Bend, Indianapolis and other stops in Indiana. The trophy then will go on display in Des Moines, where the team has a\u00a0 minor league affiliate, as well as various cities in Iowa, then barnstorm through the Midwest. The Cubs' Mesa, Arizona-complex will host the trophy during spring training before it returns to Wrigley Field for the April 10 home opener. The team will post schedules and other information about the trophy and collect fan social media posts with it on cubs.com/trophytour, and fans also can follow #CubsTrophyTour on Twitter and Instagram.

    "text": "By Jonnelle Marte December 8 at 5:16 PM Follow @jonnelle CKE Restaurants CEO Andrew Puzder, center, departs Trump Tower in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, as head of the Labor Department,\u00a0according to a Republican briefed on the decision.\u00a0 Puzder, who runs CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr., has been a harsh critic of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, arguing that it would increase costs for consumers and lead to fewer jobs. He also opposes the recently-delayed Labor Department rule that aimed to make millions more workers eligible for overtime pay. As the head of a fast-food company, Puzder is a supporter of the approach touted by Trump on the campaign trail that lowering taxes for corporations and the wealthy and loosening regulations for businesses can boost job creation. He is a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act , which he claims has hurt the restaurant industry because higher health premiums have left consumers with less money to spend. By bringing in Puzder, Trump is signaling that he may scale back some of regulations introduced by current Labor Secretary Tom Perez. If confirmed, he will have the potential to reverse some of the Obama administration\u2019s most notable efforts to bolster protections for workers, families and retirement savers. [ Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet ] His appointment could put\u00a0the future of the Labor Department\u2019s overtime rule into question. In a Forbes op-ed that ran after the Labor Department finalized the overtime rule in May, Puzder wrote that the rule would \u201cadd to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers,\u201d and that the rule would lead to fewer hours and reduced opportunities for workers. As Labor Secretary, Puzder could potentially decide not to defend the rule in court. He could also propose revisions to the rule, but any adjustments would likely require notice and\u00a0public comment. With the upcoming nomination of the fast-food executive, Trump would bring another top fundraiser into his cabinet. Puzder supported Trump\u2019s race to the White House financially and served as an economic adviser to his campaign. He and his wife, Deanna, contributed a total of $332,000 to helping Trump get elected, including money given to Trump\u2019s campaign, to joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. His anti-regulation stance is also viewed as a threat to another major rule finalized by the Labor Department earlier this year that would affect the investing advice given to retirement savers. The rule would require brokers and insurers to put their clients\u2019 interest ahead of their own. Financial firms opposed to the rule say it is \u201cburdensome\u201d and could limit their ability to work with small-time investors. While Puzder has not addressed the regulation specifically, his nomination increases the likelihood that implementation of that rule could be delayed,\u00a0according to an analyst report from the investment bank FBR & Co. The move could give lawmakers and the Trump administration more time to repeal or revise the rule. Puzder has said that government policies that increase labor costs, such as significantly raising the minimum wage , hurt small businesses and \u201c encourage automation .\u201d In March, he told Business Insider that he and other fast-food companies are investing in automation and considering machines that could tackle simple tasks such as taking customers\u2019 orders. \u201cIf you\u2019re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive \u2014 this is not rocket science,\u201d he said at the time, though he later added that he would never remove all front-line employees. Some business groups applauded Puzder\u2019s likely nomination Thursday saying that the fast-food executive understands the challenges faced by retailers and restaurants. \u201cAndrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,\u201d said David French, senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which also opposes the overtime rule. But some Democrats and consumer advocates are critical of Trump\u2019s expected pick, saying his approach may harm low-wage workers. \u201cThe Labor Secretary should be someone who wakes up every day thinking about how they can raise American wages and fight for American workers,\u201d Sen. Charles Schumer said in a statement. \u201cMr. Puzder\u2019s career has shown exactly the opposite.\u201d Puzder became the CEO of\u00a0CKE Restaurants in 2000. The company, which has more than 3,700 restaurant locations in 44 states and 39 countries, is in the process of relocating its headquarters from southern California to Nashville.\u00a0Prior to joining the fast-food business, he worked as a commercial trial lawyer in St. Louis, Mo. Philip Rucker contributed to this report. Read more: ",

The disastrous tally has been pushed to new heights by soaring abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers, a class of drugs known as opioids. Heroin deaths rose 23 percent in one year, to 12,989, slightly higher than the number of gun homicides, according to government data released Thursday. Deaths from synthetic opioids, including illicit fentanyl, rose 73 percent to 9,580. And prescription painkillers took the highest toll, but posted the smallest increase. Abuse of drugs like Oxycontin and Vicodin killed 17,536, an increase of 4 percent. ",

She last met a foreign visitor on Nov. 10, when she greeted a presidential delegation from Kazakhstan, the same day she spoke on the phone with President-elect Donald J. Trump. She has delivered three televised apologies, each only several minutes long, sometimes choking with emotion. \u201cMy heart is crushed,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I think I cannot resolve the deep disappointment and anger of the people even if I apologize 100 times.\u201d She was said to have heard the weekly protests calling for her to leave office. Those protests have grown from 20,000 people in central Seoul six weeks ago to about 1.7 million on Saturday, who came within a few hundred feet of her compound, shouting, \u201cEvict her!\u201d \u201cThe president heard the people\u2019s voices with a heavy heart,\u201d Jung Youn-kuk, Ms. Park\u2019s spokesman, said after one of the protests, though he did not clarify whether she heard the protesters\u2019 shouts through her window or, as one South Korean news outlet has reported, watched them on TV. Photo About 1.7 million people protested in central Seoul on Saturday, calling for Ms. Park to step down. Credit Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters Beyond that, her aides have declined to discuss her daily routine or her mood these days, except to say that she was taking the crisis gravely and was doing her best to deal with it. They said she had invited Christian leaders and a top Buddhist monk to visit her last month to offer advice on the crisis. Her office did not disclose what they told her, except that the monk had quoted Buddhist scripture, saying, \u201cA tree bears fruit when it sheds flowers.\u201d For many in South Korea , the flower has already fallen. As Ms. Park\u2019s approval rating has plummeted, shop owners across the country have pulled down pictures of her they once hung proudly on the wall. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even in her hometown, Daegu, where she made a brief visit last week, she was confronted by protesters demanding her resignation. After visiting a century-old market that had been heavily damaged in a fire, her office said, she returned to her car and wept . Possibly the last time a South Korean leader was this isolated was in 2008, when massive crowds had rallied in central Seoul for weeks to protest President Lee Myung-bak\u2019s decision to lift a ban on American beef imports amid fears of mad cow disease . At the time, Mr. Lee said he climbed Mount Bugak, the cool green peak that rises above the Blue House, in the evening, saw the protesters\u2019 candlelight filling the city center and wept. For Ms. Park, the Blue House itself is ablaze with memories. She first moved there at age 9, when her father, Maj. Gen. Park Chung-hee, seized power in a military coup in 1961 . At 22, after her mother was killed in an assassination attempt against her father, she became his acting first lady. In 1979, after her father was assassinated amid widespread protests against his dictatorship, she left the presidential palace, only to return as president in 2013. In between, she lived a secluded life in southern Seoul, in a house plastered with photos of her dead parents and adorned with their relics. \u201cHer home was more like a museum for Park Chung-hee,\u201d Choi Sang-yeon, an editorial writer at the South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo, wrote recently of his visit there a decade ago. \u201cIt looked as if her clock had stopped in the 1970s and she spent much time communicating with her dead father.\u201d Mr. Choi described the atmosphere there as \u201cheavy and dark.\u201d In her 1993 memoir, \u201cWhat If I Were Born in an Ordinary Family,\u201d Ms. Park wrote of her tragic family history and her sadness: \u201cIn my life\u2019s scale, the worthwhile times have never outweighed painful ones.\u201d In the end, Ms. Park\u2019s cloistered life may have set the stage for her political implosion. She has said she often spends evenings alone reading government reports. She shuns one-on-one meetings with senior aides. Her former cook told a South Korean magazine that she usually ate alone, watching TV. She has said she cut ties with her brother and sister to prevent nepotism, a bane of past South Korean presidents. She has two dogs, white Jindos, a Korean breed prized for its loyalty. Photo Ms. Park, at the rear, in an undated photograph with her parents and siblings. She has no husband or children. Both of her parents were assassinated, and she has been estranged from her brother and sister for years. Credit Yonhap, via Reuters But in an episode that has haunted her presidency, when the ferry Sewol sank in 2014 , killing more than 300 people in one of the country\u2019s biggest disasters in decades, her chief of staff said he could not locate her for seven hours. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Where she was during those crucial hours has been one of the most jealously guarded secrets of her office, spawning lurid rumors. Her office recently said that she was in her residence, not in her main work office, at the time and that she did receive reports about the sinking. In testimony before a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, her former chief of staff, Kim Ki-choon, said only that he did not know where in the sprawling compound she was. \u201cI only knew that she was somewhere in the Blue House,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know well what was going on in her personal life in her residence.\u201d Her trusted friend and adviser all these years was Choi Soon-sil, whose family had befriended her while her father was still in power. After becoming president, Ms. Park has said that she continued to rely on Ms. Choi to look after her wardrobe and other personal affairs. Prosecutors said Ms. Choi did far more than that, and they have indicted her on extortion and other charges. While Ms. Park cannot be indicted while she holds office, the indictment of Ms. Choi identified Ms. Park as a criminal accomplice , a first for a president. In her apologies, a grim-faced Ms. Park has said she could not forgive herself for letting her guard down with Ms. Choi, who she said had helped her during her \u201clonely\u201d and \u201cdifficult times.\u201d But she admitted no legal wrongdoing.
