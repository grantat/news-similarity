Seoul announced in August that Thae Yong Ho, No. 2 at the North's embassy in London, had come to South Korea with his family because of his disgust with North Korea . Pyongyang later called him \"human scum\" who embezzled official funds and committed other crimes. Thae, who has been under the protection of the National Intelligence Service, met with South Korean lawmakers on Monday together with NIS officers, according to Lee Cheol Woo, one of the lawmakers. The NIS, South Korea's main spy agency, said it couldn't confirm the meeting. Lee's office cited Thae as denying the North Korean accusations and saying he decided to defect after realizing the North's \"horrific\" reality. He was quoted as saying he learned about South Korean democracy by watching South Korean dramas and movies. He told lawmakers that North Koreans are suffering \"slavery\" under Kim's dictatorship and that higher-level officials are subject to more intense state surveillance. Thae, who is to be released into South Korean society on Friday, said he'll try to publicly raise the North's situation, Lee's office said. South Korean media said that Thae will be under a police protection program after his release into society. Thae is the most senior North Korean diplomat to defect to South Korea. In 1997, the North Korean ambassador to Egypt fled but resettled in the United States. Kim, believed to be in his early 30s, took power upon the death of his dictator father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. He's since orchestrated a series of high-profile executions, purges and dismissals in what outside analysts have said was an attempt to bolster his grip on power. More than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, according to the South Korean government. Many defectors have said they wanted to leave North Korea's harsh political system and poverty. 0 Shares ",

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump's pick for attorney general, during one of Trump\u2019s \u201cthank-you\u201d tour rallies, on Saturday. Trump has echoed the views of Sessions, perhaps the Senate\u2019s most vocal immigration hard-liner. (Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images) By David Nakamura December 19 at 10:59 AM Follow @davidnakamura As a leading advocate for slashing legal immigration levels, Roy Beck has spent years on the political fringes of the debate in a country that has had dramatic growth in its foreign-born population over a half-century. Beck is executive director of NumbersUSA, an Arlington-based nonprofit organization devoted to \u201cstabilizing\u201d the population. He has been marginalized in Washington as an eccentric figure whose views some consider xenophobic or even racist. In recent weeks, though, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s early appointments, including the nominee for attorney general and two top White House advisers, are giving Beck hope that his positions are suddenly front and center at the highest levels of government. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the wilderness, and overnight we are not anymore,\u201d Beck said. Trump, he added, \u201creally did make some very strong statements about cutting immigration. That\u2019s a total change.\u201d Throughout Western nations, societies are reexamining the merits of immigration in the wake of a global surge of refugees, terrorist attacks and struggling economies. In the United States, President Obama has warned against an overreaction to the forces of globalization and the political and economic turmoil in the Middle East and Europe. He has referred to the United States, repeatedly, as a \u201cnation of immigrants.\u201d But here, as in Europe, some of the most strident restrictionist voices have gained new political legitimacy amid a wave of populist anxiety of the kind that propelled Trump to his presidential victory. Trump campaigned on pledges to build a border wall, deport the undocumented and ban Muslim immigrants. And during a campaign speech in Phoenix last summer, he raised the specter of new policies to curtail legal immigration, citing concerns about foreign workers taking jobs and keeping wages down for the native-born. Trump noted that 59\u00a0million immigrants had come to the United States over the past 50 years, boosting the nation\u2019s foreign-born population share from 4.8\u00a0percent to 14\u00a0percent, according to Pew Research Center. \u201cMany of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration \u2014 as we have following previous immigration waves \u2014 to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility.\u201d Today, the U.S. government awards green cards to more than 1\u00a0million foreigners annually, granting them legal permanent residence. Groups such as NumbersUSA want to slash that by a half or more. In his speech, Trump expressed a desire to cut legal immigration levels to \u201cwithin historical norms,\u201d as measured by a share of the overall population, and he proposed a new federal commission to develop proposals to achieve it. The goal, he said, would be to \u201cselect immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self-sufficient.\u201d The new immigration system should establish \u201ccontrols to boost wages and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.\u201d Trump has echoed the views of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who is perhaps the Senate\u2019s most vocal immigration hard-liner and whom Trump has nominated as U.S. attorney general. Stephen Miller, a longtime Sessions aide who wrote most of Trump\u2019s immigration speeches, has been named senior adviser to the president for policy in the Trump White House. And Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist, advocated for reducing legal immigration levels as editor of Breitbart News, a conservative site that reports extensively on the issue. \u201cWhat we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,\u201d Sessions wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last year. To immigrant rights advocates, such talk sounds like justification for pursuing \u201cnativist and xenophobic\u201d policies, said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. She pointed to academic studies showing that immigrants spur economic growth and suggested that Trump and his aides are employing a false rationale as political cover to \u201ctake us back to [the policies of] previous centuries.\u201d The last time the United States significantly cut immigration levels was in 1924, after a public backlash over huge spikes of foreign workers during the Second Industrial Revolution prompted Congress to establish strict quotas based on \u201cnational origin.\u201d The new laws favored white immigrants from Northern and Western Europe, while severely restricting Jews from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Africans. Asians and Arabs were banned outright. Over the ensuing decades, U.S. immigration rates plunged to their lowest levels since the pre-Civil War era \u2014 from more than 800,000 immigrants a year between 1900 and 1910 to about 70,000 a year between 1930 and 1940, according to federal data . In 1965, Congress replaced the national-origin quota with a system focused on reuniting immigrant families that led to a massive spike in immigration levels. Under current policies, immigrants and their descendants will account for an additional 103\u00a0million people over 50\u00a0years, 88\u00a0percent of the nation\u2019s population growth, according to Pew. \u201cThe question is whether having an immigration level higher than any other country in the world but half of what we have now signifies any kind of qualitative change in who we are as a country,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, another group that advocates for reducing immigration levels. \u201cThat 500,000 or 400,000 immigrants a year is somehow un-American, but 1\u00a0million is America.\u201d During unsuccessful immigration reform efforts under President George W. Bush in 2007 and Obama in 2013, Beck and Krikorian were reliable voices of opposition to bipartisan legislative proposals that featured a path to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11\u00a0million illegal immigrants. But to them, the fate of the undocumented \u2014 which has become the major flash point on Capitol Hill \u2014 obscures their more fundamental goal of reducing overall immigration flows. A third major restrictionist group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, has spent decades lobbying Congress to cap immigration at 300,000 per year. All three organizations were started with funding from John Tanton, a Michigan doctor who has professed support for eugenics, the pseudoscience claiming that some racial groups are inherently superior. But Beck rejected as \u201cnonsense\u201d the notion that his group\u2019s views are based on race. \u201cIt is nationalist, not nativist,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not where you were born, but are you a member of this national community?\u201d NumbersUSA touts as its spiritual godmother the late Barbara Jordan, a Texas Democrat who was the first African American woman elected to Congress from the Deep South. In the mid-1990s, before her death in 1996, Jordan chaired a bipartisan federal commission that recommended to the Clinton administration cutting annual green cards from 675,000 a year to 550,000. Clinton never moved forward on the proposal. In an ad that aired during the Republican and Democratic presidential primary debates last year, NumbersUSA featured a clip of Jordan\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe commission finds no national interest in continuing to import lesser-skilled and unskilled workers to compete in the most vulnerable parts of our labor force.\u201d Studies have shown that immigrants who arrive legally boost the economy over the long term and that many have higher levels of education than native-born Americans. Proponents of lowering immigration levels \u201care just interested in coming up with reasons not to have people who are different,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, an adjunct scholar at the conservative Cato Institute who served as counselor to the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under Bush. Anderson said the 1924 law that slashed immigration rates was \u201chardly a model of good governance. It was one of the ugliest periods of the eugenics movement and extremely anti-Semitic.\u201d Trump advisers emphasized that limiting immigration would benefit all American workers, including blacks and Hispanics. One aide said the president-elect has not specified a target immigration level because he wants to consult members of Congress. The aide \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address the debate because he was not authorized to talk about the issue on the record \u2014 said Trump favors a revamped system that would prioritize immigrants with high education levels and expertise in high-skilled industries such as technology. The 1965 immigration act sought to build in preferences for skilled foreign laborers, but the system overwhelmingly favors family reunification. Of the 1\u00a0million foreigners granted permanent legal residence in 2014, 647,000 \u2014 about two-thirds \u2014 received green cards based on family ties, according to the Department of Homeland Security . Just 152,000 permanent arrivals were employment-based. In addition, 134,000 refugees and asylum seekers received green cards, and 54,000 more were distributed in an annual diversity lottery for underrepresented countries, many in Africa. Critics have said the rules encourage \u201cchain migration,\u201d the tradition of immigrants seeking to bring extended family members. The Trump aide cited as a model Canada\u2019s system of awarding points to immigrants based on education, job skills, language proficiency, age and other criteria. If he pursues a legislative push, Trump is likely to run into major resistance, including from some fellow Republicans and members of the business community, which has supported more-robust programs for foreign workers and their families. But Beck said he is counting on Trump. \u201cWe have a citizen army,\u201d said Beck, whose group has more than 6\u00a0million Facebook followers. \u201cWe will be acting and pushing members of Congress. We\u2019re not going into this expecting him to disappoint us.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Photo: ELAINE THOMPSON, AP) When it comes to car ads, there\u2019s little truth in advertising. However, that little bit of truth could point you toward being a smarter car shopper. So it\u2019s important to separate fact from fiction when shopping for a new car . To help you see through the hype, I contacted two colleagues and drew on experience from my time as a car salesman. Together, we\u2019ve listed the five fibs we see most often in television and print auto ads. 1. Ridiculously low lease payments These days, it seems you can lease any car for $199 \u2014 or even less \u2014 per month. But Jim Dykstra, a former car dealer who created the subscription car-buying site Vinadvisor.net , says a low payment really just means you\u2019re getting less. Case in point: included mileage. \u201cYou need to understand the value of miles before you race down to the dealership,\ufffd? he says. \u201cThe difference between a lease calculated at 10,000 miles per year and 15,000 miles per year can be up to $50 a month.\ufffd? Advertised lease payments might also omit taxes and fees, Dykstra says. In many states, the sales tax plus the dealer and registry fees increase the lease payment by more than 10%. 2. Hidden drive-off fees This is my personal favorite, because you could theoretically lease a Ferrari for $199 per month if \u2014 and this is a big if \u2014 you paid high enough drive-off fees. \u201cDrive-off fees\ufffd? is a leasing term for the amount of money you pay up front to cruise off the lot. For example, many dealerships advertise the Audi A4 for a monthly payment of $350. This probably doesn\u2019t include the tax and fees, as Dykstra points out, and you\u2019ll have to plunk down $3,500 to qualify for this low payment. Down payments make sense when you\u2019ll eventually own the car, but when leasing a car , it\u2019s the opposite. Instead, make a drive-off payment of $1,000 or less. Your monthly lease payment will be higher, but you\u2019ll preserve your savings. 3. Show one car, price another \u201cA classic game that car ads like to play is showing the most decked out, fully loaded, top trim level of a model but [advertising] it for the price of the base model,\ufffd? says automotive reporter Jaclyn Trop. \u201cIn reality, the prices can differ by thousands of dollars.\ufffd? When shopping, she suggests, you should review the equipment included with each trim level \u2014 typically base, sport and luxury \u2014 and buying only features you know you need. 4. The case of the disappearing \u201cad car\ufffd? Used cars are selling for record average prices these days, due in part to inventory typically being less than three years old as new cars come off lease, according to Edmunds.com. \u00a0(Photo: Chris O'Meara, AP) Carmakers equip one version of a car model at a strategic price so they can present an affordable-sounding figure. But Dykstra says dealers order few of these cars. \u201cSo lots of times, even if you wanted to buy the ad car that you saw online or on TV, those ad cars are few and far between,\ufffd? he says. Here\u2019s a tipoff that the vehicle in the newspaper is an ad car: In small print, the ad will say, \u201c1 at this price.\ufffd? And that one car is in the back of the lot blocked in by five other vehicles. 5. Incentives \u2014 but not for you You\u2019re reading the newspaper when you see an ad for the car you want at an unbelievably low price. You think there must be a catch \u2014 and there is. Above the advertised price, you\u2019ll usually find a note that the company has factored in cash incentives, but you probably won\u2019t qualify for these. Dealers will often extend hefty loyalty bonuses to those who buy the same make of car, so unless you\u2019re sticking with the same brand, you\u2019re out of luck. ",

Emergency workers respond to the scene after a truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday. (Associated Press) Erik Kirschbaum German police said that nine people were killed and at least 50 injured when the driver of a 40-ton truck appeared to deliberately crash into a crowded outdoor Christmas market in the heart of Berlin Monday evening. Police said they are investigating whether it was an intentional attack on the market at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, one of dozens of such cherished pre-holiday markets throughout the city where hundreds of numbers of people gather for drinks, snacks and to shop for handmade Christmas presents. A police spokesman said that a man suspected of being the truck\u2019s driver had been detained several hundred yards away from the scene, and that a passenger in the truck had\u00a0died from injuries. \u201cWe have detained a suspect whose description matched that of the person said to be driving the truck and fled,\u201d Berlin police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf told reporters. \u201cThe passenger in the truck is dead. We\u2019re just at the start of our investigation.\u201d German TV networks showed police and rescue workers moving\u00a0around a\u00a0damaged black truck with several smashed windows.

More than half of people who get paid vacation time won't use all their days off this year, according to a report from\u00a0New York-based Bankrate.com. (EyesWideOpen/Getty Images) More than half of Americans who get paid vacation time won't use all of their days off this year, according to a report from New York-based Bankrate.com. If you're leaving vacation days on the table this year, you're not alone. More than half of people who get paid vacation time won't use all their days off this year, and it's often not just one or two wasted days. A report from New York-based Bankrate.com found the average amount of leftover days is 19, and the median is seven. Millennials are the biggest hoarders. One in four workers in the 18 to 25 age group say when the calendar flips to 2017, they will not have used a single day from 2016. That's compared with fewer than one in 10 employees overall. \"Younger millennials in general feel that they're laying the foundations of their career,\" said Sarah Berger, personal finance expert at Bankrate.com. \"They feel like they have something to prove and that's really why they're not taking as many days off.\" Banking the days to be used the following year is the most popular reason for not using vacation days, but other reasons reflect today's worries in the workplace. Twenty-three percent said they feared the mountain of work that would await them upon their return from time off. Other reasons for eating the days included enjoying work, not being able to afford a trip and worries about their jobs being at risk if they spend too much time away. ",

    "text": "Beijing Denies US Claim That China Is Synthetic Drug King By erika kinetz and gillian wong, associated press BEIJING \u0097 Dec 19, 2016, 10:47 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Synthetic Marijuana Suspected in Mass LA Overdose 0 Shares Email U.S. assertions that China is the top source of the synthetic opioids that have killed thousands of drug users in the U.S. and Canada are unsubstantiated, Chinese officials told the Associated Press. Both the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy point to China as North America's main source of fentanyl, related drugs and the chemicals used to make them. Such statements \"lack the support of sufficient numbers of actual, confirmed cases,\" China's National Narcotics Control Commission told DEA's Beijing field office in a fax dated Friday. In its letter to the DEA, which the commission also sent to AP, Chinese officials urged the U.S. to provide more evidence about China's role as a source country. It's a point the state-run China Daily newspaper drove home publicly in an article this month stating that made-in-China carfentanil was not the cause of overdose deaths in the U.S. DEA officials said their casework and investigations consistently lead back to China. DEA data also shows that when China regulates synthetic drugs, U.S. seizures plunge. \"China is not the only source of the problem, but they are the dominant source for fentanyls along with precursor chemicals and pill presses that are being exported from China to the U.S., Canada and Mexico,\" said Russell Baer, a DEA special agent in Washington. Beijing is concerned enough about international perceptions of China's role in the opioid trade that after AP published investigations highlighting the easy availability of fentanyls online from Chinese suppliers, the narcotics commission made a rare invitation to a team of AP journalists to discuss the issue at the powerful Ministry of Public Security, a leafy complex just off Tiananmen Square at the historic and political heart of Beijing. They also provided responses, in writing, to AP's questions. U.S.-China cooperation is essential for mounting an effective global response to an epidemic of opioid abuse that has killed more than 300,000 Americans since 2000. The presence of fentanyl, a prescription painkiller up to 50 times stronger than heroin, and related compounds in the U.S. drug supply began to rise in 2013, after dealers learned they could multiply profits by cutting the potent chemicals into heroin, cocaine and counterfeit prescription pills. Even as the U.S. Congress considers legislation that would punish opioid source countries, no government agency has produced comprehensive data on seizures of fentanyl-related substances by country of origin. The national database on drug seizures overseen by DEA does not require reporting by source country and may not accurately reflect seizures of all fentanyl-related compounds. Baer said it didn't even have a \"fentanyl\" category until around two years ago. It also takes time for forensic chemists to identify drugs seized from the field, which means fentanyl-related samples may get initially logged incorrectly as other drugs. \"In those cases, the field agent may not, and I think it's fair to say usually does not, revise or amend the initial seizure,\" Baer said. He added that DEA is trying to improve its data-collection methods. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy declined to comment or to provide data that would back up the U.S. assertions. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had data on fentanyl seizures by country of origin only for 2015: Nearly two-thirds of the 61 kilograms (134 pounds) of fentanyl seized last year came from Mexico. The rest, 35 percent, came from China. DEA officials say Mexican cartels are key bulk suppliers of fentanyl to the U.S., but portray Mexico primarily as a transshipment point. U.S. authorities have tracked shipments of fentanyl precursors from China to Mexico and the U.S., but many appear legitimate and are diverted to the black market upon arrival, Baer said. Mexican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted, said fentanyl and its precursors were coming from China. Only two labs trying to produce fentanyl from scratch have been located in Mexico in recent years, with others apparently taking simpler steps to turn precursors into fentanyl, the officials said. Mexican authorities did not immediately respond to requests for data on fentanyl and fentanyl precursor seizures by country of origin. Still, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence indicating that China plays an important role in the fentanyls trade and, despite disagreements about data, Chinese authorities have been proactive in trying to stop their manufacture and export. It is easy to find Chinese companies online offering to export synthetic opioids, the AP found in investigations published in October and November. In response to that reporting, China's narcotics commission said it was scrutinizing 12 opioid vendors the AP identified, along with other companies that advertise fentanyl analogs. They said they also found three American companies advertising fentanyls, and noted that some vendors use servers based outside of China. China's National Narcotics Laboratory has analyzed 25 fentanyl-related samples since 2012, the vast majority of which were being smuggled by mail to the U.S. or Europe, the commission said. In some cases, China has enacted faster, more comprehensive changes to its drug control laws than much of the rest of the world. The commission said China has taken a precedent-setting approach to synthetic drug regulation, controlling dozens of substances that aren't abused domestically. At the same time, Beijing has struggled to get the international community to reciprocate. China has twice asked the United Nations to place the drug ketamine under international control. Ketamine, also known as Special K, is widely abused within China but prized as an essential anesthetic across the developing world by the World Health Organization and others. \"China looks forward to further practical action taken by the U.S. to jointly promote the international control of ketamine,\" the narcotics commission said in written remarks to AP. Beijing already regulates fentanyl and 18 related compounds and is considering designating four more: carfentanil, furanyl fentanyl, acryl fentanyl and valeryl fentanyl, the narcotics commission told AP. A formal review began in October, and the process can take up to nine months. In the meantime, the commission said it had warned Chinese vendors and websites that carfentanil, a weapons-grade substance so lethal it has been called a terrorism threat, and other analogs can harm human health and should not be sold. That message sent a ripple of anxiety across the internet and caused some to start pushing alternative opioids, like U-47700, the AP found in conversations with a dozen companies advertising drugs online. \"Friend, fent is illegal in China, it is dangerous for us,\" wrote one vendor. Baer said DEA is actively investigating U.S.-based vendors who use dark net markets to sell fentanyl and related compounds, as well as Chinese companies that use U.S. servers to sell carfentanil. But the extent to which those U.S. companies are merely retailing made-in-China drugs is not clear. Baer said the DEA doesn't believe fentanyl is mass-produced in the U.S., though authorities have uncovered mom-and-pop pill press operations. One of them was run by a 28-year-old in Utah, who was busted late last month with a pill press, piles of powder and cash, and nearly 100,000 pills laced with suspected fentanyl in his Cottonwood Heights home. According to the criminal complaint, the young man hired people to accept packages shipped to their homes, which they'd hand over unopened. The packages came from China. \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP reporters Mark Stevenson in Mexico City, Desmond Butler in Washington and researcher Fu Ting in Shanghai contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Burhan Ozbilici/AP hide caption toggle caption Burhan Ozbilici/AP Russia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, speaks at a gallery in Ankara, Turkey, on Monday. Shortly afterward, a gunman opened fire. Burhan Ozbilici/AP Editor's note: An image below shows Ambassador Andrei Karlov on the ground after he was shot. Russia's ambassador to Turkey has died after he was shot Monday evening at an art exhibition in the capital, Ankara, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in comments broadcast on Russian state television. Ambassador Andrei Karlov was shot \"multiple times\" by an armed assailant as he was \"delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of a photo exhibit,\" Turkey's state run news agency, Anadolu , reported. Three other people were injured in the attack, the agency reported. Turkey's interior minister has identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a 22-year-old Turkish riot police officer who had been working in Ankara for about 2 1/2 years, according to Anadolu . Special forces \"neutralized\" the attacker at the scene, Anadolu reported, without elaborating on what it meant by \"neutralized.\" An Associated Press photographer at the scene said the gunman was killed in a shootout with police. Article continues after sponsorship An Associated Press photographer at the scene reports this man shot Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at a photo gallery in Ankara on Monday. Burhan Ozbilici/AP hide caption toggle caption Burhan Ozbilici/AP The Associated Press photographer who witnessed the attack said the gunman wore a suit and tie and shouted \"Allahu Akhbar\" as he fired \"at least eight shots.\" The man also shouted \"Don't forget Aleppo! Don't forget Syria!\" in Turkish, the wire service added. He then yelled: \"Stand back! Stand back! Only death will take me out of here. Anyone who has a role in this oppression will die one by one.\" The assailant \"smashed several of the photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover,\" according to the AP photographer's account. The attack happened at the opening of a photo exhibition, \"Russia as Seen by the Turks,\" according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency . The local Hurriyet newspaper posted an image of multiple people lying on the floor at what appears to be a gallery that it says is from the immediate aftermath of the attack. \"We qualify the events as a terrorist attack; we stay in contact with Turkish officials who have pledged that a thorough all-round investigation will be carried out. The assassinators will be punished. Today this issue will be brought up at the U.N. Security Council,\" Zakharova said, according to Tass. \"The memory of Russia's prominent diplomat Andrei [Gennadievich] Karlov will always stay in our hearts,\" she added. Russia is a close ally of the neighboring Syrian regime's and is involved in a wide-ranging airstrike campaign in Syria. Some Russian officials are blaming the assassination on those opposed to Russia's actions in Syria, as NPR's Lucian Kim reported from Moscow. \"They want to drive a wedge between Moscow and Ankara at any price,\" Leonid Slutsky, head of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, said on state television. \"It's their strategic goal, but they won't reach it.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the attack a \"provocation to destroy Turkish-Russia normalization,\" Anadolu reported . He said that the two countries have launched a joint commission to investigate the homicide. The attack took place \"just a day before Turkey's foreign minister was to travel to Moscow for talks on Syria,\" as NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Istanbul. Karlov became ambassador to Turkey in 2013 and was a career diplomat, having served since 1976, according to an official biography . He was Russia's ambassador to North Korea and also worked at the Russian Embassy in South Korea. Prior to his post in Turkey, he served as Russia's deputy director general for consular affairs. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby tweeted, \"We condemn this act of violence, whatever its source. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\" This is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",

Julie Delton/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Julie Delton/Getty Images Elderly hospitalized patients taken care of by female doctors had better results than those seen by male doctors. Julie Delton/Getty Images In a study that is sure to rile male doctors, Harvard researchers have found that female doctors who care for elderly hospitalized patients get better results. Patients cared for by women were less likely to die or return to the hospital after discharge. Previous research has shown that female doctors are more likely to follow recommendations about prevention counseling and to order preventive tests like Pap smears and mammograms. But the latest work , published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, is the first to show a big difference in the result that matters most to patients: life or death. The study's authors estimate \"that approximately 32,000 fewer patients would die if male physicians could achieve the same outcomes as female physicians every year.\" Keep Things Simple For A Healthy, Long Life \"Of course! What did you expect?\" replied the wife of Dr. Ashish Jha, the study's senior author, when he shared his team's findings with her. Jha said he expects a backlash over the study results. But his team's methodology, successfully put through multiple analyses, makes this work noteworthy, he added. But tens of thousands of fewer deaths per year if we just went with female doctors? Whoa! To us, a man and woman who met as we were getting our start in medicine, them's fightin' words. An editorial about the study urges doctors to remedy the gender disparities in care and the pay gap that favors male physicians over women. Since half the patients we treat are women and girls, it makes sense that at least half the physician corps should reflect the population. We've achieved that in medical school rolls, but overall only a third of practicing doctors are female. And many specialties, including orthopedics, cardiology and neurosurgery, are still dominated by men. Article continues after sponsorship So why is there a gender-based difference in physicians' care? The authors admit that they are \"unable to identify exactly why female physicians have better outcomes than male physicians.\" We don't pretend to know for sure, but as married doctors, we have our hunches. We talked it over and here are our thoughts about the research. Dr. Sarah-Anne Henning Schumann: The actual effect reported in the study is small, but multiplied over a huge population it does add up to something significant. Dr. John Henning Schumann: I like the Big Data aspect of it. The authors said, \"Let's look at more than a million Medicare patients over several years and see how they fared based on the gender of their doctor.\" While many people may want to tear this study apart, I think the findings make intuitive sense. Sarah-Anne: I'm assuming the difference is because of the way that women, in general, communicate. It's about being better listeners, more nurturing and having emotional intelligence. John: There are plenty of men who are good communicators. Sarah-Anne: Yes, just as there are plenty of women who don't really have those qualities. For female doctors, having worked their way through pre-med, med school and residency, they can have some of that nurturing communication skill beaten out of them. John: That happens to men, too! Sarah-Anne: That's true. But this study shows us \u2014 just possibly \u2014 that if female doctors, on average, communicate better, their style might be more effective in treating disease and preventing death. John: It's interesting to me because I think about some of my older patients, who much prefer that I tell them what to do rather than to discuss options and share decision-making. Sarah-Anne: I think that traditionally men were the doctors. People often assume men are more intelligent and so would be more likely to take their advice. John: That has to change, as we get closer to parity with women in the profession. Sarah-Anne: My mother has had many experiences with male doctors where she feels they haven't listened to her. They aren't warm or kind, but she feels reassured anyway. She thinks they're smart, and what's most important to her is their knowledge and technical skill, not their bedside manner. John: Mom always knows best, if that's what she values. Sarah-Anne: Even in our family, we're both doctors. I'm a family doctor, trained to see adults and kids. You're an internist, trained to only see adults. And in both of our families, most of the time, our family members will reach out to you with their questions \u2014 even about kids. And my family, who attended my Harvard Medical School graduation, I'll remind you, seems to value your opinion more. They seem to be looking for opinions more from men. That's kind of an interesting thing. John: I never really thought about that. I can see how that's totally male privilege. It has to be frustrating to be taken less seriously. Sarah-Anne: I'm in a Facebook group of physicians who are moms. While it's not every doctor-mom in the country, there are over 60,000 of us in it. So many tell stories of being mistaken for nurses \u2014 and taking great offense at that. We have worked so hard to get where we are and want to be treated as equals to our male colleagues. But I see the mix-up as a compliment rather than an insult. To be compared [to] a nurse says that patients are seeing me as someone who is caring for them and nurturing. John: That's a smart way to reframe it. Our colleague Jill used to get angry when people assumed she was a nurse. Instead, she decided to embrace it and use it as a call to service. Now she asks patients if they need an extra blanket or something to drink. And she believes that she provides better, more empathic care. Sarah-Anne: Everyone is going to want to know what is it about women that leads to these better outcomes. I think it's going to be hard to figure out exactly. John: Do you think people that read or hear about this study will take home the message that they need to choose female doctors? Sarah-Anne: Some will no doubt oversimplify it to that. What I take away is that if communication is the key, as I suspect, then we need to better select and train medical students and residents to exhibit these qualities. John: Amen to that. What about equal pay for equal (or better!) outcomes? Paging Lilly Ledbetter ! Sarah-Anne: You're not really asking me that, are you?

Got it Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim speaks at news conference at the Soumaya Museum in Mexico City in March 2011. (Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images) By Philip Rucker , Robert Costa and Joshua Partlow December 19 at 7:29 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @costareports Follow @partlowj In the closing days of his campaign, Donald Trump vilified one of the world\u2019s richest men \u2014 Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim \u2014 as part of a globalist cabal conspiring to extinguish his populist candidacy. Yet over the weekend, Slim journeyed to Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for what the president-elect described as \u201ca lovely dinner with a wonderful man.\u201d The peacemaking gesture \u2014 the culmination of weeks of back-channel negotiations that included a secret visit to Mexico City by a Trump envoy \u2014 signals a possible thawing between Trump and Mexico\u2019s business and political elite, which he had used relentlessly as a foil throughout his campaign. The communications raised hopes in Mexico\u2019s business community that Trump might reconsider his vow to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and be persuaded to adopt less hard-line immigration and economic policies, which were cornerstones of his campaign. Larry Rubin, president of the American Society of Mexico and a key liaison between Republican officials in the United States and Mexican leaders, said Trump and his team are forging a better understanding of shared economic interests between the two countries. (The Washington Post) \u201cWhat President-elect Trump wants to do in coming closer to the Mexican business community has an impact not only nationally but regionally with Latin America and opens the doors for good business relations overall,\u201d said Rubin, who is one of several candidates to serve as Trump\u2019s ambassador to Mexico. \u201cThe closer that the administration is to businesses and governments in Mexico and in the region, the better for the U.S.\u201d But Trump has made no declaration of any shift in his immigration or trade policies, and any softening would carry the risk of angering his core supporters. Saturday, just hours before his dinner with Slim, Trump staged the final rally of his \u201cthank you\u201d tour in Mobile, Ala., and the crowd chanted, \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d \u201cDo not worry. We are going to build the wall,\u201d Trump said, reiterating his promise to erect a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it. Trump and Slim\u2019s dinner was designed to open a friendly line of communication rather than delve into policy details, according to people briefed on the discussions. Slim\u2019s visit to Mar-a-Lago came after Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager who remains a confidant of the president-elect, quietly visited Mexico City on Dec. 9 to meet with Slim. After the election, Slim connected with Lewandowski \u2014 someone he saw as having Trump\u2019s ear but not as a formal member of his staff \u2014 and arranged for them to discuss trade, economic and other issues, according to people with knowledge of the session. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Shefte,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) Slim has long been the dominant figure in Mexico\u2019s business community. He has a net worth estimated at $77\u00a0billion, according to the most recent tally by Forbes magazine. He controls Latin America\u2019s largest telecom company, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, and is also involved in banking, construction, retail, health care, oil and other businesses. Slim also is the largest single investor in the New York Times Co. Trump\u2019s meeting with Slim is the latest example of the president-elect reconciling with former foes \u2014 most prominently, Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who had led the Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s candidacy but became a serious candidate for secretary of state. During the campaign, Slim strongly criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Mexican Americans as well as his plans to renegotiate NAFTA and build the border wall. Slim said that Trump\u2019s proposed tariff on imports would \u201cdestroy\u201d the U.S. economy. Trump in turn accused Slim of helping promote his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and cast him as part of a global conspiracy. At an Oct. 14 rally, Trump attacked Slim personally and accused Times journalists of being \u201ccorporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim.\u201d Trump\u2019s quarrel with Slim extends to the very beginning of his campaign. At his June 2015 announcement speech, Trump\u2019s remarks about undocumented Mexican immigrants being criminals and rapists sparked an intense furor. A television company controlled by Slim canceled a project it had been working on with Trump\u2019s company, and Slim\u2019s spokesman said Trump was \u201cclose-minded\u201d and his comments \u201ctotally out of line.\u201d Trump told friends at the time that he believed Slim \u2014 who once had a business relationship with a rival candidate, former Florida governor Jeb Bush \u2014 helped orchestrate the public backlash. \u201cHe believes Carlos Slim was behind a lot of his problems,\u201d said one Trump friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. This person suggested that Trump sees a benefit to Saturday\u2019s dinner: \u201cHe wants to neutralize him.\u201d After Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, Slim\u2019s tone toward the \u00adpresident-elect changed. In recent comments, Slim has spoken optimistically about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cIf Trump is able to grow the United States economy and jobs, that would be fantastic for Mexico,\u201d Slim told a business forum. Slim\u2019s evolution comes as the Mexican government is undertaking an extensive effort to preserve NAFTA by proving Mexico\u2019s worth to the U.S. economy. Since Trump\u2019s win, Mexican diplomats have sought to spread the message to immigrants, through the network of 50 consulates in the United States, about their rights and legal protections. The Mexican government has enlisted business executives in both countries to talk about the economic benefits of free trade in what one Mexican official described as \u201cthe language that the new president speaks: deals and entrepreneurial vision.\u201d Mexican officials have readied themselves to discuss NAFTA, or any other topic, with the incoming administration. But they have also stressed that they don\u2019t yet know what policies Trump intends to pursue. \u201cThe truth is right now we don\u2019t even have a [negotiating] table,\u201d Paulo Carre\u00f1o, Mexico\u2019s deputy foreign secretary for North American affairs, said in a recent interview. While Trump\u2019s election has presented challenges for Mexico, Carre\u00f1o said, the government remains \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospects for the bi\u00adlateral relationship. Carlos Sada, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said in a speech last week to the Council of the Americas that his country would \u201cwork to find common ground with the next U.S. administration.\u201d Sada added, \u201cBesides my basic efforts to get to know better the character of the U.S. president-elect, we have to seriously recognize the juncture at which we are standing today: We either capitalize it and turn it into opportunity for the sake of a new stage of our integration and shared growth or risk a major setback.\u201d A group of CEOs from both countries met in Mexico City recently for a public policy summit chaired by Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; John Rice, vice chairman of General Electric; Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1\u00f3n, chairman of the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, a Mexican private-sector business council; and Armando Garza, chairman of Alfa, a Mexican-based multinational conglomerate. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and a number of his ministers attended the session, where business leaders discussed the impact of Trump\u2019s election on cross-border trade and other economic matters, according to people familiar with the meeting. Earl Anthony Wayne, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico under President Obama, said there is \u201ca lot of concern and a desire to find a positive way forward.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a million dollars a minute in trade that goes across our border,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cThe CEOs are very interested in preserving what they see as mutually beneficial relations. There\u2019s a lot of attention to what the policies will turn out to be and a desire to have a dialogue with whoever the new officials will be.\u201d In August, Trump made a splashy visit to Mexico City to meet with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, where the then-candidate was unusually subdued and struck a cooperative tone with the Mexican leader. Trump said at a joint news conference that day that he and Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not discuss who would pay for his proposed border wall, despite his campaign-trail vow to compel Mexico to foot the bill. Slim\u2019s mark can be seen all across Mexico City, from the glittering Museo Soumaya, an hourglass-shaped building made of aluminum tiles and named after his late wife, to the Sanborns department stores that dot so many corners. His wealth amounts to a noticeable chunk of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. In a 2013 appearance CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show With David Letterman,\u201d Trump told the host that Slim was a \u201cgood guy\u201d with \u201ca lot of money.\u201d When Letterman detailed the towering nature of Slim\u2019s fortune, however, Trump smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so good when you mention Carlos Slim,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s okay.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "China Expected to Return US Navy Drone 'Soon' By Luis Martinez Dec 19, 2016, 12:22 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH One-China Policy: The Basics 0 Shares Email China is expected to return the U.S. Navy underwater research drone seized last week off the Philippines as soon as Tuesday, U.S. officials say. The handover is expected to occur near Scarborough Shoal, one of the flash points in the South China Sea. The underwater \"Ocean Glider\" drone is expected to be handed over to a U.S. Navy destroyer by the same Chinese Navy ship that seized it last week, according to a U.S. defense official. The official says there are no indications that the drone was ever taken off the Chinese Navy ship, a Dalang III (ASR-510), which took the drone. US Demands Return of Seized Drone by Chinese Navy in South China Sea The ship was apparently headed westward to China when it turned back on Sunday to head east towards Scarborough Shoal. Noting Chinese sensitivities about the incident, a U.S. official would only characterize the timing of the handover as taking place \"soon.\" The defense official said there are two plausible scenarios for how the drone could be returned. One option would be to have two small boats exchange the drone at sea, the other option would have the Chinese vessel place the the drone in the water so it could be recovered by the American destroyer. Over the weekend, the Pentagon announced that \"an understanding\" had been secured with China for the return of the underwater drone. The drone was seized Thursday 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines by the crew of a Chinese naval vessel that had been shadowing the USNS Bowditch, a U.S Navy oceanographic vessel. The crew had been conducting research in the area. The American ship was in the process of recovering one of two unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) known as an \"Ocean Glider.\" The UUV was \"gathering military oceanographic data such as salinity, water temperature and sound speed ... in accordance with international law,\" Cook said Friday. A small boat launched from the Chinese Navy warship and retrieved the other drone from the water and brought it to the Chinese vessel. The American crew contacted the Chinese vessel by radio multiple times, demanding the return of the drone. The demands were ignored, the Pentagon said. The only response the Chinese vessel gave was \"we are returning to normal operations\" as it pulled away from the Bowditch, according to the Pentagon. \"The UUV is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States,\" Cook said Friday. \"We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law.\" The South China Sea has become an international focal point for China, the United States and other countries in the region. China has claimed seven reefs in the Spratly Island chain as its own, essentially dredging them into islands. There are also territorial claims over the Paracel Islands located east of Vietnam and the Scarborough Shoal, 200 miles west of the Philippines. New satellite imagery released publicly by a Washington think-tank last week seems to indicate that China has begun placing \"significant\" military defenses on the artificial islands it has built up in the Spratly Islands. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Tribune news services Contact Reporter A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday evening, killing at least nine people as it tore through tables and wooden stands. Many others were injured. Police said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested nearby and a passenger was dead. The vehicle crashed into the market outside the capital's popular Christmas market at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. AP Television footage showed a large Scania truck with its windshield smashed out on the sidewalk alongside the market, with a swarm of ambulances nearby. A large Christmas tree with a gold star on top was toppled over nearby in the street, and tree branches were crushed under the truck's tires. Police said they were still investigating whether the crash was deliberate. But it came less than a month after a U.S. State Department calling for caution in markets and other public places, saying extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\" Islamic State and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack public places. On July 14, a truck plowed into a Bastille Day crowd in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. Mike Fox, a tourist from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press at the scene in Berlin that the large truck missed him by about three meters as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and wooden stands. \"It was definitely deliberate,\" Fox said. Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas, who said in a tweet \"we are mourning with the relatives\" of the victims. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere gave no indication in a statement whether authorities believe the crash was an attack. ",

Turkish police officers responding to the incident fatally shot the gunman, who was identified by officials as Mevlut Mert Aydintas, aged 22. Turkish officials confirmed earlier reports that Aydintas was himself a police officer, working riot detail in Ankara. The Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov speaks a gallery in Ankara Monday Dec. 19, 2016, moments before he was shot dead by a gunman, who is seen at rear on the left. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici The leaders of Turkey and Russia said Karlo\u2019s killing has been intended to ruin Russia-Turkey ties. Speaking in televised remarks during a meeting with senior officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a \u201cprovocation aimed at derailing Russia-Turkey ties and the peace process in Syria.\u201d\u00a0 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a video message being shown on several Turkish TV channels, said that \u201cthis is a provocation to damage the normalization process of Turkish-Russian relations. But both the Russian and Turkish administrations have the determination not to fall for this provocation.\u201d Both leaders said Russian investigators will be part of the official probe into Karlov\u2019s assassination.\u00a0 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey a \u201cdespicable attack.\u201d\u00a0 Kerry said that the killing was \u201can assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world.\u201d He said that the U.S. is ready to offer help to Russia and Turkey in the investigation of the attack.\u00a0 The ambassador was several minutes into a speech at an embassy-sponsored photo exhibition in the capital, Ankara, when Aydintas, wearing a suit and tie, shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and fired at least eight shots, according to an AP photographer in the audience. The attacker also said some words in Russian and smashed several of the photos hung for the exhibition. A gunman gestures near the body of Russian Amassador Andrey Karlov at a photo gallery in Ankara, Turkey, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo, don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d Aydintas shouted in Turkish, referring to the Syrian city where Russian bombardments have helped drive rebels from areas they had occupied for years during the war. He also shouted \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d the Arabic phrase for \u201cGod is great\u201d and continued in Arabic: \u201cWe are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.\u201d People react after the  the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov,  was shot at a photo gallery in Ankara, Turkey, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici The gunman approached Karlov as he lay on the ground and shot him at least one more time at close range, according to the AP photographer. The attacker also smashed several of the framed photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover. Three other people were wounded in the attack, NTV said. The attack comes a day before a meeting of Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign and defense ministers in Moscow to discuss Syria. Russia and Iran have backed Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the nearly six-year conflict, while Turkey has supported Assad\u2019s foes.\u00a0 Senior Russian lawmakers are describing the killing of Karlov as a provocation aimed to derail a rapprochement between the two nations. Leonid Slutsky, the head of the foreign affairs committee at the lower house of Russian parliament, said that unspecified opponents of Russia \u201care making desperate attempts to spoil ties between Russia and Turkey, but those attempts will fail.\u201d He and other senior lawmakers called for even closer cooperation with Turkey and refrained from advising Russians to avoid visiting Turkey.\u00a0 Karlov was shot \u201cwhen an unidentified assailant opened chaotic gunfire during a public event in Ankara,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. She said Russia was in contact with Turkish officials about the incident.\u00a0 Russia and Turkey recently negotiated a cease-fire in the Syrian civil war between rebels and the Assad regime fighting over the city of Aleppo. The cease-fire has led to the negotiated surrender of rebels that had held the city since nearly the beginning of the five-year-old conflict. If the evacuation from Aleppo is completed later on Monday, it will close an important chapter in Syria\u2019s civil war, which Russia is involved in largely due to its long-standing alliance with the ruling Assad clan, and Turkey is involved in largely due to its long border with the country. Earlier this year, there was\u00a0 a diplomatic crisis between the two nations \u00a0after Turkey shot down a Russian jet Ankara said had violated their airspace during maneuvers over Syria. \u00a0 Turkey has also struggled with a series of deadly terrorist attacks recently , from both Kurdish rebels and groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS .) According to\u00a0 the Ministry of Foriegn Affairs , Karlov began his diplomatic career in 1976, and has previously served in North Korea. He became Russian Ambassador to Turkey in July of 2013. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Gabor began acting in the U.S. in 1952 along with her sisters, Magda and Eva. Getty Images 3. Gabor starred as singer Jane Avril in the 1952 film \"Moulin Rouge.\" The film was nominated for seven Oscars, although Gabor herself was not nominated. It won for best art direction and costume design. Getty Images advertisement 4. Jose Ferrer and Suzanne Flon also starred with Gabor in \"Moulin Rouge,\" which is based on the life of artist Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. To play Toulouse-Lautrec, who was just five feet tall, the five-foot-nine-inch Ferrer performed some scenes walking on his knees. Getty Images 5. Gabor, left, appeared with comedian Judy Canova on \"The Colgate Comedy Hour,\" an NBC comedy series that ran from 1950-1955. Ed Clark / Time & Life Pictures via Getty Images 6. Three generations of Gabors gathered in Vienna's Hotel Sacher to take this 1955 portrait. From left, the top row shows Magda, the sisters' mother Jolie, and Eva. The bottom row features Zsa Zsa, the sister's father Vilmos, and Zsa Zsa's daughter, Francesca. The three Gabor sisters have 20 marriages among them, but Francesca, daughter of Zsa Zsa and hotel baron Conrad Hilton, is the only child of any of them. Getty Images advertisement 7. Gabor, center, had a small role as a strip-club owner in Orson Welles' famed 1958 crime drama, \"Touch of Evil.\" The film's famed opening sequence, three and a half minutes of a continuous shot following a bomb placed into a car, is considered one of the greatest long shots ever filmed. Everett Collection 8. Gabor, center, with Larry Storch at right, played a gypsy grifter on a 1966 episode of \"F Troop.\" Gabor appeared in numerous TV shows, including \"Mr. Ed,\" \"Gilligan's Island,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"Batman\" and \"Facts of Life.\" ABC 9. Zsa Zsa and Eva Gabor were talk-show regulars. Zsa Zsa is seen here appearing on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in 1968. Fred A. Sabine / NBC advertisement 10. Gabor kept her figure and youthful looks for decades. Although her birth date has been debated, she is believed to have been born in 1917, making her 52 in this 1969 photo taken on the set of the game show \"Name Droppers.\" NBC 11. Jim Backus, who played millionaire Thurston Howell III on \"Gilligan's Island,\" shared a scene with Gabor in 1965. She played Erika Tiffany Smith, a fellow millionaire who wants to buy the castaways' island. The Skipper develops a crush on Smith, but she only has eyes for the Professor. Everett Collection 12. Zsa Zsa's youngest sister, Eva, left, had an acting career of her own, starring as the city socialite thrust into country life in \"Green Acres.\" Like her sisters, she wed often. Eva Gabor was married five times. When she passed away in 1995 at age 76, her mother was still living. Jolie Gabor would die at age 100 in 1997, but was never aware her daughter had passed away. David McGough / Time & Life Pictures via Getty Images advertisement 13. Gabor and talk-show host Dick Cavett shared a memorable scene in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.\" A character dreams she is watching Gabor on Cavett's talk show, when suddenly Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund, center) appears and slashes Gabor to death. Everett Collection 14. Later in life, Gabor made the news for a 1989 incident where she slapped a Beverly Hills policeman who stopped her for a traffic violation. She claimed he had sworn at her. She served 72 hours in jail and numerous legends, true or not, have sprung up about her time there. It was claimed she said she had to \"bathe in Evian water\" and that her release from jail was delayed 15 minutes so she could put on her makeup. Kevork Djansezian / AP 15. Gabor went on to parody her famous cop-slapping incident in the movie \"The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear\" and on a 1991 episode of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" starring Will Smith. NBC 16. Gabor also did some stage acting. She's seen here performing in \"Cinderella\" in Los Angeles in 1993, but she also acted in \"Forty Carats\" on Broadway and traveled with the national tour of perennial Broadway favorite \"Blithe Spirit.\" Chris Martinez / AP 17. Gabor has been married nine times, wedding Frederick Von Anholt in 1986. Her third husband, George Sanders, later married her older sister Magda, but just for six weeks. A famous story claims that Gabor was once asked how many husbands she'd had, to which she is said to have replied, \"You mean, besides my own?\" Time & Life Pictures via Getty Images 18. Gabor had hip replacement surgery in 2010, at age 93, but her recovery was slow and an infection developed. Istvan Bajzat / EPA ",

    "text": "Electoral College Members Meeting Across the Country to Cast Votes By Meghan Keneally Dec 19, 2016, 12:56 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Presidential Electors to Cast Their Votes 0 Shares Email The 538 electors are meeting today to cast their votes in the last step of the presidential election . But what is usually a formality has taken on new significance this year with Donald Trump 's election and calls for electors to defect. In order to win the election, candidates need to reach 270 Electoral College votes. Trump reached that mark, garnering 306 electoral votes on Nov. 8 compared to Hillary Clinton \u2019s 232 votes, although he trails her in the popular vote. Electoral College: What to Know About Monday's Vote Over the past six weeks, left-leaning groups have called for electors to break rules that require them to vote in a way reflective of their states\u2019 popular votes, a move that would make them \u201cfaithless electors.\ufffd? Electors are not bound by the Constitution or federal law to vote according to the popular vote of their state. Thirty states have laws that require electors to do, but those laws have not been scrutinized, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Activist Michael Moore has offered to pay the fines of those who choose to break with their states' vote. One of the biggest concerns among some electors is the role of Russian hackers ahead of the election, and the potential impact that the revelations from the stolen emails had. All but one of the 80 electors who have called for classified briefings on Russia\u2019s suspected hacking are already pledged to Clinton. The gap between the results of the popular vote and the Electoral College tally has also left some electors unhappy, with Clinton garnering some 2.8 million votes more than Trump. Only one elector who is pledged to Trump -\u2013 Chris Suprun from Texas -\u2013 has said that he won\u2019t be voting for Trump today. And one elector from Maine said he plans to vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Clinton. One elector will likely be voting for Clinton is her husband, former President Bill Clinton , will be casting his vote in New York. Clinton won the state by a large margin. The Electoral College vote won\u2019t be formalized until Jan. 6, when Congress counts the ballots. Additional reporting by Shushannah Walshe, MaryAlice Parks and Lauren Pearle. 0 Shares ",

Police are calling it a deliberate attack. USA TODAY NETWORK Police stand near a black lorry that ploughed through a Christmas market on Dec. 19, 2016 in Berlin. (Photo: Sean Gallup, Getty Images) BERLIN\u00a0\u2014 A large black truck slammed into a Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12\u00a0people and injuring 48 others in what police said was a deliberate attack. The carnage happened during an outdoor market near Berlin's Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. A suspect, believed to be the driver, was arrested about a mile away from the scene. A rider in the truck - which bore a Polish license plate - was found mortally wounded in the passenger seat, according to the Associated Press and German media. The passenger, who police described as a Polish national, died as paramedics treated him. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawki said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. The scene was laced with chaos. Dozens of ambulances lined up in front of the church as desperate people looked for friends and relatives among the injured. At least one woman could be seen getting treatment in the back of an ambulance. A large Christmas tree with a gold star on top was toppled over nearby in the street. The attack shattered the pre-Christmas calm in Germany, a time when thousands of locals and tourists spend their early evenings at markets, drinking mulled wine, and eating sausages and pastries. The\u00a0markets were due to finish on Friday. Witnesses told numerous news outlets, including Fox News and the Daily Telegraph, that the truck drove at least 80 feet into the heavily crowded area and did not appear to slow down. Fox reported that the truck carried several tons of steel. It remains too early to determine whether the incident is an act of terror. But U.S. officials suggested that is the most likely explanation. \"The United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas Market in Berlin, Germany, which has killed and wounded dozens,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. \"We send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded . . . We have been in touch with German officials, and we stand ready to provide assistance as they recover from and investigate this horrific incident.\" Donald Trump said the incident smacks of an assault motivated by anti-Christmas sentiment. \"Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,\" Trump said. \"ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.\"\u200b Burkard Dregger was at a Christmas party when he heard news of the incident and rushed to the scene. \"It is a terrible thing but we need to keep cool heads and work out what has happened before we draw any conclusions,\" he said. Dregger is head of security for parliamentarians attached to Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling CDU party. He was briefed by investigators but they had not yet come to any conclusions and were keeping an open mind about the attacker and motive. \"Happiness and freedom in Germany has been destroyed tonight,\" Dregger said. In this screen grab taken from video, emergency workers attend to the  scene after an attack by a truck at a Christmas market in Berlin on Dec. 19, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: AP) Some survivors took to social media to describe the horror and panic. \"People crushed. I am safe. I am safe,\" tweeted an apparent witness, Emma Rushton. Video footage from the scene shows stalls knocked over and people lying injured on the ground. Truck attacks in Europe have been on government radar screens as possible ways that terrorists might try and carry out simple and cost-effective assaults.\u00a0In July, 86\u00a0people were killed in Nice, France, when a truck slammed\u00a0into a large crowd during Bastille Day celebrations. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. The U.S. State Department issued a warning last month that Americans in Europe should be vigilant to the threat of terrorist attacks during the holiday season. The alert specifically mentioned Christmas markets. After the Berlin incident, the Chicago Police Department said there was no known threat to the Chicagoland area.\u00a0Still, the police department said in a statement it was adding foot and bike patrols as well as other specialized units to provide security to Daley Plaza, where the annual German-style Christmas market is being held.

Police secure the area in front of an Islamic center in Zurich on Monday. (Ennio Leanza / Associated Press) Associated Press Several people were wounded in a shooting at a mosque frequented largely by Somali immigrants in Switzerland's largest city, and the suspect remains at large, Zurich police said Monday. Police and ambulances swarmed to the scene near the city's rail station, blocked off a nearby road, and secured the Islamic Center. On Twitter, the Zurich police department said: \"Large operation after shooting at mosque in the Eisgasse. Several injured. Perpetrator on the run.\" It said the situation was under control and the wounded had been taken to hospital. There were conflicting news reports about whether the shooting had taken place inside a prayer room or outside. Police told German-language daily Blick that three people had been injured. Attacks by gunmen are rare in Switzerland. The country was shaken in 2013 by at least two multiple-fatality shootings. The country has a long tradition for men to keep their rifles after completing compulsory military service \u2014 which partly explains a high rate of gun ownership in the country of about 8.2 million people.

(Chicago Tribune) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Donald Trump started racking up electoral votes Monday even as anti-Trump protesters across the country tried to persuade the Electoral College to prevent him from winning the White House. Trump didn't lose any electors with votes counted in a half dozen states he won Nov. 8: Tennessee, West Virginia, Arkansas, South Carolina, Mississippi and Oklahoma. Initial results gave Trump 44 votes and Democrat Hillary Clinton, 10. It takes 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency. Electors were voting throughout the day and there was scant evidence many GOP electors would peel away from their Election Day winner. More than three dozen would have to abandon him to complicate his path to the presidency. More than 200 demonstrators braved freezing temperatures at Pennsylvania's capitol, chanting, \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" and \"No treason, no Trump!\" Protesters also gathered in Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and other states. The protesters, however, were unlikely to persuade the Electoral College to dump Trump. An Associated Press survey of electors found very little appetite to vote for alternative candidates. Only one Republican said he would vote for someone else. Republican electors have been deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many of the emails are part of coordinated campaigns. \"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They are generally freaked out. They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\" Electoral college meets amid push to stop Trump Protests are planned for state capitals, but they are unlikely to persuade the electoral college to dump Trump. Protests are planned for state capitals, but they are unlikely to persuade the electoral college to dump Trump. See more videos Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\" A joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results of the Electoral College vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner \u2014 almost certainly Trump \u2014 will be sworn in on Jan. 20. The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. The AP tried to reach all of the electors and interviewed more than 330 of them, finding widespread aggravation among Democrats with the electoral process, but little expectation Trump would be derailed.

Sara D. Davis/Getty Images North Carolina's Legislature is poised to repeal the controversial \"bathroom bill,\" after the Charlotte City Council unanimously voted to repeal its local anti-discrimination measure. The state law, called House Bill 2 or HB2, was passed in March as a direct response to that Charlotte measure \u2014 over the course of 12 hours, in the state's first special legislative session in 35 years. North Carolina Governor Drops 'Bathroom Bill' Lawsuit Against U.S. Now the law might be rolled back in another special session, again following a decision by the Charlotte City Council. Among other things, HB2 blocked local jurisdictions from passing anti-discrimination laws affecting to anyone not protected at the state level, including gay and transgender people. It also required trans people in government facilities to use the bathroom corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate. North Carolina Passes Law Blocking Measures To Protect LGBT People The Charlotte measure that HB2 blocked would have expanded the city's anti-discrimination measure to protect LGBT people from biased treatment by businesses. It would also have allowed trans people to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. Since HB2 was passed, leaders in Charlotte had considered a deal with state lawmakers under which they'd repeal their measure and then the state would repeal HB2 \u2014 but rejected the proposal, member station WFAE reports . Then, on Monday morning, they had a surprise session \u2014 not announced to the media \u2014 and changed course. \"This morning, the City Council repealed that ordinance, but made it contingent upon the Legislature repealing HB2 by Dec. 31,\" Will Michaels of member station WUNC reports for NPR.

    "text": "advertisement As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn in as the country's commander-in-chief next month, a majority of Americans say they are either uncertain or pessimistic about his presidency, even as the country is sounding a more optimistic tone about the future of the economy and Trump's ability to bring positive change to Washington D.C. A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds 54 percent of adults saying that they are either uncertain (25 percent) or pessimistic and worried (29 percent) about how Trump will perform during his presidency, compared with 45 percent with either an optimistic and confident view (22 percent) or a satisfied and hopeful view (23 percent). That's a significantly worse outlook than Americans expressed after the elections of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. A combined 66 percent were either optimistic or hopeful about Obama in January 2009, according to the same poll, while 59 percent were optimistic or hopeful about George W. Bush in January 2001. The data show the extent to which the nation remains unusually divided even though Election Day is in the rearview mirror, said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies. \"Usually elections settle arguments and the nation comes together, at least in the short term,\" Yang said. \"Today, hard feelings persist on both sides of the partisan divide. It's as if the 2016 campaign has never ended.\" Those partisan differences are particularly stark when it comes to public approval ratings of the way Trump is handling his transition. Half of the country overall gives Trump high marks so far, compared to 41 percent who give him a thumbs down. But among Hillary Clinton's voters, only 12 percent approve of how he's handling the transition, compared to 92 percent of Trump voters. Back in 2008, 50 percent of John McCain's voters approved of Barack Obama's handling of his presidential transition, and in 1992, 63 percent of George H.W. Bush's voters backed Bill Clinton's early moves as president-elect. The partisan divide extends to views about the men and women Trump has selected to lead his administration. Seventy-eight percent of Democrats say they are disappointed with the administration appointments Trump has made so far, while 80 percent of Republicans say they are generally pleased with Trump's picks. While Trump's overall favorability has ticked up modestly since before the election, he remains underwater, with more Americans giving him a poor rating (46 percent) than a positive one (40 percent.) That marks the first time that an incoming president has been viewed more negatively than positively in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Some bright spots -- but ones mostly driven by enthusiasm from Trump's supporters While the public is largely apprehensive about the president-elect, Americans do say that they are more optimistic that the U.S. economy will improve in the next year. Forty-two percent say they believe the economy will get better - the highest share since autumn of 2012 -- while only 19 percent say the economy will get worse in the next year. Trump has also generated relatively positive feelings about his ability to change the federal government for the better. A majority of Americans say Trump will shake up the way government operates - and, among that group, they believe that he'll bring the right kind of change by a two-to-one margin (41 percent to 20 percent). Additionally, a majority - fifty-six percent - say they are optimistic that Trump will keep U.S. jobs from going overseas. Still, the confidence about Trump's presidency is mostly fueled by enthusiasm among his base voters rather than by more hopeful expectations among those who didn't choose him on their ballot in November. A whopping 92 percent of Trump voters are optimistic about his ability to bring change to Washington, while just 20 percent of Clinton voters say the same. The same share of Trump voters - 92 percent - say they are hopeful that Trump will look out for those who are struggling in today's economy, while only nine percent of Clinton voters agree. Those who say that the economy will get better in the next year rather than worse include key Trump constituency groups like whites (49 percent better compared to 15 percent worse), Republicans (68 percent better to six percent worse), and men (46 percent better to 15 percent worse.) Among Democrats, 33 percent believe the economy will get worse compared to 19 percent who believe it will improve, and just 22 percent of African Americans think the economy will improve compared to a third who say it will deteriorate. The public also still harbors concerns about Trump's temperament. Just 36 percent of Americans say they are optimistic that Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 44 percent say they are worried about the issue. The Republican Party gets a boost - but will it last? In the wake of the 2016 election, the Republican Party now has a higher net favorability rating (35 percent positive, 38 percent negative) than the Democratic Party (34 percent positive, 42 percent negative). That's the first time since after the 2010 midterms that Republicans have scored better on the favorability measure than their Democratic counterparts. But it's not clear that Americans' warmer feelings toward the GOP will endure. After its previous high watermark six years ago, the party's positive ratings quickly fell back to earth, with Democrats regaining the advantage the following month. Carrie Dann ",

And not just a song or two -- she composed an entire opera. Alma Deutscher CBS News Alma said it is wonderful to see her opera coming to life. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can even imagine how exciting it is because, you know, I\u2019ve seen it all in my imagination, how it would sound like and how it would look like, and now finally it\u2019s actually coming true,\u201d she said. CBS News got a peek of her new opera, which is currently in rehearsal and will run in a Vienna theater later this month. Alma grew up outside of London and sang before she could speak. She said she does her best work when she\u2019s most relaxed, often while playing with her skipping rope. \u201cWhen I wave it around like this and I tell stories in my mind, then a melody sometimes just springs into my head,\u201d she said. That\u2019s how she came up with her version of \u201cCinderella.\u201d \u201cI thought it was a little silly that Cinderella was found by a shoe. Why a shoe?\u201d Alma said. \u201cIn my story, the prince finds her with a melody.\u201d Alma at rehearsal with cast members of her opera \u201cCinderella\u201d CBS News Alma is still getting used to the fairy tale turn in her own life. \u201cI think that if someone told me many years ago that my opera would be performed in Vienna, you know, the capital of music, then I would\u2019ve laughed! I would\u2019ve thought it was a joke!\u201d she said. She devours 100 books a year and doesn\u2019t have a TV, computer, or smartphone. She doesn\u2019t have the time. \u201cAfter this I want to write my piano concerto, and I\u2019m also writing a book now which I want to publish and I want to make into a film, and then I want to write the music for it,\u201d Alma said. She\u2019s excited too about opening in Vienna, but she\u2019s already dreaming of another venue: New York. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "OPEN Interactive Feature The United Nations says it has about 100 staff members in Aleppo, mostly Syrian citizens, and several hundred others in nearby Syrian cities. Officials with the organization have said they were denied permission to observe evacuations. As many as 50,000 civilians may still be stuck in the area, according to humanitarian groups, although a precise figure is all but impossible to determine. \u201cAfter so many delaying tactics and obstruction, this resolution should finally allow the full respect of international humanitarian law in Syria,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said in a statement. \u201cIt should also pave the way for a cease-fire and negotiate a political solution that is much awaited by the Syrian people and the entire international community.\u201d The extent to which the Syrian government will cooperate with the monitoring is unclear, though Russia is a principal military backer of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. After days of delays and sporadic violence , the evacuation of civilians and fighters from besieged communities in Syria resumed Sunday night, with convoys taking people out of eastern Aleppo and two nearby Shiite villages. As of Monday afternoon, 20,000 people had been removed from the last rebel-held part of Aleppo, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said in a post on Twitter . Among those evacuated to a rebel-held area west of the city was Bana al-Abed, a 7-year-old girl whose Twitter posts with her mother throughout the siege by government forces helped draw attention to the plight of civilians. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Opposition activists posted videos and photographs of the girl and her mother on Monday after they arrived in rebel-held territory. The evacuation of more than 2,000 sick and wounded people from two Shiite villages that have been surrounded by Sunni insurgents for years also began Monday. The villages, Fouaa and Kfarya, were not originally part of the agreement but were added after pro-government gunmen prevented buses from removing people from eastern Aleppo last week. Ten buses carrying civilians from the villages left on Monday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, and local journalists posted online videos of their arrival in another government-held area. Video Security Council Votes to Send Monitors to Syria The United Nations Security Council, with the backing of Russia, voted unanimously on Monday to have observers oversee operations bringing civilians out of Aleppo, Syria. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Also added to the agreement was the evacuation of two rebel-held villages near the border with Lebanon, Zabadani and Madaya, that have long been surrounded by government forces. The evacuation deal, brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran, was intended to relieve one of the more crushing aspects of Syria\u2019s war: the practice by both sides of besieging their opponents and bombarding their communities. The agreement, and an accompanying cease-fire, has proceeded haltingly since it began on Wednesday, with gunfire on the route repeatedly stopping convoys. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the Syrian government, said five buses that had been held up by pro-government forces for hours were allowed to leave eastern Aleppo before midnight on Sunday. The eastern part of Aleppo, the remaining rebel-held area of the city, has been surrounded by government forces for months and subjected to frequent airstrikes that have killed hundreds of people and have reduced neighborhoods to rubble. If the evacuations continue without interruption, the removal of the remaining residents of eastern Aleppo will put the entire city under Mr. Assad\u2019s control and mark a turning point in the war . Aleppo was once the largest city in Syria and was its industrial hub before the war. Its fall would leave rebels in control of only smaller towns and rural areas. Advertisement The jihadists of the Islamic State, who oppose both the government and the rebels, still hold significant territory farther east, including the city of Raqqa, their de facto capital.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook President Obama answers questions during a news conference in the Brady Press Breifing Room at the White House Friday. (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama granted 78 pardons and 153 commutations on Monday \u2014 a single-day record for the use of presidential clemency power as Obama engages in an historic end-of-term clemency surge. With just 32 days left in office, Obama more than doubled the number of pardons he\u00a0granted in the previous seven years. And he continued his vigorous use of a lesser form of his clemency power, having now commuted the sentences of 1,176 federal prison inmates \u2014 mostly for long, mandatory-minimum drug sentences imposed during a war on drugs waged over the past three decades. But time is running out for Obama to address the backlog of clemency cases at\u00a0 the Office of the Pardon Attorney . As of Nov. 30, there were\u00a01,937 pardon petitions\u00a0and\u00a013,042 applications for a commutation of sentence still pending. \u201cWe need the president to pick up the pace of commutations before he leaves office,\" said Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance. \u201cHe is to be applauded for his actions thus far, but we know that the next occupant of the White House is unsympathetic to the cause of mass incarceration, and to the plight of those serving unjust sentences in federal prison.\u201d Obama began his clemency initiative in 2014 as a way to shorten the sentences of drug offenders given what he considered to be unduly harsh sentences. That effort has felt a new urgency since the election of Donald Trump, who has named as his attorney general one of the biggest critics of Obama's use of commutations. \"The president is playing a dangerous game to advance his political ideology,\" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said after Obama granted\u00a0 a single-day record 214 commutations \u00a0in August. Overall, including both full pardons and commutations, Obama has now granted more acts of clemency since President Harry Truman. With more than half of Obama's clemency actions taking place in his last year in office, pardon expert P.S. Ruckman Jr. called it \"the greatest last-minute surge in history\"\u00a0\u2014 even exceeding President Bill Clinton's use of pardons in the last months of his presidency. But unlike Clinton, who used his pardon power to help relatives and political allies, Obama's\u00a0pardons on Monday\u00a0did not include any of the more politically charged cases that activists have been urging him to grand his presidential mercy to. (Former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden\u00a0 have not applied for clemency , and Obama says all pardons must go through the application process.) Instead, the list of Obama's newest pardons reflects a variety of federal crimes including drug dealing, bid rigging, illegal gambling, possession of untaxed alcohol and the illegal importation of tortoises. Yes, tortoises.\u00a0Ralph Hoekstra of Huntington Beach, Calif., was sentenced to a year of probation and a $5,000 fine in 2005 after pleading guilty to buying dwarf Indian star tortoises off of a reptile enthusiast website. Obama's actions followed a pattern of pre-holiday clemency that critics have called \" part of a broken process .\" While Obama has begun to shorten prison sentences through commutations more regularly, his full pardons have largely been a once-a-year phenomenon. Aside from four Iranian-Americans\u00a0pardoned as part of a hostage swap that accompanied the Iran nuclear deal, his last four rounds of pardons have come the week before Christmas. With 148 total pardons, that means Obama still has a way to go in order to meet his promise to that the number of pardons will be \"roughly in line with what other presidents have done.\"\u00a0President George W. Bush pardoned 189 people, and Clinton pardoned 396. Among modern presidents, only one-term President George H.W. Bush pardoned fewer. In a blog post, White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said he expects Obama to grant more pardons and commutations before leaving office. But he\u00a0also stressed that the use of clemency was a stopgap solution to a systemic problem. \"The mercy that the president has shown his 1,324 clemency recipients is remarkable, but we must remember that clemency is a tool of last resort and that only Congress can achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure over the long run that our criminal justice system operates more fairly and effectively in the service of public safety,\" Eggleston wrote.

Under the law, transgender people may not use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity unless they get the sex on their birth certificate changed. Cooper's announcement today came after the Charlotte City Council met this morning and voted 10-0 to rescind its local LGBT ordinance that led to HB2, The Charlotte Observer reported . \"Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore assured me that as a result of Charlotte's vote, a special session will be called for Tuesday to repeal HB2 in full,\" Cooper said in a statement today. \"I hope they will keep their word to me and with the help of Democrats in the legislature, HB2 will be repealed in full. Full repeal will help to bring jobs, sports and entertainment events back and will provide the opportunity for strong LGBT protections in our state.\" Today's move by the Charlotte City Council is dependent on state legislators fully repealing HB2 by Dec. 31, according to The Associated Press.

Tribune news services Contact Reporter An Ankara police officer dressed in a suit and tie shouted slogans about Syria's civil war after he killed Russia's ambassador to Turkey\u00a0 in front of stunned onlookers at a photo exhibition in the Turkish capital on Monday, according to officials and an Associated Press photographer who witnessed the shooting. Police later killed the assailant. Ambassador Andrei Karlov, 62, was several minutes into a speech at the embassy-sponsored exhibition in Ankara when a man identified by\u00a0Turkey's interior minister as Mevlut Mert Altintas fired at least eight shots, according to the AP photographer in the audience. \"Don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria!\" the gunman shouted in Turkish, referring to the Syrian city where Russian bombardments have helped drive rebels from areas they had occupied for years during the war. He also shouted \"Allahu akbar,\" the Arabic phrase for \"God is great\" and continued in Arabic: \"We are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.\" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Altintas, who was born in 1994, had been an officer with Ankara's riot police squad for more than two years. Soylu did not give a motive for the attack. The gunman approached Karlov as he lay on the ground and shot him at least one more time at close range, according to the AP photographer. The attacker also smashed several of the framed photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover. Three other people were wounded in the attack,\u00a0Turkey's NTV television said. After shooting the ambassador, the gunman climbed to the second floor of the same building and a 15-minute shootout with police ensued before he was killed,\u00a0Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. Andrei Karlov shot and killed Karlov started his diplomatic career in 1976, after graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. (Dec. 19, 2016) Karlov started his diplomatic career in 1976, after graduating from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. (Dec. 19, 2016) See more videos The attack comes a day before a meeting of Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign and defense ministers in Moscow to discuss Syria. Russia and Iran have backed Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the nearly six-year conflict, while\u00a0Turkey has supported Assad's foes. \"It's a tragic day in the history of our country and Russian diplomacy,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in televised comments. \"Ambassador Karlov has made a lot of personal contributions to the development of ties with Turkey. He has done a lot to overcome a crisis in bilateral relations,\" she said. \"He was a man who put his heart and his soul into his job. It's a terrible loss for us and also the world.\" Karlov joined the diplomatic service in 1976. He served as Russia's ambassador to Pyongyang in 2001-2006, and later worked as the chief of the Foreign Ministry's consular department. He had served as the ambassador to\u00a0Turkey since 2013. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said U.S. officials were aware of reports about the shooting. \"We condemn this act of violence, whatever its source,\" Kirby said. The United Nations also condemned the attack. \"There can be no justification for an attack on an ambassador ... and we very much hope that the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Melih Gokcek, the mayor for Ankara, told reporters outside the exhibition center that the \"heinous\" attack aimed to disrupt newly-re-established relations between\u00a0Turkey and Russia. Relations between Russia and\u00a0Turkey were badly strained by the downing of a Russian warplanes at the Syrian border in November 2015, but Turkey's apology earlier this year helped overcome the rift. The leaders of the two countries, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have held several meetings in recent months and spoken frequently over the phone. Russia and\u00a0Turkey have co-sponsored the evacuation of civilians and rebels from Aleppo and also discussed the prospect of organizing a new round of peace talks in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana. Turkey\u00a0has struggled with multiple security threats in recent years, including Kurdish militants who claimed responsibility for a Dec. 10 bombing in Istanbul that killed 44 people, many of them police. The Islamic State group fighting in Syria and Iraq has also been blamed for attacks in Turkey, a NATO member and a partner in the U.S.-led campaign against the group. Additionally, Turkish security forces and courts remain preoccupied with purging state institutions of the supporters of an exiled Islamist cleric whom the government accuses of staging a failed coup attempt in July.

    "text": "Twitter Donald J. Trump will be the next president of the United States. That's been the case since Nov. 8, when Trump won 306 electoral votes, despite losing the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million. And on Monday, the result was ratified by Electoral College voters, who gathered in state capitols across the United States to formally vote for president. 5 Things You Should Know About The Electoral College Trump secured 304 electoral votes \u2014 two fewer than he earned in November, according to the Associated Press, which tracked results from capitol to capitol. That was despite a pitched effort by some on the left who wrote letters to Trump electors trying to persuade them to switch their votes or not vote at all and keep Trump short of the 270 needed. Not only did it not happen, but more electors tried to defect from Hillary Clinton Monday than from Trump, by a count of seven to two, as of Monday afternoon. Three Democratic electors in Maine, Minnesota, and Colorado tried to vote for candidates other than Clinton. The electors' votes, however, were disallowed because of state rules binding them to the statewide popular vote winner. Four more electors in Washington state defected from Clinton. Three voted for Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American who gained some notoriety for her protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Breaking 4 \"faithless electors\" break ranks in Washington state electoral college vote. 3 vote for Colin Powell, one for Faith Spotted Eagle \u2014 Ed Pilkington (@Edpilkington) December 19, 2016 Some of the Democratic electors tried to vote for Sanders. Others, including the Powell voters in Washington, were attempting to promote alternate Republican candidates that the House of Representatives could theoretically elect as president instead of Trump. The Electoral College gathering is usually a formality \u2014 a chance for political activists to gather amid pomp and circumstance to formalize their party's victory in each state. Article continues after sponsorship MAILBAG: Could 'Faithless Electors' Keep Donald Trump Out Of The White House? But the fact Clinton won the national popular vote by such a large margin, combined with the unconventional and unpredictable \u2014 and to many, threatening \u2014 way that Trump carried himself before and after winning the White House, led to an unprecedented effort to lobby electors to vote for someone else. Electors found themselves inundated by letters, petitions, tweets and Facebook posts, urging them to cast a ballot for an alternative candidate. Many people behind the lobbying campaign cited a Federalist Paper written by Alexander Hamilton, which frames the Electoral College as a safeguard against \"foreign powers\" that try to \"gain an improper ascendant in our councils\" \u2014 a potentially relevant line, in the midst of revelations that Russia attempted to disrupt this year's election by hacking and releasing Democratic emails. Hollywood celebrities even got in on the act, recording video pleas to electors. But, unsurprisingly, that effort had no effect on Trump electors. Just in: Maine elector David Bright voting for @BernieSanders today. #mepolitics pic.twitter.com/AMPUkNog3e \u2014 Michael Shepherd (@mikeshepherdME) December 19, 2016 \"They don't understand us,\" said Pennsylvania elector Ash Khare. \"I received over 70,000 emails. I received over 5,000 letters. I received over 500 phone calls at all times of day and night.\" But Khare, like most electors, is a longtime Republican political activist who was proud to cast a ballot for Trump. MN elector Muhammad Abdurrahman is deemed a \"faithless\" elector. Is dismissed and replaced. \u2014 Brian Bakst (@Stowydad) December 19, 2016 \"I've been an elector since 1996,\" Khare told Harrisburg public radio station WITF. \"But I've never been asked to do anything because we never won since 1988.\" Maine elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would cast a ballot for Sanders. But Bright ultimately changed his vote to Clinton, after his initial ballot was ruled out of order. A Minnesota elector, Muhammad Abdurrahman, tried to vote Sanders, according to Minnesota Public Radio reporter Brian Bakst. He was replaced by another elector who cast a ballot for Clinton. Two Texas electors defected from Trump \u2014 one went for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the other for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul. The Kasich defector, Chris Suprun, told The Hill beforehand his plans. Another Texas elector, Art Cisneros, resigned instead of voting for Trump. He spoke to NPR earlier this month. Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Mark Makela/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Anti-Donald Trump protesters rally outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building before electors arrive to cast their votes on Monday in Harrisburg. Mark Makela/Getty Images Many Republican electors dismissed the pleas to \"vote their conscience,\" pointing out that their consciences were perfectly fine with Trump. With protesters heckling from the gallery of Pennsylvania's House chamber, Pennsylvania elector Robert Gleason seemed to pointedly respond to their efforts. \"My fellow electors,\" Gleason said, \"let us always remember this shared moment when we stood up for our constitutional system, followed our conscience, answered the call of Pennsylvania voters, and did our part by electing the next president and vice president of the United States, Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\" On Monday night, Trump issued a statement saying, \"today marks a historic electoral landslide victory in our nation's democracy.\" In fact, in nearly 80 percent of previous presidential elections, the winning candidate earned a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump. There are two more steps in the process. States will submit a \"certificate of vote\" to the Federal Register by Dec. 28. Then, on Jan. 6, Congress will formally tally the Electoral College's votes in a joint session and make it official. ",

The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound. A gunman opened fire on Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey at a photo exhibition on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound. Umar Farooq and Laura King An off-duty Turkish police officer who shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Syria and Aleppo!\u201d shot and killed Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey on Monday as he delivered a speech in the capital, Ankara\u2014a bloody episode that was captured on video and posted on social media. \u00a0 The assailant, identified by Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu as a 22-year-old riot policeman, was himself gunned down by security forces. The ambassador, who was shot multiple times, was pronounced dead at the hospital a short time after the shooting, officials said. \u00a0 The attack appeared to represent the latest violent spillover of the Syrian conflict into neighboring Turkey. Suicide bombings linked to the fighting in Syria have become almost commonplace in Turkey, often causing mass casualties, but this was the first deadly attack on a senior diplomat that was seemingly motivated by the brutal and multi-sided war next door. Russia and Turkey, which have both intervened militarily in Syria, are on opposite sides of the conflict. Russian firepower has helped Syrian President Bashar Assad cling to power and recapture opposition-held east Aleppo; Turkey has allied itself with some of the rebels seeking to topple him. The video of the attack, which took place at a photo exhibition sponsored by the Russian embassy, shows the envoy \u2013 veteran diplomat Andrei Karlov, 62\u2014collapsing minutes into his speech after apparently being shot from behind. The gunman moves into the frame, clad in a black suit and tie and holding a handgun, and can be heard shouting in Turkish as onlookers flee in panic. At least three bystanders were reported injured. \u201cWe die in Aleppo, you die here!\u201d the shooter yells out before firing several shots into the air. \u201cYou will not taste security until our towns are secure! Do not forget about Syria and Aleppo!\u00a0 Whoever is part of it will get their punishment!\u201d\u00a0 Supporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were quick to draw a connection to July\u2019s attempted coup against Erdogan, which was followed by a purge of tens of thousands of suspected political opponents. The mayor of Ankara, Ibrahim Melih Gokcek, who is from Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, claimed the shooter was a follower of Fethullah Gulen, an elderly cleric living in self-exile in the United States and blamed by Turkey for masterminding the coup attempt. Relations between Turkey and Russia nosedived in November 2015 after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet along the Syrian border. Erdogan earlier this year had a fence-mending session with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and the two countries have agreed to revive a natural-gas pipeline project that had been suspended, among other cooperative steps. The assassination came on the heels of near-daily protests outside the Russian embassy in Ankara as well as the consulate in Istanbul.\u00a0 Thousands of Turks and Syrians have been holding rallies at the Russian diplomatic outposts, along with the Iranian consulate and embassy, over the two governments\u2019 war roles in support of Assad. They have escalated amid reports of heavy civilian casualties in Aleppo during the re-capture of the city\u2019s eastern sector from the rebels. Scores of Turkish police were deployed at a protest last week at the Russian consulate on Istanbul\u2019s main central avenue that drew thousands. Protesters chanted \u201cPutin, murderer! Russia, murderer!\u00a0 You will get your punishment!\u201d Adding to the tension, there were reports of gunshots fired near the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, and the State Department warned Americans to avoid the area. The State Department, which has been harshly critical of Russia\u2019s role in the Syrian war, expressed dismay over the attack. \u201cWe condemn this act of violence, whatever its source,\u201d said spokesman John Kirby. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.\u201d Russia called the killing a terrorist act and said it would bring up the episode with the United Nations Security Council. \"There is no place for terrorism, and we will be resolutely fighting against it,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the semi-official TASS news agency.

The president-elect easily racked up the 270 electoral votes needed to send him to the White House.

Many of the Republicans casting ballots said they were inundated with calls and emails urging them to dump Trump. And some electors did break with how their state voted, albeit in unexpected ways. In Washington, a state Clinton won by 16 points, the former secretary of state received just eight of the state's 12 electoral votes. Colin Powell received three votes and Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle received one as part of an effort to promote a candidate other than Trump. An elector in both Maine and Minnesota attempted to cast a ballot for Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary. However state laws requiring electors to follow the statewide vote invalidated both efforts. Only one Republican elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, publically pledged not to vote for Trump despite his state heavily favoring the president-elect last month. One other Texas elector also abandoned Trump in the final vote. Play ",

    "text": "Obama announces record wave of pardons, commutations Published               December 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President Obama on Monday pardoned 78 people and granted another 153 commutations, amounting to the most acts of clemency granted by a U.S. president ever in a single day. White House Counsel Neil Eggleston announced the decisions in an official blog post. He described all the individuals being pardoned or seeing their sentences shortened as \u201cdeserving.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThe 231 individuals granted clemency today have all demonstrated that they are ready to make use \u2013 or have already made use \u2013 of a second chance,\u201d he wrote. He also previewed additional clemency decisions in the weeks ahead, saying: \u201cI expect that the President will issue more grants of both commutations and pardons before he leaves office.\u201d The decisions could fuel criticism from the right, following a presidential campaign in which winner Donald Trump hammered a law-and-order message and suggested authorities were too soft on crime. But Obama has been granting commutations at rapid-fire pace in his final months in office, focusing primarily on shortening sentences of those convicted of drug offenses rather than pardons. Pardons amount to forgiveness of a crime that removes restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury. The pardon also lessens the stigma arising from the conviction. Eggleston said Obama has now pardoned a total of 148 people during his presidency and has shortened the sentences of 1,176 people, including 395 serving life sentences. Eggleston said each clemency recipient's story is unique, but a common thread of rehabilitation underlies all of them. Pardon recipients have shown they have led a productive and law-abiding post-conviction life, including by contributing to the community in a meaningful way, he said. The commutations were announced as Obama vacations in Hawaii during the holidays.\u00a0 Many of those on Obama\u2019s list Monday had been sentenced on drug-related convictions. Groups that have urged the president to use his clemency powers cheered the decision, urging him to go further in the waning days of his administration. \u00a0 \u201cAs the clock counts down on the Obama administration, the need for commutations of these non-violent drug offenders -- and many more like them -- is more important than ever,\u201d Jessica Jackson Sloan, national director of #cut50, said in a statement.\u00a0 The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement Trending in Politics 1 ",

Relations between Russia and Turkish government have also been tense in recent years over the ongoing bloodshed in Syria. Last year, Moscow cut ties after the Turks shot down a Russian jet on the Syrian border.

Burhan Ozbilici / AP But in recent months there has been a thaw. Putin personally visited Turkey in October to push for revival of a stalled natural gas pipeline project. Karlov, who was born in 1954, had been based in Ankara for three years, according to a resume posted on the Russian embassy site. Prior to that, he worked for two decades in North Korea. He was married and had a son. President Barack Obama, in Hawaii for the holidays, was briefed on the assassination and the White House condemned the Karlov killing. \"This heinous attack on a member of the diplomatic corps is unacceptable, and we stand united with Russia and Turkey in our determination to confront terrorism in all of its forms,\" the White House said. Secretary of State John Kerry denounced \"this despicable attack,\" calling it \"an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent the nations of the world.\" Strongly condemn savage attack on #Russia Amb to #Turkey Andrey Karlov & several other ppl. Our thoughts are w/the victims & their families. \u2014 Samantha Power (@AmbassadorPower) December 19, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump offered his condolences to Karlov's loved ones and said his killer was a \"radical Islamic terrorist.\" \"The murder of an ambassador is a violation of all rules of civilized order and must be universally condemned,\" Trump said. British ambassador to Turkey Richard Moore called Karlov a \"quietly spoken, hospitable professional\" and said his thoughts were with his wife and family. Meanwhile, the State Department urged American citizens to steer clear of the embassy in Ankara, which went into lockdown immediately after the shooting. It was lifted later Monday. Tuesday morning local time, a man was arrested after shots were fired outside the American embassy in Ankara, authorities said. No one was hurt, a U.S. State Department official told NBC News, and Turkish authorities are investigating. Turkish media reported the man fired a shotgun eight or nine times shortly before 4 a.m. local time.

The judge has since been cleared of misconduct. Eric Risberg/AP A California judge has been cleared of misconduct after sentencing a Stanford University student to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a woman earlier this year. \"The California Commission on Judicial Performance ruled Monday that there was no evidence that Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky displayed bias in handing down a sentence decried as too lenient by critics across the country,\" The Associated Press reported. At the sentencing in June, Persky said he considered student Brock Turner's lack of prior criminal history in determining the length of his sentence for assaulting an unconscious woman on campus. Brock Turner Freed From Jail After Serving Half Of 6-Month Sentence \"A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. I think he will not be a danger to others,\" said the judge, as we reported . Turner, 21, was released in September after three months in jail . He was expected to return to his native Ohio to live with his parents. His sentence also required him to register as a sex offender. The case sparked an ongoing recall campaign against the judge. One of those calling for his removal is Stanford Law professor Michele Dauber, who wrote in an email to NPR this fall, \"We need judges who understand violence against women. Judge Persky does not. He should be replaced. Hopefully a qualified woman will replace him.\" After the sentence, Turner's victim read a statement in court, directed at her assailant, who was a swimmer for the university: \"I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. ... My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.\" Article continues after sponsorship As The Two-Way has reported , after Turner was sentenced, Stanford \" was found to have five federal complaints about its handling of sexual violence \u2014 the most cases under review of any school on the list published by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.\" ",

A firefighter stands in the intersection where a Metrolink train collided with a truck near Oxnard on Feb. 24, 2015. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Dan Weikel Contact Reporter Federal investigators on Monday blamed last year\u2019s derailment of a Metrolink commuter train on a tired truck driver who had gone without rest for 24 hours before mistakenly turning onto the tracks at a railroad crossing outside Oxnard. The collision with a Ford F-450 utility truck and trailer occurred shortly before dawn on Feb. 24, 2015, near the crossing at South Rice Avenue and East Fifth Street. Four Metrolink passenger cars derailed,\u00a0injuring 32\u00a0of 51 passengers and crew members, including the engineer,\u00a0Glenn Steele, 62, of Riverside County,\u00a0who died seven days later. The truck driver, Jose Ramirez-Sanchez, 54, of Yuma, Ariz., received minor injuries. National Transportation Safety Board investigators concluded in their report that Ramirez-Sanchez probably was fatigued when he turned right from Rice Avenue onto the tracks and\u00a0became stuck on the right-of-way about 80 feet west of the grade crossing. By the time he drove onto the tracks,\u00a0investigators said, he had spent almost 17 hours on the road and had been on duty for 24 hours. Research shows that inadequate sleep can result in decreased alertness, lapses in attention, mistakes in judgment \u00a0and a higher risk of accidents.\u00a0 \u201cThe driver erred in turning west on the railroad tracks rather than west onto East Fifth Street 57 feet farther south due to a combination of acute fatigue and unfamiliarity with the area,\u201d the NTSB report stated. After the impact, the train pushed the truck about 130 feet east of the crossing and three of the four derailed passenger cars rolled over on their sides. The trailer came to rest on the crossing, where it was destroyed by fire. At the time of the collision, Ramirez-Sanchez worked for Growers Co. but was operating the vehicle for Harvest Management. Both firms are based in Arizona and operate fleets of trucks, buses and semi-trailers that serve the agricultural industry. The crash raised questions about the safety and workmanship of 57\u00a0 Hyundai Rotem cab cars that Metrolink bought several years ago to upgrade its fleet with more crash-resistant rolling stock. Cab cars are passenger cars with an engineer\u2019s position. They operate at\u00a0the front of trains when they reverse direction at the end of a line. In the Oxnard crash, the cab car\u2019s front-end deflector, or so-called pilot, which is designed to prevent debris from getting under train wheels, broke off on impact with the truck and was found behind the wreckage. An in-house investigation by Metrolink concluded that the deflectors of its Hyundai cab cars had flawed welds, inadequate bracing and did not meet the railroad\u2019s strength specifications. The inquiry also found quality problems with several couplers of the derailed passenger cars. Though it has been\u00a0suspected that the defective pilot contributed to the severity of the Oxnard crash, NTSB investigators said they found no markings or damage suggesting that the deflector itself interfered with the wheels of the train and caused the derailment. Subsequent studies of one of the couplers indicated that it would have passed stress tests regardless of its workmanship, the NTSB report stated. The flawed deflectors are now the subject of lawsuits filed against Hyundai Rotem Co. by injured passengers, the family of the deceased engineer and Metrolink, which received its last\u00a0car from the company\u00a0in 2014. Railroad officials said they are reviewing and evaluating the NTSB report. They added that Metrolink took several safety measures after the faulty deflectors were discovered, such as placing 40 leased freight locomotives in cab car roles until the defective parts could be repaired or replaced. A Metrolink spokesperson said that the last of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co. engines were returned Nov. 1, and that 52 of the cab cars have been fixed. She added that 40 are back in service. \u201cMetrolink has fully cooperated with the NTSB throughout its\u00a0investigation and took actions to enhance safety for our\u00a0passengers and team members prior to the release of this report,\u201d said Sherita Coffelt, the railroad\u2019s director of public affairs.

The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawki said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. Zurawki said that \u201cthey must have done something to my driver,\u201d he told TVN24. Berlin\u2019s top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and said that reports the truck may have been hijacked were \u201cpure speculation.\u201d\u00a0 5:22 p.m. ET -- The White House released a statement Monday evening about the truck plowing through the crowd at the Berlin Christmas market.\u00a0 \u201cThe United States condemns in the strongest terms what appears to have been a terrorist attack on a Christmas Market in Berlin, Germany, which has killed and wounded dozens,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cWe send our thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of those killed, just as we wish a speedy recovery to all of those wounded.\u201d 4:53 p.m. ET -- Berlin police are encouraging people to use a Facebook safety check to learn if loved ones are safe after a truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market.\u00a0 The tweet linked out to Facebook, which has set up checks periodically after natural disasters and attacks around the world.\u00a0 But police also asked people to refrain from spreading videos to protect privacy \u00a04:40 p.m. ET --\u00a0Germany\u2019s justice minister says that federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, are taking over the investigation after a truck rammed into a Christmas market in Berlin.\u00a0 Heiko Maas didn\u2019t give further details in a post on Twitter Monday night about the \u201cshocking news\u201d from the capital. He added: \u201cwe are mourning with the relatives\u201d of the victims. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere says that he\u2019s in constant touch with security authorities, but didn\u2019t give any indication in a statement whether they believe the incident was an attack. BERLIN - At least nine people were killed and dozens injured when\u00a0a truck plowed through a crowd at a popular Christmas market in Berlin late Monday, police said. Polizei Berlin said that a suspect had been arrested near the scene. A passenger in the truck died at the scene, although it\u2019s not clear how or when that happened yet. The identity of the passenger and arrested suspect have not been released. Police spokesman Winfried Wenzel told ZDF television that the suspect arrested was believed to be the truck driver. The incident happened in Breitscheidplatz, a major square in the center of the German capital, that is normally filled this time of year with people celebrating the holiday season.\u00a0 While officials haven\u2019t stated whether it was an purposeful attack or an accident, CBS News correspondent Charlie D\u2019Agata reports that witnesses said there was little doubt it was a deliberate attack based on the way it jumped the curb. \u00a0 Additionally, the incident happened just a few weeks after the U.S. State Department warned that various terrorist groups were going to be targeting outdoor markets and festivals this holiday season throughout Europe. A large Scania truck with its windshield smashed out could be seen on the sidewalk alongside the market, although officials have not yet confirmed that it was the truck used in the attack. \u00a0 A firefighter walks in front of a truck at the site of an accident at a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS Witness Shandana A. Durrani said she was walking and texting when the truck entered the market about 20 feet away. She said she heard some popping but wasn\u2019t sure if it was a gun or not. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t stopped to check my phone, I would have been hit,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cEveryone went scurrying. So many people hurt.\u201d She said the way the market was laid out, \u201cthere was just no place to run so a lot of us hid behind other stalls.\u201d Every year, the city of Berlin hosts a Christmas market there near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue. The incident happened at the foot of the landmark Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church, which was kept as a ruin after World War II.\u00a0 Paramedics work at the site of an accident at a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Several  people in the U.S. intelligence community told CBS News that the situation in Berlin has all the hallmarks of a terror attack. Officials here in the U.S. say it bears similarities to the recent terror attack in Nice, France \u00a0- in which 86 people were killed and hundreds injured - and is what terror groups have been calling for their followers to do. German police have recently rounded up a series of people for planning attacks on Christmas markets, and even detained last week a 12-year-old Iraqi boy for attempting to set off a nail bomb in one of them. CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan reports the U.S. State Department issued a warning in late November specifically cautioning Americans in Europe to \u201cexercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets.\u201d The release cited ISIS, al Qaeda and \u201ctheir affiliates\u201d as planning attacks using \u201cconventional and non-conventional weapons\u201d focusing on the upcoming holiday season and \u201cassociated events.\u201d Many in Germany have been fearful of a rise in terrorism since the country took in more than a million migrants and refugees last year, mostly fleeing conflict in the Mideast.\u00a0 German prosecutors were already investigating a 12-year-old boy who allegedly attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen last week. A survivor of an accident with a Polish truck is rescued on a stretcher near a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz square near the fashionable Kurfuerstendamm avenue in the west of Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2016.\u00a0 REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch The German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources. In the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported. Police said it would have burned but would not have exploded. Stephan Meyer, the parliamentary spokesman on security issues for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, said the boy apparently had turned rapidly to Islamic extremism. \u201cThis shows how quickly the radicalization of a young person, a child, can take place,\u201d he said. In the Nice attack, officials said Mohamed Lahouaiyej Bouhlel deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into thick crowds on the French Riviera celebrating the country\u2019s independence day. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Email Associated Press photographer Burhan Ozbilici was attending a photo exhibition Monday when a Turkish policeman opened fire,\u00a0 killing Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey . He recounts how he captured the chaotic scene with his camera despite the lethal danger. \u00a0\u00a0 ANKARA, Turkey -- The event seemed routine, the opening of an exhibit of photographs of Russia. So when a man in a dark suit and tie pulled out a gun, I was stunned and thought it was a theatrical flourish. Instead, it was a coolly calculated assassination, unfolding in front of me and others who scrambled, terrified, for cover as the trim man with short hair gunned down the Russian ambassador. The gunshots, at least eight of them, were loud in the pristine art gallery. Pandemonium erupted. People screamed, hid behind columns and under tables and lay on the floor. I was afraid and confused, but found partial cover behind a wall and did my job: taking photographs. The exhibition, titled \u201cFrom Kaliningrad to Kamchatka, from the eyes of travelers\u201d featured photos from Russia\u2019s westernmost Baltic region to the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the east. I decided to attend simply because it was on my way home from the Ankara office. When I arrived, the speeches had already begun. After Russian Ambassador Andrey Karlov began to make his address, I moved closer to photograph him, thinking the pictures would come in useful for stories on Turkish-Russian relations.\u00a0 A gunman gestures near the body of Russian Amassador Andrei Karlov at a photo gallery in Ankara, Turkey, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici He was speaking softly and -- from what I could tell -- lovingly about his homeland, stopping occasionally to allow the translator to relay his words in Turkish. I remember thinking how calm and humble he seemed. Then came the gunshots in quick succession, and panic in the audience. The ambassador\u2019s body lay on the floor, just meters (yards) away from me. I couldn\u2019t see any blood around him; I think he may have been shot in the back.\u00a0 It took me a few seconds to realize what had happened: A man had died in front of me; a life had disappeared before my eyes. I moved back and to the left, while the gunman -- later identified as police officer Mevlut Mert Altintas -- gestured with his gun at people cowering on the right side of the room. At first, I couldn\u2019t figure out what had motivated the shooter. I thought he might be a Chechen militant. But people later said he was shouting about the Syrian city of Aleppo. So he was probably angry about Russian bombardments of Aleppo that were aimed at driving out anti-government rebels. Many civilians have been killed in the fighting. He also shouted \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d but I couldn\u2019t understand the rest of what he said in Arabic. The gunman was agitated. He walked around the ambassador\u2019s body, smashing some of the photos hanging on the wall.\u00a0 ",

The incident happened at Breitscheidplatz, a public square in the center of Berlin. The driver's nationality wasn't known, but police said his truck appeared to have Polish license plates. The driver attempted to flee but was apprehended by police, they added. A passenger in the truck was among those killed, police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said on German TV. It immediately wasn't clear how the passenger died, or the relationship to the driver. A truck is seen near the Christmas market in Berlin on Dec. 19. Fabrizio Bensch / Reuters It wasn't clear whether the truck veered into the holiday crowds on purpose or by accident. But local German media cited police who said initial indications pointed to an attack, not a traffic accident. NBC News could not immediately confirm those reports.

Governor-elect Roy Cooper, who unseated Pat McCrory last month in part by campaigning against the law, said the move followed the Charlotte City Council's decision to repeal the pro-LGBT ordinance that inspired the North Carolina General Assembly to pass the law in the first place. Related: Trial over North Carolina's House Bill 2 Delayed Until Next Summer Cooper, the state's attorney general, said he already had agreement from the leaders of the state Senate and House of Representatives to undo the law, known as House Bill 2, and that the legislature would meet in special session on Tuesday to get it done. Republican leaders have said in the past they would not repeal the law unless Charlotte backed down first. That appears to have happened, with Charlotte living up to its end of the deal and Cooper, who takes office Jan. 1, attempting to hold lawmakers to theirs. \"I hope they will keep their word to me and with the help of Democrats in the legislature, HB2 will be repealed in full,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"Full repeal will help to bring jobs, sports and entertainment events back and will provide the opportunity for strong LGBT protections in our state.\" My statement on today's Charlotte City Council vote: pic.twitter.com/qNN8pmvSjv \u2014 Roy Cooper (@RoyCooperNC) December 19, 2016 Since HB2 passed in March, a variety of companies, sports leagues and entertainers have turned their backs on North Carolina in protest. Related: NCAA Pulls Seven Championships Out of North Carolina Over HB2 The state law was passed in reaction to an ordinance approved by the Charlotte City Council in February that expanded legal protections for LGBT citizens, including transgender peoples' freedom to use bathrooms assigned to the gender they identified as. The state law, passed in an overnight session of the legislature and signed quickly by McCrory, restricted such bathroom access in schools and government buildings, nullifying the Charlotte ordinance and other similar local measures. In addition, the law stripped cities of the right to set their own minimum wages. \"It's been 271 days since the shameful and archaic HB2 was first passed, and the entire country has witnessed its devastating impact,\" Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a joint statement with Equality North Carolina praising Coooper's deal. \"It's time for state lawmakers to repeal HB2 and begin repairing the harm this bill has done to people and the damage it has done to North Carolina's reputation and economy.\" The Charlotte City Council said in a statement that it repealed the ordinance during a Monday morning meeting with the local delegation to the state legislature. The council made the move contingent on HB2 being repealed by Dec. 31. The city remains \"deeply dedicated to protecting the rights of all people from discrimination, and, with House Bill 2 repealed, will be able to pursue that priority for our community,\" the statement said.

The laptop's hard drive, which sources say was discovered in an unrelated investigation into alleged sexting by former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner , had been used by Weiner and his estranged wife, top Clinton adviser Huma Abedin . FBI Director Says Investigation Into Hillary Clinton Emails Back On The FBI had effectively closed its investigation of Clinton's use of a private server as secretary of state in July, at which time the agency's director, James Comey, stated flatly in a press conference that, \u201cno charges are appropriate in this case.\" But the possibility that emails discovered on the laptop could be related to the investigation led Comey to issue a stunning letter to Congress on Oct. 28, informing them of the rekindled probe. \"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\" Comey wrote in the letter to Congress. Nine days later, on Nov. 6, just two days before the election, Comey said in another letter to Congress, \"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\" Clinton has said Comey's actions were a turning point in the presidential race , telling donors soon after the election that the FBI director's announcement killed momentum in her campaign and boosted motivation for Trump. A top donor told ABC News that the Comey letter was \"a perfect setup for failure.\" 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Geoff Caddick, AFP/Getty Images) The world of English soccer is a weird and wonderful one, especially at this time of year\u00a0when the games come thick and fast. Yet there is also a ludicrously parochial side to the English Premier League, one that has unfairly and somewhat embarrassingly caught Swansea City head coach Bob Bradley in its crosshairs. Bradley, the former United States national team boss, has come under fire for\u00a0failing to revive Swansea\u2019s fortunes since taking over in October. The club sits 19th in the 20-team EPL standings and\u00a0has managed two wins in its past 10 games, prompting\u00a0calls for Bradley to be fired. So far, so normal\u00a0in the cutthroat environment of the world\u2019s toughest league. MORE SOCCER COVERAGE: Stripping Russia of 2018 World Cup would prove FIFA is truly reformed What goes far beyond the realms of sensible behavior though, is the reaction to Bradley\u2019s comments in his post-game interview following Saturday\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Middlesbrough, where the 58-year-old committed what is apparently a cardinal sin in the English game. For a brief second, before subsequently correcting himself, Bradley referred to a penalty kick as a \u201cPK,\u201d\u00a0and called the visit to Middlesbrough a \u201croad game\u201d instead of an \u201caway trip.\u201d Cue outrage from Britain\u2019s soccer social media dwellers, who apparently have too much time on their hands and should get back to their television sets, currently toting endless reruns of Love Actually and blanket coverage of the ever-popular world darts championship. According to some, Bradley\u2019s verbiage shows why he is ill-suited to the EPL, is proof that he has failed to adapt\u00a0and that Swansea\u2019s American owners erred in hiring one of their compatriots. It is a farce, and one that, in the same year that the United Kingdom decided it didn\u2019t want to be part of a European political collective anymore, reflects poorly on the country. For a start, let\u2019s state the blindingly obvious by suggesting that sporting lingo has nothing to do with coaching ability. Further, Bradley has also clearly gone out of his way to avoid Americanisms, presumably aware that being from the U.S. could be held against him by British soccer snobs. The Wall Street Journal found that Bradley has actually used more British-type terms than\u00a0American ones in his press appearances, apart of regularly saying \u201czero\u201d instead of \u201cnil\u201d and \u201cgame\u201d instead of \u201cmatch.\u201d Oh no, shame on him. Then comes the greatest irony of all. Bradley has not once used the term soccer, which apparently constitutes the ultimate evidence that someone is a newbie. Brits continue to make fun of Americans over the term and most have come to believe it was invented over here. It wasn\u2019t. In fact, dating back to the 19th century, \u201csoccer\u201d was in common usage in England, having been spliced from the sport\u2019s full name \u2014\u00a0asSOCiation football. At the midpoint of the last century there was a widely read magazine, Soccer Star, that lasted for decades. Shopping areas are still populated with outlets of Soccer Scene, a well-known athletic goods store. Most fans prefer to forget that and Bradley continues to get the short end of the things. A popular television show titled \"Soccer AM,\" doesn\u2019t help much either, with a weekly skit about a loud-mouthed and clueless American coach \u2014\u00a0named Brad Bobley\u00a0\u2014\u00a0complete with an awful fake accent and plenty of American terminology. While that at least is based in humor, the suggestion that Bradley\u2019s lexicon is in any way related to his ability to lead Swansea out of relegation danger is merely ignorant. And it does nothing to help Bradley\u2019s cause, one that, with the most pivotal point of the season approaching, is in definite need of an urgent lift. 206 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

    "text": "Syrian civil war began in March 2011 and has raged for five years, causing untold destruction and more than 250,000 deaths The departure from the villages had stalled on Sunday after militants burned six empty buses assigned to take the villagers out. The Observatory and Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu later said that since midnight Sunday, some 4,500 people have been evacuated from eastern Aleppo. Reports differed on how many people remain in what was once the Aleppo rebel enclave, ranging from 15,000 to 40,000 civilians, along with an estimated 6,000 fighters. Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency said a total of 131 wounded people \u2014 including 46 children \u2014 were brought to Turkey for treatment since the evacuations began last week. The agency said five of them have since died. If the evacuation from Aleppo is completed later on Monday, it will close an important chapter in Syria\u2019s civil war, now in its sixth year, with rebels having no remaining presence in Syria\u2019s largest city, which was once the country\u2019s commercial center. The rebels captured eastern Aleppo in July 2012 and held on to it despite a ferocious assault in the past weeks by Syrian government forces, backed by Russia and a host of Shiite militias from Iraq, Lebanon, Iran and Afghanistan. The recapture of the entire city would be President Bashar Assad\u2019s biggest victory since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend. Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you. \"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\" Related: Why Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever Anymore The goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\" But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could. \"Imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased.\" Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public. The natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy. Long-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too. Related: Is Perfecting Artificial Intelligence This Generations Space Race? She imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone. \"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\" While the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy \u2014 edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory \u2014 experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved. Heather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one. Stocktrek Images / Getty Images Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones .) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead. AfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave. If people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back? Both Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave. Related: Could One Person Take Down the Internet? \"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says. Beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones. \"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way? Digital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death.

They let us combine our curated memories and experiences with all our messy data \u2014 the texts and tweets and \"Likes\" and photos \u2014 and organize it into something that we hope will let our loved ones and future generations actually understand something about who we were.

Although electors in dozens of states still have to vote, the electoral balloting in Texas put Trump over the majority threshold, according to a state-by-state tally by the Associated Press. Thirty-six of the state's electors voted for Trump, one for John Kasich and one for Ron Paul . The next, and last, official step in the electoral process is for Congress to count the votes. Under the procedure set out by the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, that formal process is scheduled for Jan. 6. Some anti-Trump activists had hoped against hope that they could persuade electors in states that voted for Trump to defect, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Electors are nearly all party loyalists. Additionally, they faced more than two centuries of tradition\u00a0and, in some states, legal obligations\u00a0that called for them to cast their ballots according to which candidate won the popular vote in their states. No\u00a0defectors have ever changed the result of a presidential election. Four\u00a0electors today successfully defected in Washington state. Instead of voting for Hillary Clinton, who won the state's popular vote,\u00a0three electors voted\u00a0for former secretary of State\u00a0Colin Powell and one voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, an environmental activist.\u00a0Electors in two other states who tried to vote against the state's winner were replaced with alternates. There may be additional defections in the remaining states, but since Trump now has a majority of the electoral votes, those would\u00a0not be enough to change the result. Latest updates ",

CERN hide caption toggle caption CERN Jeffery Hangst's ALPHA research at CERN, which is Europe's premier particle physics laboratory and is located near Geneva, is devoted to studying antimatter. CERN In a technological tour de force, scientists have developed a new way to probe antimatter. For the first time, researchers were able to zap antimatter atoms with a laser, then precisely measure the light let off by these strange anti-atoms. By comparing the light from anti-atoms with the light from regular atoms, they hope to answer one of the big mysteries of our universe: Why, in the early universe, did antimatter lose out to regular old matter? \"This represents a historic point in the decades-long efforts to create antimatter and compare its properties to those of matter,\" says Alan Kostelecky , a theoretical physicist at Indiana University. Antimatter sounds like something out of science fiction. \"The first time I heard about antimatter was on Star Trek, when I was a kid,\" says Jeffrey Hangst , a physicist at Aarhus University in Denmark. \"I was intrigued by what it was and then kind of shocked to learn that it was a real thing in physics.\" He founded a research group called ALPHA at CERN, Europe's premier particle physics laboratory near Geneva, that is devoted to studying antimatter. That's a tricky thing to do because antimatter isn't like the regular matter you see around you every day. At the subatomic level, antimatter is pretty much the complete opposite \u2014 instead of having a negative charge, for example, its electrons have a positive charge. And whenever antimatter comes into contact with regular matter, they both disappear in a flash of light. When antimatter touches regular matter, it annihilates in a flash of light. These images show anti-hydrogen atoms annihilating as they come into contact with the walls of the ALPHA experiment, which are made of ordinary matter. CERN hide caption toggle caption CERN \"What you hear about in science fiction \u2014 that antimatter gets annihilated by normal matter \u2014 is 100 percent true,\" Hangst says, \"and is the greatest challenge in my everyday life.\" Article continues after sponsorship Because if his team makes antimatter and then it touches the walls of its container ... then poof! It's gone. He and his colleagues have spent years figuring out how to make the antimatter version of simple hydrogen atoms. They then trap and hold these anti-atoms in a vacuum using strong magnetic fields. \"We can keep them for a long time,\" Hangst says. \"We've demonstrated we can keep them for 15 minutes without losing them.\" In the journal Nature, his team reports that they've now used the special laser to probe this antimatter. So far, what they see is that their anti-hydrogen atoms respond to the laser in the same way that regular hydrogen does. That's what the various theories out there would predict \u2014 still, Hangst says, it's important to check. \"We're kind of really overjoyed to finally be able to say we have done this,\" he says. \"For us, it's a really big deal.\" Understanding the basic properties of antimatter is an important step toward understanding why we even exist. When the universe began, scientists think, there should have been equal amounts of antimatter and matter \u2014 which means they should have destroyed each other completely. \"But something happened, some small asymmetry that led some of the matter to survive,\" Hangst says. \"And we simply have no good idea that explains that right now.\" That's why he and his colleagues want to understand whether matter and antimatter truly obey the same laws of physics. And theoretical physicists watch these experiments with awe. \"Just the concept that you can make an anti-atom, an atom made of antimatter, is a real gee-whiz thing,\" says Chris Quigg , at Fermilab, near Chicago. \"Anybody has to be impressed by that.\" There are a lot more subtle measurements of antimatter left to do. And once experimentalists develop this kind of new tool, Quigg says, who knows what else they'll be able to do with it in the future. ",

A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit can go forward accusing former Mayor Richard Daley of ignoring evidence that white Chicago police detectives working under disgraced former police Cmdr. Jon Burge tortured dozens of black suspects into murder confessions. U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve's... (Jason Meisner) A decade ago, Daley was interviewed under oath by two special prosecutors who had been appointed to investigate the torture scandal, but the questioning was criticized as friendly to the then-mayor. \"They weren't just softball questions, they were 16-inch softball questions,\" G. Flint Taylor, one of the lawyers scheduled to question Daley next month, told the Tribune in 2006. Daley said he couldn't recall in answering more than 20 questions during an interview that included sometimes long and rambling questions or comments by the special prosecutors followed by usually brief responses from Daley. The report issued weeks later skirted Daley's role in the scandal and was blasted by some as a whitewash. Smith, who spent nearly 20 years in prison before prosecutors dismissed his case last year, claims he was beaten with a rubber nightstick by Calumet District detectives Peter Dignan and John Byrne, kicked in the groin and had a plastic bag put over his head to force him to confess to the 1983 slaying of James Fullilove. In denying a motion by lawyers for the city to dismiss Smith's lawsuit last month, U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve wrote that Smith's attorneys \"sufficiently allege that Daley, as Chicago's mayor, participated in a conspiracy to conceal evidence of police torture.\" Richard M. Daley was first elected mayor in 1989 following a failed bid in 1983. The mayor has won re-election every four years since then, always with little to no opposition. The judge did, however, dismiss on technical grounds allegations over Daley's actions as state's attorney, saying that by law he was immune from exposure to damages stemming from a criminal prosecution. St. Eve's decision closely mirrored a ruling in a separate case involving Michael Tillman, who claimed he confessed to a 1986 rape and murder only because detectives under Burge's command punched him, beat him with a phone book, threatened to kill him and held a plastic bag over his head. In 2012, Daley was set to give a video-recorded deposition in Tillman's case after a judge allowed the suit against him to proceed. But before he testified, the case was settled for $5.375 million. At the time, Heard issued a statement denying any wrongdoing on the mayor's part. \"As for the claims that he knowingly allowed police torture to occur some 30 years ago, his response remains the same: It is simply not true,\" Heard said.

Authorities weren\u2019t considering the attack as terrorism, he said. Police also said it was too early to determine whether there might be any link to an incident in Berlin also on Monday, where a truck rammed into a Christmas market, killing at least nine people. \u201cThe unknown person fired several shots and fled from the building,\u201d Bisa told reporters near the mosque, which was cordoned off by police. \u201cThe shooting took place inside a prayer room with several people in it. Two victims were severely injured.\u201d Bisa said the injured were hospitalized and were aged 30, 35 and 56 years old, but did not specify their nationalities. He said witnesses described the attacker as clad head to foot in black, and was believed to be aged about 30 years old. At the scene, Abukav Abshirow, a 30-year-old Somali man who works at a Zurich car dealership, said his friend was among the injured. He recalled how they had been celebrating a religious occasion at the center the night before. \u201cI am under shock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great times here. The atmosphere was always friendly and happy at the center ... I am very, very sad this happened. We never had problems here before. We spend the weekend here with our children in peace.\u201d \u201cI am waiting to find out what happened, and who is responsible,\u201d he said. Attacks by gunmen are rare in Switzerland. The country was shaken in 2013 by at least two multiple-fatality shootings. The country has a long-standing tradition for men to keep their military rifles after completing compulsory military service - which partly explains a high rate of gun ownership in the country of about 8.2 million people. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

(Photo: J. David Ake, AP) NEW YORK \u00a0Platinum Partners hedge fund founder Mark Nordlicht and four others with ties\u00a0to the New York City-based hedge fund were\u00a0charged Monday in a $1 billion securities fraud indictment, one of the largest alleged scams since Bernard Madoff's notorious Ponzi scheme. Brooklyn federal prosecutors who announced the eight count indictment\u00a0said two additional suspects were indicted for their alleged roles in a $50 million bond fraud involving Black Elk Energy, one of Platinum Partners' largest portfolio companies. The hedge fund's management companies\u00a0\"projected stability and confidence\" to current and prospective investors, reporting positive average returns of 17% from 2003-2015, according to a parallel civil lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Inside, however, the management firms faced a worsening liquidity crisis at times\u00a0referred to in company documents\u00a0as \"Hail Mary time,\" along with \"relentless\" redemption requests from investors seeking their money back, federal prosecutors and the SEC said. Nordlicht and his alleged co-conspirators knew that one of the company's chief\u00a0funds faced\u00a0financial trouble as early as 2012, the indictment charged. As the situation turned\u00a0desperate, the suspects allegedly defrauded investors by overvaluing the company's\u00a0largest assets, concealing cash flow problems at Platinum's signature fund and paying preferential repayments to some customers. \"Nordlicht and his cohorts engaged in one of the largest and most brazen investment frauds perpetrated on the investing public, earning Plantinum\u00a0more than $100 million in fees during the charged conspiracy,\" Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said in a statement announcing the charges. The secret financial implosion \"eventually led to Nordlicht and his co-conspirators operating Platinum like a Ponzi scheme, where they used loans and new investor funds to pay off existing investors,\" said Capers. Platinum declined to comment on the allegations. Founded in 2003,\u00a0 Platinum Partners \u00a0is an investment management group that as recently as March reported to the SEC and other regulators that it had $1.7\u00a0billion in assets under management. The firm manages multiple funds, but most assets were invested through Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage Fund and Platinum Partners Credit Opportunities Master Fund. Defendants charged with Nordlicht, 48, of New Rochelle, N.Y. include: David Levy, 31, a New York City resident and the company's co-chief investment officer; Uri Landesman, 55, of New Rochelle, the former president of Platinum's signature fund: Joseph SanFilippo, 38, of Freehold, N.J., the CFO of the signature fund; Joseph Mann, 24, of Brooklyn an investor and finance official; Daniel Small, 47, of New York City, a former managing\u00a0director; and Jeffrey Shulse, 44, of Houston, the former CEO of Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations. Prosecutors cited company records that documented the financial crisis hidden from investors. In a Nov. 2012 email exchange with Landesman, Nordlicht wrote \"It's just very daunting. It seems like we make some progress and then [redemptions] are relentless almost.\" The following month, Nordlicht forwarded an email to Landesman showing he had informed a co-conspirator that he wife was urging him to leave for Israel. Many of Platinum's investors are observant members of the Jewish religious community, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Platinum's management hid the red ink in part by claiming a position in Golden Gate Oil LLC was valued at roughly $170 million. In reality, it was worth a fraction of that total, the SEC complaint said. The executives also allegedly misled investors about the\u00a0cash crunch. Records of a Jan. 2015 conference call with investors show\u00a0Nordlicht said: \"If we look historically, we've been very\u00a0very fortunate ... we're running about a billion four between all our different entities ... I\u00a0think we've returned about double that in cash to investors, so that is really an indication of ... being very liquid and nimble.\" By 2016, however, the financial crisis had emerged in\u00a0public view. In June, former Platinum executive Murray Huberfeld was indicted on alleged conspiracy charges with Norman Seabrook, head of the New York City corrections officers union. They\u00a0have pleaded not guilty. In July, Platinum told investors it had hired an independent monitor to oversee the\u00a0liquidation of its two principle hedge funds. Platinum Partners also said that month it would likely to return the assets of its largest and oldest fund to clients as the result of the arrest of a longtime associate on charges he arranged a $60,000 bribe in an effort to land a crucial investment from the New York City correction officers union. In August, Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage Fund (International) Limited and Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage Fund L.P. were placed into liquidation and provisional liquidation, respectively, under orders issued by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, according to the company's website. Though the alleged securities fraud is large, it's well below the as much as $20 billion investment scam Madoff ran for decades until his operation collapsed in Dec. 2008.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook The main characters in 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' are, from left to right: Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and K-2SO (Alan Tudyk). (Photo: Jonathan Olley, Lucasfilm Ltd.) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\u00a0has pushed Walt Disney Studios to rare planetary air: It's the first studio to take in more than $7 billion at the box office globally. After the weekend's box office grosses, including a $290 million global debut for Rogue One, Disney had hit $6.998 billion for the year \u2014 $2.7 billion in the U.S. and nearly $4.3 billion internationally, the studio said Monday. \u201cThis historic achievement is possible because all of our film studios are bringing their absolute best to the table, telling great stories of all kinds that resonate with audiences across borders, gender\u00a0and generations,\u201d said Alan Horn, the studio's chairman, in a statement. 'Rogue One' blows up the box office like a Death Star with $155M debut Among Disney's hits in 2016: the Marvel Universe films Captain America: Civil War and Doctor Strange, Pixar's Finding Dory, Disney animated films Moana and\u00a0Zootopia, and Disney live-action film The Jungle Book. Also adding to Disney's 2016 take: Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which made its debut in December 2015, but has earned more than one-third (about 37%) of its $2 billion global total in 2016. \u201cThese films work because each one has not only something for everyone, but everything for someone,\" Horn said. \"It\u2019s our honor to be able to create these experiences for audiences, and we\u2019re thankful to them for continuing to come out to the theater with us.\u201d Last year, as the U.S. box office set a new all-time high of $11 billion, Universal set a new global box office high of $6.89 billion, driven by Jurassic World,\u00a0Furious 7 and\u00a0Minions.\u00a0Disney's $5.85 billion also surpassed the 2014 global box office studio record of $5.5 billion set by 20th Century Fox (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, How to Train Your Dragon 2). Although there\u2019s been much concern about declining viewership at Disney's sports TV powerhouse ESPN, Disney's potential company-wide performance\u00a0led Bank of America Merrill Lynch research analyst Jessica Reif Cohen to reiterate a\u00a0Buy rating with a price target of $125. Disney ( DIS ) shares closed Monday up 1.3% at $105.30. \"We believe (Disney) offers an increasingly solid catalyst pipeline for upside potential,\" she said in a note Monday to investors,\u00a0through fiscal year 2018, which ends in October 2018. In addition to growth at theme parks and resorts, Disney has \"a solid studio outlook with blockbuster-level visibility from upcoming theatrical releases across all major studio labels\" including the live-action Beauty and the Beast (March 17, 2017),\u00a0Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (May 5), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (May 26),\u00a0Thor: Ragnarok (Nov. 3)\u00a0and Star Wars: Episode VIII (Dec. 15), she said.

By Anthony Faiola December 18 at 6:49 PM Follow @Anthony_Faiola WARSAW \u2014 The Law and Justice Party rode to power on a pledge to drain the swamp of Polish politics and roll back the legacy of the previous administration. One year later, its patriotic revolution, the party proclaims, has cleaned house and brought God and country back to Poland.\u00a0 Opponents, however, see the birth of a neo-Dark Age \u2014 one that, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, is a harbinger of the power of populism to upend a Western society. In merely a year, critics say, the nationalists have transformed Poland into a surreal and insular place \u2014 one where state-sponsored conspiracy theories and de facto propaganda distract the public as democracy erodes. [The global wave of populism that turned 2016 upside down ] In the land of Law and Justice, anti-intellectualism is king. Polish scientists are aghast at proposed curriculum changes in a new education bill that would downplay evolution theory and climate change and add hours for \u201cpatriotic\u201d history lessons. In a Facebook chat, a top equal rights official mused that Polish hotels should not be forced to provide service to black or gay customers. After the official stepped down for unrelated reasons, his successor rejected an international convention to combat violence against women because it appeared to argue against traditional gender roles. Over the weekend, Warsaw convulsed in street protests amid allegations that the Law and Justice party had illegally forced through a budget bill even as it sought to restrict media access to Parliament. (Reuters) Cheered on by religious conservatives, the new government has defunded public assistance for in vitro fertilization treatments. To draft new sexual-education classes in schools, it tapped a contraceptives opponent who argues that condom use increases the risk of cancer in women. The government is proffering a law that critics say could soon be used to limit opposition protests. [ \u2018Her story is my story\u2019: How a harsh abortion ban has reignited feminism in Poland ] Yet nothing has shocked liberals more than this: After a year in power, Law and Justice is still by far the most popular political party in Poland. It rides atop opinion polls at roughly 36 percent \u2014 more than double the popularity of the ousted Civic Platform party. \u201cThe people support us,\u201d boasted Adam Bielan, Law and Justice\u2019s deputy speaker of the Senate. Trump is promising a tax code rework that could trigger a bonanza of cash rebates for Americans. In Poland, Law and Justice put cash in pockets in other ways, but always while merging social conservatism and nationalism with populist economics. The new government doled out money to families with children. They also slashed Poland\u2019s retirement age \u2014 to as young as 60 for women and 65 for men. Opponents call such actions the \u201cbuying\u201d of support, moves that will only drive up Polish debt and masquerade a long-term power grab that could entrench Law and Justice for years. But right now, for many Poles, nationalism has never felt so good. \u201cWe are living in this post-truth environment where you can say and do anything and people don\u2019t seem to care,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Warsaw-based Institute of Public Affairs. Now they\u2019re true believers The road to Law and Justice country runs an hour outside cosmopolitan Warsaw, down a dirt path in the hamlet of Krupia Wolka. Once there, pass the front-yard playground of a cream-colored house and meet Pawel and Maria Wiechowski.\u00a0 High school sweethearts, they married back in 1992. Two-and-a-half decades and 10 children later, they\u2019re still deeply Catholic \u2014 and still struggling financially.\u00a0 Maria, a therapist for autistic children, quit work when child-care costs exceeded what she earned. Pawel, a craftsman, makes intricate moldings for ceilings and walls. Their parents helped them buy their six-bedroom dream home in the country, so they\u2019re mortgage-free. But he hasn\u2019t had work in two months. During dry spells before, the couple would mothball their 20-year-old VW van to save on gas, and the kids would walk to school. But in the era of Law and Justice, there\u2019s no need. The new government program for families is the Wiechowskis\u2019 life raft; it offers them a monthly cash payout worth nearly $1,000. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s 100 percent of our income,\u201d Pawel said. \u201cSome people criticize the child benefit and say it\u2019s a government handout. It\u2019s not. It is support for traditional families.\u201d Pawel voted for Law and Justice last year as \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d But now he\u2019s a true believer. \u201cIn the United States, you had the same choice, picking the lesser of two evils,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure a year ago either, but now I see how right we were.\u201d Embracing the new government, to some measure, also means buying into the disturbing worldview it sells: You can only trust a Pole \u2014 even then, only some. And the party\u2019s views have never been more effectively disseminated. The national broadcaster in Poland would often tilt toward the party in power. But following its victory, Law and Justice launched an unprecedented purge of journalists at the channel, turning it into what opponents describe as a propaganda machine where conspiracy theories flourish. It recently ran a piece on the health risks of child vaccinations.\u00a0 Conservative Catholic radio and television, meanwhile, is abuzz with the\u00a0 reopening of an investigation into the 2010 plane crash that killed then-President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and 94 others. The crash was blamed on human error at the time. But Jaroslaw Kaczynski \u2014 the late president\u2019s twin brother and Law and Justice\u2019s powerful party chief \u2014 appears certain it was a coverup. Was it? \u201cWe are considering the possibility,\u201d Pawel said with a nod. The new government is also skeptical of the Paris climate change agreement to cut carbon emissions and has pulled support for Polish wind and solar farms. At the same time, it is pumping more money into coal.\u00a0 \u201cWho really knows what is causing global warming?\u201d Pawel said. \u201cAnd Poland needs the coal industry.\u201d Maria was always more concerned with the spread of liberal values, which Law and Justice has, she said, rightly nipped in the bud. There is no more talk in Poland, for instance, of offering any legal rights to same-sex couples. Earlier this year, the office of a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group in Warsaw was badly vandalized. Police never caught the perpetrators. \u201cHomosexuality was quiet before, then they tried to normalize it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that happening now.\u201d\u00a0 Are they concerned about allegations the new government is distracting the public as it chips away at Polish democracy? \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just cleaning house.\u201d \u2018Where is all this going?\u2019 On a frigid recent evening in Warsaw, Monika Mizolebska, a museum researcher, stoically marched with thousands of other Poles to protest the new government. This is the street opposition \u2014 the people terrified by what they see unfolding in Poland. Already, the new government has taken steps to limit the power of the constitutional court, chipping away, critics say, at checks and balances. A new draft law would also allow government-appointed governors the right to decide on future permits for demonstrations.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m here marching because it may be the last time we\u2019re allowed to,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think many of us really understand what\u2019s happening in Poland.\u201d The mother of a 13-year-old daughter, Mizolebska said she is deeply concerned about what sees as an attack on\u00a0 women\u2019s reproductive rights . A near-total abortion ban \u2014 women and doctors faced up to five years in jail \u2014 was defeated in October after a\u00a0 massive street protest . But she fears it may yet come back. \u201cThe government wants women to be mothers, to be housewives, but my daughter wants to be a writer, maybe a journalist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what chance does she have here? In these conditions?\u201d She is also concerned about a new proposed school curriculum the Polish Academy of Sciences says will marginalize evolution theory by reducing its prominence in some grades. Sciences more generally would receive less time, in favor of more hours for Polish history.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s 2016 and we\u2019re still talking about whether to teach evolution,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWhere is all this going? I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Ewa Galica in Warsaw contributed to this report. Read more ",

Roberts on Monday did not comment in rejecting an emergency appeal by lawyer Steven Michel of New Mexico . Michel argued that Senate Republicans' obstruction of President Barack Obama's nomination of Garland violates Michel's rights as a voter under the provision of the Constitution that provides for popular election of senators. Lower courts had previously dismissed Michel's case. He filed his suit in the summer, well before the election of Donald Trump seemingly doomed Garland's nomination. Meanwhile, Garland soon will resume hearing cases on the federal appeals court in Washington, where he serves as chief judge. Garland is set to hear arguments in cases before the appeals court on Jan. 18, according to a calendar posted by the court online. He has not taken part in cases since Obama nominated him in March. 0 Shares ",

Russia has provided support for Syrian troops that bombarded rebel-held sections of Aleppo for months, creating a humanitarian crisis in the war-torn city. Both nations in recent days have worked on a plan to allow for evacuation of rebel neighborhoods. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said\u00a0Alt\u0131nta\u015f had spent more than two years with a\u00a0riot police unit in \u00a0Ankara, the Turkish capital. Chilling photographs from the scene show\u00a0Karlov\u00a0lying on the ground while the gunman \u2014\u00a0dressed in a suit,\u00a0gun drawn \u2014 stands over him. Moments later the killer was fatally shot by Turkish special forces. \"We are currently in\u00a0contact with\u00a0Turkish authorities who are assuring us that a thorough, comprehensive investigation will be conducted.\" Zakharova said. Karlov, 62, was a longtime diplomat dating back to Soviet days. He began his career in\u00a01976, and spent most of the next quarter-century representing his country\u00a0in North Korea or South Korea. He was appointed ambassador to Turkey in 2013. The White House and State Department condemned the attack and extended thoughts and prayers to Karlov's family, the Russian government and the Russian people. \"This heinous attack on a member of the diplomatic corps is unacceptable, and we stand united with Russia and Turkey in our determination to confront terrorism in all of its forms,\"\u00a0National Security Council spokesman\u00a0Ned Price said in a statement. Secretary of State John Kerry offered U.S. assistance to Russia and Turkey \"as\u00a0they investigate this despicable attack, which was also an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said the killing was a \u201cprovocation aimed at derailing Russia-Turkey ties and the peace process in Syria.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan echoed Putin's comment, adding, \"Both the Russian and Turkish administrations have the determination not to fall for this provocation.\u201d Both leaders said Russian investigators will be part of the official probe into the assassination. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also extended condolences, adding there was \"no justification for such a heinous act.\" 8879 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 207 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i7lmZQ NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "At least 12 dead, 48 injured after truck plows into Berlin Christmas market in apparent terror attack Published               December 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injured 48 others in what witnesses described as a deliberate attack. German authorities said they are still investigating whether the crash was an accident, but a statement from the White House National Security Council (NSC) said the incident \"appears to have been a terrorist attack.\" The large Scania truck with a Polish license plate crashed into the market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.\u00a0The truck came to a halt on a sidewalk on one side of the market, shortly after ramming a large stand called \"Fascination Christmas,\" ripping off one side and knocking down a large Christmas tree. The three-meter tree lay in the street, red and gold ornamental balls still attached to its limbs and a golden star at the top. Police said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested about 1 1/2 miles away, near Berlin's Victory Column monument. A passenger in the truck died at the scene as paramedics were attending to him. Authorities initially estimated that 50 people were injured. Police later revised the total to 48, while Berlin's fire brigade said others were \"more mentally injured.\" Related Image Expand / Contract Police stand beside a damaged truck which ran into crowded Christmas market in Berliin Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24.\u00a0Zurawski added that the truck had been loaded with steel structures weighing 25 tons. Die Welt newspaper reported that the arrested suspect is a Pakistani known to police for minor criminal offenses, but not terrorism. The newspaper also reported that the dead passenger was a Polish national. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the incident had a chilling echo of the July 14 truck attack in Nice, France that killed 86 people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the Nice attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. ISIS and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack public places. Mike Fox, a tourist from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press at the scene in Berlin that the large truck missed him by about three yards as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and wooden stands. \"It was definitely deliberate,\" Fox said. Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Dozens of ambulances lined the streets waiting to evacuate people, and heavily armed police patrolled the area. Police on Twitter urged people to stay away from the area, saying they needed to keep the streets clear for the rescue vehicles. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. But Berlin's top security official, state interior minister Andreas Geisel, told RBB television that it was too early to say whether it was an attack, and called reports that the truck may have been hijacked \"pure speculation.\" Even so, some politicians were pointing fingers. Marcus Pretzell, a prominent member of the anti-migration Alternative for Germany party, lashed out at the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying on Twitter: \"When will the German state of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel's dead! (hash)Nice (hash)Berlin.\" U.S. President-elect Donald Trump issued a statement calling the attack \"horrifying.\" \"Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,\" Trump said. \"ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.\" Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach. Both attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. Monday's incident comes less than a month after the State Department warned U.S. citizens to be cautious in markets and other public places, saying extremist groups were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\" In a statement, State Department spokesman John Kirby condemned the \"horrendous events\" at the Christmas market.\u00a0 NSC spokesman Ned Price said the United States has already been in contact with German officials and stands ready to assist in the investigation and response. Law enforcement sources tell Fox News that the FBI's Legal Attache (LEGAT) office in Berlin had been in touch with German officials to offer intelligence support to investigators. The sources said late Monday that no Americans had been identified among the victims. Zurich police search for gunman after shooting at mosque; at least 3 injured Last week, German prosecutors said a\u00a012-year-old boy attempted to set off a nail bomb at a Christmas market in the southern city of Ludwigshafen. The German-born son of Iraqi parents is alleged to have tried to set off the device at the Christmas market on Nov. 26, and again outside city hall on Dec. 5, Focus magazine reported, citing security sources. In the second failed attempt, a passer-by spotted the backpack containing the device and reported it to authorities. Inside they found a glass jar packed with firecrackers with nails taped to it, Focus reported. Police said it would have burned but would not have exploded.

The SDA news agency reported that the victims were adults who were outside near an Islamic center. Police said is unclear whether the attack had to do anything with the location.

Baca is charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and his wife, Carol Chiang, arrive at the federal courthouse in downtown Los Angeles earlier this month for his trial. Baca is charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Joel Rubin and Victoria Kim Contact Reporters Lee Baca spent 15 years as sheriff of Los Angeles County\u00a0building a reputation as\u00a0an ethical\u00a0and transparent leader with creative, progressive ideas on law enforcement. A\u00a0federal prosecutor Monday needed only about 90 minutes to dismantle that glowing portrait of Baca\u00a0and replace it with a far more sinister portrayal as the former sheriff\u2019s obstruction of justice trial came to a close. Assistant U.S. Atty. Brandon Fox delivered an unsparing closing argument to jurors, recapping nearly two weeks of testimony and evidence that he said prove Baca willfully participated in a 2011 plan to interfere with an FBI probe into widespread inmate abuse\u00a0by deputies in county jails. Fox presented Baca as a petty, territorial figure who \u201cgave lip service\u201d to repeated warnings about his jails and then grew furious when he learned federal agents had launched a secret\u00a0investigation into the lockup facilities. Baca\u2019s mindset, Fox said, was to \u201cforget about the abused inmates, forget about the dirty deputies. Mr. Baca wanted to ensure\u00a0that no outside law enforcement agency was going to police his jails.\u201d Nathan Hochmann, Baca\u2019s lead attorney,\u00a0followed Fox with his own closing argument.\u00a0In it, Hochmann revisited the\u00a0thrust\u00a0of the defense\u2019s case: That while Baca was upset federal officials had kept him in the dark about their investigation, he did not cross any legal lines and\u00a0was unaware his trusted\u00a0second in command, former Undersheriff Paul Tanaka , was leading a group of deputies to subvert the federal probe. \"The mere fact that Sheriff Baca was sheriff \u2026 does not make him criminally responsible for what went on down below,\u201d Hochmann said. The claim of ignorance was attempted before by Tanaka, who was tried earlier this year on the same charges Baca now faces. His claim that he had been oblivious while Baca managed the obstruction plan on his own failed as Tanaka was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. He is appealing the conviction. Hochmann likened the FBI and Sheriff\u2019s Department to\u00a0two brothers who were \u201cinvolved in a pushing and shoving match in a sand box.\u201d \u201cThe government calls that six weeks in the sand box obstruction,\" he said. Lee Baca , a powerful and celebrated law enforcement figure, block\u00a0the FBI from investigating abuse and violence in\u00a0county jails when he was sheriff? Answering that\u00a0question will... The question at the heart of the\u00a0most significant public corruption trial to hit Los Angeles in decades is clear: Did Lee Baca , a powerful and celebrated law enforcement figure, block\u00a0the FBI from investigating abuse and violence in\u00a0county jails when he was sheriff? Answering that\u00a0question will... (Joel Rubin and Victoria Kim) Following the attorneys\u2019 last words, jurors will deliberate on Baca\u2019s fate. A guilty verdict on the two felony charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy would almost certainly send Baca, who is 74 and in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, to federal prison for several years. An acquittal would\u00a0rehabilitate Baca\u2019s legacy somewhat, although he faces another trial on an outstanding charge that\u00a0he lied to federal officials about his awareness of the obstruction plan \u2014\u00a0also a felony. Along with Tanaka,\u00a0eight others from the department\u2019s middle and lower ranks have been convicted or pleaded guilty to participating in the obstruction. Over six weeks in August and September 2011, after Baca learned of the FBI\u2019s investigation, prosecutors allege\u00a0the sheriff\u2019s officials\u00a0kept\u00a0an inmate who was working as an FBI informant hidden from agents, pressured\u00a0deputies and the informant not to cooperate with the investigation and tried to intimidate\u00a0the lead agent in the case by threatening her with arrest. Baca, who stepped down as sheriff in 2014 as the scandal engulfed the department, remained expressionless as he\u00a0listened to the attorneys work to sway jurors with their widely divergent explanations of Baca\u2019s role in the\u00a0events. As he did during the trial, Fox relied heavily in his closing remarks on phone records and Baca\u2019s work calendar to show\u00a0Baca was present for meetings when the plan to derail the FBI investigation was hatched and then remained in close contact with Tanaka as it unfolded.\u00a0 During the trial, Hochmann had tried to downplay the records, emphasizing Baca could have been discussing any number of issues he dealt with as the head of the department\u2019s\u00a0sprawling\u00a0operation.

Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong, right, interviewed Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently on Armstrong's podcast. (Chicago Tribune, Getty-AFP photos) Hands up if you had disgraced cycling cheat Lance Armstrong down as the man to secure a profoundly odd 50-minute year-end interview with Mayor Rahm Emanuel . Anyone? No? But an encounter between the two alpha males on Armstrong's podcast, released Monday, was not without intrigue, or humor \u2014 some of it intentional. Armstrong told the mayor his brother Ari is an \"a------.\" And not to be outdone in a measurement of manhood, Emanuel called legendary hard man Armstrong a \"wuss.\" The prickly exchanges between the two sometime-triathletes simmered with pent-up machismo but generated a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, including one in which Armstrong revealed the time that Ari Emanuel had dropped a truth bomb on him. Armstrong and Hollywood mega-agent Ari Emanuel spoke on the phone after Armstrong's long years of cheating were finally revealed, Armstrong said, when Ari told him, \"You know what Lance, you know what the biggest problem is here? Everyone thinks you're an a------.\" The offended Texan complained to the mayor, whom he called \"Rahmbo,\" \"Let's just be honest, a lot of people think your brother is an a------.\" \"Including family members!\" Rahm Emanuel acknowledged. Sadly, the podcast's audio format did not record the look on Mayor Rahmbo's face when Armstrong earnestly informed him that he \"wouldn't want to be\" Chicago mayor. But Emanuel showed admirable restraint when Armstrong later went on an extended rant, accusing former President Bill Clinton of cheating at golf. Rather than make the obvious point that lectures about cheating in sports are a subject upon which Armstrong might be wise to remain silent, he instead chided Armstrong for failing to call Clinton out. \"You know what? You're a wuss,\" Emanuel said. Clinton's team didn't immediately respond. ",

(Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential electors in all 50 states are meeting Monday to officially cast their votes for Donald Trump as GOP electors are under intense pressure to oppose him. Electors in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania\u00a0voted during the morning and early afternoon and parceled out their state's votes with no rogue electors. Trump won Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Democrat Hillary Clinton carried Illinois and New Hampshire. \u00a0 Despite a last-minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there\u2019s little indication of a significant rebellion. The meetings, which occur\u00a0more than a month after the Nov. 8 election, is typically a formality. This year, the nation\u2019s 538 electors are in the spotlight as Trump critics mount a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. 6, although the results from each state have been released throughout the day Monday. Read more: GOP electors targeted with $500K ad buy in final anti-Trump push Electors have received thousands of emails and phone calls\u00a0arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nation\u2019s history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls. Thousands of protesters have gathered outside state capitols throughout the country. \"Many Republican electors have told me they're open to sending the vote for President to the U.S. House of Representatives, which has happened twice in our nation's history,\u201d said Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who is not voting for Trump . \u201cFrankly, at this point, I'm wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary,\" he said. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican-led committees or as an independent probe. \u00a0 Yet, so far, Suprun is the only Republican to publicly say he\u2019ll vote against Trump. Opponents would need 37 GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov.\u00a0John Kasich, has told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would kick to the Republican-led House of Representatives, which is unlikely to override their own party\u2019s president. Further, the\u00a0Republican National Committee\u00a0has been conducting a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump. Clinton won more than 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump got 306 of the 538 electoral votes \u2014 the state-by-state system created by the nation's founders based on the size of a state\u2019s congressional delegation. Read more: A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote It\u2019s the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gore\u2019s loss in 2000 to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadn\u2019t been since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote. The coalition of outside groups, calling themselves the Hamilton Electors, ran $500,000 in television ads over the weekend featuring actors\u00a0including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing quoting from the Federalist Papers about the need for electors to exercise their conscience in casting their votes. Yet a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows 46% of voters say electors should be bound to vote for the candidate that won their state, to 34% who think electors shouldn\u2019t be bound if they have significant concerns about the winner. Trump himself took to Twitter on Sunday night to express his frustration, saying his supporters would be \u201cscorned and called terrible names\u201d if the situation was reversed. If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2016 The polls also show how significantly false information has spread as Trump recently declared that he won in \u201ca massive landslide victory.\u201d Half of Republicans think Trump won the popular vote, according to recent survey of 1,011 Americans conducted by Qualtrics. Trump lost the popular vote by a by a wider margin than any president in modern history .\u00a0Among Republicans without college education, the share was 60%. Posted!

    "text": "McCain Sees Russia Hacking as Threat, at Odds With Trump By laurie kellman, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 19, 2016, 3:39 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Senators Call for Investigation Into Russian Hacking Allegations 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is the business titan who has spoken appreciatively of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Republican Sen. John McCain is the tough-talking national security hawk who warns that Russian interference in the U.S. election threatens to \"destroy democracy.\" McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, on Sunday joined Democrats in calling for a special select committee to investigate foreign cyberattacks, putting him at odds not only with the incoming GOP president but with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who favors allowing the Intelligence committee to take the lead on the inquiry. \"We need a select committee. We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election,\" McCain said. \"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we have been totally paralyzed.\" Trump calls reports of Russian hacking \"ridiculous\" and his transition team dismissed the CIA assessment, saying it was the work of the same people who claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. CIA Director John Brennan has said the intelligence community is in agreement that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, though there's no evidence Moscow succeeded in helping Trump win. But the charge, along with Trump's selection of a potential secretary of state with business ties to Russia, has divided a GOP riven by a fierce presidential primary and Trump's refusal to single out Moscow for criticism. The fractures within the Republican Party will test longstanding GOP orthodoxy that saw Russia as a threat and responded to Putin's annexation of Crimea with tough sanctions. \"I think reality is going to intercede at one point or another,\" McCain said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" on the eve of the Electoral College vote expected to formalize Trump's victory. Trump, McCain suggested, \"will very quickly understand what the Russians are all about.\" The Twitter-loving Trump did not immediately respond to McCain's remarks. But the president-elect's incoming chief of staff refused Sunday to say that the president-elect trusts the CIA's conclusion that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee in a bid to help the real estate mogul defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton . \"They haven't been totally up front and transparent in their opinion as to who, what, where and how this all happened,\" Reince Priebus said of the intelligence community on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina said Friday that his Intelligence panel \"will follow the intelligence wherever it leads.\" McCain at Armed Services and Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of Foreign Relations, also plan inquiries. McCain joined Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed in pressing for a select committee in a letter released Sunday. An aide to McConnell said he would review the letter. McCain and Trump have clashed throughout the campaign. Trump bashed McCain as a \"loser\" and \"not a war hero\" because he was shot down and captured during the Vietnam War. McCain criticized Trump for making disparaging remarks about NATO, immigrants, Muslims and a \"Gold Star\" family that lost a son in Iraq \u2014 and for refusing to say he'd accept the presidential election results unless he won. McCain dropped his tepid support for his party's nominee in October over the release of a recording in which Trump boasts about assaulting women. President Barack Obama has ordered a full review of any Russian involvement before he leaves office next month. While Trump's choice of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state has drawn concern among some Republicans, he is expected to win confirmation despite ties to Russia. 0 Shares ",

Taraji P. Henson stars as a woman who faces racial and gender inequality at 1960s NASA in 'Hidden Figures.' (Photo: Hopper Stone) ATLANTA \u2014\u00a0The three talented mathematicians at the heart of the historical drama Hidden Figures helped take America\u00a0into space. Their carpool cruise home in a 1957 Chevrolet after work, however, was their time to vent about not going anywhere in their jobs. Filming a scene for the movie (in theaters Christmas Day in 14 cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and Washington; expands\u00a0nationwide Jan. 6) in an old ice cream warehouse on a warm April day, Taraji P. Henson is\u00a0seated in the back as Katherine G. Johnson, the woman whose calculations would ultimately help John Glenn orbit Earth. Yet Katherine\u2019s first day working with NASA scientists in 1961 hasn\u2019t gone so well. Michelle Obama: 'Skin color, gender, is the most ridiculous defining trait' Her colleagues are similarly irked: Octavia Spencer\u2019s Dorothy Vaughan is angry that she leads the \u201ccolored computers\u201d \u2014\u00a0a group of black women crunching numbers every day \u2014 but doesn't get a supervisor's pay, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s Mary Jackson isn\u2019t having any luck in her dream of becoming an engineer. \u201cTruth be told, Dorothy, I don\u2019t even know if I can keep up in that room,\u201d Henson says, giving Katherine\u2019s tone a worrisome edge. \u201cI\u2019ll be back with the computers within the week or out of a job entirely.\u201d \u201cOh, please,\u201d Spencer responds. \u201cYou\u2019re better with the numbers than anyone in that room, Katherine, and you know it. Just make that pencil move as fast as your mind does, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Taraji P. Henson (from left), Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer share a car on the Atlanta set of 'Hidden Figures.' \u00a0(Photo: Hopper Stone) That mind would be key to America staying competitive with the Russians in the 1960s space race, though Hidden Figures (based on the Margot Lee Shetterly book) explores the\u00a0obstacles facing the country as well as the three main characters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not only racial but also gender inequality, involving white men in a workplace who didn\u2019t know what to make of a black woman being the smartest person in the room. The movie pairs a strong female-empowerment message with heady themes and feel-good vibes. \u201cIt just says that when we stick together, we can change the world,\u201d says Mon\u00e1e, a Grammy-winning musician whose first Hollywood audition was for Hidden Figures. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just because of Katherine or Mary or Dorothy, it was because they all stuck together. They leaned on each other\u2019s shoulders, they cried, they laughed, they loved, they encouraged each other. It\u2019s because (Katherine) had her sisters there to encourage her that history was made.\u201d Taraji P. Henson has the best advice for conquering sexism and racism in Hollywood The\u00a0work has proven fruitful.\u00a0Hidden Figures\u00a0was nominated for three Critics\u2019 Choice Awards \u2014 including best picture and best supporting actress for Mon\u00e1e \u2014 and Spencer is up for\u00a0supporting actress at both the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild ceremonies. The movie also snagged a SAG best cast nomination. With its roots in the civil rights movement,\u00a0Hidden Figures\u00a0\u201creminds us how far we\u2019ve come and respecting each other no matter what we look like, the color of our skin or where we come from,\u201d says Erik Davis,\u00a0managing editor for Fandango.com and Movies.com. He adds that the film could be a strong Oscar contender\u00a0in February: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the year\u2019s best crowd-pleasers, and it\u2019s the crowd-pleasers that typically win best picture.\u201d Kevin Costner stars as NASA head honcho Al Harrison, who becomes a champion of Katherine Johnson's work. \u00a0(Photo: Hopper Stone) As the movie starts out, things aren't peachy keen for the core trio. A West Virginia native who graduated high school at 14 and college by 18, Katherine is assigned to a group at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The outfit is\u00a0led by NASA head honcho Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), who wants Katherine to look \u201cbeyond the math\u201d to help figure out how to get Glenn (Glen Powell) to space and back safely. But she\u2019s looked down upon by other men and has to run to the other side of the campus just to use the colored restrooms. \u201cThey\u2019re engineers and they\u2019re scientists, but they allowed some of that (prejudice) to creep over, and the net effect was the cream wasn\u2019t necessarily rising to the top,\u201d Costner says. \u201cHuman nature has pettiness and insecurity in it, and that crosses all racial boundaries.\u201d Meanwhile, Mary is a bright young woman who specializes in aircraft data and wind-tunnel experiments and wants to become the first female engineer at NASA of any race, though she has to petition the court system to win the right to take classes at an all-white school. And Dorothy, a former math teacher, is stonewalled by her boss (Kirsten Dunst) when it comes to getting properly paid for the work she does, all while NASA is installing a huge IBM computer that threatens to make Dorothy and her charges obsolete. Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) and Mary (Janelle Monae) are math geniuses looking to advance in their NASA careers. \u00a0(Photo: Hopper Stone) The women are there for one another on the job and in their personal lives, and it mirrored the chemistry the trio of actresses found with each other. \u201cWhen we come together, you see all our superpowers working seamlessly together,\u201d Mon\u00e1e says. \u201cAnd we have a real sisterhood.\u201d Adds Powell: \u201cThe tone of the set comes from the top of the call sheet, and those three women, there\u2019s no ego there.\u201d Holiday film preview: 10 must-see movies In the car scene, Mary \u2014 who can be saucy when speaking her mind \u2014\u00a0gets a little too comfortable for her co-worker, and Dorothy takes a moment from driving to smack her passenger\u2019s legs. \u201cHave some respect. Get your damn feet off my dashboard! This isn\u2019t your living room.\u201d After the camera stops, the actresses keep going, riffing on their dialogue and having fun with their characters. \u201cHow do I make them\u00a0give me more money?\u201d Spencer says. Henson allows a moment of silence before responding, \u201cSet it off!\u201d Everyone cackles with delight. 'Hidden Figures' stars Octavia Spencer (from left), Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monae attend a screening hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \u00a0(Photo: Kris Connor, Getty Images for the Academy) It\u2019s akin to something Henson\u2019s over-the-top Cookie Lyon might say on Fox's TV hit Empire, yet it shows what kind of \u201clittle chameleon\u201d she is, Spencer says. \u201cCookie is this brazen, brash woman who\u2019s street-smart and tough, and Katherine is the opposite: very quiet, very reserved, very cultured, very educated, a little bit shy. We get to see Taraji in a way we don\u2019t normally see her, and she does it effortlessly.\u201d Spencer figures Mon\u00e1e is like \u201cif Lena Horne and Diahann Carroll had a daughter,\u201d and she brings a definite spark to Mary, \u201ca mathematician on fire.\u201d And for Dorothy, Spencer wanted to give her character a motherly approach\u00a0with\u00a0her friends and children and an authoritative side at work. \u201cShe\u2019s a no-guff lady,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to come in and give you warm hugs and cookies.\u201d Pharrell's 'Hidden Figures' track 'Runnin' is finally here Good food was a key to the stars\u00a0finding a bond, first in rehearsals a week before production began and later at potluck dinners. One of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s favorite nights was Henson making a meal of turkey meatloaf and wine for the bunch. It was a natural thing for Henson. \u201cI can get along with a rock,\u201d she says with a laugh. But their friendship was never forced:\u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018OK, ladies, we have to come together and hang out so we can jell on set.\u2019 \u201cGoing out to dinner with someone you have no chemistry with, what is that going to do? You\u2019re just going to be out for an awkward dinner.\u201d Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) learns the ins and outs of NASA's new IBM computer. \u00a0(Photo: Hopper Stone) The friendship between the real women got them through the issues of the day, and co-writer and director Theodore Melfi believes\u00a0most of the themes in Hidden Figures are still a part of our world and have even been magnified decades later. Equal pay and equal rights for women are ongoing fights, he says, and black Americans continue to struggle for justice in the workplace and beyond. \u201cWe seem to be in another Cold War with Russia all of a sudden, which is remarkable to me how that happened, and we\u2019re in a Cold War with ISIS and in a constant state of battling forces we can\u2019t understand or predict,\u201d the director says. \"This movie for me is all about that.\u201d Making this kind of film is why Powell got in the business, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re in this time of division right now where it doesn\u2019t really feel like the United States of America. ... \u00a0And this is a movie about people coming together to accomplish something that seemed impossible and doing it in the name of freedom and togetherness. Astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) prepares for the mission that will make him a household name. \u00a0(Photo: Hopper Stone) \u201cThe basic premise of math is about efficiency,\u201d Powell adds.\u00a0\u201cAnd when you\u2019ve got racism, sexism and bigotry, that\u2019s just standing in the way of efficiency in our own progress. This is a movie that just says:\u00a0\u2018Hey, why are we making this harder than it has to be? We can be united and wonderful and love each other.\u2019 \u201d Powell sees a lot of chatter about women\u2019s equality and \u201cthe glass ceiling,\u201d yet what Hidden Figures does well is having men supporting women in all facets. Costner\u2019s character is a champion for Katherine, and so is Powell's astronaut Glenn. Powell says one scene comes straight from the real Johnson\u2019s memories: Glenn (who died Dec. 8 at age 95) broke from the pack, much to the chagrin of some, during training in Langley in 1961 to chat with Katherine and her colleagues. In a scene filmed at an Atlanta middle school, where the halls and rooms were turned into the inner workings of a 1960s NASA complex for Hidden Figures, Glenn gets a call from Al right before the 1962 launch of Friendship 7 at Cape Canaveral. The landing coordinates spit out by the high-tech IBM seem off, which makes Glenn feel a little iffy about the mission that will become his historic three orbits of Earth. ",

Syria's United Nations Ambassador Bashar Jaffari is confident the small, rebel held enclave of Aleppo will be \"clean\" by Tuesday. But the evacuation begins an uncertain future for both civilians and rebel fighters. A Syrian woman holding a child who were  evacuated from the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo during the ceasefire arrive at a refugee camp in Rashidin, near Idlib, Syria, early Monday. AP The rebels have been allowed to leave with small arms, to fight another day. But almost all of them \u2014 the exact number, while in the thousands, isn't known \u2014 will go to the province of Idlib. If Aleppo is secured, which seems all but certain, the rebel-held region is one of the top targets for President Bashar Assad's forces and Russian air power. For the tens of thousands of civilians who've chosen to go there, it represents a journey from frying pan to fire. The 47 children of eastern Aleppo's orphanage \u2014 along with 7-year-old Bana al-Abed who chronicled on Twitter the suffering of her city and her own fears of dying in a bombing \u2014 may soon find themselves in the crosshairs again.

(Photo: National Geographic) In 1985, an Afghan girl with piercing green eyes stared into the world\u2019s soul from the cover of National Geographic in an iconic and mesmerizing photo. Thirty-one years later, another young girl peers out from the magazine\u2019s glossy front in an equally compelling portrait. A girl with tangles of pink-streaked hair, comfy pink leggings and a resolute gaze \u2014\u00a0a girl who until 2012 lived as a boy. Meet Avery Jackson, 9, the first transgender individual to grace the cover of the 128-year-old magazine, which\u00a0is rolling out to subscribers this week in a special edition devoted solely to gender issues around the globe. Avery never intended to be a trailblazer for gender identity, a topic that is front and center in a rapid-fire evolution of how people define themselves. Growing up, \"I really just wanted to be myself,\" Avery told\u00a0USA TODAY. \"I'm just a girl.\" But the Kansas City fourth-grader knows the significance\u00a0of the magazine's cover. \"By putting myself more out there,\u00a0people will be able to know that\u00a0I am transgender and proud and learn\u00a0more about transgender issues.\" From the Supreme Court to statehouses, fashion pages to Facebook, the question of \u201cwho we are\u201d is complicated and fluid,\u00a0and never more relevant. That is why National Geographic decided to devote its\u00a0January issue to the \u201cgender revolution,\u201d said\u00a0Susan Goldberg, the magazine's editor in chief. \"It seems that the discussion about gender is really at the center of our national conversation.\u00a0It is playing out in\u00a0our education system, legal system, the military. Everywhere you look there is this conversation.\" What started out as a story about girl empowerment\u00a0a year ago soon took flight in a deeper direction. \"Editors said it's really complicated to be a boy, too,\" Goldberg said. The magazine decided to examine\u00a0all facets of gender through culture, society and science\u00a0and \"humanize\" the stories of everyday people, she said. Exploring a gender revolution: Susan Goldberg The choice of a petite pioneer for the cover seemed natural, Goldberg added. \"We thought Avery was so strong,\u00a0so proud ...\u00a0and confident about her decisions that she was a good person to symbolize the new discussions about gender. She seems to sum up the complexity of the issue.\u00a0\" AVERY\u2019S STORY Avery's mother, Debi Jackson, 42, said\u00a0her child went from being a \"happy, outgoing 2-year-old boy to becoming sullen and depressed\" between the ages of 3 and 4. Avery\u00a0became angry and withdrawn and hated going to preschool, Jackson said. \"She started talking about death a lot.\" When Avery dressed up in a princess dress,\u00a0the darkness\u00a0lifted, said\u00a0Jackson who also has a son Anson, 11, with husband\u00a0Tom, 41. The couple\u00a0thought their child was a gay boy and \"it would be OK.\" One day when they were walking through Target on a holiday shopping trip, Jackson said Avery turned to her and said:\u00a0\"You call me a boy, you think I\u2019m a boy, but you know I\u2019m a girl on the inside,\u00a0right?\" What followed were pediatrician visits, sessions with a genetic therapist and the decision to let Avery\u00a0dress\u00a0as a girl on the weekends. And then came another pivotal moment, Jackson said. Avery was going to a birthday party on a Sunday afternoon and her mom asked her to put on\u00a0boy clothes for a few hours. \"No,\" Avery\u00a0said. \"I don't want to pretend to be a boy.\" Avery dressed as a girl and none of her friends \"batted an eye,\" Jackson said. On Monday morning, she dressed for school \"in pink head to toe,\" Jackson said. \"And she was excited about going to school for the first time in months.\" BEYOND TRANSGENDER The January special edition, which includes a glossary of more than 20 terms redefining gender, is landing at a time when the political landscape is shifting and some fear a rollback in rights. Jackson, who calls her home-schooled daughter \"smart, fearless and a natural entertainer,\" was hit by the enormity of the magazine cover photo and how confident and secure Avery seemed. Yet\u00a0there already has been a backlash in conservative circles, she acknowledged. \"We still have a chance to change hearts and minds,\" \u00a0said\u00a0Jackson, who has become an advocate for transgender rights. \"We are just trying to put a face to a word that people don\u2019t understand.\" The January 2017 cover of National Geographic that hits newsstands on Dec. 27, 2016,  features 15 individuals with various gender identities. \u00a0(Photo: National Geographic) Georgiann Davis, 36, \u00a0also has powerful insight into gender identity, one delivered in a gut-kicking\u00a0revelation. Davis, whose story is told\u00a0in the magazine, was born with an intersex trait known as CAIS (complete androgyn insensitivity syndrome) that wasn\u2019t identified until her adolescence. She was born with a vagina, internal and undescended testes and XY chromosomes. At 13, she was blissfully playing outside when she felt abdominal pains. A trip to the doctor didn\u2019t reveal\u00a0anything wrong. Except that she had testes, not ovaries. Her parents and doctors decided to keep Davis in the dark and concoct a cover story: \u201cThey told me I had early onset cancer of ovaries and would need surgery before I turned 18,\u201d she said. The \u201ccancer\u201d surgery at 17 \u2014\u00a0which forced Davis into early menopause as a teen \u2014\u00a0really removed her testes. It wasn\u2019t until Davis was stepping into adulthood in her 20s and looking for a new physician that reality came crashing down in the form of her medical records. \u201cI expected to read about cancer. But I held them up to the light on a really bright day in Chicago and saw the words 'testicular feminization syndrome,'\u201d Davis said. \u201cI felt like a freak at that moment.\u00a0I was just so confused. ...\u00a0I was lied to.\u201d Davis, who initially threw her records out, said\u00a0it took about seven more years for her to share her story and feel comfortable as someone who is intersex,\u00a0a term used for those who have a combination of male and female sex traits. \u201cThe experience of intersex individuals makes it so clear that gender identity is biological,\u201d endocrinologist Josh Safer said. It is a \u201cmassive mistake that gender identity can be manipulated.\u201d GENDER AND THE FUTURE The medical community is \u201cevolving\u201d on gender issues, said\u00a0Safer, who is medical director of a transgender center at Boston Medical Center. But he still sees \u201ca void in medical knowledge\u201d about the transgender population. If more trans children can be identified at an early age, the use of puberty blockers then hormone therapy can carve a comfortable and safe path as they develop, he said. \u201cRecognition there is a need to be respectful of people with all their differences is not sufficient,\u201d Safer said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to get medical doctors to start prescribing hormones because they know about what pronouns to use.\u201d ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Dec 19, 2016 6:37 AM EST Bana Alabed, the young Syrian girl who has become an internationally recognized symbol of civilians\u2019 suffering in her country\u2019s ruthless civil war \u00a0through a Twitter account run by her mother, has made it out of eastern Aleppo along with other children evacuated by international aid groups. According to the president of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a Washington D.C.-based non-profit organization, Alabed arrived to the countryside west of Aleppo on Monday with \u201cmany\u201d other children from the former opposition enclave of eastern Aleppo, where thousands of rebels and civilians are still believed to be awaiting evacuation. The mass evacuation of civilians was resumed Monday morning after a tumultuous weekend, with a fragile cease-fire appearing to hold. Dr. Ahmad Tarakji, the head of SAMS, tweeted a photo of Bana Alabed in the arms of a medical worker Monday morning. Other Syrian activists and aid workers on the ground tweeted similar photos with the little girl, who appeared to be in relatively good health. Later Monday the Associated Press released video showing Bana and her mother Fatemah together at the site run by aid agencies. . @AlabedBana and many children arrived to #Aleppo countryside. @sams_usa @UOSSM and partners arr coordinating the response plan there. pic.twitter.com/k3iAohYbFY \u2014 Ahmad Tarakji, MD (@tarakjiahmad) December 19, 2016 Fatemah Alabed\u2019s media background gave her the prowess to capture attention and widespread sympathy via Twitter for her and her daughter throughout their ordeal, as their neighborhood was bombed for weeks by Russian-backed Syrian government forces. The last tweet on the mother and daughter\u2019s account was from Sunday morning, in which Fatemah begged Turkish leaders to \u201cmake this ceasefire work and get us out now.\u201d \u201cMe and Bana want to tell all the world how much kids and all people in east Aleppo, how much they are suffering,\u201d Fatemah told the activist Qasioun News Agency in the video acquired by the AP. \u201cThere is no life there.\u201d \u201cWe created our Twitter to tell all the world what is happening there. We are happy because our voice reached all the world. We are free,\u201d the mother said, adding that while she was happy to be out with her daughter, she was sad as she has now, like an estimated 2 million other Syrians, on the verge of becoming a refugee. \u201cI left my soul there... We can\u2019t stay there because there is a lot of bombs and no clean water, no medicine. They even targeted hospitals and schools. When we get out, we had a lot of suffering, because we stayed almost 24 hours in bus without water and food and anything. We stayed like prisoners, a hostage. Finally, we arrived here and we thank God and we thank all our friends who have supported us.\u201d \u00a0 Dear @MevlutCavusoglu & @rt_erdogan please please please make this ceasefire work & get us out now. We are so tired. - Fatemah #Aleppo \u2014 Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) December 18, 2016 Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s regime has dismissed the mother and daughter as pawns and propagandists for the opposition forces in the country, all of which the regime describes as \u201cterrorists,\u201d including the moderate rebel groups that have received backing from the U.S. and its allies. The photos and videos posted by Fatemah of her daughter revealed the horror of life in eastern Aleppo, under constant bombardment and with little to no humanitarian aid getting into the area since Assad\u2019s offensive to retake the city began in earnest more than a month ago. By Friday last week, tense cease-fires had given cover for an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 civilians and rebel fighters to be evacuated from eastern Aleppo, crammed into any vehicle that moved, with no choice but to start again in unknown territory. Those holed up in eastern Aleppo were given a choice under the evacuation deal brokered last week; board buses bound either for government territory, or other rebel enclaves to the west of Aleppo. There have been reports that dozens of men who boarded those buses previously have since disappeared without a trace. ",

By Ed O'Keefe December 19 at 5:36 PM Follow @edatpost Donald Trump clinched the presidency Monday as members of the electoral college cast ballots declaring him the victor, a perfunctory conclusion to the most stunning presidential contest in modern history. Trump became the winner Monday afternoon after electors from Texas cast ballots and put him over the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Results will be officially announced Jan. 6 in a special joint session of Congress. While Democrat Hillary Clinton amassed a nearly 3 million-vote lead in the popular vote, Trump won the state-by-state electoral map, making him president-elect. That political dichotomy sparked special scrutiny and intense lobbying of electors by Trump\u2019s opponents in recent weeks, including mass protests. It also drew outsize attention to the usually overlooked, constitutionally obligated gatherings of 538 electors in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The mostly symbolic calls for an electoral college rejection of Trump grew after revelations of a CIA assessment that Russian hacking could have boosted his campaign, which in the view of many Trump critics raised doubts about his legitimacy. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Trump has dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s analysis of Russia\u2019s role in the election and has boasted , including on Monday, of a \u201chistoric\u201d electoral landslide. But his 305-to-232 win over Clinton ranks just 46th out of 58 electoral college margins. \u201cThis election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cWith this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead.\u201d His detractors called on electors to buck the president-elect in favor of Clinton \u2014 or Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, or another Republican such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Ultimately, Kasich earned one vote from an elector in Texas. So did former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.). In Washington state, three electors cast votes for former secretary of state Colin Powell, while another voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, a member of the Sioux tribe from South Dakota who opposes the Dakota Access Pipeline. Pence earned the requisite electoral votes to serve as vice president, but in Washington state, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also earned some votes. Across the country, critics of the president-elect braved cold temperatures and rallied outside state capitol buildings in hopes that electors might act as an emergency brake on Trump. In Pennsylvania, which voted for a Republican president for the first time since 1988, a few hundred shell-shocked Democrats protested in Harrisburg while all 20 electors backed Trump. In Utah, protesters booed and shouted \u201cShame on you\u201d as the state\u2019s six electors cast votes for Trump in a capitol building conference room in Salt Lake City. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Shefte,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) In Florida, a crucial swing state where Trump defeated Clinton by about a percentage point, Trump won all 29 electoral votes. He also earned all 16 votes in Michigan, another state that flipped to Republicans for the first time since 1988. On the streets of Washington, D.C., two dozen protesters assembled outside Trump\u2019s hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, singing songs such as \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d Some held signs, including one that read, \u201cResist Putin\u2019s Puppet.\u201d The District\u2019s three electors later gathered at city hall, just a block from Trump\u2019s hotel. In Albany, N.Y., former president Bill Clinton sat in the state Senate chamber as an elector and cast one of the Empire State\u2019s 29 electoral votes for his wife. \u201cI\u2019ve never cast a vote I was prouder of,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting. [ In last-shot bid, thousands urge electoral college to block Trump at Monday vote ] Despite the pleas of Trump opponents, most electors had said for weeks that they planned to cast votes reflecting the will of their home states. \u201cAny choice was better than Hillary, so it\u2019s not a hard choice for me,\u201d Oklahoma Republican elector Charles Potts said in a recent interview. Richard Snelgrove, an elector who also serves as a Salt Lake County, Utah, council member, said he had received \u201cthousands of emails, hundreds of letters and a few phone calls \u2014 most of them respectful, a couple over the top, and a few that have been downright threatening.\u201d Most of the messages asked him to vote for Clinton on the grounds that she won the national popular vote. But Snelgrove said there was no justification for such a move. \u201cNo one elected me king, and it\u2019s my job to reflect the will of the people of Utah,\u201d he said. \u201cThey chose Trump.\u201d In Harrisburg, Ray-Ellen Kavey, 68, had driven from neighboring New York state to try to persuade Pennsylvania\u2019s electors to switch allegiance. \u201cI think the Constitution charges the electors with preventing exactly what is happening here \u2014 a hostile takeover of our government by a bigot who has been supported by Russia,\u201d Kavey said. \u201cI know nothing will come of this, but my conscience won\u2019t let me do any less.\u201d In Austin, Joni Ashbrook, 64, and her best friend, Mary Robinson, 62, stood outside the pink-granite Texas capitol, holding two ends of a banner that Ashbrook had sewed. \u201cResist Trump\u2019s Agenda,\u201d the sign read. Ashbrook, a retired fourth-grade science teacher, said that she knew the electors would probably vote for Trump but that she was troubled by Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and disregard for global warming. \u201cI\u2019d like for them to be very thoughtful about what\u2019s going on around them,\u201d Ashbrook said of the electors. \u201cBut this is just another way for us to say \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d In Maryland, all 10 of the state\u2019s electors voted for Clinton during a meeting in the Governor\u2019s Reception Room at the State House in Annapolis. Maryland law requires electors to vote for the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote, which Clinton won easily. Maggie McIntosh, a state delegate from Baltimore, choked up as she announced the results to an audience of more than 70 spectators. \u201cThis is kind of an emotional moment,\u201d McIntosh said with tears in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional moment for many women in this country and this state. Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first woman nominated by a major political party for president of the United States. She won the majority of votes here in Maryland, the electors today have chosen her as president, and she won the majority of votes in this country.\u201d The CIA\u2019s assessment of Russia\u2019s election interference prompted 10 electors \u2014 nine Democrats and one Republican \u2014 to request an intelligence briefing to learn more about Moscow\u2019s role, a move endorsed by some of Clinton\u2019s top campaign aides. Other groups had urged electors to postpone the vote until Trump explains what he plans to do about his multinational family business empire. Trump has declined to explain his plans in person but has tweeted that he will hand over day-to-day responsibilities for his company to his adult sons, who will do \u201c no new deals \u201d while he occupies the White House. Intelligence officials last week declined requests to brief electors, saying they will provide congressional briefings only when a review ordered by President Obama is completed. Electors each cast two votes, one for president and one for vice president. In every state, officials prepared a \u201ccertificate of vote\u201d to be sent to Washington for processing by Congress and the National Archives. Lawmakers are scheduled to gather Jan. 6 in the House chamber to hear the results from the states in alphabetical order during a session set to be led by Vice President Biden. It will allow lawmakers to challenge the results or the votes of individual electors. The Constitution says nothing about how electors should vote, but some states bind them to the results of the popular vote, and some state parties essentially force electors to take a loyalty pledge to serve. Just a handful of electors tested the limits this year, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether those who voted for people other than Clinton or Trump would face punishment. While much of the uncertainty headed into the day centered on how many electors would vote against Trump in the states he won, it was Clinton who saw her tally shrink further. In the state of Washington, a liberal stronghold where the Democratic nominee won the popular vote comfortably, Clinton won eight of the 12 electors. Three of the remaining four cast votes for Powell, who served in the administration of George W. Bush. And there was the vote for Faith Spotted Eagle. State Democrats had selected their electors at a lightly attended party convention packed mostly with supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the runner-up in the Democratic presidential primary race. Electors in Colorado and Minnesota also tried and failed to buck Clinton. In Maine, elector David Bright initially cast his ballot for Sanders to honor thousands of younger voters who had supported the senator. But state officials ruled that Bright\u2019s vote was improper. They ordered a revote, and Bright voted the second time for Clinton.

The study, by the Reuters news agency, found lead poisoning twice and even four times higher than what was seen in the recent contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan .\u00a0 Aisha Stafford and her husband Andrew Irby pay close attention to their 2-year-old twins Murad and Jihad.\u00a0 \u201cI was scared, really scared,\u201d Stafford said.\u00a0 In May, they were tested for lead. The results: Levels nine times what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers safe for Murad -- and four times for Jihad.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s heart-breaking to not know if your child will have learning disabilities or whatever other problems,\u201d Stafford said.\u00a0 \u201cIt hurts.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to not know if your child will have learning disabilities or whatever other problems,\u201d said Aisha Stafford. CBS Evening News Last year, nearly 2,700 children in Philadelphia were found to have harmful levels of lead in their blood -- levels that can cause irreversible brain damage, a lower IQ and lifelong learning and behavioral problems.\u00a0 The culprit -- lead paint in homes -- goes far beyond Philadelphia.  It\u2019s also a common problem in places like Baltimore, Cleveland and Milwaukee, where most inner-city housing was built before Congress banned lead paint in 1978.\u00a0 And a new Reuters analysis found 3,000 American neighborhoods where children had double the level of lead poisoning than what was found in Flint, Michigan,  where the lead-tainted water was the problem.\u00a0 Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City has studied lead in kids.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a very pervasive toxic chemical and there\u2019s absolutely no level of lead in the human body which is safe,\u201d said Landrigan.\u00a0 As for Murad and Jihad, their home is now lead-safe. The city has repainted and tested their house to make sure it\u2019s okay. \u201cThese children need help,\u201d said Stafford. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to these children to go through things like this.\u201d Murad and Jihad were tested for lead in May. The results: Levels nine times what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers safe for Murad -- and four times for Jihad.\u00a0 CBS Evening News Philadelphia came under major criticism from a local newspaper that spent months investigating the lead problem. On Monday, the mayor announced that he plans to crack down on landlords by refusing to renew their rental licenses if they cannot prove that the properties they own are certified lead-safe.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

But Obama opted not to issue a warning that specific when he spoke to Putin about the hacking during a September meeting at the G-20 summit in China, said intelligence officials offering NBC News exclusive new details. The president didn't want to inflame an already tense situation, the officials said. Instead, he used less specific language to warn Putin of consequences if Russian interference didn't stop.

This time Obama used the phrase \"armed conflict.\" \"International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace,\" said part of a message sent over the Red Phone on Oct. 31, according to a senior U.S. official. \"We will hold Russia to those standards.\" Related: Why Obama Didn't Do More About Russian Hack The so-called \"Red Phone\" system is used to communicate in moments of crisis, such as the September 11, 2001 terror attacks or the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Formally known as the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center line, it is no longer a literal phone, and instead sends email messages and attachments. The Obama administration had never used the system before, officials said. Several intelligence officials told NBC News the use of the Red Phone communicated just how serious the situation had become. \"It's a dramatic step to pick that phone up and use it,\" said Ret. Adm. James Stavridis, the former head of NATO.

Having lost a close election, however, senior Democrats don't see the White House pushback against Putin as a success. The Russians had already stolen reams of emails and used them to embarrass Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Whether those revelations swung the election can never be known, but Democrats say they played a major role in an election decided by fewer than 80,000 votes spread across three states. Related: FBI Agrees With CIA Assessment That Russia Wanted Trump to Win Donna Brazile, a Democratic party official, has said publicly that attempted cyber intrusions of Democratic Party systems continued through Election Day \u2014 and that Democrats felt abandoned by the government. A senior intelligence official told NBC News the message ultimately sent to the Russians was \"muddled\" \u2014 with no bright line laid down and no clear warning given about the consequences. The Russian response, said the official, was non-committal. \"The Ultimate Red Line\" In a statement, a senior White House official confirmed that the Red Phone was used on Oct. 31 to send a message to Moscow. \"This action was part of our ongoing, rigorous efforts to press the Russian government to halt the actions of those responsible for these cyber attacks.\" The official declined to provide details of the message, however. Obama claimed success for his message to Putin at a news conference last Friday. \"I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequence if he didn't,\" said Obama. \"In fact, we didn't see further tampering of the election process.\" Stavridis, whom Hillary Clinton considered as a potential running mate, said he believed the U.S. response to the Russian hacks \"was insufficient to achieve the objective of ensuring that we do not receive further attacks. In other words, when someone tries to bully you, you have to push back or you invite further response.\" But he also said the word \"war\" has to be deployed \"extremely carefully.\" \"I think declaring something an act of war, let's face it, is the ultimate red line.\" William M.

Got it (Nicki DeMarco,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) By David Filipov , Kareem Fahim and Liz Sly December 19 at 6:11 PM Follow @davidfilipov Follow @kfahim Follow @LizSly MOSCOW \u2014 A Turkish police officer who angrily denounced the bloodshed in Syria killed the Russian ambassador to Turkey in Ankara on Monday, shooting the diplomat in front of a room full of horrified spectators at an art gallery in an assassination captured on video and quickly shared around the world. As the ambassador, Andrei Karlov, lay on the floor, the assailant, still waving his gun, screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo! Don\u2019t forget Syria!\u201d\u00a0 The shooting was among the most brazen retaliatory attacks yet on Russia since Moscow entered the war in Syria on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, and unleashed a bombardment on Aleppo that has drawn international condemnation for what observers on the ground\u00a0have called indiscriminate attacks on civilians.\u00a0 But in Moscow, where the Kremlin has maintained that its aerial sorties and missile attacks have exclusively targeted \u201cterrorists,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry called the shooting \u201ca terrorist attack,\u201d and President Vladi\u00admir Putin called it a\u00a0\u201cprovocation aimed at rupturing ties between Russia and Turkey.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe only answer to the murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey must be the intensification of the struggle against terrorism,\u201d Putin said in nationally televised remarks.\u00a0\u201cAnd the bandits will feel it.\u201d 1 of 7 What the scene of the fatal shooting in Turkey looked like View Photos A gunman in Turkey killed Russia\u2019s ambassador at a photo exhibit. Caption A gunman in Turkey killed Russia\u2019s ambassador at a photo exhibit. \u00a0Dec. 19, 2016 Turkish police secure the area near an art gallery where Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, was fatally shot. Umit Bektas/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Putin ordered his major crime investigative unit to work with Turkish authorities, who identified the gunman as 22-year old Mevlut Mert Altintas, an officer with the riot police. In the video, Altintas, dressed incongruously in a black suit and tie, shouts out, \u201cWe are those who pledged jihad to Mohamed.\u201d Referring to Syria, he added, \u201cEvery single person who has a share in this atrocity will pay for it!\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0Several other people were wounded in the attack, which came as Karlov was speaking at the opening of an exhibit of Russian photos, but their identities were not immediately made public. [ Gallery: Scenes from Aleppo ] Altintas was killed in a shootout with police at the gallery, but Russian authorities vowed\u00a0to reveal a larger plot \u2014 and some in Moscow suggested that the West was to blame for its support of moderate rebel factions in Syria.\u00a0 Putin stopped short of that, saying only,\u00a0\u201cWe need to know who guided the hand of the murderer.\u201d The assassination was Turkey\u2019s third major attack in less than 10 days, and followed months of deadly violence \u2014 including a failed coup attempt and a suicide attack on Istanbul\u2019s international airport \u2014 that has highlighted the threats facing Erdogan\u2019s government and left the country reeling from a sense of siege. The attacks have reflected a convergence of crises that Turkey, a NATO member and major ally of the United States, has been forced to weather over the last few years. They include the spillover from the war in neighboring Syria, a failed peace deal with Kurdish militants and a domestic challenge from a shadowy network tied to a Turkish preacher living in the United States.\u00a0 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has successfully seized on the crises to consolidate his own authority. His government has moved forcefully against Kurdish and Islamist militants as well as followers of the preacher, Fethullah Gulen.\u00a0 It was not clear whether the Altintas, the assassin, fit into any of those categories. The interior minister said Altintas hailed from a town near Izmir, on the Aegean coast, and had been on the force for two and half years. Some pro-government commentators tried to brand him as a follower of Gulen, while his shouted manifesto after the shooting suggested, at the very least, he was acting out of anger at the carnage in Syria.\u00a0 In a television address hours after the shooting, Erdogan also condemned the assassination as \u201ca provocation\u201d aimed at disrupting warming ties between Turkey and Russia. Erdogan, who has been a leading regional opponent of the Syrian government, also defended Turkey\u2019s cooperation with Syria\u2019s sponsor, Russia, saying that it aimed to \u201cfind a solution for the humanitarian crisis in Syria\u201d and \u201c to stop the oppression in Aleppo.\u201d Erdogan and Putin, two strongmen with global aspirations, have found common ground in recent months in their desire to secure an end to the Syrian war that would guarantee their long-term influence at a time when U.S. diplomacy has collapsed. Their foreign ministers, as well as their counterpart from Iran, which backs Assad, are planning to meet Tuesday in Moscow to negotiating a settlement to the Syrian war that would exclude the United States and assert the three powers as the region\u2019s most vital players.\u00a0 Russia and Turkey\u2019s newfound cooperation over Syria was exemplified by\u00a0 the deal they brokered last week for the evacuation of besieged people from the last few blocks of rebel held territory in eastern Aleppo. The statements by Putin and Erdogan suggested that the assassination may not disrupt the budding convergence of interests between Moscow and Ankara. Until last summer, the two presidents had been bitter rivals over Syria, supporting opposite sides in the war and embroiled in recriminations over the shoot-down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet in November 2015. [ How the Russia-Turkish rivalry shaped the world ] Those circumstances have led some Russian politicians to accuse the West of complicity in the attacks.\u00a0 \u201cThey are afraid of that alliance, it\u2019s a counterweight to the European Union and NATO,\u201d said Vladi\u00admir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist politician whose often outlandish remarks on foreign policy are sometimes seen as a trial balloon for things the Kremlin would rather not say. Many players risk losing out in any Russian-Turkish deal over the future of Syria, including the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition, extremists with the Islamic State,\u00a0and Syria\u2019s al-Qaeda affiliate. The United States, meanwhile, joined other nations in condemning the shooting.\u00a0 \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, the Russian people, and with the other victims who were injured in this shooting,\u201d Secretary of State John F. Kerry said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe stand ready to offer assistance to Russia and Turkey as they investigate this despicable attack, which was also an assault on the right of all diplomats to safely and securely advance and represent their nations around the world. President-elect Donald Trump also issued a statement condemning the killing. Karlov started his diplomatic career during the Soviet era in 1976 and took the post in Ankara in July 2013, according to the embassy\u2019s website. Putin referred to him as a \u201cbrilliant diplomat\u201d who \u201chad excellent relations with the leadership of Turkey and other political forces.\u201d The incident could spur even more vigorous efforts between Russia and Turkey to secure their role as Syria\u2019s main power brokers and negotiate a settlement to the war on their terms. Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, said that any fallout \u201cwill entirely depend on Russia\u2019s reaction.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAll indications thus far is that they will retain the relations they have built with Turkey since the rapprochement a couple of months ago,\u201d he added. The recent cease-fire cobbled together was to Russia\u2019s long-term benefit in Syria, while also addressing Turkey\u2019s real concern about civilian casualties, Stein said.\u00a0 Fahim reported from Cairo, Sly from Beirut.

An upcoming documentary shows the humble beginnings of Rousey\u2019s first pro fight in 2011. Ronda Rousey, shown in 2013, made her MMA debut in March 2011. (Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports) The story of Ronda Rousey\u2019s fighting career is full of unusual twists, but one of the most bizarre came right at the very beginning. Rousey\u2019s next fight against Amanda Nunes will headline UFC 207 on Dec. 30, in front of a packed Las Vegas crowd and a global television audience. Her first was at a makeshift venue at a Californian country club, and it nearly didn\u2019t happen. Thanks, primarily, to a 60-pound pitbull named Porkchop. Back in March 2011, Rousey, a former Olympic judo bronze medalist, was preparing for her first steps into mixed martial arts, chasing a dream despite the Ultimate Fighting Championship then not having a women\u2019s division. MORE UFC COVERAGE: Born to fight, UFC's Josh Samman succumbed to drugs, depression Her debut professional contest was slated to take place at the Braemar Country Club in Tarzana, Calif., in front of a tiny audience, with a guaranteed purse of $400 plus an additional $400 for a win. However, it would take a sneaky bit of chicanery at the weigh-in for Rousey to be able to compete against, and ultimately defeat, Ediane Gomes. In her book, My Fight/Your Fight, Rousey described how two days before the bout her dog, Mochi, had gotten into a fight of her own \u2014\u00a0with Porkchop \u2014\u00a0owned by Rousey\u2019s then-roommate, Wetzel Parker. As Rousey intervened, Porkchop was \u201cstill in fight mode\u201d and bit her twice, on her foot and her shin. \u201cThere was a hole in the arch of my foot,\u201d Rousey wrote. \u201cFlesh was hanging off the base of my toes. A split second later, blood filled the holes and started gushing onto the carpet.\u201d A trip to the emergency room, then another to a plastic surgeon, meant that Rousey\u2019s foot was stitched up before she prepared to tip the scales. Despite blinding pain, she was determined to have her initial MMA scrap, even though athletic commission rules forbade fighters from competing with stitches. In order to stop the fight doctor and commission official from paying too much attention to her foot, Rousey came up with the idea of loudly announcing she needed to weigh-in naked, as fighters sometimes do when they are near the weight limit, with towels held up around them to protect their modesty. In the confusion, the doctor and officials barely noticed the inflammation and stitches across the top of her foot, and the match went ahead. The exchange is highlighted in an upcoming documentary about Rousey that features some fascinating and previously unseen footage of the early part of her career. Filmmakers Gary Stretch and Pete Antico followed Rousey for five years to collect material for their upcoming movie about her, titled Through My Father\u2019s Eyes\u00a0and to be released by Wrekin Hill Entertainment in the spring . According to Stretch, a former world champion boxer, and Antico, a renowned Hollywood stunt man, the remarkable scene at Rousey\u2019s first fight perfectly highlighted how much \u2014\u00a0and how quickly \u2014\u00a0her life changed. \u201cIt was a tiny little venue, I remember as she was warming up out the back you could see a forklift truck and machinery behind her,\u201d Stretch told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cEveryone has to start out somewhere and that was the beginning for her. The amazing thing about it is that just a couple of years later she was a huge superstar and a household name.\u201d \u201cRonda had the burning desire to be great, that was within her heart,\u201d Antico added. \u201cBut at that time of that first fight there was no outlet for it. It didn\u2019t seem possible for a woman to become rich and famous in the sport. Women\u2019s MMA was just getting started. She made it happen. Everything that has happened since and the way the sport has grown \u2026 that is a testament to her passion and dedication.\u201d Rousey defeated Gomes, who would later go on to compete in the Invicta MMA organization and had previously lost to Nunes in 2010, via her signature armbar maneuver in only 25 seconds. And thus the process of dominating the world of women\u2019s MMA began, a juggernaut that suffered its first derailment in Australia last November, when Rousey\u00a0was stunningly knocked out by Holly Holm. The Nunes fight offers a chance for redemption, as well as an opportunity to reclaim the belt, which Holm surrendered to Miesha Tate, before Tate in turn lost it to Nunes during the summer. It will be one of the year\u2019s most-watched MMA contests, and a world removed from the low-key inception of her career in the octagon.

When Zsa Zsa Gabor burst onto the scene of the staid 1940s and 1950s Hollywood, she established herself as the prototype celebrity for those who are famous for being famous \u2014 setting the stage for future starlets such as Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton, and Anna Nicole Smith to do the same. \"It's the same formula: She had lots of relationships, she had a good share of scandals and controversy, she was beautiful to look at.\" But Gabor's tabloid-making antics were done without the assistance of Instagrammed selfies or attention-grabbing tweets, and at a time when private lives, even those of well-known actresses, weren't always public. \"Zsa Zsa Gabor proves that even before the Internet, you could do the kind of things the Kardashians do today,\" Bob Thompson, pop culture expert at Syracuse University, told NBC News. \"She said things and behaved in a way that most of us could not get away with.\" Related: Socialite, Hollywood Glamour Queen Zsa Zsa Gabor Dies at 99 Gabor savored her well-publicized socialite status. A Hungarian-born beauty queen, she sang and acted in Europe before following her sisters Eva and Magda to Hollywood, where she secured a string of mediocre cinema roles, as well as a string of lovers. \"I never hated a man enough to give him his diamonds back,\" she explained frankly in 1957. Her glamour and guile made her the stuff of tabloid editors' dreams. She called everyone \"dahling\" in her thick Hungarian accent and had more drama in her real life than in the movies that she appeared in \u2014 often as herself. \"She did all the same things that today's celebrities that are in the same category are doing, except she didn't have all the channels that they do,\" such as 24/7 cable outlets and social media, branding expert Karen Post told NBC News. \"But it's the same formula: She had lots of relationships, she had a good share of scandals and controversy, she was beautiful to look at.\" Outside of her colorful love life, Gabor's more infamous acts included punching a Spanish police officer in the 1960s, then slapping a Beverly Hills officer in the 1980s; for the latter incident, she allegedly insisted on washing her face with bottled Evian water during her three-day jail stint. Photos: The Life of Glamour Queen Zsa Zsa Gabor Between her willingness to be trailed by the press and her outsize personality, Gabor perfected a recipe for getting the world to go gaga over Zsa Zsa. And others haven't been shy about copying it. \"I believe Ms. Gabor was ahead of her time,\" Post said. \"[Celebrities] decide in their mind who their brand is, and that includes the personality and the persona and the tone of their voice and presence, so to feed into that just makes them a more distinct and more unique brand where they don't blend in with the competing celebrities.\" But Gabor took offense to the notion that she was the original Kardashian, or the first Paris Hilton. On Hilton \u2014 whose great-grandfather, Conrad, was among her many husbands \u2014 Gabor once said, \"She's rather silly.\" \"She does too much for publicity,\" Gabor added. After her death Sunday, her longtime friend and former publicist Edward Lozzi told NBC News that he too scoffed at comparisons of the three Gabor sisters to the three Kardashian sisters. Related: With Lamar Odom Crisis, a Public Family Pleads For Privacy \"I hate it when there's been comparisons [of] when the Gabors were at their peak \u2014 quoted everywhere and in photos with kings and queens and international playboys \u2014 and then there's comparisons to the Kardashians,\" Lozzi told NBC News, adding that it \"makes me sick.\" In all fairness, there is one key difference between Gabor and those she's compared to, said Thompson, the pop culture expert. Gabor did have a career in addition to being famous for being famous. \"She did have some presence in Hollywood. She was in an Orson Welles film, she was in 'Moulin Rouge.' And she was in a lot of TV shows. So she was always this kind of peripheral celebrity presence,\" he said. Although her birth date has been debated, Gabor is believed to have been born in 1917, making her 52 in this 1969 photo taken on the set of the game show \"Name Droppers.\" NBC Gabor died at age 99 after a heart attack, following years of health problems, including a stroke and leg amputation that left her confined to a wheelchair. In her final years, she withdrew from the spotlight that she once welcomed. \"\"She wants people to remember her as she was years ago,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Prinz von Anhalt, husband number 9, told TODAY in 2011.

    "text": "Trump secures victory in Electoral College, as bid to flip electors flops Published               December 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote on Monday and secured his election as the 45th president of the United States, as the latest \u2013 and perhaps last \u2013 stop-Trump movement failed to gain traction in state capitals. A fervent push by anti-Trump forces to persuade electors to defect had turned the normally mundane civic procedure into high drama.\u00a0 But Trump easily surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, as representatives tabbed to cast ballots in accordance with their states\u2019 Nov. 8 decision mostly adhered to the election results. With several states still voting, Trump had 304 votes and Hillary Clinton had 169. Texas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes. We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media). \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2016 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence afterward tweeted \"congratulations\" to his running mate while saying he was \"honored & humbled\" to be officially elected the next vice president.\u00a0 Republican National Committee Co-Chair Sharon Day\u00a0urged Trump\u2019s detractors to stop fighting his election, now that his victory is affirmed. \u201cThis historic election is now officially over and I look forward to President-elect Trump taking the oath of office in January,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cFor the good of the country, Democrats must stop their cynical attempts to undermine the legitimacy of this election, which Donald Trump won decisively in the Electoral College with more votes than any Republican since 1988.\u201d\u00a0 Elector antics were few and far between throughout the day, with most the disruptions occurring on the Democratic side. A Democratic elector in Maine tried to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders, but switched to Clinton after it was ruled improper. Another who tried to vote for Sanders in Minnesota was replaced; a Colorado elector who tried to back Ohio Gov. John Kasich likewise was replaced. One of the biggest deviations was in Washington state, where three electors voted for Colin Powell and one voted for \u201cFaith Spotted Eagle;\u201d the remaining eight went to Clinton, the state\u2019s winner. \u00a0 It marked the first time in four decades the state's electors broke from the popular vote. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman vowed to work with the state attorney general and charge the four unfaithful electors with a violation of Washington state civil law. Such violations carry a fine up to $1,000. With Trump\u2019s win now secured, a joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results. Trump\u2019s clear Electoral College victory could serve to deter any further last-ditch efforts to effectively nullify his November win and prevent his inauguration, though the battle may shift next to his Cabinet picks. \u00a0 Few expected the \u201cfaithless elector\u201d push to imperil Trump\u2019s victory on Monday. Only one Republican elector \u2013 Texas\u2019 Chris Suprun \u2013 publicly stated he would vote for an alternative candidate. (He backed Kasich, while another Texas elector used his ballot to vote for former congressman Ron Paul.) More than three dozen Republicans would have had to abandon Trump to complicate his path to the presidency. But GOP electors still faced immense pressure -- with some even receiving threats -- from Trump foes in the run-up to Monday\u2019s Electoral College vote. Those urging disorder in state capitals often cited Clinton\u2019s popular-vote win, by roughly 2.6 million votes, over Trump in November. Celebrities made public appeals to electors to use the arcane process to upend Trump\u2019s victory, as some Democratic electors tried to persuade their Republican counterparts to defect. Reports that U.S. intelligence officials determined Russia interfered in the election to boost Trump \u2013 findings disputed by Trump himself \u2013 only fueled efforts to wield the Electoral College vote as a political circuit-breaker. As electors met, thousands of protesters descended on state capitals Monday in one last push to convince Trump voters to change their minds. In Arizona, dozens of protesters gathered outside the meeting site, marching around the Capitol mall and carrying signs that said, \"Stop Trump.\"\u00a0More than 200 demonstrators gathered at Pennsylvania's Capitol, chanting, \"No treason, no Trump!\" Both states, and dozens of others, cast their electoral votes for Trump anyway. In Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant dismissed attempts to sway Republican electors. \"This idea \u2026 that we want to change the electors\u2019 minds who have been dedicated to Donald Trump very early in the process I think is just misguided,\u201d he said. If nothing else, the furor over Monday\u2019s proceedings has served to re-acquaint Americans with a process that few pay attention to every four years. The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. To be elected president, the winner must get at least half plus one -- or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins that state's popular vote. Maine and Nebraska award them by congressional district. After a joint session of Congress certifies the results on Jan. 6, the next president will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Trump already is nearly done naming his Cabinet appointees, as he prepares for confirmation hearings and the inauguration ceremonies, in addition to his first 100 days agenda. Despite the transition process being well underway, Republican electors said they were deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support the billionaire businessman in the days and weeks leading up to Monday\u2019s proceedings. Many of the emails were part of coordinated campaigns. \"The letters are actually quite sad,\" said Lee Green, a Republican elector from North Carolina. \"They honestly believe the propaganda. They believe our nation is being taken over by a dark and malevolent force.\" Wirt A. Yerger Jr., a Republican elector in Mississippi, said, \"I have gotten several thousand emails asking me not to vote for Trump. I threw them all away.\" Arizona elector Robert Graham told Fox News on Saturday that the state\u2019s 11 electors received hundreds of thousands of emails telling them not to vote for Trump and that he\u2019s received information that some of the other 10 have been followed or have received a death threat. \u201cIt\u2019s out of hand when you have such \u2026 a small group of people that is pushing so hard against millions if not hundreds of millions of people who still appreciate this whole system,\u201d said Graham, chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. \u201cThe Electoral College is part of the Constitution.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.
