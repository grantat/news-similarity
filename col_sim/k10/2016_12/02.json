    "text": "Email PITTSBURGH -- A Pittsburgh-area high school principal has been placed on administrative leave after a recording surfaced of him allegedly berating a student, CBS Pittsburgh reports .\u00a0 On Wednesday, Woodland Hills Superintendent Alan Johnson confirmed that Kevin Murray was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. The 14-year-old student said the principal often harasses him and allegedly speaks to him in a threatening manner and uses expletives. On one occasion, the teen recorded it. That recording was made back in April, while the boy was being reprimanded for a previous incident. During the incident, the principal is allegedly caught on the recording saying among other things, \u201cI\u2019m going to [expletive] punch you in the face. Man-to-man, bro. I don\u2019t care if you are [expletive] 14 years old or not. I will punch you in your face, and when we go down to court, it\u2019s your word against mine, and mine wins every time.\u201d \u201cObviously, what I heard there is not something that we would condone as a school district,\u201d Johnson said. According to the family\u2019s attorney, Todd Hollis, there were several other incidents involving the boy and Murray. Hollis says the threats and harassment have gone on throughout the school year against the \u201cspecial education\u201d student. \u201cThe cultural problem at Woodland Hills has to be changed, and I don\u2019t think that simply placing the principal on administrative leave is going to change that,\u201d said Hollis. But Johnson says it\u2019s standard to place an employee on paid leave during an investigation. Hollis isn\u2019t happy. \u201cI am getting calls from parents, educators, even some police officers who are saying to me this behavior is not unusual and it seems apparent to me that the superintendent is aware of it,\u201d said Hollis. \u201cBeing on paid administrative leave isn\u2019t termination, it\u2019s a vacation. That\u2019s not enough.\u201d Hollis says his client remains in school. \u201cThe child is in school, but the child was apparently being harassed by some teachers in the school and ran to his counselors office today,\u201d Hollis said. He is urging others to come forward. \u201cI am reaching out to every parent that is aware of this. Call my office, get in touch with me, email, Facebook, I will be happy to address the problem,\u201d Hollis said. He says he has not had a sit-down meeting with the superintendent yet. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration.  (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 683308689 ORIG FILE ID: 624448490 (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) James Mattis, a retired four-star general, achieved almost mythic status within the Marine Corps as an aggressive combat commander and innovative strategist whose speeches and writings defined the warrior ethos for the latest generation of military men and women. Donald Trump\u2019s reported decision to name Mattis to head the Defense Department would be a strong signal that the president-elect is looking for a wartime leader at the Pentagon and not someone to just manage budgets. Several media outlets reported Thursday that\u00a0Trump has selected Mattis, though the Trump campaign has denied that a decision has been made. During the campaign, Trump said he would overhaul the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State. Trump has said\u00a0the current plan isn\u2019t working and suggested\u00a0some military leaders had been cowed by the Obama administration. \u201cYou could easily imagine that Trump believes the advice of generals has been muted and diluted,\u201d said Gregory Newbold, a retired Marine lieutenant general and friend of Mattis. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for somebody who is the antidote to that. You certainly get that in Jim Mattis.\u201d Reports: Trump picks Mattis for Defense secretary If confirmed by the Senate, Mattis would be a departure from previous Defense secretaries\u00a0who have come from the ranks of civilian government service or politics. He would replace Ash Carter, a physicist who rose through the ranks of the Defense Department. Mattis\u2019 appointment as Defense secretary would require\u00a0a congressional waiver\u00a0because federal law requires a seven-year gap between retirement from the military and assuming the Cabinet post, a statute designed to safeguard the principle of civilian control over the military. The last retired general to head the Defense Department was George Marshall in 1950. Mattis interview: Syria would fall without Iran's help Mattis, 66, retired in 2013 after 44 years in the Marine Corps. He led an infantry battalion in the Persian Gulf War in 1990-91 and commanded a task force that struck deep into Afghanistan after the 9/11\u00a0attacks. In 2003, he led a division that raced across the desert toward Baghdad in the initial assault into Iraq. His call sign was \u201cchaos.\u201d On and off the battlefield, Mattis developed a reputation as a blunt speaker whose language sometimes harkened to an earlier time, capturing the ethos of being a warrior. He avoids military jargon like exit strategy and instead speaks unapologetically about \"victory,\" \"ferocity\" and \"slaughtering\" the enemy. He sprinkles his talk with historic references, often reaching back to the ancient Romans and Greeks. When he was preparing his troops to head into Iraq, he cited an epitaph from Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla to explain counterinsurgency to his troops: \"No better friend, no worse enemy.\" \"There was always a sense that we had to put things into words that would touch our troops' hearts \u2014 not just their heads,\u201d Mattis said in a 2013 interview with USA TODAY. Speaking to newly minted infantry officers at the Marine base in Quantico, Va.,\u00a0several years ago, he described the affection that leaders feel for their troops and the need to maintain authority despite those emotions.\u00a0He worked in references to Little Big Horn and Valley Forge. He left no room for doubt about their role if they find themselves at war with America's enemies. \"You are to annihilate them,\" he said.\u00a0\"You are to make them recoil back and say, 'We don\u2019t ever want to take on the U.S. Marines.'\" Those who have worked with him say he is more than a battle commander.\u00a0As head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East,\u00a0he traveled the region, cultivating ties with foreign military leaders and helping shape strategy in the area. \"I know he has this reputation as a\u00a0'war fighter,'\u00a0and it certainly is earned, but he really is a clear, precise strategic thinker, more so than any man I have ever worked for,\" said Jim Howcroft, a retired Marine officer who served as Mattis' intelligence officer during the Iraq invasion in 2003. Since retiring, Mattis has lamented the lack of strategy in Washington. Testifying before Congress last year, he said the United States should \u201ccome out from our reactive crouch and take a firm, strategic stance in defense of our values.\u201d Strategy is often defined as an overarching set of principles and goals that guide policy decisions. In 2013, Mattis left his position as head of Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East, amid reports the White House squeezed him out. Asked about the reports at the time, Mattis said he provided the unvarnished truth to his civilian leadership. \"The idea that you should moderate it before you give it to them is not showing respect to your civilian leadership,\" Mattis said at the time. As Pentagon chief Mattis would also guide the military\u2019s personnel policies, possibly wading into the controversial order by the Obama administration to open\u00a0all military jobs to women, including the infantry and special operations. The Marine Corps had asked for an exemption for its infantry units, following a study that showed mixed-gender infantry squads did not perform as well as all-male units. Carter denied the exemption request, and the Marine Corps is taking steps to open the infantry to women. Trump\u00a0during the campaign derided \u201cpolitically correct\u201d military personnel policies, though he has not said whether he would change it. Mattis has also not publicly stated his position on opening the jobs to women, but he has said the decision should be based on what impact it would have on combat effectiveness. He has talked about what makes jobs like the infantry distinct. \u201cThere is a great difference between military service in dangerous circumstances and serving in a combat unit whose role is to search out, close with and kill the enemy at close quarters,\u201d Mattis testified last year before Congress. 1531 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gRg3wK ",

By Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker December 1 at 9:07 PM Follow @ktumulty Follow @PhilipRucker CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 The raw, lingering emotion of the 2016 presidential campaign erupted into a shouting match here Thursday as top strategists of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign accused their Republican counterparts of fueling and legitimizing racism to elect Donald Trump. The extraordinary exchange came at a postmortem session sponsored by Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, where top operatives from both campaigns sat across a conference table from each other. As Trump\u2019s team basked in the glow of its victory and singled out for praise its campaign\u2019s chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, who was absent, the row of grim-faced Clinton aides who sat opposite them bristled. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri condemned Bannon, who previously ran Breitbart, a news site popular with the alt-right, a small movement known for espousing racist views. \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am proud to have lost,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather lose than win the way you guys did.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications director Jennifer Palmieri and campaign manager Robby Mook speak to the traveling press corps aboard the campaign plane above Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, fumed: \u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d \u201cYou did, Kellyanne. You did,\u201d interjected Palmieri, who choked up at various points of the session. \u201cDo you think you could have just had a decent message for white, working-class voters?\u201d Conway asked. \u201cHow about, it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, she doesn\u2019t connect with people? How about, they have nothing in common with her? How about, she doesn\u2019t have an economic message?\u201d Joel Benenson, Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, piled on: \u201cThere were dog whistles sent out to people. . . . Look at your rallies. He delivered it.\u201d At which point, Conway accused Clinton\u2019s team of being sore losers. \u201cGuys, I can tell you are angry, but wow,\u201d she said. \u201cHashtag he\u2019s your president. How\u2019s that? Will you ever accept the election results? Will you tell your protesters that he\u2019s their president, too?\u201d The session was part of a two-day forum that the school\u2019s Institute of Politics has sponsored in the wake of every presidential election since 1972. It gathers operatives from nearly all of the primary and general election campaigns, as well as a large contingent of journalists, with the stated goal of beginning to compile a historical record. Generally, the quadrennial gatherings are frank but civil ones, in which political operatives at the top of their game accord each other a measure of professional respect. This year, in the wake of a brutal campaign with a surprise outcome, it was clear that the wounds have not yet begun to heal. The animosity of the campaign aides mirrors the broader feelings of millions of voters on both sides. Campaign officials lashed out at each other, and also against the media \u2014 which neither side believed had treated it fairly. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook also acknowledged that her operation had made a number of mistakes and miscalculations, while being buffeted by what he repeatedly described as a \u201chead wind\u201d of being an establishment candidate in a season where voters were eager for change. He noted, for example, that younger voters, perhaps assuming that Clinton was going to win, migrated to third-party candidates in the final days of the race. Where the campaign needed to win upward of 60\u00a0percent of young voters, it was able to garner something \u201cin the high 50s at the end of the day,\u201d Mook said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we lost.\u201d He and others also faulted FBI Director James B. Comey for deciding in the waning days of the campaign to revive the controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Trump officials said Clinton\u2019s problems went beyond tactics to her weaknesses as a candidate and the deficits of a message that consisted largely of trying to make Trump unacceptable. David Bossie, Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, taunted Mook: \u201cYou call it \u2018head winds,\u2019 I call it self-inflicted wounds.\u201d Conway added, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference for voters between what offends you and what affects you,\u201d arguing that Trump was speaking more directly to people\u2019s anxieties and needs. Strategists for Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who waged a strong challenge against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, agreed. \u201cThere was a large part of the Democratic primary electorate who had concerns about the secretary\u2019s veracity and forthrightness,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019s campaign manager. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides insisted, again and again, that their candidate had been held to a different standard than the other contenders \u2014 as evidenced by the controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Palmieri said that many political journalists had a personal dislike for the Democratic nominee and predicted that the email issue will go down in history as \u201cthe most grossly overrated, over-covered and most destructive story in all of presidential politics.\u201d \u201cIf I made one mistake, it was legitimizing the way the press covered this story line,\u201d Palmieri said. Mook added that Trump deftly used his rally speeches to \u201cswitch up the news cycle.\u201d \u201cThe media by and large was not covering what Hillary Clinton was choosing to say,\u201d Mook said. \u201cThey were treating her like the likely winner, and they were constantly trying to unearth secrets and expose.\u201d For instance, Mook posited that the media did not scrutinize Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns as intensively as the issue of Clinton\u2019s private email server. Conway retorted: \u201cOh, my God, that question was vomited to me every day on TV.\u201d The strangest criticism of the media, however, was by Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. His complaint: Journalists accurately reported what Trump said. \u201cThis is the problem with the media. You guys took everything that Donald Trump said so literally,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cThe American people didn\u2019t. They understood it. They understood that sometimes \u2014 when you have a conversation with people, whether it\u2019s around the dinner table or at a bar \u2014 you\u2019re going to say things, and sometimes you don\u2019t have all the facts to back it up.\u201d At a dinner the previous evening, CNN chief executive Jeff Zucker was heckled during a panel discussion about the media by operatives from several losing Republican campaigns, who accused the network of showering Trump with free publicity. To win the GOP nomination, Trump vanquished a highly credentialed field of 16 other Republicans, some of whom were backed up by tens of millions of dollars in outside spending. What his opponents failed to recognize, until it was too late, was that 2016 would be a year unlike any other, in which the standard rules would not apply. \u201cThe uniqueness of this cycle made it such that some of those traditional kind of avenues became less effective,\u201d said Danny Diaz, who managed the campaign of the presumed early front-runner, former Florida governor Jeb Bush. \u201cMoney and mechanics matter, but passion about a candidate matters more,\u201d added Mike DuHaime, a strategist for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), another establishment figure in the race. Barry Bennett, the campaign manager for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, said of voters: \u201cWhat they wanted more than anything else was strength, and Donald Trump was supplying it every day.\u201d Clinton consultant Mandy Grunwald had a darker interpretation, which she expressed in an icy backhanded compliment to the Trump team on Thursday: \u201cI don\u2019t think you give yourself enough credit for the negative campaign you ran.\u201d She noted that the murky corners of the Internet were rife with false stories that Clinton was in dire health, and on the verge of going to prison. \u201cI hear this heroic story of him connecting with voters,\u201d Grunwald said. \u201cBut there was a very impressive gassing of her.\u201d Benenson, meanwhile, served notice that the election may be over but that the battles it spawned are not. \u201cYou guys won, that\u2019s clear,\u201d Benenson said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest. Don\u2019t act as if you have a popular mandate for your message. The fact of the matter is that more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump.\u201d At which point Conway turned to her side and said: \u201cHey, guys, we won. You don\u2019t have to respond. He was the better candidate. That\u2019s why he won.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The Progress MS-04 cargo craft broke up at an altitude of 190 kilometers (118 miles) over the remote Russian Tuva region in Siberia that borders Mongolia, Roscosmos said in a statement. It said most of spaceship's debris burnt up as it entered the atmosphere but some fell to Earth over what it called an uninhabited area. Local people reported seeing a flash of light and hearing a loud thud west of the regional capital of Kyzyl, more than 3,600 kilometers (2,200 miles) east of Moscow, the Tuva government was quoted as saying late Thursday by the Interfax news agency. The Progress cargo ship had lifted off as scheduled at 8:51 p.m. (1451 GMT) from Russia's space launch complex in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, to deliver 2.5 metric tons of fuel, water, food and other supplies. It was set to dock with the space station on Saturday. Roscosmos said the craft was operating normally before it stopped transmitting data 6 ? minutes after the launch. The Russian space agency would not immediately describe the malfunction, saying its experts were looking into it. This is the third botched launch of a Russian spacecraft in two years. A Progress cargo ship plunged into the Pacific Ocean in May 2015, and a Proton-M rocket carrying an advanced satellite broke up in the atmosphere in May 2014. But both Roscosmos and NASA said the crash of the ship would have no impact on the operations of the orbiting space lab that is currently home to a six-member crew, including three cosmonauts from Russia, two NASA astronauts and one from the European Union. Orbital ATK, NASA's other shipper, successfully sent up supplies to the space station in October, and a Japanese cargo spaceship is scheduled to launch a full load in mid-December. NASA supplier SpaceX , meanwhile, has been grounded since a rocket explosion in September on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company hopes to resume launches in December to deliver communication satellites. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This version corrects the spelling of the region to Tuva, not Tyva. \u2014\u2014 Aerospace Writer Marcia Dunn in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Nor do we know why the online publication attacked the Christian couple\u2019s church. Maybe author Kate Aurthur got a speeding ticket while driving through Waco, Texas?

So let\u2019s cut to the chase \u2013 is Antioch Community Church anti-gay? \u201cAbsolutely not, Pastor Siebert told me in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe are not only not anti-gay, but we are pro-helping people in their journey to find out who God is and who He has made them to be.\u201d The pastor told me he was surprised by the controversy surrounding a message he delivered more than a year ago pointing out that people from all different walks of life attend the church. \u201cFor us \u2013 our heart has always been to love Jesus, preach the word of God and help people in their journey,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.

Caption The president-elect saluted workers at a plant where he says he saved more than a thousand jobs, then headed to Ohio for the first stop of his \u201cthank-you\u201d tour. Dec. 1, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump talks to members of the media while taking a tour of Carrier Corp. in Indianapolis. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ylan Q. Mui , Matea Gold and Max Ehrenfreund December 1 at 8:42 PM Follow @ylanmui Follow @mateagold Follow @MaxEhrenfreund INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday warned that the government would punish companies seeking to move operations overseas with \u201cconsequences,\u201d setting the stage for an unusual level of intervention by the White House into private enterprise. Trump\u2019s remarks came as he triumphantly celebrated a decision by the heating and air-conditioning company Carrier to reverse its plans to close a furnace plant here and move to Mexico, helping keep 1,100 jobs in Indianapolis. About 800 of those were manufacturing positions that had been scheduled to move south of the border, said a person familiar with the negotiations. An additional 300 to 600 Carrier positions at that plant, as well as roughly 700 jobs at another facility in the area, will still be cut. Under the terms of the agreement, which have not been finalized, Carrier would receive a $7\u00a0million tax incentive package from the state of Indiana in exchange for making a $16\u00a0million investment in the facility \u2014 although Trump said Thursday that amount would probably be higher. In remarks delivered inside the Carrier facility, the president-elect said more companies will decide to stay in the United States because his administration will lower corporate taxes and reduce regulations. He also warned that businesses that decide to go abroad will pay a price through a border tax on imported goods. President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 1 celebrated a deal that will prevent jobs at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis from being shipped abroad. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) \u201cCompanies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,\u201d Trump declared Thursday. \u201cNot gonna happen. It\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d Trump said he decided to intervene after watching a television news report that reminded him that he had vowed during the campaign, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Carrier leave.\u201d Trump\u2019s determination to use a mixture of incentives and tariffs to keep jobs from going overseas represents a sharp break with the free-market wing of the Republican Party, including senior congressional leaders. On Thursday, top Republicans offered careful responses to the Carrier deal. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty darn good that people are keeping their jobs in Indiana instead of going to Mexico,\u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), emphasizing that the party is hoping to pass comprehensive tax changes that would be a boon to all businesses. Ryan has repeatedly criticized President Obama for allegedly trying to pick \u201cwinners and losers\u201d in his stimulus package and other economic policies. [ Why lots of people think Trump\u2019s deal to save 1,000 Indiana jobs was a bad idea ] The Carrier deal was sharply criticized by some conservatives, who viewed it as government distortion of free markets, as well as liberals, who derided it as corporate welfare. \u201cI think it sets a pretty bad precedent,\u201d said Dan Ikenson, director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be addressing issues like this on an ad hoc basis. It certainly incentivizes companies to make a stink and say: \u2018We\u2019re going to leave, too. What are you going to do for me?\u2019 \u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, accused Trump of reversing course on a pledge to punish companies that outsource manufacturing jobs. In the case of Carrier, Trump had said he would force the company to \u201cpay a damn tax\u201d if it closed the plant. \u201cInstead of a damn tax, the company will be rewarded with a damn tax cut,\u201d Sanders wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. \u201cWow! How\u2019s that for standing up to corporate greed?\u201d Privately, some business leaders were also unnerved. \u201cIt is uncharted territory for a president-elect to get involved personally in social engineering with a single company,\u201d said an adviser to major corporations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order not to anger the incoming administration. Now that Carrier \u201cis no longer the political pi\u00f1ata,\u201d the adviser added, chief executives \u201care asking, \u2018Who\u2019s next?\u2019 \u201d Timothy Bartik, an economist at the nonpartisan W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that vague threats from the \u00adpresident-elect could stymie corporate investment as firms seek to avoid decisions that could draw the ire of the White House. \u201cWhat are these consequences? Who\u2019s in charge of them?\u201d Bartik asked. \u201cOne of the worst things for corporate investment is uncertainty,\u201d he added. \u201cYou would hope that the government would not add to the uncertainty.\u201d In Indianapolis, where Carrier has been a staple of the business community since the 1950s, the deal was celebrated. [ The trick to persuading Trump? Flattery, proximity and snappy pitches ] \u201cOur union at every level, including our local union leadership, fought to keep that plant open,\u201d said Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers, which represents the factory\u2019s workers. Gerard said that although it did not endorse Trump, the union supports crucial aspects of the president-elect\u2019s agenda, including preservation of manufacturing jobs, scrapping free-trade deals and spending on infrastructure. \u201cIf this step is any indication of what\u2019s to come, we look forward to working with him,\u201d Gerard said. Jennifer Volheim, a bartender at Sully\u2019s Bar and Grill, down the street from the factory, said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when it was on track to shut down. But, she said, she voted for Trump and knew he would make a difference. \u201cWe knew Trump was on it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not even in office yet and he\u2019s saving . . . jobs.\u201d In fact, by Trump\u2019s own telling on Thursday, he had no plans to intervene in the Carrier case until he watched an evening news segment featuring a worker who expressed confidence that the \u00adpresident-elect would save the Indianapolis plant. He said his campaign vow to save the plant was \u201ca euphemism\u201d for other companies. Regardless, Trump \u2014 known for his tendency to react to TV news reports \u2014 said he immediately picked up the phone and called Gregory Hayes, the chief executive of Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies. \u201cI said, \u2018Greg, you gotta help us out here. You gotta do something,\u2019 \u201d Trump recalled Thursday. Standing in front of a wall blanketed with Carrier\u2019s blue-and-white logo, Trump lavished praise on the company for its decision, promising that the sales of its air-conditioning units would soar \u201cbecause of the goodwill you have engendered.\u201d Experts said no modern president has intervened on behalf of an individual company. Although Obama stepped in to rescue car manufacturers after the 2008 financial crisis and President John F. Kennedy intervened to prevent steel producers from increasing prices, these actions affected entire industries \u2014 not decisions at a specific plant, Bartik said. Jeff Windau, an analyst at the investment firm Edward Jones in St. Louis, said that Trump might not have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to keep up this kind of dealmaking once in the Oval Office. \u201cHaving a current president-elect focus on a specific company and a specific location \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty micro view of the world,\u201d he said. [ Trump is shocked that Carrier workers took him literally. That doesn\u2019t bode well for his many promises. ] But Trump said Thursday that he planned to personally call other companies that are contemplating moving operations out of the country, even, as he said, if critics felt such outreach was not \u201cpresidential.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s very presidential. And if it\u2019s not presidential, that\u2019s okay because I actually like doing it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have a lot of phone calls made to companies when they say they\u2019re leaving this country, because they\u2019re not going to leave this country.\u201d Trump\u2019s aggressive stance toward outsourcing comes despite the fact that his family companies profit from low-wage laborers around the globe who produce Trump-branded merchandise. His daughter Ivanka has her own separate brand of jewelry, shoes and clothing, much of which is produced in China. Abigail Klem, president of Ivanka Trump\u2019s company, said in a statement that the brand has \u201cconsistently expressed that we share industry [leaders\u2019] interest in bringing more manufacturing opportunities to the US and are looking forward to being a part of the conversation.\u201d A representative for the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly attacked specific companies for outsourcing, drawing huge cheers from his crowds. He blasted Ford Motor Co. for opening factories in Mexico, criticized a U.S. drug company that moved its headquarters offshore and said he would not longer eat Oreo cookies because its maker, Nabisco, moved part of its production to Mexico. He also mocked politicians who offered low-interest loans and tax abatements to keep factories in the United States. \u201cThese companies don\u2019t even need the money, most of them,\u201d he said at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in October. \u201cThey take the money. There were a couple instances where geniuses with great lawyers gave them money, and then they moved anyway.\u201d Trump repeatedly pointed to Carrier\u2019s planned move to Mexico as a prime example of the perils of globalization: The company told Indiana officials it would save $65\u00a0million a year by shifting production to a 645,000-square-foot factory under construction outside Monterrey, where wages are far lower. Carrier rejected a tax incentive package the state offered earlier in the year to keep the Indianapolis plant open. But that was before Trump won the election and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence became the vice president-elect. On Thursday, Hayes said that discussions with Trump and his team gave the company \u201ca renewed confidence in the future of manufacturing\u201d in the country. Some state officials also noted that the federal government is a major customer of United Technologies. United Technologies\u2019 sales to the government have dropped in recent years, from $6.3\u00a0billion in 2013 to $5.6\u00a0billion last year, making up about 10\u00a0percent of its total revenue. Defense analysts said that Trump could not legally steer contracts to United Technologies or punish the company through the Pentagon\u2019s highly regulated acquisition system. The Federal Acquisition Regulations are thousands of pages long and run through an often stifling bureaucracy that determines requirements, puts out requests for proposals from industry, then embarks on a lengthy selection process that can take months, if not years. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the acquisition system can\u2019t be used as a bargaining chip: \u201cThe short answer is no, and it would be highly illegal.

The stop, in the state Vice President-elect Pence still serves as governor, came amid a \"thank you\" tour of the Midwestern states that helped propel their ticket to victory. \"I will tell you that United Technologies and Carrier stepped up, and now they're keeping over 1,100 people,\" Trump said. \"It's so great.\" Trump said he got involved after seeing a report on Carrier's announcement it would leave for Mexico. Trump said he was moved by a Carrier employee and Trump supporter who promised his co-workers that Trump wouldn't let the company leave. \"It's because of that guy,\" Trump said, scanning the assembled throng and explaining how he reached out to the company's top brass. \"Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,\" Trump thundered, before tempering the threat with pledges for deregulation and lower taxes. \"We're going to do great things for businesses,\" Trump said. \"There's no reason for them to leave anymore.\" Before Trump spoke, Pence told his fellow Hoosiers they had cause to celebrate. \"It\u2019s a great day for working people all across the U.S.A.,\" Pence said, speaking before Trump. \"The State of Indiana is proud. \"Since the 1950s, Carrier has been a part of Indiana\u2019s success story, and thanks to our president-elect, Carrier has decided to stay and grow right here in Indiana. We are so grateful.\" Trump and Pence were at the factory on the west side of Indianapolis, where they toured the facility they helped keep in the U.S., thanks in part to a $7 million tax break from the Hoosier State. In February, the heating and air conditioning company said that it would shutter the plant and send jobs to Mexico, and video of angry workers being informed about the decision soon went viral. \u201cBig day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks, Carrier,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday. Trump threatened to impose sharp tariffs on any company that shifted its factories to Mexico. And his advisers have since promoted lower corporate tax rates as a means of keeping jobs in the U.S. By enabling the plant to stay open, the deal spares about 800 union workers whose jobs were going to be outsourced to Mexico, according to federal officials who were briefed by the company. This suggests that hundreds will still lose their jobs at the factory, where roughly 1,400 workers were slated to be laid off. Also, neither Trump nor Carrier has yet to say what the workers might have to give up or precisely what threats or incentives were used to get the manufacturer to change its mind. The company attributed its decision to the incoming Trump administration and financial incentives provided by Indiana, which is something of a reversal, since earlier offers from the state had failed to sway Carrier from decamping to Mexico. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is possible because the incoming Trump-Pence administration has emphasized to us its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate,\u201d the company said in a statement released Wednesday. Trump will later hold a campaign-style rally in Cincinnati, the first of several stops on the \u201cUSA Thank You Tour 2016\u201d planned this month to revisit the states that helped him capture the White House. Trump, who has long spoken of feeding off the energy of his raucous crowds, first floated the idea of a victory tour just days after winning the election, only to instead prioritize filling some of his Cabinet positions.

Jones , USA TODAY Sports 9:31 p.m. EST December 1, 2016 Share The Patriots star is likely out for the rest of the season. USA TODAY Sports New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (87) runs after a catch against the Pittsburgh Steelers during the fourth quarter at Heinz Field. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports) The New England Patriots should be optimistic that Rob Gronkowski will make a full recovery from surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back, but that likely won\u2019t happen in time for Gronkowski to return this season. The team issued a statement late Thursday night conceding that the all-pro tight end likely would not return even in the playoffs, though the Patriots wanted to wait until after Friday's surgery to make such a determination. \"Rob has always been one of our hardest workers and was voted captain for the leadership he provides on our team,\" the Patriots wrote in the statement.\u00a0\"We are deeply saddened any time a player is lost to injury. \u00a0We are committed to assisting Rob throughout his recovery and look forward to his return to playing football for the New England Patriots.\" Two orthopedic surgeons told USA TODAY Sports that a return this season would be extremely difficult for Gronkowski. \u201cThis year, no,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Hecht, the chief of spine surgery for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York and a member of the NFL's Neck and Spine Committee. \u201cVery unlikely, incredibly unlikely. I would really count on next year.\u201d The timetable for a return being floated is eight weeks. But Hecht said it typically takes NFL players between 12-16 weeks to return to game action after a disc surgery. The AFC Championship Game is in seven weeks, and the Super Bowl will be played in Houston in nine weeks. \u201cEven though you\u2019re feeling better, you have to go through the rehab part,\u201d Hecht said. With Rob Gronkowski out, now what for Patriots offense? A player who returned too quickly would be at risk for re-herniation, which would likely require additional surgery. Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt returned to the field six weeks after back surgery earlier this season only to experience a setback that required another procedure. Watt has been on injured reserve since Sept. 28. Friday\u2019s surgery will be the third on Gronkowski\u2019s back since 2009, when he was at the University of Arizona. He also had a herniated disc repaired in 2013 while with the Patriots. If the new injury is to a disc that had been repaired previously, his recovery timeline could be extended by several weeks, said Dr. Wellington Hsu, the Clifford C. Raisbeck Distinguished Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cTen years ago, you would have gotten a lot of people that would call this a career-ending surgery, but we know a lot more now that make me optimistic that Gronkowski can fulfill a very promising career,\u201d Hsu told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cHowever, we can't take that too far. We can't get him back to the point where he can be able to play in the Super Bowl.\u201d Follow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjones . PHOTOS: Week 13 games ranked by watchability ",

Starbucks President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will take Schultz's place. Newslook Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down from role of ceo (Photo: Stephen Brashear) Howard Schultz, who helped turn Starbucks  into an iconic global brand as well known for its activism as its coffee blends, will step down from the role of CEO in April. Schultz will become the company\u2019s executive chairman, concentrating on ramping up Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, a new premium experience that the company is betting on to boost growth worldwide, as well as the company\u2019s well-known forays into community activism. Kevin Johnson, the company\u2019s current president and COO will become the CEO,\u00a0retaining the title of president. \u201cIn all my years at Starbucks\u00a0 I have never been more energized or exhilarated about the opportunities that lie ahead,\u2019\u2019 Schultz said in a conference call Thursday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving the company. I\u2019m here every single day, and I\u2019m going to contribute to what I consider a significant growth opportunity. ...\u00a0But Kevin and the team are in charge.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s the second time since Schultz bought the Starbucks Coffee Company in the late 1980s that he has stepped down from the role of CEO. He resigned in 2000, only to return to the helm eight years later. But \u201cthe differences between then and now couldn\u2019t be greater,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u00a0noting that when he returned to the top job in 2008, Starbucks and other companies were riding out the dramatic financial downturn that was the Great Recession. \"The management team at that time ... just did not have the capability or experience to really navigate through that difficult period.\" In recent years, he says, the company has assembled \u201cthe strongest leadership team in our history.\" Johnson, who began his career as a systems engineer for IBM, joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and began working at the company in 2015. He previously spent 16 years at Microsoft working on global sales and marketing, then five years in Silicon Valley as CEO of Juniper Networks, a Sunnyvale, Calf.-company that develops networking products. It is Johnson\u2019s deep background in technology that Schultz said will be pivotal for Starbucks\u2019 future growth. Technology can be used to bolster the customer experience, while Schultz focuses on the more premium offerings that will make a visit to Starbucks stand out from other eateries or retailers. \"We\u2019ll be opening globally in years to come roasteries, reserve stores and reserve bars that will be customer destination venues,\u2019\u2019 Schultz says. By the end of 2019, the company plans to have unveiled more than 20 roasteries, and it plans to open more than 1,000 reserve stores, a new premium coffee space that will highlight new brewing techniques, and artisanal food offerings. Schultz said that those locations are expected to \"deliver twice the unit economics of a typical Starbucks store.'' Schultz, who will continue to be chairman of the board, will also continue to spearhead the social causes that have sometimes made him and Starbucks a lightning rod. In 2013 he asked\u00a0customers not bring firearms into stores. And in 2015, as the nation was grappling with a wave of police shootings of unarmed black men and boys, Starbucks employees were told to write \u201cRace Together\u201d on cups, with the company saying that it wanted to help spark a discussion about race. \u201cWe want to use our scale for good,\u2019\u2019\u00a0Schultz said, noting a few of its many initiatives, including hiring over 10,000 veterans and their spouses, and making a dent in the youth unemployment rate by giving thousands fo young people. \"We think companies need to do more for the people they serve and the people they employ.\u2019\u2019 Johnson acknowledged that Schultz is a major act to follow. \"Howard is among the world\u2019s\u00a0 most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs,\u2019\u2019 Johnson said. But, the company's leaders work\u00a0\"well together and have built a foundation of trust, transparency and teamwork.\u2019\u2019 Contributing: Elizabeth Weise\u00a0 4980 CONNECT TWEET 31 LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gruw5F ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Retired Marine general James Mattis (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) 6390 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 108 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday that he has\u00a0selected James Mattis, a legendary, tough-talking retired Marine Corps general who favors a robust military and criticized the Obama administration's approach to war, to lead the Defense Department. Trump joked about the announcement at a rally Thursday night in Cincinnati. \"We are going to appoint 'Mad Dog' Mattis as our Secretary of Defense,\" Trump said. \"But we're not announcing it 'til Monday, so don't tell anybody.\" Mattis retired in 2013 after leading the military\u2019s Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Africa. He will require\u00a0a waiver from Congress to become Defense secretary because the law prohibits veterans who have been retired for fewer than seven years from taking the job. That is expected to be a formality, given support for him from many in Congress, including Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., the influential chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mattis made headlines at a series of prominent commands with blunt talk that appealed to troops and left no doubt about his approach to war. After leading troops in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, he told an audience in San Diego in 2005 that he relished fighting. Mattis appointment as Defense secretary would signal wartime posture \"Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot,\" Mattis said. \"It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling. You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\" Those remarks earned him a rebuke from his superiors but didn\u2019t stop his ascent to the military\u2019s most prestigious and taxing posts. Known as the \u201cWarrior Monk,\u201d Mattis also cultivates a bookish reputation. Mattis is a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and has continued to speak out about military policy in retirement. In 2014, he criticized the Obama administration\u2019s plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2016, a stand that it has abandoned in favor of leaving about 10,000 troops there to train local forces and fight terrorists. Deadlines for withdraw, Mattis said then, simply embolden American enemies. Mattis, Marines balked on lifesaving MRAP vehicles \u201cWe want to crush the enemy\u2019s hope to win through violence,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cYet we have now given the enemy hope that if they hang on until our announced withdrawal date they can perhaps come back.\u201d Mattis\u2019 views may mesh with Trump\u2019s calls to beef up the military and more aggressively prosecute the war against Islamic State terrorists. As Defense secretary, Mattis will inherit the ongoing air war in Iraq and Syria, as well as the thousands of U.S. troops on the ground there who training local forces and elite commandos who are targeting leaders of the terrorist organization, also known as ISIL. The war against Taliban insurgents and al Qaeda-linked terrorists in Afghanistan will grind on as well. He\u2019ll be responsible for more than 1 million active-duty troops and a budget of more than $600 billion annually. Also on his plate: the increasingly aggressive Russian military, which has seized Crimea from Ukraine and regularly harasses U.S. ships and warplanes operating in international waters and airspace in Europe; and China\u2019s mounting ambitions in the South China Sea where it has built artificial islands and fortified them with landing strips and troops. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates was in New York Thursday, and met with Michael Flynn, Trump's choice to be national security adviser. Gates' top priority at the Pentagon, while the wars raged in Iraq and Afghanistan, was the fielding of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to protect troops from roadside bombs. In 2005, Mattis was the top officer at the\u00a0Marine Corps command that allowed a request\u00a0to field the urgently needed combat trucks to languish.\u00a0A 2008 Pentagon\u00a0 inspector general report \u00a0singled out his\u00a0Marine Corps Combat Development Command\u00a0for failing to act on an urgent plea for MRAPs to replace vulnerable Humvees. It wasn't until 2007, after Gates read about the trucks' superior protection in a story in USA TODAY, that he forced the Pentagon bureaucracy to buy them to replace Humvees. The Pentagon and Gates\u00a0credit\u00a0MRAPs with saving the lives of thousands of troops. 6390 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 108 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2grmKIY ",

First, Trump leaves New York City for an event at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indianapolis alongside Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Both will announce their agreement reached with Carrier executives to keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S., which the company said is due in part to Trump's and Pence's personal lobbying as well as state tax incentives. Both Trump's transition team and the company have refused to publicly disclose the full details of the deal, while the president-elect's close aides have openly touted it as just the start of what Americans can expect from a Trump presidency. Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2016 Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 After Indianapolis, Trump then heads to Cincinnati, Ohio, where his tour kicks off at 7 p.m. ET. The rally will be Trump's first since his victory speech on Nov. 9. It is being held at U.S. Bank Arena, the site of one of Trump's largest rallies during the campaign. Trump's often boisterous behavior during rallies defined a large part of his campaign, though it's unclear whether he will use the same approach with his tour. In recent interviews, Trump has signaled some awareness of real divisions in the country following his surprise victory, though his Twitter feed has also revealed his frustration with both the recount effort in three states pushed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton 's wide lead in the popular vote. As he continues working with aides on the massive transition effort, Trump plans to visit states that he won and some where he didn't prevail, according to a Trump official. ",

Joe McKnight rushed for more than 2,200 yards in his USC career. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Zach Helfand Contact Reporter Former USC running back Joe McKnight was shot and killed in Terrytown, La., a town outside New Orleans, on Thursday afternoon, according to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. The incident is being investigated as a possible road rage incident, said Colonel John Fortunato, a police spokesman. Fortunato said police have identified the suspect as Ronald Gasser, a 54-year-old white male, who remained on the scene and is being questioned by homicide detectives. According to a report by the NOLA.com, an eyewitness in Terrytown saw two men in an argument near an intersection. One man was yelling at a second man trying to apologize. The eyewitness said the man who had been yelling shot the second man multiple times, then said, \"I told you don't you f--- with me,\" before firing on the man again. Fortunato said the incident took place at 2:43 p.m. CST. McKnight, 28, committed to USC under then-coach Pete Carroll from River Ridge, La., as the next in the line of USC playmakers like Reggie Bush . He played at USC for three seasons before turning professional. McKnight amassed\u00a02,755 yards and 15 touchdowns rushing and receiving and another two touchdowns as a returner. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL draft by the New York Jets , where he spent three up-and-down seasons before moving to the Kansas City Chiefs and then the Miami Dolphins in 2013. A torn Achilles\u2019 tendon in 2014 ended his NFL career. In 2016, he played for the Edmonton Eskimos and Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. McKnight is the second NFL player this year to die as a result of a possible road-rage incident. Saints player Will Smith was killed in April.\u00a0 McKnight\u2019s relationship with USC was somewhat strained after he was not allowed to play in the final game of his junior season, in 2009, while USC investigated him for allegedly receiving improper benefits. He would leave USC soon afterward. USC\u2019s current and former players and coaches have reacted with notes of shock and sadness on social media. USC Coach Clay Helton posted, \"Saddens me to hear the news about Joe McKnight. Our prayers go out to the McKnight family.\" Brian Cushing , one of McKnight's USC teammates, wrote, in part, \"I'm absolutely crushed to hear the news today about you being gone. I'll never forget what you accomplished and how far you came as a player and a person.\" Bush said on Twitter, \"this one hurts bad.\u201d ",

    "text": "Email A 7-year-old girl died Thursday after a school van that had stopped to pick up children was rear-ended by a truck on a rural East Texas highway, officials said, and 10 students and the van driver were injured. The Trinity County Sheriff's Office identified the child on its Facebook page as Journey Magness, daughter of Deputy David Magness. Authorities in Trinity County, which is about 75 miles north of Houston, believe the uninjured 17-year-old driver of the pickup truck was temporarily blinded by the sun as her truck came over a hill, crashing into the stopped van at about 7:30 a.m. \"The best as we can tell, the sun is going to play a big, major role in this,\" Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace said. The 7-year-old girl was riding in the van and died at a hospital. Ten children from the van and the pickup truck \u2014 ages 5 to 15 years old \u2014 were taken to a hospital, along with the van driver, East Texas Medical Center spokeswoman Rebecca Berkley said. All were treated and released by Thursday afternoon, Berkley said. A statement Thursday on the Trinity ISD website said the safety of students and staff is the highest priority and the student who died was being mourned. The accident comes nearly two weeks after six children died and several were injured in Chattanooga, Tennessee , when their school bus crashed on a curvy road. The bus driver faces vehicular homicide charges. 0 Shares ",

Kirk Siegler/NPR hide caption toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR The Tri-Pro Forest Products facility in Orofino, Idaho, closed in October after operators said they didn't have a steady enough supply of logs to keep the sawmill running and profitable. Kirk Siegler/NPR A few weeks before the election, the Tri-Pro lumber mill in north Idaho shut down . It was the second mill to close in the area in six months, putting more than a hundred people out of work. While that's big economic loss for any community, it was especially tough for the tight-knit town of Orofino and its 3,000 or so residents. \"It's going to be a struggle, quite honestly,\" says Mike Reggear, the supply manager and only employee left on the Tri-Pro payroll. The mill officially closed Oct. 4, after operating on the site in one incarnation or another for nearly 60 years. The shuttered lumberyard is now eerily quiet as Reggear ties up some loose ends; the old mill, kilns and saws are ready to be hauled out. \"There were living-wage jobs [with good benefits] that have now been lost,\" Reggear says, shaking his head. Enlarge this image Like most people in Clearwater County, where Orofino is located, Mike Reggear has spent his entire life working in the timber business. \"Clearwater County has taken a double shot to the nose,\" he says, following the closure of two mills that left more than a hundred people out of work.

Kirk Siegler/NPR The story behind Tri-Pro's closure is an all-too-familiar one lately in north Idaho: Reggear says there just wasn't a steady enough supply of logs available locally to keep the sawmill running and profitable. The amount of federal land open to logging has dwindled since the 1980s, and imports from Canada are cheaper. Article continues after sponsorship But just like any economic story in rural America today, it's more complicated than that. And even in Idaho's deeply conservative timber country, there are mixed feelings over whether President-elect Donald Trump can do much to turn things around. Changing Times Timber towns like Orofino, situated along railroad lines and rivers, were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when it seemed like there was a limitless supply of timber in the Northwest woods. The federal government \u2014 and specifically the U.S. Forest Service, run as an extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 was in the business of actively promoting logging. Enlarge this image Timber mill towns like Orofino were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when the timber supply in national forests seemed limitless. Today many federal lands are closed to logging, and unemployment rates in these towns are among the highest in Idaho.

Today many federal lands are closed to logging, and unemployment rates in these towns are among the highest in Idaho. Kirk Siegler/NPR The environmental mood of the country is significantly different today. So is the economy \u2014 mechanization, for instance, has meant that fewer people are needed to log in the woods or work in the mills. At best, logging is a seasonal occupation, says Jerry Spencer, \"so you try to diversify a little bit \u2014 because you can't live on [work] eight months a year.\" One night over Coors Lights at the Ponderosa Restaurant, Spencer says he feels lucky he still can find work as an independent contractor, logging in the woods when he can. Spencer and one of his buddies had been splitting time between north Idaho and the oil fields in North Dakota and Wyoming, where they drove trucks. Then oil prices tanked. He's not too eager to talk politics, but Spencer says he's glad Donald Trump won. ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times There is a Washington tradition of presidents calling on a Goldman Sachs luminary to take the reins of the economy, including the Democrat Robert E. Rubin in 1995 and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Republican, in 2006. Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Goldman pedigree is as good as it gets, given that his father, Robert, was a pioneer in stock trading who spent 35 years at the firm. While the Goldman brand may have initially attracted Mr. Trump, for the broader financial community it is Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s track record at hedge and private equity funds, which is where the real money is made on Wall Street these days, that makes him appealing. \u201cMnuchin as Treasury secretary is somebody who can speak to bankers \u2014 Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein, James Gorman and Brian Moynihan. He can speak their language,\u201d said Gary Kaminsky, a former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, referring to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. \u201cHe comes from a trading desk, and that\u2019s something that is very strong,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky, who has attended fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, added. While there is little doubt that Mr. Mnuchin can speak the language of Wall Street, he has had little experience running large, complex bureaucracies. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Paulson had ascended to the top at Goldman, and had many years of experience managing people and organizations under their belt. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mnuchin did assume a leading role in the restructuring and reinventing of IndyMac, now known as OneWest, a California mortgage giant that collapsed in 2008. He and partners acquired the firm and later made billions. After he moved from New York to the West Coast, Mr. Mnuchin was targeted by protesters who claimed that the bank was too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Last year the bank was sold to the CIT Group, a small-business lender run at the time by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain. Photo The president-elect with Todd Ricketts, another investor, who will be a deputy at Commerce. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times In a statement announcing his economic appointments, Mr. Trump highlighted the deal. \u201cHe purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital,\u201d he said of Mr. Mnuchin. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin has faced other controversies. In 2010, he and his brother, Alan, were sued over their mother\u2019s early investment with Bernard L. Madoff, an investor who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme . The lawsuit, filed by a trustee for Madoff victims, alleged that $3.2 million of the money Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from his mother\u2019s account shortly after she died belonged to other victims. The lawsuit was dropped last year because of a time limit. Hollywood has been another reinvention for Mr. Mnuchin. In 2006, he and a partner, Chip Seelig, struck a deal through their company Dune Entertainment to invest $325 million in 28 movies produced by 20th Century Fox. It was a successful partnership; Fox delivered hits (made in part with Dune\u2019s money) like \u201cAvatar,\u201d which took in $2.8 billion worldwide in 2009. After breaking with Mr. Seelig in 2012, Mr. Mnuchin teamed up with a company called RatPac, owned by the rowdy filmmaker Brett Ratner and the Australian billionaire James Packer. Mr. Ratner was then notorious in Hollywood; he resigned as a producer of the Academy Awards in 2011 after using an anti-gay slur at a public event and making frank remarks about his sex life on Howard Stern\u2019s radio show. (He apologized .) But together the three men formed a vehicle to invest $450 million in an extensive array of Warner Bros. movies. Some have been major hits, like \u201cGravity,\u201d which took in $723.2 million. But there have also been money losers, including \u201cPan\u201d and \u201cIn the Heart of the Sea.\u201d Still, Mr. Mnuchin has clearly enjoyed a Hollywood lifestyle, whether attending celebrity-filled parties at the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the Cannes Film Festival or going in with a movie industry friend to buy a Dassault Falcon 50 jet (since sold). He can currently be seen in a cameo \u2014 playing a Merrill Lynch executive \u2014 in Warren Beatty\u2019s new movie \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Beyond the entertainment industry, there other similarities between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin. They are both twice divorced, and their third partners are decidedly younger. (Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is Louise Linton, a 34-year-old actress from Scotland.) They also both have a taste for landmark Manhattan real estate: Trump Tower for the president-elect and 740 Park Avenue for Mr. Mnuchin. But there are differences, too. Despite his Hollywood appetites, Mr. Mnuchin is described by people who know him as slightly awkward and not one to command a room. Friends of the two men describe them more as social and professional acquaintances than close friends. The names of flashier prospects had been floated as possible candidates for Treasury, according to a fund manager close to the president-elect\u2019s economic brain trust. Among them: Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Jonathan Gray of Blackstone, Jamie Dimon, Mitt Romney, and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. of Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based real estate investor who has been close to Mr. Trump for decades. Brooks Barnes and Neil Irwin contributed reporting.

Learn what the Electoral College is in under a minute. USA TODAY NETWORK U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis (Photo: Stan Carroll) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee thinks it\u2019s time to do away with the Electoral College . The Memphis Democrat filed a constitutional amendment Thursday that calls for eliminating the electoral college and allowing for direct election of the president and vice president. The congressman\u2019s amendment comes as Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote in last month\u2019s presidential election topped 2.5 million. Clinton lost the electoral college \u2014\u00a0and the presidency \u2014\u00a0to Republican Donald Trump. Harassment or Hail Mary? Electors feel besieged \u201cFor the second time in recent memory, and for the fifth time in our history, we have a president-elect, who lost the popular vote,\u201d said Cohen, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. \u201cThe Electoral College is an antiquated system that was established to prevent citizens from directly electing our nation\u2019s president, yet that notion is antithetical to our understanding of democracy,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIn our country, \u2018We the People\u2019 are supposed to determine who represents us in elective office.\u201d The legislation is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Congress. It would need two-thirds approval in both the House and the Senate and would then have to be ratified by 38 of the 50 states. Cohen noted that the Founding Fathers established the electoral college in an era of limited communication. The college was premised on the theory that citizens would have a better chance of knowing about electors from their home states than about presidential candidates from out-of-state. ",

The police officer was shot several times in the line of duty Wednesday around 4 p.m. local time while responding to a domestic disturbance, according to ABC affiliate KOMO in Seattle. He was rushed to a local hospital, where he later died. Officers called for backup shortly after responding to the disturbance and quickly reported shots fired, the Tacoma Police Department told KOMO . A law enforcement helicopter, patrol cars and officers from multiple state and local agencies responded to the shooting and surrounded the home, where the suspect barricaded himself with a rifle, police said. Police Officer Shot in Washington State Dies at Hospital The tense standoff ended this morning around 3:30 local time after the suspect was killed. Two children who were inside the home at the time have been removed, according to Detective Ed Troyer of the Pierce County Sheriff\u2019s Department. He did not provide details about what led to the shooting, but he said no other police officers were harmed and the neighborhood is now safe. ABC News\u2019 Kelly Johnstone and J.J.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joined with Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the committee that oversees government operations , in sending a letter Thursday to the General Services Administration, which in 2013 awarded a lease to the Trump organization to redevelop and run a hotel in the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump committed $200 million to transform the historic building into a hotel, and in return received the exclusive rights to run the hotel and keep the profits for a period of at least 60 years.

First, critics say, that would mean the Trump organization would be negotiating annual rent payments with federal bureaucrats who work for Donald Trump. And second, the GSA lease includes a standard provision stating that \"No\u2026elected official of the Government of the United States\u2026shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom\u2026\" \"Federal procurement officials include this clause in lease agreements to avoid the appearance of favoritism or preferential treatment toward federal officials,\" Warren and Carper write. \"GSA officials managing the agreement are required to balance their duties to execute the terms of the contract entered into with the building's tenant while also protecting the interests of the building's landlord.\" However, the senators continued, \"once President-elect Trump assumes office, he will oversee GSA and have the authority to appoint a new GSA Administrator, which will effectively make President-elect Trump landlord and tenant at the same time. Terms of the agreement also require annual disclosures of sensitive financial information and for GSA to renegotiate rent adjustments and other payments to the Trump Organization. Such a scenario will present unmanageable conflicts of interest for career GSA officials and President-elect Trump and result in a breach of plain language of the lease agreement.\" Warren and Carper add that the GSA's relationship with President-elect Trump \"is also complicated by two provisions in the Constitution prohibiting the President from receiving additional 'emoluments' salaries, fees, or profits \u2014 from either the U.S. or foreign governments.\" They point out that Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution, states: \"The President shall\u2026receive for his Services, a Compensation\u2026and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.\" And Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution \u2014 often referred to as the \"Emoluments Clause\"\u2014states: \"[N]o Person holding any Office\u2026shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument...of any kind whatever, from any...foreign State.\" If the current lease agreement remains in place, the senators say, President-elect Trump \"will receive compensation from the federal government separate from his annual salary, which is prohibited by the Constitution.\" Carper and Warren are also concerned, they write, that foreign governments are paying for their official representatives to stay at what is known as the Trump International Hotel because the property is affiliated with the incoming President. The Kingdom of Bahrain, for example, recently booked space at the Trump Hotel for a reception, they write. \"Once he takes office, payments from these foreign governments to entities owned by President-elect Trump would likely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause prohibition of payments from foreign governments,\" the senators say. The senators say they see no evidence that GSA took steps to plan for this difficult scenario while Trump campaigned to be president, and they are demanding answers that GSA so far has refused to provide about what legal conclusions have been reached by government ethics lawyers. In November, the GSA told Buzzfeed that \"Prior to Mr. Trump taking the oath of office, GSA plans to coordinate with the President-elect's transition team to allow a plan to be put in place to identify and address any potential conflict of interest relating to the Old Post Office building.\" Trump has promised that he will discuss how he plans to deal with his business interests at a Dec. 15 news conference. During the campaign, he accused Democrat Hillary Clinton of \"corruption,\" for, among other things, the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of contributions from foreign governments. Ken Dilanian ",

Eleven hostages were rescued, authorities said, adding that no one was injured. WFOX Police are reporting a hostage situation at the Community First Credit Union in Jacksonville, Florida, Dec. 1, 2016. Gary McCullough/AP Photo Law enforcement personnel gather near the Community First Credit Union bank, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Jacksonville, Fla., where authorities say a bank robber was holding several hostages. The incident began with a gunman taking hostages inside a Community First Credit Union branch. As the situation unfolded, the suspect released a couple of hostages but continued to threaten people, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference. He said the suspect threatened to kill hostages multiple times and put a gun to the back of hostages' heads a couple of times.

Will Dickey/The Florida Times-Union via AP Police officers escort hostages safely across the street after a gunman held them during an attempted robbery at Community First Credit Union, Dec. 1, 2016, in Jacksonville, Florida. At one point, two hostages tried to flee, which distracted the suspect, and that's when SWAT team members stormed into the bank, taking the suspect into custody, Williams said. @NewsShelby/First Coast News Emergency vehicles are seen in near a reported hostage situation in Jacksonville, Florida, Dec. 1, 2016. While the situation was resolved peacefully, the victims \u2014 employees and bank customers \u2014 are \"shaken up,\" Williams said. The suspect is not a bank employee, he added.

Our hearts and prayers are with the families and membership.\" WFOX Police are reporting a hostage situation at the Community First Credit Union in Jacksonville, Florida, Dec. 1, 2016. While the hostage situation was unfolding, the mother of a bank employee told local news station First Coast News that she hadn't been able to reach her 45-year-old daughter, who she knew left for work that morning. \"I don't know what is going on,\" the employee's mother said, appearing emotional. \"She just had a birthday.\" @NewsShelby/First Coast News This photograph shows a woman whose daughter was feared to be inside the bank during a hostage situation in Jacksonville, Florida, Dec. 1, 2016. Directly across the street from the bank, staff members and children huddled inside a church and day care building.

    "text": "Not long after Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence departed for the airport and to another rally in Ohio to celebrate his victory, workers coming in for the night shift received a letter titled \u201cCompany Update on Indianapolis Operations.\u201d Photo \u201cIt sets a great tone,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview as he toured the Carrier factory after the announcement that 1,100 jobs would remain there. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is great for America.\u201d Credit A J Mast for The New York Times \u201cWhile this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cWe are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with the expected completion by the end of 2017.\u201d United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s parent, saw the writing on the wall as soon as Mr. Trump declared victory last month. Offering to preserve jobs, even at the cost of some of the $65 million savings the company expected from the move, could serve its larger corporate interests. \u201cEvery penny counts, but if we step back and I\u2019m looking at earnings of $6.60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-elect listens to some of the company\u2019s bigger concerns,\u201d said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York. And Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, while providing a carrot through the state incentives and promises of future business tax cuts, held an implicit stick: the threat of pulling federal contracts from Carrier\u2019s parent, United Technologies. Mr. Trump and his team were well aware that the amount United Technologies stood to lose in those contracts dwarfed the savings from moving some of its operations to Monterrey from Indiana. Despite only accomplishing half of what had been promised in the campaign, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence predicted that the number of jobs ultimately preserved could rise as Carrier follows through on its promise to invest more than $16 million in the state. That provision, plus the incentives, were worked out between Carrier and officials from the state of Indiana\u2019s economic development office, with Mr. Pence overseeing the process. Trump and the Carrier Factory In February, Carrier told its workers in Indiana that it would move 1,400 jobs making furnaces and heating equipment to Mexico. Donald J. Trump, then a candidate, seized on the issue and made the planned move a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade. The vice president-elect insisted that the incentives did not represent a giveaway on Mr. Trump\u2019s part, and claimed United Technologies had turned down a similar-size package of breaks in March. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What made the difference, he said, was Mr. Trump\u2019s public pressure, as well his promise to cut corporate taxes and ease regulation. \u201cThese jobs were gone,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cI sat the executives down in my governor\u2019s office in the statehouse in early March. They said we aren\u2019t in a position to reconsider this in any way, shape or form.\u201d Mr. Trump, too, played down the role of the incentives. And he said he did not directly raise the $5 billion to $6 billion in federal contracts United Technologies receives, much of it from the Pentagon. But company officials are acutely aware that its Pratt & Whitney unit, among other things, supplies jet engines to the Air Force\u2019s most advanced fighter and many other planes, making it much more vulnerable to political pressure than other, lesser-known manufacturers that have been steadily closing shop in the Midwest and moving production south of the border. \u201cIt may have a played a role in their equation,\u201d Mr. Trump allowed. \u201cI never mentioned it. I didn\u2019t feel I had to.\u201d What about the fact that Mr. Trump frequently sourced products for his properties overseas, along with some popular Trump-branded merchandise? Will he lead by example and buy more goods made in the U.S.A.? \u201cI buy thousands and thousands of TVs,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to, but they essentially don\u2019t make them in the U.S. You know the hats I do? It took us forever to find a company that can make a hat in the U.S.\u201d ",

    "text": "Email NEW STANTON, Pa. -- A 14-year-old boy is accused of shooting his mother and 8-year-old brother once each in the forehead as they slept and calling 911 to insinuate his father did it, Pennsylvania state police said Thursday. The 14-year-old called 911 just before 7 a.m. Wednesday, saying his mom and younger brother were dead and his father placed a gun in his bed before leaving the house, State Police Trooper Stephen Limani said at a news conference. The 14-year-old later told officers he took a gun from atop the refrigerator, loaded it and then shot Dana Remaley and Caleb Remaley after his father, David, went to work, police said. Remaley also allegedly told police he would have shot his father, too, had he been at the home, about 25 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.\u00a0 An ambulance was first to arrive on the scene Wednesday. Workers gave the teen a blanket and started to question him when he went back inside the home to get the firearm, Limani said. Since the workers aren\u2019t trained to deal with someone with a gun, they retreated from the home until troopers responded. During the time before troopers arrived, the 14-year-old apparently retrieved the gun and was walking down the street carrying it when he encountered neighbor, police said. That neighbor engaged the boy in conversation, leading him to discard the gun and approach officers, Limani said.\u00a0 \u201cThat neighbor did a very good job in de-escalating the situation,\u201d Limani said. \u201cThe last thing we want to do is approach a 14-year-old with a firearm.\u201d\u00a0 The only indication of a motive is that the teen and his parents weren\u2019t getting along lately, Limani said. However, his relationship with his little brother was seemingly good, especially considering their age difference, he said.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a very horrific time, a very difficult time for this particular family and the community here in New Stanton. To have two individuals shot in their home while they are sleeping, it\u2019s very traumatic,\u201d said Limani, according to CBS Pittsburgh .\u00a0 A friend of the family described the 14-year-old as a polite, kind, straight-A student who was involved in sports and in church. Anita Stoner told WTAE-TV her son is a good friend of the boy\u2019s, and she was friends with Dana Remaley. \u201cHe\u2019s such a good kid,\u201d she said. She said Dana Remaley was generous and always willing to lend a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do without her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was always there for me.\u201d The 14-year-old was still being medically treated Thursday, and mental health evaluations were pending, Limani said. He is awaiting arraignment on two counts each of criminal homicide and first-degree murder, charged as an adult. No attorney information is available. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Newslook In this Aug. 21, 2015, file photo, Army 1st Lt. Shaye Haver, center, and Capt. Kristen Griest, right, pose for photos with other female West Point alumni after an Army Ranger school graduation ceremony at Fort Benning, Ga. Haver and Griest became the first female graduates of the Army's rigorous Ranger School. The decision by the Pentagon to allow women to serve in all combat jobs has put new focus on an often-forgotten U.S. institution: the Selective Service. While America has not had a military draft since 1973, all men must register with the Selective Service within 30 days of turning 18. U.S. leaders repeatedly insist that the all-volunteer force is working and the nation is not returning to the draft. But there are increasing rumblings about whether women should now be required to register if they can indeed serve in all areas of the military. (Photo: John Bazemore, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama supports requiring women to register for Selective Service when they turn 18\u00a0\u2014 becoming the first president to endorse universal draft registration since Jimmy Carter. \"As old barriers for military service are being removed, the administration supports\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as a logical next step\u00a0\u2014\u00a0women registering for the Selective Service,\" said Ned Price, a spokesman for Obama's National Security Council. The White House had previously expressed neutrality on the controversy, but took a position in a statement to USA TODAY on Thursday. But the timing of Obama's support makes it mostly symbolic, coming in the final weeks of his presidency and the day before the House will vote on a defense policy bill that strips a Senate-passed provision to add women to Selective Service. Instead, the compromise version now calls only for a commission to study two related issues: Whether women should be included in Selective Service, and whether the Selective Service system itself should be abolished. The White House made clear that Obama supports an all-volunteer force, and there are no plans to re-institute the draft. But Obama believes adding women to the draft would serve two purposes: showing a commitment to gender equality throughout the armed services, and fostering a sense of public service that comes from requiring draft registration as a ritual of adulthood. The Pentagon also expressed its support for a universal draft Thursday. \"It makes sense for women to register for Selective Service just as men must,\" said spokesman Peter Cook. Defense Secretary Ash Carter opened all combat roles to women earlier this year, which \"only strengthens our all-volunteer force by giving us access to 100% of America's population so we can recruit and retain the most qualified individuals,\" Cook said. Removing the ban on women in all combat roles opened more than 200,000 jobs to women, most of them in Army and Marine infantry units. As a practical matter, women troops have been exposed to combat conditions for a long time. More than 280,000 women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan out of nearly 2.5 million troops. In those wars, 152 women have died in battle or from non-combat causes and more than 950 have been wounded in action. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, had no comment on the White House announcement, said Dustin Walker, a spokesman. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., applauded the announcement. \"We need to remove arbitrary barriers to service by women in our armed forces,\" Reed said in a statement. \"There is no draft in today's military, but it is difficult to say we have true equality if we continue with a Selective Service system that only requires compulsory service from men.\" Sen. Mitch McConnell supports having women register for draft Kate Germano, chief operating officer of the Service Women's Action Network and a retired Marine officer, said her advocacy group views the White House announcement as a significant step toward improving national security. The draft would only be revived in time of a national emergency, and excluding women would mean lesser qualified men would be selected over women for the fight, she said. \"That doesn't make sense,\" Germano said. \"We support this wholeheartedly.\" Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the White House stand has value even it doesn't become policy. \"It\u2019s symbolic,\" O'Hanlon said. \"But it\u2019s a good statement.\" No one has been drafted into the military since 1973\u00a0\u2014 and indeed the last\u00a0enlisted man\u00a0drafted into the military retired years ago. \u200bBut\u00a0Selective Service can still have far-reaching consequences for young men and\u00a0\u2014 under the policy change now supported by Obama\u00a0\u2014 young women. Those who fail to register for the draft can be denied federal student aid and loans, security clearances, government employment and\u00a0job training programs. For immigrants, failing to register can be a roadblock to citizenship. Three-quarters of states make Selective Service a requirement for driver's licenses and other government benefits. For Obama, adding women to the draft would also eliminate an inconsistency in the administration's\u00a0policy on transgender status. The Education Department, for example, is pressuring schools to recognize a student's self-identified gender. But current Selective Service say the sex at birth determines whether someone is subject to the registration requirement. Subjecting women to Selective Service has long made for intriguing politics, often fraught with ulterior motives. Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., has introduced bills for years that would add women to the draft\u00a0\u2014 but then also require a draft any time Congress declares war or\u00a0authorizes military force for conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan. His calculation: Requiring a draft would make Congress less likely to go to war in the first place. Senior military officials, over the years, say they prefer\u00a0the volunteer force for\u00a0its professionalism. Draft women? Why not?: Column On the other side of the spectrum is Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., a hawkish conservative and member of the Armed Services Committee who proposed adding women to the draft earlier this year. But his proposal was essentially offered as a dare, attempting to force an\u00a0election-year vote on a policy he opposes. Hunter\u00a0blasted the White House announcement on Thursday as \"purely politics, one last jab,\" given the action taken by Congress. Hunter noted that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, had opposed opening Marine infantry units to women in his previous post as commandant. \"The military doesn't support this,\" Hunter said. The incoming Trump administration is likely to review and potentially repeal allowing women to serve in ground combat units, Hunter said. The Senate version of the defense policy bill, which includes a provision\u00a0requiring\u00a0women to register for the draft, passed in June, 83-15.\u00a0In July, the House voted 217-203 to remove the provision from its version of the bill. A conference committee hashed out a compromise bill this week. It was President Franklin Roosevelt who first proposed drafting women in order to address a shortage of military nurses in World War II. \"Since volunteering has not produced the number of nurses required, I urge that the Selective Service Act be amended to provide for the induction of nurses into the armed forces,\" he said in his 1945 State of the Union Address . \"The need is too pressing to await the outcome of further efforts at recruiting.\" Two months later, the House passed a bill to draft nurses,\u00a0347 to 42, but the bill died in the Senate, and the war soon ended. In 1981, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in\u00a0Rostker v. Goldberg that an all-male draft was constitutional, with\u00a0Justice William Rehnquist writing in a 6-3 decision that because Congress had excluded women from some combat roles, it was reasonable for Congress not require that they be subject to the draft.

Fernando Avila kneels at a makeshift memorial for Charly Leundeu Keunang a day after the 43-year-old was shot and killed by LAPD officers on skid row in 2015. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Kate Mather Contact Reporter Prosecutors have concluded that Los Angeles police officers were legally justified in shooting a homeless man last year on skid row, a videotaped killing that attracted international attention and renewed the local debate over interactions between police and L.A.\u2019s homeless population. The district attorney\u2019s office found\u00a0that the officers \u2014 Sgt. Chand Syed and Officers Francisco Martinez and Daniel Torres \u2014\u00a0reasonably believed Charly Leundeu Keunang posed a lethal threat during the March 1, 2015 shooting. Their decision was outlined in a 22-page memo obtained by The Times on Thursday. Prosecutors said video from a body camera worn by the sergeant\u00a0showed that\u00a0Keunang had wrapped his fingers around the butt of\u00a0a rookie officer\u2019s holstered gun while wrestling with police, saying he was \u201crapidly gaining control\u201d of the weapon.\u00a0Even if he didn\u2019t have complete control of the gun, they wrote, it could have easily fired as the struggle continued. The officers \u201cacted lawfully in self-defense and in defense of others,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the Nov. 9\u00a0memo explaining why they were not charging the officers. \u201cKeunang posed a high likelihood of killing officers and civilians at the very instant that he was shot.\u201d Read: Prosecutors explain why they won\u2019t charge LAPD officers in skid row shooting Open link It is rare for prosecutors to charge law enforcement officers in connection with on-duty shootings. The L.A. County district attorney\u2019s office hasn\u2019t pursued charges in such a case\u00a0 since 2000 . The death of Keunang, a 43-year-old Cameroonian national known on skid\u00a0row\u00a0as \u201cAfrica,\u201d was seen around the world after\u00a0a bystander posted video of the shooting on Facebook, drawing millions of views. The recording\u00a0shows police struggling with Keunang on the ground before at least five gunshots echo loudly. The shooting underscored the challenges police face when patrolling the sprawling tent encampments of skid row, where mental illness and drug use are common. It also renewed\u00a0complaints among those who live on skid row and their advocates, who have long accused police of too quickly resorting to heavy-handed tactics. Nevertheless, after reviewing the video and other evidence, the Police Commission decided earlier this year that the officers did not violate the LAPD\u2019s rules for using deadly force. The panel did, however, fault the rookie cop \u2014 Joshua Volasgis \u2014 for failing to maintain control of his gun and baton. The events leading up to Keunang\u2019s death began when someone called 911 and reported an attempted robbery and assault along South San Pedro Street, authorities said. There, the caller identified Keunang as the suspect, telling officers he had also threatened him with a baseball bat. Keunang became aggressive during the encounter, according to reports from the LAPD\u2019s chief and inspector general made public earlier this year. He clenched his fists and raised his voice, ignoring commands from officers and repeating, \u201cLet me express myself.\u201d The officers repeatedly warned Keunang he would be Tased if he did not calm down, the reports said. At one point, Keunang walked back into his tent. Two sergeants pulled the tent open as Keunang grabbed a cellphone from inside. One officer then used a Taser, the reports said, but it didn't appear to have an effect. Instead, Keunang charged an officer and began swinging his arms, the reports said. One officer punched Keunang in the face, and he was taken to the ground. A Taser was used on Keunang  again. At some point, the rookie officer said, he felt Keunang grab his holstered pistol. \u201cHe's got my gun,\u201d the officer yelled. \u201cMy gun, he's got my gun.\u201d Keunang was stuck by gunfire six times, according to his autopsy report. His family has filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the officers, accusing police of using excessive force.

    "text": "By Crimesider Staff AP December 1, 2016, 4:24 PM Utah parents disarm teen son who brought family's guns to school Parents arrive to pick up their children after a student brought a shotgun and a handgun to at Utah junior high school Jeremy Harris/KUTV Email http://www.cbsnews.com/news/teen-in-utah-school-stabbing-charged-with-attempted-murder/ BOUNTIFUL, Utah -- Police said two fast-acting Utah parents disarmed their 15-year-old son in the hallway of a Utah junior high school Thursday after the teenager brought the family\u2019s shotgun and handgun to school, discharging at least one round without injuring anyone. Bountiful Police Chief Tom Ross said the boy\u2019s mother and father became concerned about their son Thursday morning. They went to Mueller Park Junior High in the northern Utah city of Bountiful when they noticed a handgun and shotgun were missing from their home. Ross said the parents confronted their son in a school hallway and disarmed him. Police were still trying to learn whether the student intentionally fired the gun or if the weapon went off accidentally while the parents intervened. Ross said he\u2019s \u201cextremely grateful for the parents for their involvement and the fact that this ended without any loss of life.\u201d Police did not immediately release the student\u2019s identity. Ross would only say that the student was a 15-year-old white male. Ross did not immediately have details about whether anyone else was around when the incident occurred but he says students were in classes nearby. Ross did not know whether a gun fired more than once or how the parents disarmed their son or their specific concerns about him. Ross did not know why the student brought the weapons to the school or what he intended. Police had not been contacted before about the boy, Ross said. As the parents intervened, a teacher called 911 and a police officer who happened to be down the street arrived and took custody of the student soon after, police said. Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams praised the parents, saying \u201cIt\u2019s all of our jobs to keep kids safe.\u201d Williams had no immediate information about the student or whether the student had any history of trouble or incidents at the school, but, \u201cWhoever it is certainly faces a lot of trouble.\u201d Ross said the student was in custody Thursday morning, but he did not know if the student was still being questioned at the school or in another location. He did not know if the student had been arrested on suspicion of any specific charges. Ross said the student\u2019s parents remained \u201cwith their son through the process.\u201d The school, about 11 miles north of Salt Lake City, remained on lockdown as more than 100 officers went room-by-room through the building to ensure it was safe. Police found a backpack in the hallway and wanted to ensure it did not contain any explosives, Ross said. It was unclear if the backpack belonged to the student. Ross said no other student appears to have been involved. Several hundred parents arrived and waited in the snow across the street from the school for word from police and administrators about when they could pick up their children. They later packed into a church across the street to sign up to take their children home. School officials began allowing parents to take students home around 11 a.m. Candy Beckstead said she was at a dentist\u2019s office when her sister called to tell her that there was something going on at her son\u2019s school. She didn\u2019t hear from her 8th-grade son but rushed to the school. \u201cI freaked out and went into panic mode,\u201d she said. \u201cScreaming, crying.\u201d The incident comes about two weeks after another Utah student stabbed five random high school classmates and himself before he was cornered by school workers, according to police. The victims and the 16-year-old suspect survived the wounds. The teen has been charged with five counts of attempted murder in connection with the Nov. 15 rampage at a school in Orem, about 50 miles south of Mueller Park Junior High. Police also arrested a teenager in late October after he shot an older boy twice in the head in a fight over a girl near another Utah middle school. Charges against the 14-year-old include attempted murder and weapons violations. The Associated Press is not naming the boys because it does not normally name juvenile defendants. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Aldrin had fluid in his lungs when he landed but was responding well to antibiotics, according to White Desert Antarctica, the tour company Aldrin traveled with. His condition is stable, but he will be kept overnight for observation, the tour company said, adding that Aldrin is in \"good spirits.\" Video from TVNZ shows Aldrin being transferred from a Safair cargo plane to an ambulance upon arriving in Christchurch at just before 6 a.m. local time. He was then transferred to a medical facility, according to the National Science Foundation. Aldrin, 86, was visiting the South Pole as part of a tourist group when \u201chis condition deteriorated\u201d and it was decided that he should be evacuated as a \u201cprecaution,\u201d according to White Desert. Aldrin\u2019s \u201ccondition was described as stable\u201d when he was handed over to the U.S. Antarctic Program medical team and evacuated. He was accompanied by a member of his team and was under the care of a doctor with the U.S. Antarctic Program, White Desert said. The National Science Foundation said it provided the \u201chumanitarian medical evacuation flight\u201d for the \u201cailing\u201d former astronaut. The U.S. government agency flew out Aldrin from its Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to McMurdo Station on the Antarctic coast. From there, Aldrin embarked on the flight to New Zealand. In 1969, Aldrin became one of the first men to ever set foot on the moon as part of the famed Apollo 11 mission, accompanying Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins. The New Jersey native posted pictures on his official Twitter account earlier this week showing him preparing for his trip to Antarctica. Aldrin posted a series of photos to social media on Tuesday as he departed Cape Town International Airport for Antarctica.

Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters confirmed the three deaths at a news conference Thursday afternoon. But he offered some good news: Search crews have found \"quite a few\" of the 70 or so people who were reported missing. Seventy-four people have been treated for injuries, and some remain in hospitals, officials said. The state Emergency Management Agency said almost 8,500 customers remained without power Thursday in Sevier County.

Officials said crews were making significant progress in the search and clearing operations, which have been slowed by mud and rockslides caused by the wet weather. Many county businesses were back open Thursday, and all but two county schools will be open Friday, officials said. Gatlinburg Mayor Mike Werner, who lost his own home, described the community as \"mountain tough, telling NBC station WBIR of Knoxville: \"It's a huge bump in the road, but we're going to be OK. We're going to be OK.\" Photos: Smoky Mountains Charred by Three Days of Fires Authorities had previously said seven people were dead. The family of one of them identified her to NBC News on Thursday as Alice Hagler, 70. Officials have identified Alice Hagler, 70, as one of the victims of the fire that devastated Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. Courtesy of Hagler family Hagler was last heard from on Monday night, when she was on the phone with a son at her home in Gatlinburg and the line went dead, WBIR reported . \"My mother called me frantically that the house was on fire, yelling that the house was on fire, and I told her to get out of the house,\" James Wood told the station. He tried desperately to return to the cabin where they lived, but he found that the inferno was too intense. \"I made my best to get to her,\" Wood said. \"The fires were absolutely, entirely impossible to get through up on Wiley Oakley Road. I did make it to the road, but two miles up I couldn't make it any further.\" Trevor Cates walks through the smoldering remains of the fellowship hall of Banner Missionary Baptist Church as he inspects damage Tuesday in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Brian Blanco / Getty Images Incident commanders said the blazes started with the human-caused Chimney 2 Fire, which was reported in the park Nov. 23. By Monday, the region's prolonged drought and extreme winds were causing the fire to spit out embers that quickly ignited numerous new fires, they said. Fire commanders said more than 700 structures in Sevier County have been damaged or destroyed \u2014 about 300 of them in Gatlinburg \u2014 and as many as 14,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes, authorities said. Rescue crews could finish searching Gatlinburg by Thursday night. City officials said owners, residents and renters will be allowed \"limited access\" to their properties, businesses and homes in some areas of the town Friday morning. Post by NBC News . President Barack Obama also spoke with Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and committed to providing any assistance to help fight the fire. The White House said the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant this week to mobilize resources. Major threatened areas include Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, the latter of which is home to Dollywood, the theme park named for country music superstar Dolly Parton. The attraction itself wasn't damaged, a spokesman said, but the fire came perilously close. The theme park could reopen Friday. Parton, a native of Sevier County, released a video Wednesday night pledging to pay $1,000 a month as part of the My People Fund to help families who lost their homes \"until they get back up on their feet.\" Play ",

Ted S. Warren/AP hide caption toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Howard Schultz, who is stepping down as CEO of Starbucks, speaks at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March. Ted S. Warren/AP Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks CEO: Can You 'Get Big And Stay Small'? Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Shares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. During a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. Schultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. ",

Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times Employees at the Anaplex Corp. in Paramount. The metal plant is one of two ordered by L.A. County health officials to stop endangering the health of the public. Employees at the Anaplex Corp. in Paramount. The metal plant is one of two ordered by L.A. County health officials to stop endangering the health of the public. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) Tony Barboza In a rare intervention, county health officials Thursday ordered two Paramount metal-processing plants to stop emissions of hexavalent chromium or shut down operations contributing to high levels of the cancer-causing air pollutant. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health directed Aerocraft Heat Treating Co. and Anaplex Corp. to \u201cimmediately take all necessary actions to eliminate the current nuisance endangering the health of the public, which may include full or partial suspension of operations.\u201d The orders come two days after \u00a0the facilities in the city southeast of Los Angeles were targeted with enforcement action by air quality regulators. The South Coast Air Quality Management District filed Tuesday for an administrative order to force the facilities to halt their emissions or shut down, accusing them of exposing Paramount residents to high cancer risks. Taken together, the moves mark a significant escalation by agencies that have been\u00a0criticized by residents for slow and weak action in addressing longstanding health concerns over pollution from metal plants operating close to homes and schools. Regulators\u00a0began studying\u00a0metal pollution in\u00a0the working-class community\u00a0several years ago but have not delivered on promises of new emissions rules\u00a0to protect residents. And until recently, most efforts had focused on\u00a0only one metal plant in a city with dozens. Then in late October, air monitoring found a hot spot of hexavalent chromium at more than 350 times normal levels \u2014 among the highest concentrations recorded in the region.\u00a0Hexavalent chromium, also called Chromium 6, is a known human carcinogen linked to lung cancer . It was a troubling validation for residents in the mostly Latino city of 55,000, who have complained for years about harsh metallic fumes. The city is home to an array of metal platers, finishing shops and forges that service\u00a0aerospace, defense and other industries.\u00a0 The\u00a0alarming measurements forced air quality officials\u00a0to expand their\u00a0investigation. They pledged to find and fix problems, calling it their highest\u00a0priority. In the weeks that followed,\u00a0inspectors from several\u00a0agencies joined forces, fanning across some two dozen facilities in the the city\u2019s industrial spine in search of companies that\u00a0were responsible. The\u00a0 directives \u00a0hand-delivered\u00a0Thursday by the county\u00a0give Aerocraft and Anaplex 24 hours to notify the health department of their intent to comply and submit a list of actions taken and proposed to stop the threat to the public. The orders seek to \u201cbring the facilities into compliance or shut down the processes that are responsible\u201d for the excess emissions, said Angelo Bellomo, a deputy director for the health department. Anaplex spokesman Ad\u00e1n Ortega said Thursday that the company had reviewed the health department\u2019s directive and will\u00a0respond. \u201cAnaplex takes these allegations very seriously and is looking to make corrective\u00a0actions wherever necessary,\u201d Ortega said. Aerocraft did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. In previous comments, however, an Aerocraft spokeswoman has said the company is reviewing its processes, cooperating with investigators and\u00a0\u201cwill take necessary actions to resolve any issues.\u201d Such\u00a0directives are rarely used. The last one issued by the department was in response\u00a0to the Aliso Canyon gas leak in the fall of 2015, which ordered Southern California Gas Co. to stop the gas release and relocate thousands of Porter Ranch residents. Bellomo said the health department has not decided whether relocation\u00a0will be necessary in Paramount, where residents live as close as a block from where the hexavalent chromium hot spot was detected. Both facilities targeted this week have operated in the\u00a0city for decades \u2014\u00a0and Anaplex has been in trouble\u00a0before. The air district cited Anaplex in April for violations involving the use of primers containing chromium, records show. Last year, Anaplex agreed to pay a $142,200 penalty to settle hazardous waste and water pollution violations stemming from a years-long investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A\u00a02010 inspection by the agency found the company failed to treat its wastewater for toxic metals, including cadmium, chromium and nickel. Ortega, the Anaplex spokesman, said that previous complaints from local and federal pollution regulators had been resolved, and that the latest air quality issues \u201cwere brought to our attention\u201d only after an inspection in mid-November. Bellomo said officials do not want pollution problems in Paramount to linger as they have\u00a0elsewhere, citing \u201clots of cases where non-compliant operators have continued to operate for years and decades.\u201d \u201cSo this is going to be a full-court press \u2014\u00a0AQMD and public health together bringing a rapid abatement of this hazard,\u201d he said. The recent orders were welcomed by community groups and environmentalists who have fought for more aggressive action on metal pollution in Paramount. \u201cWe are encouraged,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Robina Suwol, who directs the environmental health advocacy group California Safe Schools. \u201cBut there is still much to be done to protect this extremely vulnerable community.\" Twitter:\u00a0 @tonybarboza UPDATES: 8:25 p.m.: This article was updated with additional details and with new comments from an Anaplex spokesman and environmentalists. 3:24 p.m.: This article was updated with additional details on Anaplex and with previous comments from that company and Aerocraft.

    "text": "This week on 60 Minutes, the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed for spying in 1953, say their mother was innocent. In 2001, Bo... The Meeropols are not seeking a presidential pardon, saying that would suggest their mother was guilty. They instead are seeking a public exoneration, akin to a 1977 statement by then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis on behalf of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Italian immigrants who were convicted in a 1920 murder. That proclamation said \u201cany stigma and disgrace should be forever removed\u201d from their names. In an interview broadcast on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October, the Meeropols told contributor Anderson Cooper that an exoneration would have personal and political meaning. \u201cOur mother was killed for something she did not do,\u201d Robert Meeropol told Cooper. \u201cShe was taken away from us. That\u2019s as personal as it can get. But, the fact that the government facilitated the invention of evidence in order to convict someone of a capital crime, that is something that should concern everybody.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what action, if any, the Obama administration will take in its waning weeks. But Rosenberg\u2019s supporters believe their prospects are dim once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, in part because Roy Cohn, once a lawyer for Mr. Trump, was a member of the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution team against the Rosenbergs. \u201cThe ghost of Ethel Rosenberg is going to haunt the White House once Donald Trump takes office,\u201d Robert Meeropol said. The Rosenbergs both maintained their innocence, though they requested only Ethel\u2019s exoneration. The sons said that\u2019s because they believe their father was guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage, though they argue he didn\u2019t engage in atomic spying and shouldn\u2019t have been executed. Ethel Rosenberg\u2019s supporters believe their cause was helped by the July 2015 release of Greenglass\u2019 grand jury testimony, which a federal judge in New York unsealed in response to a request from historians and archivists following Greenglass\u2019 death. That 1950 testimony conflicted with statements made a year later during the couple\u2019s trial by Greenglass, who was indicted as a co-conspirator and was himself sentenced to 10 years in prison. Greenglass said he had given the Rosenbergs research data he had obtained while working as an Army machinist at the Los Alamos, New Mexico, headquarters of the top-secret Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. He said he recalled seeing his older sister transcribing handwritten notes to give to the Soviets on a portable typewriter at the Rosenbergs\u2019 New York apartment in 1945. But the grand jury records show no mention of that and indicate he appeared to minimize his dealings with his sister. Greenglass told the grand jury that Julius Rosenberg was adamant that he should continue with his Army service so he could \u201ccontinue giving him information,\u201d but when asked whether his sister, Ethel, was similarly insistent, he replied, \u201cI said before, and say it again, honestly, this is a fact: I never spoke to my sister about this at all.\u201d Decades after the trial, Greenglass was quoted by a New York Times journalist as having admitted to lying at trial about his sister in order to protect his wife. In a May decision that ordered the records unsealed, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein noted that Greenglass said in his new statements that it was likely his wife, Ruth Greenglass, rather than Ethel Rosenberg, who typed up the notes that were passed to the Soviets. The brothers were adopted following their parents\u2019 executions and changed their last name. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

James 'Mad Dog' Mattis as Secretary of Defense by Hans Nichols and Halimah Abdullah Share advertisement President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to head the Department of Defense, a move that could signal the incoming administration's tougher positioning with nations such as Iran. Trump made a surprise announcement of the expected appointment during a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday night, as the crowd cheered wildly. \"We are going to appoint Mad Dog Mattis as our secretary of defense,\" Trump said theatrically. He then added: \"But we're not announcing it 'til Monday, so don't tell anyone \u2014 Mad Dog. He's great. He is great.\" BREAKING: Trump announces James Mattis pick for Secretary of Defense during Cincinnati \"Thank You\" rally https://t.co/8g1P3El17G \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) December 2, 2016 Mattis, a tough talking retired Marine general nicknamed \" Mad Dog \" who during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 famously led the 1st Marine Division's rapid drive into Baghdad. Among his peers, Mattis has a reputation as a blunt military strategist. During a 2005 panel discussion in San Diego, Mattis once said that he enjoyed \"brawling\" and enjoyed killing the enemy in war. \"Actually it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot,\" Mattis said. \"It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.\" Gen. Mattis testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 9, 2010. Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP Mattis, a former commander of U.S. Central Command, which covers the Middle East, is considered a hardliner on Iran. His confrontational style on the matter was frowned up by the Obama administration, U.S. officials told NBC News. He once accused \"the highest levels\" of the Iranian government of being involved in an assassination plot against the Saudi ambassador at a Washington, D.C. restaurant. James M. Mattis (2R), aboard the USS Peleliu in the Arabian Sea on 24 November 2001. JIM HOLLANDER / EPA \"On Iran, General Mattis takes a very hard line view,\" said James George \"Jim\" Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and the current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \"He would say we need to use hard power to prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon. He is also considered a \"warrior monk,\" who thinks deeply about military strategy. He once told his Marines \"The most important six inches on the battlefield is between your ears.\" Mattis' confirmation by the Senate is not assured. Only three years out of uniform, he would also need a Congressional waiver for a 1947 law that requires a seven year wait. Hans Nichols ",

In an unprecedented move, the U.S. State Department has classified details on refugees to be resettled in America via a secret deal made with Australia. The bi-lateral agreement, which Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a \u201cone-off,\u201d involves 2,465 people currently being held in Papua New Guinea and Nauru who will now be transferred onto U.S. soil. Related Image Expand / Contract Department of Homeland security Secretary Jeh Johnson was mum when lawmakers asked about the refugees. (The Associated Press) \u201cThis is a backroom deal, wheeling and dealing with another country's refugee problem,\u201d Center for Immigration Studies fellow Don Barnett told FoxNews.com. \u201cI don\u2019t believe for a moment it\u2019s a one-time deal. That\u2019s for public consumption.\u201d The move has also raised a red flag among Congressional oversight members. Related Image Expand / Contract Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa (AP) In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Secretary of State John Kerry, key lawmakers Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., complained about the lack of transparency. \u201cThis situation is concerning for many reasons,\u201d read the letter, charging that \u201cyour departments negotiated an international agreement regarding refugees without consulting or notifying Congress.\u201d Screeners from the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services are set to leave for the Pacific Island nations next month to begin vetting the refugees. Related Image Expand / Contract FILE: May 22, 2014:  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C. (REUTERS) When staffers probed the number of individuals being considered for resettlement, they were told it was \u201cclassified,\u201d even though refugee admissions are traditionally public. Officials, however, did confirm countries of origin to be Iran, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and Sudan, as well as some deemed \u201cstateless.\u201d Iran, Sudan and Syria are the three countries on the U.S. current State Sponsors of Terrorism list. But Barnett said the \u201cstateless\u201d category is most worrisome. \u201cThese could be Burmese Muslims, who have posed assimilation issues for every nation which has taken them,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous precedent which says, \u2018We\u2019ll take any ethnic group with which you don\u2019t get along.\u2019\u201d Australia has been under fire for paying poor surrounding island nations to house detention centers for refugees. Australia created the camps in an effort to curtail \u201cpeople smuggling\u201d and has long had a policy which prevents individuals seeking asylum from entering the country before being vetted. The Goodlatte-Grassley letter also asked why Australia and other countries refused to take in the refugees. \u201cIf they\u2019ve been vetted and deemed inadmissible, the U.S. can\u2019t say, \u2018You don\u2019t want them, so we\u2019ll take them,\u2019\u201d said Barnett. Speaking at a Nov. 14 press conference, Turnbull said, \u201cNobody is taking any more refugees, but what the Americans are doing is assisting these individuals on Nauru and Manus by bringing them in within their existing quota.\u201d The Obama administration increased the quota for the 12-month period that began in October to 110,000 refugees, up from 85,000 the previous year. Turnbull\u2019s announcement that his country would be \u201ctaking more refugees from Central America\u201d as part of some \u201ccommitments at President Obama's Refugee Summit\u201d has also sparked speculation that the deal is a trade of refugees from the most dangerous areas of the world for ones from Central America. In July, Costa Rica agreed to set up a detention center for those wishing to enter the United States through a new program the administration established initially for children to reunite with U.S. -based parents. The program has been expanded to include those fleeing gang violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. It also created a special category for female heads of households. \u201cAll you have to do is say is you\u2019re a single mother and you\u2019re in,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cThere is all sorts of twisting of the law here.\u201d A \u201cparticular social group,\u201d is one of the five categories applicants must meet to obtain refugee or asylum status. The designated group could be a religion, nationality, race or political group whose members have a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution for belonging. While U.S. law stipulates refugee status should not be granted based on generalized violence, according to officer training materials obtained by FoxNews.com, status can be considered for women heads of households who are vulnerable to crime, economic hardships or could be a victim of \u201cMachista,\u201d described in materials as a \u201ccultural pattern where men father children, [then] abandon [their] family.\u201d The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 146,000 individuals will apply to enter the U.S. through the Costa Rican Center. In a July 26, 2016 press release the State Department laid out the logistics in which after pre-screening and transfer to Costa Rica, \u201cthey will undergo refugee processing before being resettled to the United States or another third country.\u201d Representatives from the Grassley-Goodlatte committee are set to receive a classified briefing on the Australian refugee deal next week. However, numerous questions could remain shielded from public view including costs, timing, benefit to the U.S. and perhaps most importantly why it was done in secret. Advertisement ",

Bruce Rauner's office during veto session at the state Capitol on Thursday. Speaker of the House Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, center, leaves Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's office during veto session at the state Capitol on Thursday. (Seth Perlman / AP) Privacy Policy The deep distrust between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who run the General Assembly boiled over Thursday on an unusual final day of the fall session that featured a testy veto message, a lawsuit against the governor and several lawmakers knocking off before the heavy lifting was done. And as legislators zoomed up interstates to get home, it was a massive energy bill that emerged as the major accomplishment. Republicans and Democrats united to raise electricity rates on Illinois residents and businesses to bail out a pair of Exelon's nuclear power plants. On average it'll cost ComEd customers an extra 25 cents or $4.54 a month, depending on who is doing the math. The governor plans to sign the bill. Left by the wayside once again was just about anyone who relies on state government. Lawmakers and the governor didn't agree on a new state budget as many social service agencies teeter on the brink of financial collapse and public universities are in bad shape. Legislators left in limbo whether they would overturn Rauner's move to yank $215 million in teacher pension help from an already shaky Chicago Public Schools. And Mayor Rahm Emanuel's plan to shore up two city worker pension funds didn't clear the Senate due to lawmaker absences, although the governor has strongly suggested he'll veto it anyway. One suburban Democratic lawmaker described the frustration with state government when he took to the microphone during the debate on the energy bill. \"What are we doing you guys? What are we doing listening to this bill? We don't have a budget and our so-called stopgap budget is just weeks away from expiring,\" said Rep. Sam Yingling, a Democrat from Grayslake who narrowly won re-election last month and has again been targeted for defeat by Republicans in 2018. \"Instead, we are talking about a multibillion dollar corporate bailout for one of the most profitable energy companies in the state. And how are we going to finance this? This is going to be financed on the back of the rate payers.\" Despite the bad political optics, neither side wanted to be blamed if the legislation failed. Rauner didn't want to take the heat for the loss of jobs associated with the plants closing, particularly as his economic agenda remains on hold amid Democratic opposition. At the same time, Democrats feared alienating unions who stand to gain more jobs under the legislation, particularly as Democrats rely on organized labor to fend off campaign challenges from Rauner and his wealthy allies in business. Bruce Rauner to raise rates on consumers to help two struggling nuclear power plants. The last-minute attempt to resolve the long-festering electricity issue came on a day the Republican... As lawmakers prepare to wrap up the fall session, Exelon and ComEd on Wednesday announced an agreement with Gov. Bruce Rauner to raise rates on consumers to help two struggling nuclear power plants. The last-minute attempt to resolve the long-festering electricity issue came on a day the Republican... (Monique Garcia) Even with the shared interest in passing the legislation, the process was not without the usual political fireworks. After announcing a tentative deal a day before, Rauner's office on Thursday morning accused House Democrats led by Speaker Michael Madigan of inserting several \"poison pills\" into the energy measure. Among their complaints, Rauner aides pointed to requirements that new renewable energy projects follow prevailing wage laws, which the governor repeatedly has sought to weaken saying the rules lead to higher construction costs. Madigan dismissed those accusations, telling reporters \"the governor's administration says a lot of things and you people seem to eat it right up.\" Ultimately, the bill won approval following a flurry of negotiations between Rauner's office and supporters, including a change that pushed back the bill's effective date until next summer, a move that lowered the number of votes required to pass it. (Kim Geiger) Under the revamped proposal, the utilities would collect about $235 million a year from customers to keep open nuclear plants in Downstate Clinton and the Quad Cities. That's lower than the $285 million called for in previous versions of the legislation. Exelon said the legislation would cap rate increases at an average of 25 cents a month for ComEd customers, though opponents say the hike could cost more than $4 a month. The adjustment would allow ComEd to spend about $400 million a year on energy efficiency programs. While that's less than the $500 million earmarked for energy efficiency in the initial legislation, the funding has helped build support among backers of clean energy. That includes the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argues the legislation will help expand wind and solar projects and in turn create new jobs. The power bill is a stripped-down version of an earlier measure that at one time also included subsidies for Downstate coal plants. That was abandoned following opposition from Rauner, along with a controversial provision that would have changed how customers are charged for their monthly energy use. That plan would have allowed billing based on an average of a customer's top 30 minutes of usage on weekdays. Supporters said the measure would shield customers from higher rate hikes that would result if the plants closed and the power supply dropped. \"This isn't a bailout, this is a stabilization of our supply,\" said Rep. Michael Tryon, a retiring Crystal Lake Republican. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan's office opposed the bill, citing the rushed manner in which the final deal was put together. The office said it continued to have concerns about the impact on consumers, saying further study was needed. The bill morphed several times with hard-to-track changes and lawmakers had little time to read the final version. The lengthy debate produced a joke from Rep. Jaime Andrade, D-Chicago, who noted the army of lobbyists hired to help pass the bill and \"probably made a lot of money this last year or two.\" \"Maybe they can do some pro bono work and help us get a budget deal on behalf of the citizens,\" Andrade said. The measure passed the House on a 63-38 vote, with just three votes to spare as more than 40 Democrats and around 19 Republicans voted in favor. In the Senate, it passed 32-18 with only two votes to spare. GOP leader Christine Radogno of Lemont joined 24 Democrats in voting for the plan. Rauner issued a statement saying his administration worked to protect jobs, ratepayers and taxpayers and that the measure \"shows that when all parties are willing to negotiate in good faith, we can find agreement and move our state forward.\" One area where agreement remains elusive is a bill to provide $215 million in pension relief to struggling Chicago Public Schools. Sitting on Rauner's desk for nearly a month, the bill suddenly was inserted into the action following a closed-door meeting between Rauner and legislative leaders that was supposed to focus on the budget. Instead, it resulted in a fight between Rauner and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton after Cullerton encouraged Rauner to sign the legislation even though a broader overhaul for the state's highly indebted employee retirement system has yet to emerge. Rauner accused Cullerton of going back on a June agreement in which Republicans supported the bailout for CPS only \"on condition that Democrats reengage in serious, good faith negotiations.\" He vetoed the bill less than an hour after the meeting ended. The Senate voted to override that measure, but the House left town before voting. The House has 15 calendar days to take up the override, but the chamber is not scheduled to return to Springfield until Jan. 9. In addition to the CPS pension money veto, Emanuel was unable to win approval of a plan to fix two troubled city worker pension systems. The House easily passed the measure aimed at shoring up the municipal worker and laborers retirement funds, but the Senate did not take up the bill after several members left early. The Emanuel administration hopes the Senate will vote in January during the final days of the lame-duck session, but Rauner has strongly suggested he might veto the measure. \"The governor cannot support this bill without real pension reform that protects taxpayers,\" Rauner spokesman Lance Trover said. Time is on Rauner's side \u2014 if he waits to act until the current General Assembly's final adjournment next month, the newly-sworn lawmakers would not be able to vote on whether to override him. The mayor's pension bill would require newly hired city workers to put 11.5 percent of their salaries toward pensions instead of 8.5 percent. City taxpayers also would pay more, in the form of already-approved tax hikes on water and phone bills. As all of this unfolded in the Capitol, the state's largest employee union went to court in Downstate St. Clair County to ask a judge to prevent Rauner from imposing his contract terms after negotiations were declared deadlocked. The request from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees comes as the Rauner administration has begun to put in place its changes, including merit pay which the union says fosters favoritism, and drug and alcohol testing for those suspected of using on the job. The union says the administration can't put the changes in place yet because the Illinois Labor Relations Board has not issued a written decision on the impasse. Once that happens, the union can accept the governor's terms, strike or go to court. \"Gov. Rauner should negotiate, not dictate. By forcing confrontation instead of seeking compromise, the governor bears responsibility for this litigation and the threat of a disruptive strike,\" union spokesman Anders Lindall said in a statement. The administration contends its changes, including sharp increases in employee health care costs, are aimed at saving taxpayers money. Meanwhile, there was little public talk Thursday of the state's most pressing issue: the lack of a complete budget. A temporary spending plan is set to expire Jan. 1, meaning the state will no longer be able to cut checks for universities and social service providers who care for the state's elderly. While both sides continue to meet, they remain sharply divided. Rauner wants a comprehensive agreement that includes several economic reforms such as a cut in costs associated with workers compensation insurance employers must pay for employees hurt on the job. But the governor says he's open to another stopgap plan if Democrats would agree to term limits and giving cities the ability to freeze property taxes. Madigan-led Democrats have long opposed those ideas, saying they would harm workers and force schools to cut budgets as tax dollars dried up. Madigan, who was first elected in 1970, contends the state already has term limits in the form of elections. While Rauner didn't emerge publicly Thursday, he ended the day the same way he began it: Posting a video on his Facebook page. The first one called on Madigan to negotiate on a budget. The second was a short clip announcing he'd postponed a live webcast with wife Diana Rauner. The event was billed as a casual \"hangout\" from the Executive Mansion, and was one in a series of appearances Rauner has done in recent months as he seeks to control his public image during the budget stalemate. \"There's so much going on here in Springfield we've got to focus on getting some things done,\" Rauner said. \"We'll reschedule, looking forward to it, happy holidays.\" mcgarcia@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "Dec 1 2016, 6:45 pm ET Princess Cruises to Pay $40M Fine for 'Magic Pipe' Sea Waste by Associated Press advertisement Princess Cruise Lines will pay a $40 million penalty after pleading guilty to seven federal charges in an illegal ocean pollution case that involved one ship's use of a so-called magic pipe to divert oily waste into the waters, authorities said Thursday. Miami U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer told a news conference the penalty is the largest ever of its kind. A plea agreement filed in federal court also requires Carnival Corp., parent company of the Princess line, to submit 78 cruise ships across its eight brands to a five-year environmental compliance program overseen by a judge. The cruise ship Crown Princess travels into Port Canaveral, Florida in this July 18, 2006. JOE SKIPPER / Reuters Ferrer said the illegal practices came to light when an engineer aboard the Caribbean Princess discovered the \"magic pipe\" in 2013 off the coast of Great Britain and told investigators about it. Authorities later learned the 952-foot ship had been illegally discharging oily water into the ocean since 2005. \"Our open seas are not dumping grounds for waste,\" Ferrer said. \"One thing we must never do is take our clear blue oceans for granted.\" A single illegal discharge dumped 4,227 gallons of oil-contaminated waste about 20 miles off the coast of England on Aug. 26, 2013, according to court documents. The documents also show illegal practices were found on four other Princess ships, including use of clean ocean water to fool onboard sensors that would otherwise detect dumping of improperly contaminated bilge water. Authorities say cost savings was the motive and that the ship's officers and crew conspired to cover up what was going on. John Cruden, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's environmental division, said the Caribbean Princess \"violated the law, they covered it up and then they lied about it.\" \"We're sending a strong message in this case to the entire industry.\" In a statement, Princess said it was \"extremely disappointed\" that employees had violated company policy and federal law regarding discharge of pollutants. The cruise line said it cooperated with investigators after the magic pipe was unveiled in 2013 and has taken numerous steps to fix the problem. \"Although we had policies and procedures in place, it became apparent they were not fully effective,\" the statement said. \"We are very sorry that this happened and have taken additional steps to ensure we meet or exceed all environmental requirements.\" The oily bilge waste comes from a ship's engines and fuel systems. Instead of being dumped raw into the ocean, it is supposed to be offloaded when a ship is in port and either burned in an incinerator or taken to a waste facility. Sometimes bilge water can be discharged into the ocean but only after almost all oil is separated out. The plea agreement and penalty must be approved by a Miami federal judge. If it is, $14 million of the Princess penalty will be earmarked for environmental projects in Florida, Great Britain and in international open waters. The 17-ship Princess line is based in Santa Clarita, California. Its parent company, Carnival, is based in Miami and is the largest cruise ship operator in the world.

    "text": "After Jay Cutler's shoulder surgery, Bears will weigh QB options Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. Rich Campbell Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Jay Cutler \u2019s injury-marred season breathed its last anticlimactic breath Thursday, officially shifting talk about his uncertain future with the Bears to 2017. Coach John Fox announced Cutler will have surgery to repair the labrum in his right shoulder, an outcome the quarterback hoped to avoid. Eight days after Fox said Cutler's injury was not season-ending, it turns out to be exactly so. With the procedure now scheduled for Saturday, it's quite possible \u2014 probable, even \u2014 that Cutler has played his final game for the Bears. In the weeks and months ahead, this regime, which inherited Cutler, must decide whether they want the veteran to remain part of a rebuilding effort that has sputtered to an 8-19 record since 2015. Their options don't appear to be compelling. Cutler turns 34 in April, is scheduled to make between $12.5 and $15 million next season, and he will be coming off surgery on his throwing shoulder. But Cutler's contract contains no deadlines that would force the Bears into action. They could keep him on the roster well into 2017 and let the player acquisition cycle evolve while fluidly evaluating their options. Jay Cutler might have played his final game with the Bears . That possibility is sure to delight many fans and frustrate others as Chicago's most polarizing athlete heads toward surgery Saturday to repair the labrum in his right shoulder. But for all the informed speculation about the Bears' desire... Jay Cutler might have played his final game with the Bears . That possibility is sure to delight many fans and frustrate others as Chicago's most polarizing athlete heads toward surgery Saturday to repair the labrum in his right shoulder. But for all the informed speculation about the Bears' desire... (Rich Campbell) It would not be surprising if general manager Ryan Pace held out hope of trading Cutler, given how Pace has salvaged late-round draft picks in separate trades involving players he was determined to part with, receiver Brandon Marshall and tight end Martellus Bennett. Cutler's trade value, though, figures to diminish because of his surgery. The team and the player hoped to avoid such a drastic measure because of the rehabilitation required and how that will last at least into April, when teams begin their offseason programs. Every team wants its quarterback in meetings and at practices as soon as possible because of his importance to the offense. Besides Cutler's recovery, his contract and projected production will affect teams' willingness to trade for him. He has missed at least one game to injury or benching each year since 2009. He's an even 51-51 as a starter in the regular season during his eight seasons with the Bears. And his career record, including his first three seasons with the Broncos, is 68-71. In 11 seasons, Cutler's team has made the postseason once and won only one game. A team that acquired Cutler in a trade also would take on his contract, which includes a $12.5 million base salary that wouldn't become guaranteed until Week 1 of the regular season. It also includes up to $2.5 million in per-game bonuses for being on the active gameday roster. The most unlucky number is believed to be 13, a digit that portends such calamitous events there is a word to describe the antipathy it causes \u2014 triskaidekaphobia. With all that in mind, the fact the Bears haven't selected a quarterback in the first round of the NFL draft in 13 years is richly... The most unlucky number is believed to be 13, a digit that portends such calamitous events there is a word to describe the antipathy it causes \u2014 triskaidekaphobia. With all that in mind, the fact the Bears haven't selected a quarterback in the first round of the NFL draft in 13 years is richly... (Brad Biggs) Is that commensurate with the value Cutler would provide a team? For comparison's sake, consider the Jets' Ryan Fitzpatrick is playing on a one-year, $12 million deal, and the Vikings' Sam Bradford effectively is earning $18 million this season as part of a contract he signed in March. Alternatively, the Bears could release Cutler if there are no takers. There would be no cash cost to doing so, and it would result in a palatable salary cap hit of only $2 million. The other option is keeping him. For a club focused on long-term building more than short-term contention, finding a young, talented quarterback is among Pace's top priorities. Cutler, on the other hand, is the Bears' longest-tenured player. He is part of a status quo defined by five straight seasons without a playoff berth, soon to be six. If the Bears draft a quarterback, they still could include a veteran on the depth chart to help mentor and push the prospect, if not play until the rookie is ready. Cutler's salary would be expensive for such a role, and the Bears have cheaper options, including Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley , both of whom would have to be re-signed. With Cutler's fate for 2016 sealed after only one victory in five games played, that discussion can be put on hold for the next month as the Bears work through their final five games with Barkley as the starter. After that, debate and speculation about Cutler's future will ramp up again \u2014 possibly for the final time. ",

Lionel Bonaventure/AP hide caption toggle caption Lionel Bonaventure/AP French President Francois Hollande delivers a speech at a ceremony at the Elysee Presidential Palace in Paris on Thursday. Lionel Bonaventure/AP France's embattled president, Francois Hollande, has announced that he will not seek a second term. The surprise announcement from the socialist leader marks the \"first time in 60 years that a sitting French president has not run for re-election,\" as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from Paris. \"Terrorist attacks and a sagging economy beset Hollande and made him one of the most unpopular presidents ever.\" Hollande made the announcement in a televised address, where he spoke for about 10 minutes and defended his record since taking office in 2012, Eleanor adds. \"I am aware today of the risk that going down a route that would not gather sufficient support would entail, so I have decided not to be a candidate in the presidential election,\" Hollande said, according to Reuters. This opens up the candidate field for Hollande's Socialist Party, which is deeply divided, as it prepares for France's presidential election next spring. A few days ago, \"Prime Minister Manuel Valls ... said he was 'ready' to compete in the Socialist primary,\" according to The Associated Press. A former economy minister named Arnaud Montebourg \"has already submitted his name,\" the AFP reports . Article continues after sponsorship The eventual candidate will face stiff competition from the right. According to AFP, \"voter surveys currently tip rightwing Republicans party candidate Francois Fillon to win the election, with the far-right National Front candidate Marine Le Pen seen as his closest challenger.\" On the other hand, a recent poll saw Hollande winning just 7 percent of the votes in the first round of the two-stage election. Fillon said after today's announcement that \"Hollande had been 'lucid' about what he called 'his clear failure,' \" according to Reuters. ",

Mattis to head the Defense Department. This decision fills a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Gen. James N. Mattis to head the Defense Department. This decision fills a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. W.J. Hennigan Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump has chosen James N. Mattis,\u00a0a highly respected retired Marine four-star general, to head the Defense Department , filling in a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. Mattis served 44 years in the Marine Corps before he retired in 2013. He headed U.S. Central Command in his final three years and oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as other military operations in the Middle East. Trump announced his pick Thursday night at a rally in Cincinnati, urging his supporters to keep the news quiet. \"We're not announcing it until Monday so don't tell anybody,\" he joked. He compared Mattis to Gen. George Patton, the legendary front-line general who helped liberate Europe in World War II. \u00a0\u00a0 Unmarried all his life, Mattis, 66, was known as a hard-charging but scholarly figure who issued heavy reading lists to his subordinates and who carried \u201cMeditations\u201d by Marcus Aurelius on his deployments. In speeches, he was as likely to quote from Shakespeare or an ancient Greek poet as from\u00a0traditional military strategists Carl von Clausewitz or\u00a0Sun Tzu. His nicknames included \u201cMad Dog\u201d and \u201cWarrior Monk.\u201d White House with\u00a0such\u00a0wealthy\u00a0individuals\u00a0that his Cabinet\u00a0was mockingly referred to as \"nine millionaires and a plumber.\"\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is about\u00a0to\u00a0do him one better.\u00a0 Trump won the election\u00a0by appealing to America's disaffected working... Dwight Eisenhower surrounded himself\u00a0in\u00a0the White House with\u00a0such\u00a0wealthy\u00a0individuals\u00a0that his Cabinet\u00a0was mockingly referred to as \"nine millionaires and a plumber.\"\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is about\u00a0to\u00a0do him one better.\u00a0 Trump won the election\u00a0by appealing to America's disaffected working... (Don Lee) \u201cHe is the combination of strategic thinker and successful operator at all levels of warfare,\u201d said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Arnold Punaro and author of \u201cOn War and Politics: The Battlefield Inside Washington's Beltway.\u201d \u201cHis entire life has been learning about and implementing a strong national defense.\u201d The GOP-led Congress would need to grant Mattis a waiver to confirm him as head of the Pentagon because he has not been out of uniform for seven years. The limit was set under a law intended to maintain civilian control of the military. Winning a waiver\u00a0shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Mattis has powerful backers in Congress, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who chairs the Armed Services Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the confirmation process. \u201cGen.\u00a0Mattis is one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops,\u201d McCain said after Mattis first emerged as a candidate. Mattis clashed with White House aides before he retired over the Obama administration\u2019s outreach to Iran, which he considered unwise. He was openly critical of the Iran nuclear deal that was signed after he left the military. Mattis shares a deep distrust of Iran with Trump and Michael Flynn, a retired Army general who Trump has named as White House national security advisor. During the campaign, Trump called for ripping up or revising the nuclear deal. \u201cAmong all the issues facing us in the Middle East, I think Iran is actually foremost,\u201d Mattis said in April at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank\u00a0in Washington. \u201cAnd yet at the same time, it appears here in Washington that we've forgotten how to keep certain issues foremost.\u201d But more recently Mattis has said that it\u2019s too late to rip up the Iran deal because it\u2019s being implemented by the world powers who negotiated it with Tehran: the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. Whether he and Trump share the same world view in other areas is unclear. Trump pledged during the campaign to scale back America\u2019s military involvement around the globe; Mattis has always espoused a muscular role to advance U.S. interests overseas. Mattis has embraced diplomatic efforts to craft a two-state solution in Israel, backed Obama administration efforts to provide weapons to Syrian rebels, and he supports the NATO military alliance, all issues where he and Trump may disagree. \u201cWe need to stay engaged in the world and resist isolationism,\u201d Mattis\u00a0said in August in a speech at Washington State University. Mattis already has had an impact on Trump's thinking. In a recent interview with the New York Times, \u00a0the president-elect indicated he was reconsidering his calls for waterboarding terrorism suspects after talking to Mattis. \u201cHe said \u2014 I was surprised \u2014 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve never found it to be useful,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.\u2019 And I was very impressed by that answer.\u201d If confirmed, Mattis would oversee a Pentagon that is battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has lost ground to a renewed insurgency in Afghanistan, is grappling with Russian aggression in Ukraine and is facing a growing Chinese presence in the South China Sea. Trump has vowed to boost Pentagon spending for more soldiers, ships and aircraft, and in a video this week, said he would seek a new strategy for cyberdefense. A native of eastern Washington state, Mattis enlisted in the Marines in 1969 and was commissioned a second lieutenant through the ROTC program in 1972. He commanded an assault battalion during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He led the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the 1st Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. ",

(Photo: Kirby Lee-US PRESSWIRE, US PRESSWIRE) 252 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Former NFL and USC running back Joe McKnight was killed during an apparent road rage altercation just outside New Orleans on Thursday, police told USA TODAY Sports. McKnight, 28, was a fourth-round pick of the New York Jets in the 2010 draft and played in the NFL with the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs as a running back and return specialist. He played in the Canadian Football League this season with the Edmonton Eskimos and Saskatchewan Roughriders. Jefferson Parish (La.) colonel John Fortunato told USA TODAY Sports that McKnight was pronounced dead at the scene following an incident that occurred at approximately 2:43 p.m. at the intersection of Behrman Highway and Holmes Boulevard in Terrytown, La. The football world reacts to Joe McKnight's shocking death Fortunato said the incident was being investigated as a possible road rage occurrence after McKnight exited his vehicle and subsequently was shot multiple times. The suspect, a 54-year-old Ronald Gasser, had remained at the scene and is in custody. McKnight's lone NFL start at running back came in the final game of the 2010 regular season, and he rushed for 158 yards. He eventually made his mark as a special-teamer and was named to the Pro Football Writers of America's All-Pro team as a kick returner in 2011. McKnight returned a kickoff for a touchdown that season and also blocked a punt. He also caught two touchdowns with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014, his last year with the team and in the NFL. \"Joe McKnight was a loving father and a genuine, kind-hearted person,\" the Jets wrote in a statement.\u00a0\"It is sad when life is taken in what appears to be such a senseless act of violence. Joe, you will be missed.\" PHOTOS: Joe McKnight through the years ",

NASA TV hide caption toggle caption NASA TV A Russian resupply rocket launched Thursday morning from Kazakhstan. The flight initially went as planned, but the rocket broke up in the atmosphere about six minutes after it took off. NASA TV An unmanned cargo rocket bound for the International Space Station was destroyed after takeoff on Thursday. The Russian rocket took off as planned from Baikonur, Kazahkstan, on Thursday morning but stopped transmitting data about six minutes into its flight, as NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reported: \" Russian officials say the spacecraft failed ... when it was about 100 miles above a remote part of Siberia. \"The ship was carrying more than 2 1/2 tons of supplies \u2014 including food, fuel and clothes. Most of that very likely burned up as the unmanned spacecraft fell back toward Earth. \"NASA says the six crew members on board the International Space station, including two Americans, are well stocked for now.\" The six people currently living on the International Space Station are Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov, Andrey Borisenko and Oleg Novitskiy; NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Peggy Witson; and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet. The Japanese space agency is scheduled to launch a different supply rocket next week, according to NASA . This is the fourth botched launch of an unmanned Russian rocket in the past two years. As we reported , in May 2014 a Proton-M rocket broke apart about nine minutes after it took off carrying a satellite meant to bring Internet access to parts of Russia. Article continues after sponsorship Baikonur, We Have A Problem. Russian Rocket Crashes And Burns In May 2015, another rocket of the same type broke apart about eight minutes after it took off carrying a Mexican satellite. And in April 2015 , a Progress M-27M rocket similar to the one that took off Thursday made it to orbit before it lost contact with the ground, spun out of control, and burned up as it fell back into the atmosphere. SpaceX Rocket And Its Cargo Explode On Launch Pad In Florida [VIDEO] The most spectacular Russian rocket failure of the past few years happened in 2013, when a rocket made a wide, lazy arc back toward Earth shortly after takeoff and exploded into a fiery ball. That accident might have been the result of sensors, meant to keep the rocket upright, having been installed upside down . YouTube U.S. rockets also explode from time to time. In September , a SpaceX rocket carrying a satellite meant to bring Internet access to part of Africa exploded on a launchpad in Florida. Another unmanned SpaceX rocket exploded about two minutes into its flight in 2015. ",

    "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Will Step Down, Take on New Role By Paul Blake Dec 1, 2016, 5:53 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Will Step Down, Take on New Role 0 Shares Email Starbucks coffee announced today that Howard Schultz , the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, would be stepping down from his post this Spring and would be appointed executive chairman of the company. The coffee magnate, who has been with the company for more than 30 years, is credited with turning Starbucks into a global brand with name recognition comparable to McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola. The change will be effective April 3, 2017, according to a company statement. Schultz, the company said, \"will shift his focus to innovation, design and development\" of its Starbucks Reserve brand products and expansion of Reserve branded locations, while also focusing on the company\u2019s \"social impact initiatives.\" \"As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson \u2014- our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years \u2014- has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,\" Schultz said in a statement released by the company. In a conference call on the leadership shake-up, Johnson characterized Schultz one of the \"most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs\" in the world. Despite his high status in the business world, Schultz has not been discreet with his political views and in September he publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton. Speaking to ABC News' Chief Business Correspondent Rebecca Jarvis that month, the CEO said: \"I do hope that Hilary Clinton becomes president of the United States.\" Asked about his own political ambitions, Schultz said that \"in the last couple of years, I\u2019ve decided that this isn\u2019t the right time for me.\" However, he would not rule anything out, saying \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future.\" ABC News\u2019 Rebecca Jarvis, Darren Reynolds and Taylor Dunn contributed to this report.

(Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Kim Foxx is sworn in as new Cook County\u00a0state's attorney on Dec. 1, 2016, at the Harold Washington Library. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Steve Schmadeke Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Promising a sweeping \"new path\" of transparency and community involvement, newly elected Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx was sworn in Thursday before a crowd of several hundred in a ceremony at the Harold Washington Library. Foxx, who drew loud cheers when she spoke of rising from the Cabrini-Green housing complex to become the county's first female African-American state's attorney, is part of a wave of African-Americans elected as top prosecutors across the country after a groundswell of criticism over police shootings, including of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in Chicago. The new state's attorney acknowledged the surge of violence this year that has exceeded 700 homicides, the most in almost two decades, but said by using community involvement and data-driven approaches similar to those in New York and Los Angeles, Chicago can drive its crime rates down as well. \"We've become accustomed in Cook County to looking at the tallies of the number of young people or older people that we've lost,\" she said. \"It is an intolerable number. \"This job and this journey is about the fight for justice for all of them, for all of us.\" Saying it was hard for her to feel \"discouraged\" because of her rise from Cabrini-Green, Foxx declared, \"I'm ready to go meet the community where they are because they are angry and they are grieving, because not only is the violence high, but the trust in law enforcement right now is dangerously low.\" Foxx, a protege of Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, handily defeated two-term incumbent State's Attorney Anita Alvarez in a three-way primary last spring after public outrage over the release of the video showing a white Chicago police officer, Jason Van Dyke, shooting black teen McDonald 16 times. She then cruised to victory last month over a meagerly funded Republican opponent. Kim Foxx sworn in as Cook County state's attorney (Nancy Stone/Chicago Tribune) Alvarez had charged Van Dyke with murder just hours before the court-ordered release of the video in November 2015, some 13 months after the shooting occurred. That sparked allegations, strongly denied by Alvarez, that she sought to cover up the incident, prompting calls for her resignation. On Thursday, Foxx said she planned to change \"the culture\" of transparency in the prosecutor's office, repeating her vow to have special prosecutors, not attorneys in her own office who work closely with Chicago police, to investigate shootings by officers to avoid inherent conflicts of interests. \"We've had a structure in place for decades that has not ensured accountability,\" she told reporters after the swearing-in ceremony conducted by Chief Judge Timothy Evans . She pledged to conduct a \"wholesale review\" of how police shootings are investigated. Kim Foxx sworn in Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune New Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx greets Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson at her swearing-in ceremony on Dec. 1, 2016. New Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx greets Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson at her swearing-in ceremony on Dec. 1, 2016. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Foxx said prosecutors need to \"own what has happened\" to people in crime-torn neighborhoods such as Englewood. \"The way that we do that is to speak truths that are uncomfortable to talk about, that we do not take small steps, that we confront the historic injustices that have existed in our criminal justice system for decades,\" she said. Her office also plans to quickly begin sharing data on its charging and plea bargaining decisions \"to address the racial disparities that people in the community have concerns about,\" Foxx said. She has previously talked about beefing up the division that investigates wrongful prosecutions, stopping the automatic prosecution of youths who fight in school and diverting more people out of the criminal justice system and into mental health and substance abuse treatment. Foxx ran on a platform of reforming a criminal justice system that she and Preckwinkle contend treats minorities unfairly. Though Foxx had been an assistant state's attorney, she also had worked in the public guardian's office and, as Preckwinkle's former chief of staff, pushed criminal justice reform legislation in Springfield. On Thursday, she took over an office with a $148.5 million budget and about 1,100 employees. Chicago police  Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Preckwinkle, Public Defender Amy Campanelli and former Gov.  Pat Quinn were among the more than 200 supporters and prosecutors on hand. Foxx, a married mother of two girls, told the crowd the story of the day in 2013 that her oldest daughter turned 10. It was the same day Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton lost her daughter, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, the innocent victim of a shooting that stunned the city a week after the teen performed at festivities for President Barack Obama's second inauguration. \"She and I were interconnected, having never met before, because every Jan. 29 as I celebrate my beautiful baby, she will mourn the loss (of hers) at the hands of violence,\" Foxx said. \"That's what this is about.\" ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook This 2015 photo shows flowers and American flags honoring the victims of the attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. It remains under investigation one year later, according to the FBI. (Photo: The Associated Press) REDLANDS, Calif. \u2014 Fourteen people were killed and 22 others were injured in a shooting\u00a0rampage\u00a0during a holiday party in San Bernardino one year ago Friday, but many questions\u00a0remain unanswered. Despite extensive efforts, investigators\u00a0still don't know exactly why a Redlands couple \u2014\u00a0\u00a0Syed Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27 \u2014 committed the attack at the Inland Regional Center on Dec. 2. Authorities believe they were radicalized by the terrorist organization Islamic State, but little information on their motive has\u00a0been unearthed. \"There are many theories as to why that location was chosen,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\u00a0\"We may not ultimately ever know why, whether it was opportunistic, whether they specifically targeted that location, whether they even had a secondary location based on the amount\u00a0of weaponry they had.\" Brother of San Bernardino terrorist, 2 others arrested Farook and Malik wore dark military-style clothing and carried\u00a0assault rifles, handguns and 1,600 rounds of ammunition. They also had a bag containing an explosive that they left behind that never detonated. Law enforcement officials searched their Redlands home and found more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition. The couple also left behind a 6-month-old baby\u00a0that is still being \u201cpassed around from foster home to foster home,\u201d with\u00a0Farook\u2019s sister trying to get custody of her, FBI Supervisory Agent Sid Patel from the Los Angeles office, which has led the investigation, said during a talk in Rancho Mirage earlier this week Feds reviewing contents of San Bernardino iPhone The pair never left the area and authorities say it's possible there were plans to return to the facility and activate\u00a0the explosive. Farook and Malik\u00a0followed an L-shaped route and passed\u00a0Seccombe Lake, which was later searched for clues but ultimately wielded no results. Otherwise, nothing is known about their activities between the time of the killing and the shootout between police that left them both dead. \"We don't know if they ever met with anyone,\" Eimiller said. \"We believe there's evidence we don't have.\" The FBI last held a press conference in January to appeal to the public for help. Authorities haven't arrested anyone directly linked to the shooting and it remains under investigation. Tashfeen Malik, left, and Syed Farook are seen in this 2014 photo. \u00a0(Photo: AP) Riverside resident Enrique Marquez Jr. was arrested on suspicion of acquiring the weapons used in the attack and conspiring with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to support other terrorists. He's scheduled to appear in federal court next year. Working with a third party, the FBI extracted unspecified information from Farook's iPhone after ordering Apple to\u00a0produce software that helps\u00a0bypass a security feature that\u00a0locks the phone after 10 incorrect attempts to guess its password. The effort was controversial, as tech companies argued they needed to protect customers' privacy. Evidence shows Farook had radicalized over several years, at least as far back as 2007. He met Malik, a Pakistani with a pharmacology degree, through a radicalized online chat room where each stated they were looking for someone who shared their anti-America sentiment, officials said. If necessary, Eimiller said investigators will look beyond 2007 if there's evidence that will help them solve the case. \"We would like to know everything we can about their background, who they associated with,\u00a0whether anyone provided any kind of support for them leading up to this murder,\" Eimiller said. 27 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gRzYM6 ",

State officials said Monday that a mountain lion known as P-45 is strongly suspected of breaking into two ranches in the hills above Malibu over the weekend and killing nearly a dozen alpacas and a goat. Louis Sahagun and Brittny Mejia Contact Reporters The mountain lion known as P-45 has been granted a reprieve by the owner of 10 alpacas that\u00a0the big cat is suspected of slaughtering recently.\u00a0 Victoria Vaughn-Perling will work with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the National Park Service toward a goal of having authorities capture the animal and then decide whether to relocate it in the Santa Monica Mountains\u00a0or place it in captivity, her attorney, Reid Breitman, said Thursday.\u00a0 State officials on Monday issued a permit to Vaughn-Perling to kill the mountain lion, after the 5-year-old predator\u00a0was suspected of killing 10 alpacas and injuring\u00a0two others on Saturday at ranches\u00a0off Mulholland Highway and Little Sycamore Canyon Road, said Andrew Hughan, a spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.\u00a0 The attacks drew national attention and sparked an outcry among some animal welfare\u00a0activists,\u00a0who called it unfair to punish the puma for acting\u00a0on its instincts.\u00a0 \u201cVictoria initially took out the state depredation permit thinking it allowed her to kill the mountain lion or have it captured and relocated,\u201d Breitman said.\u00a0 By Thursday, however, wildlife activists and local ranchers in the Malibu hills persuaded her to seek other options, including accepting donations that would enable her to build lion-proof enclosures for her livestock, he said.\u00a0 Vaughn-Perling also decided to let state wildlife authorities determine \u201cthe best approach: either relocate the mountain lion in the Santa Monica Mountains or place it in captivity,\u201d Breitman said.\u00a0 L.A. County\u00a0Supervisor Sheila Kuehl issued a statement Thursday regarding the possible resolution of the fate of P-45.\u00a0 \u201cI am very grateful to the property owner for her willingness to work with my office, the National Park Service, the National Wildlife Federation, and others, to spare the life of one of the precious few mountain lions left in our Santa Monica Mountains,\u201d Kuehl said. \u201cThis is a great example of the constructive ways that government, residents, nonprofits and activists can work together to forge a common-sense solution that is a win-win for wildlife and ranchers.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump announced an agreement to keep Carrier\u2019s factory jobs in the states , it\u2019s been a year since the San Bernardino attack that killed 14 and injured 22 , legalized marijuana supporters are worried about Trump's pick for attorney general , and more and more Central Americans who can't get into the U.S. are trying to start over in Mexico .

    "text": "CBS/AP December 1, 2016, 3:51 PM Rancher with permit to shoot marauding mountain lion doesn't plan to kill Email MALIBU, Calif. -- A Malibu ranch owner who obtained a rare 10-day permit on Monday to shoot and kill a mountain lion that has been slaughtering animals in the area is not planning to kill or capture the lion, her attorney said. At a press conference on Thursday, Reid Breitman said his client, Victoria Vaughn-Perling, plans to install a permanent chain link fence on her property and get a dog that \u201cspecializes\u201d in protecting livestock from predators. He described the neighborhood she lives in as a \u201cfood court.\u201d The announcement followed uproar over the permit Vaughn-Perling received from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife this week after finding 10 of her alpacas dead last weekend. A mountain lion in the area known as P-45 is believed responsible for killing the docile, llama-like animals.\u00a0 Mountain lion P-45.\u00a0 CBS News Hundreds of people have complained to wildlife officials since news of the permit began to spread. What was supposed to be a workshop Wednesday night for residents to learn how to protect their livestock was all but hijacked by animal activists who shouted their anger over the possibility that P-45 could be killed.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s sickening that this animal is going to be executed,\u201d one person wrote on the Facebook page of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Another wrote: \u201cSo they\u2019re going to kill a lion for being a lion. Ridiculous and shameful.\u201d Los Angeles is the only megacity in the world where mountain lions live side-by-side with humans Vaughn-Perling, who had planned to attend the community meeting before she became afraid of getting death threats, told The Associated Press she has tried various strategies to protect her alpacas from P-45 following previous attacks, including adding motion lights and electrified fencing. She installed a roof on her alpaca enclosure after last weekend\u2019s attack, and also said ahead of Thursday\u2019s press conference that she preferred to have P-45 relocated rather than killed. Her attorney, Breitman, told residents and activists at Wednesday\u2019s community meeting that Vaughn-Perling has asked the Department of Fish and Wildlife to change her permit to allow P-45 to be safely captured and relocated to an animal sanctuary.\u00a0 At Thursday\u2019s press conference, she said the point of the permit was never to kill the animal, but to relocate it. But even if Vaughn-Perling doesn\u2019t plan to kill the lion, others still can. \u201cIf that mountain lion wandered down in to Malibu city, it would be shot in a heart beat,\u201d Vaughn-Perling said on Thursday.\u00a0 She said that people are looking at P-45 as an important link in the breeding process. Mountain lions have killed dozens of ranch animals near Malibu, California, in the past year. One owner got permission from the state to hunt one... Wendell Phillips, a neighbor of Vaughn-Perling\u2019s, said he obtained his own permit to kill P-45 in March after some of his alpacas were attacked and that he shot at the cat back then and grazed it.\u00a0 Phillips told CBS News : \u201cNo one wants to kill an animal, he is an animal I wish we could preserve his life. But I don\u2019t want to keep donating my animals to the food chain.\u201d \u00a0 Wendell Phillips CBS News He said P-45 is believed to have killed more than 50 animals in the area in the last year and that the issue became personal for many when one woman\u2019s longtime service animal, a miniature horse named Marco Polo, was killed last month, according to the Associated Press. \u201cPeople have to unfortunately come before animals and the call I\u2019m afraid to get is, \u2018My kid\u2019s missing\u2019 or \u2018My wife\u2019s been attacked,\u2019\u201d Phillips said. \u201cNobody wants that call.\u201d Phillips said he\u2019s also in favor of having P-45 moved, \u201cbut I keep getting told by various agencies, \u2018That\u2019s against our policy.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell, if it comes to a head between the safety of my family and my animals and your policy, the safety of my family and animals is going to win.\u201d\u00a0 Seth Riley, a wildlife ecologist for the National Park Service, said neither P-45 nor the 52 other mountain lions studied by the agency in the region since 2002 have ever attacked a human and there\u2019s no evidence that they would. He added that the cat\u2019s killing of 10 alpacas in one night without feeding isn\u2019t aberrant behavior.\u00a0 \u201cAn animal gets into an enclosed space with a bunch of vulnerable prey animals that aren\u2019t that smart or good at escape and they keep going after them until they aren\u2019t moving around anymore,\u201d Riley said.\u00a0 P-45 is just one of three breeding males during the entire 14 years the animals have been studied in the region and it\u2019s important to the species that he stay, Riley said. He and animal rights advocates say livestock can be kept safe if they\u2019re in a roofed enclosure and that there\u2019s no need to interfere with P-45\u2019s behavior.\u00a0 Roughly 6,000 mountain lions live in California. The largest group of them in Southern California roams just 40 miles from Los Angeles.\u00a0 The National Park Service tracks many of the mountain lions, and P-45, as he\u2019s known, has a GPS collar that logs every move. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Bloody Month in Chicago Brings Death Toll Past 700 Mark By don babwin, associated press CHICAGO \u0097 Dec 1, 2016, 1:54 PM ET 0 Shares Email Chicago experienced more than twice as many homicides in November this year as during the same month in 2015, and more than any November in nearly a quarter century, according to police statistics released Thursday. The 77 homicides recorded last month bring the city's 2016 total to 701, with a month still to go until year's end. It is the first time Chicago has eclipsed the 700 mark in a year since 1998, and puts the city on a pace to end 2016 with nearly 300 more homicides than were recorded last year. The statistics come as the city and police department scramble to bring the number of shootings and killings down with a host of initiatives in Chicago's most violent communities. Earlier this month, police announced that \"several hundred\" officers had flooded three high-crime areas, stepping up efforts to serve arrest warrants, conduct parole checks and make traffic stops. The police department also plans to hire an additional 970 officers over the next two years. Police said the number of shootings and homicides was lower in a weekend in mid-November when officers launched \"targeted enforcement missions\" than during the previous two weekends. Nevertheless, the month ended with more homicides than the previous November and there were 316 shooting incidents compared to 172 for the same month last year. The last November when the 70-mark was reached was in 1994, when there were 78 homicides. The November killings include the shooting death of the 15-year-old grandson of a Chicago congressman, Danny Davis . The teenager was killed in one of the city's most dangerous neighborhoods in an argument over basketball shoes. In the days that followed, Davis and other African-American politicians and activists called for tougher gun laws to stem the flow of illegal weapons into the city and increased investment in inner-city communities to combat the poverty that they say fuels much of the violence. 0 Shares ",

Ben Margot/AP hide caption toggle caption Protestors demonstrate in 2013 outside a McDonald's restaurant in Oakland, Calif. Ben Margot/AP The Obama administration is challenging a federal judge's decision last month to block the implementation of a new rule that would have made 4 million more Americans eligible for overtime pay. The Department of Labor and its co-defendants filed a notice of appeal at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on Thursday, the same day that the rule was set to take effect before the temporary injunction was issued. \"The Labor Department's sweeping overhaul to the overtime rule required employers to pay time-and-a-half to their employees who worked more than 40 hours in a given week and earned less than $47,476 a year,\" The Two-Way reported . \"That salary threshold is about twice what currently allows workers to be exempted from overtime.\" Twenty-one states and several industry group sued to block the rule, and U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant III issued a preliminary injunction on Nov. 22. Supporters of the new rule said it was necessary to keep up with inflation and helped low-income workers in a concrete way. As we've reported, the judge's ruling sided with \"plaintiffs who said the new overtime rules would have caused an uptick in government costs in their states and made it mandatory for businesses to pay millions in additional salaries.\" Article continues after sponsorship NPR's Scott Horsley quoted White House spokesman Josh Earnest as saying the Obama administration isn't giving up: \"That injunction was granted to some large businesses and Republican governors who had colluded to try to disrupt the implementation of this rule. And essentially continue to take advantage of more than 4 million of the hardest-working Americans.\" The future of the rule is extremely uncertain. Even if the Obama administration wins its appeal, the incoming Trump administration has already threatened to scrap the measure. ",

Natacha Pisarenko/AP hide caption toggle caption A Princess Cruise Line ship leaves Buenos Aires' port in Argentina in 2012. Natacha Pisarenko/AP Princess Cruise Lines will pay a $40 million fine for \"deliberate pollution of the seas and intentional acts to cover it up,\" according to the Department of Justice, which calls it \"the largest-ever criminal penalty involving deliberate vessel pollution.\" The California-based cruise operator also agreed to plead guilty to seven felony charges over illegal practices on five ships dating back, in at least one case, to 2005. The Justice Department said in a statement that Princess illegally dumped contaminated waste and oil from its Caribbean Princess ship for eight years \u2014 a practice that was exposed by a whistleblowing engineer in 2013. The engineer quit his job over the dumping when the ship docked in the U.K. and alerted British authorities, who notified the U.S. Coast Guard. He said other engineers were using a device called a \"magic pipe\" to bypass the ship's water treatment system and unload oily waste into the ocean. Then, other engineers attempted to hide the evidence of illegal dumping before British investigators could board the ship, according to the Justice Department. The statement read: \"The chief engineer and senior first engineer ordered a cover-up, including removal of the magic pipe and directing subordinates to lie.\" This continued during a subsequent investigation led by the U.S. Coast Guard. Article continues after sponsorship The Justice Department said the deliberate pollution was likely an attempt to cut costs: \"The chief engineer that ordered the dumping off the coast of England told subordinate engineers that it cost too much to properly offload the waste in ports and that the shore-side superintendent who he reported to would not want to pay the expense.\" In addition to the illegal waste dumping from the Caribbean Princess, the Department of Justice says it uncovered illegal practices on four other Princess ships: \"One practice was to open a salt water valve when bilge waste was being processed by the oily water separator and oil content monitor. The purpose was to prevent the oil content monitor from otherwise alarming and stopping the overboard discharge.\" \"The second practice involved discharges of oily bilge water originating from the overflow of graywater tanks into the machinery space bilges. This waste was pumped back into the graywater system rather than being processed as oily bilge waste.\" Some discharges likely took place within U.S. waters, the Justice Department says. \"The pollution in this case was the result of more than just bad actors on one ship,\" Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden says. \"It reflects very poorly on Princess's culture and management.\" Carnival's Earnings Hit By String Of Cruise Ship Problems In a statement to NPR, Princess Cruises says it is \"extremely disappointed about the inexcusable actions of our employees.\" It says it launched an internal investigation in 2013. And \"although we had policies and procedures in place, it became apparent they were not fully effective,\" the statement reads. \"We are very sorry that this happened and have taken additional steps to ensure we meet or exceed all environmental requirements. Princess Cruises is a subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corp., and the plea agreement requires ships from eight of Carnival's companies to submit to court-supervised monitoring of environmental compliance for the next five years.

Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect, struck Illinois State Trooper Michael Cokins on Sept. 6, 2014. Cokins, who was conducting a traffic stop along I-294 near Elmhurst when he was hit, suffered 15 broken bones and had eight surgeries. On Dec. 1, 2016, Thurow, who previously pleaded guilty to aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, was sentenced to 13 years in prison. (Illinois State Police) Warning: graphic content. Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect, struck Illinois State Trooper Michael Cokins on Sept. 6, 2014. Cokins, who was conducting a traffic stop along I-294 near Elmhurst when he was hit, suffered 15 broken bones and had eight surgeries. On Dec. 1, 2016, Thurow, who previously pleaded guilty to aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, was sentenced to 13 years in prison. (Illinois State Police) Ted Gregory Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A chronic drunken driver who struck and nearly killed an Illinois state trooper in 2014 on Interstate 294 was sentenced to 13 years in prison Thursday after pleading guilty to aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident with injuries. Leslie Thurow wept through much of the hourlong hearing at the Maywood courthouse. Guidelines requiring her to serve a specified percentage of her sentence mean the Park Ridge woman likely will end up serving nine years in prison. \"My thing with this is I don't want to see her hurt anybody else again,\" Trooper Michael Cokins, 30, said of the sentence. \"Hopefully nine years prevents her from killing someone else or herself. She obviously has no regard for human life.\" A crying Thurow, 61, said she was \"truly sorry\" for striking Cokins about 2:45 p.m. Sept. 6, 2014, when he had stopped a motorist on the northbound Tri-State shoulder near Elmhurst. The trooper broke his shoulder blade, vertebrae, arm, leg, ankle, ribs and knees, among other injuries. He was confined to a wheelchair for three months, then crutches for five more months. Leslie Thurow Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect. Leslie Thurow, of Mount Prospect. (Cook County sheriff's office) \"I didn't do everything I should have done to help myself,\" Thurow added. \"I pray for you every day.\" Law enforcement records show that the 2014 incident was Thurow's third drunken driving crash in nine months. Two days before striking Cokins, Thurow was released on probation for a May DUI arrest in Brookfield. After striking Cokins, Thurow continued driving north on I-294, hitting a retaining wall. That failed to stop her. Two miles farther along the interstate, she struck an SUV with seven occupants, including a 3-year-old boy. The SUV flipped, but none of the injuries to those inside was critical. Thurow's car struck a median, spun 180 degrees and came to a rest facing south. Cokins was in critical condition, and prosecutors were told he was not expected to walk again. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print In a recent interview in that reprehensible wad of trash called Rolling Stone, President Obama pinpointed why the Democrats lost the election. He blamed it on Fox News. He initially blamed his own party for its inability to connect with voters, but then he couldn't help himself. He did what he's done in the past when faced with denial or defeat: He targeted my place of employment. 8 Years Later: The #1 name in news, still giving Mr. Obama the blues? #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/uuHOMhw5xm \u2014 Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) December 1, 2016 Yes, his party sucks for losing, he says. But then he adds: \u201cPart of it is Fox News in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country.\u201d So, where to begin? \u00a0 First, let's call BS on this observation. If Barack Obama actually traveled the United States, he'd laugh at his own words. It's true that \"big chunks\" watch Fox News, but they don't have it on in their bars and restaurants, because those who are not leftists are usually not outwardly political. They have no desire to enforce their views on you.\u00a0 And perhaps they're used to keeping their views to themselves because people like Obama often mock them for having them. Trump's outgoingness may have changed this, but for the most part, the average non-liberal would rather talk pets than politics. President Obama is a victim of the very disease that he accuses others of having: divisideria. In the Rolling Stone interview, he accuses Fox News and others of lying to foment division. That\u2019s ironic, given that he's saying these things in Rolling Stone, the rag that peddled a massive lie (the UVA rape hoax) that ruined lives, and the same rag that put the Boston Bomber in heroic pose on its cover. You can't get a better mix of deceit and divisiveness than that. For the left, it's always been the reverse. For them, the personal is always political, and they have no choice but to infect every arena in life with their strident opinions. Whether it's in the work cafeteria, at Thanksgiving dinner or at a play date with assorted brats \u2026 if you're a strong, dedicated progressive, every moment in life is simply an opportunity for proclaiming evidence of your heroic, sensitive belief system.\u00a0 Those of us who aren't liberals have no such reflex. When I'm among friends or strangers and politics comes up, I generally find a way to subvert or deviate from debate. I tell a joke. I say something stupid. I comment on my assorted body aches. It's essentially what I do on The Five. True, as you enter the political season, this changes. People talked more politics in the back half of 2016, because that's when this subject's Super Bowl hits. People were talking Trump, because it was no different from talking about the next heavyweight champion, or a leading NASCAR driver. It's not political, it's just the season for it. It\u2019s a topic for friendly or pointless conversation to pass time while ordering a sandwich. But because Obama is a progressive, and because he\u2019s surrounded by progressives, he projects their sense of political urgency and identity onto his political adversaries. He assumes we're all just like him, only in reverse. But we aren't, and he can't see it, because he is a victim of the very disease that he accuses others of having: divisideria. In the Rolling Stone interview, he accuses Fox News and others of lying to foment division. That\u2019s ironic, given that he's saying these things in Rolling Stone, the rag that peddled a massive lie (the UVA rape hoax) that ruined lives, and the same rag that put the Boston Bomber in heroic pose on its cover. You can't get a better mix of deceit and divisiveness than that. The bottom line: The division began decades ago, when the left made politics a measure of your morality. (It\u2019s no surprise it sprang up when Rolling Stone did, too.). If you weren't like them, you were immoral. You were not simply wrong, as the saying goes, you were evil \u2014 a point made often by Charles Krauthammer and Dennis Prager. This began after World War II, when young Americans had the time to turn politics into an all-consuming hobby of emotional activity.\u00a0 No one on the right ever pulled this kind of stuff on the left. True, some held on to bad ideas, but some on the left did, too. We just assumed they were wrong. They saw us as damned. Or as Hillary said, irredeemable. That paved the way for her excruciating loss. You can't win over people you just sentenced to a life of being deplorable. This narrow, highly destructive sensibility exists still, even after Trump's beatdown. Comedians, singers and assorted talking heads continue to crap on Trump voters, reducing them to some braying, mindless, bigoted mob. But the more they do this, the more Trump supporters they create. Their simplistic, single-minded arrogance reveals the debilitating irrelevance they feel when the country no longer listens to their whine. Oh, yes \u2026 in the good old days, it used to be that you could call someone a bigot, a sexist or simply evil \u2014 and it mattered. But the left called it all too much, abusing their power, so it's no longer believable. It's as if a superhero had only one single gift (call it \"bigot-smearing\"), and Trump arrived with the kryptonite.\u00a0 So you're left with a President Obama \u2014 a smart, gifted man \u2014 ending his tenure bitterly chatting to a pathetic, marginal magazine about a network he believes gave the country President-elect Trump. He's lost the plot. All Trump did was galvanize and organize a group of people tired of being villain-shamed by the arrogant and the elite. The fact that this group happened to watch Fox News is simply a correlation, not a cause.\u00a0 But by blaming Fox News, it at least helps the outgoing president achieve one thing: not having to blame himself.

GALLAGHER Dec 1, 2016, 6:27 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Tornadoes Cause Severe Damage in the South 0 Shares Email It took just two minutes for a powerful twister to cause death and devastation after it touched down in rural Jackson County, Alabama early Wednesday morning. The EF-2 tornado packed 127-mph winds over a distance of just 200 yards, but that was enough to claim the lives of three people sheltering down in a mobile home in the community of Rosalie, officials said. The deadly storm also flattened a strip mall and gas station as well as a church in Rosalie. Eric Schultz/Getty Images City work crews make their way through the debris-strewn streets after an early-morning tore through the small Sand Mountain town, Nov. 30, 2016 in Rosalie, Alabama. It was the same deadly storm that touched down with even greater force in nearby Dekalb County, this time with an EF-3 twister packing 145 mph winds over a destructive 7.5-mile path. In its wake a 24-hour daycare had been completely torn apart and seven people had been injured, including three children. Officials say as many as 20 confirmed twisters hit northern part of the state. Alabama Governor Robert Bentley issued a state of emergency after the deadly storm system produced \"severe thunderstorms, hail, straight line winds, and tornadoes,\" in 12 counties. Some 20 homes were destroyed in Jackson County and 45 others were damaged, according to an initial assessment. \u201cThe people of Alabama have already suffered because of this week\u2019s severe weather and we are experiencing more today,\u201d Governor Bentley said on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThis State of Emergency will activate state agencies to assist communities in whatever way necessary, to ensure our people get the help they need.\" Prior to Wednesday's storms, the state had already been battling a severe drought and 11 large wildfires, the governor said. Angela Lewis/Chattanooga Times Free Press via AP Chris Graves, left, and Jennifer Jeske sort through items, Nov. 30, 2016, from the remains of a mobile home where two people were killed in Polk County after a tornado swept through the area. In Tennessee, meteorologists confirmed three tornadoes on Wednesday that killed two people and injured dozens, the weather service said. An EF-2 tornado struck McMinn County in the eastern part of the state around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, injuring 20 people and damaging 30 structures. But one bright spot did emerge, as a healthy baby was born amidst the terror of a powerful storm. \"In one of the hardest hit areas, at one of our hardest hit homes, a new child came into the world. A baby was born at the local hospital, and that family's house had been destroyed,\" McMinn County Mayor John Gentry said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon, according to WTCV, a local ABC affiliate. The mother was thrown from the home and the house destroyed, but emergency responders were able to get to the hospital just in time and she miraculously delivered a healthy baby. \"So we had 20 injured and one brand new life,\" Gentry said. 0 Shares ",

What Will Trump Do? by Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann Share First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.

What will Trump do? An interesting thing happened in the 2016 presidential race: There was no big fight over the politics of Medicare, seniors, and entitlements -- like there was in 2010, 2012, and 2014. (The reason why was due to Donald Trump's promise not to touch entitlements, as well as the Clinton campaign's effort to go after Trump on temperament, not policy.) But with Republicans in charge of the White House and Congress come Jan. 20, and with House Speaker Paul Ryan's long-awaited effort to privatize/voucherize/restructure Medicare, entitlement politics are coming back. \"Between this nomination of an avowed Medicare opponent [Trump HHS pick Tom Price] and the Republicans here threatening to privatize Medicare, it's clear that Washington Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year,\" incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer recently said, per Politico . The biggest unknown, however, is whether President-elect Trump goes along with Ryan's plans. Trump's \"I'm not going to cut Medicare\" vs. \"Modernize Medicare\" On the one hand, Trump declared that he wouldn't touch Social Security or Medicare. \"I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,\" he said in a May 2015 interview, which is still featured on his campaign website . On the other hand, Trump's transition website includes this sentence on health-care policy: \"Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation - and beyond.\" Trump joining Ryan's Medicare efforts could achieve a long-standing conservative goal, but open up the GOP to some mighty political attacks from Democrats in 2018 (including that Trump broke his promise on Medicare and entitlements). Or Trump blocking Ryan could uphold his promise on entitlements, especially with the kinds of voters who won him the election, but it would produce a significant fissure inside the GOP and conservative movement (which Democrats could still exploit). This will be one of the most important storylines to watch next year.

Bloomberg News : \"His post-election tour may take him to 'swing states we flipped over,' George Gigicos, Trump's director of advance, told reporters on Nov. 17. Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida, all states President Barack Obama won twice.\" But it's striking that Trump will be visiting the states he won -- instead of reaching out to the places that didn't vote for him. After all, according to the latest popular-vote numbers per the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman , Trump trails Hillary Clinton by 2.5 million votes nationally, 48.2%-46.3%. To put the 2.5 million votes into perspective, they're FIVE TIMES the size of Al Gore's popular-vote win in 2000. Of course, it's the Electoral College -- and not the popular vote -- that wins you the presidency. But it's noteworthy that Trump's national percentage (46.3%) is now closer to John McCain's in 2008 (45.6%) than Mitt Romney's in 2012 (47.2%). The good, the bad, and the ugly of the bully pulpit Before Trump's event in Cincinnati, he and Vice President-elect Mike Pence hold an event in Indianapolis, IN to celebrate the news of those approximately 1,000 Carrier jobs that are no longer going to Mexico. We still don't know the details of the deal, but it seems to include \"incentives\" from Pence's administration. (Remember, he's still the governor of Indiana.) \"The incentives offered by the state were an important consideration,\" Carrier said in a press release yesterday about the 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis. But another consideration? Try the federal contracts for Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, according to the Indiana Business Journal . \"[Indiana Economic Development Corporation board member John] Mutz said he doesn't believe the impending incentive package 'really is the major reason for the decision.' That, he said, is likely because of Carrier Corp. parent company United Technologies Corp's desire to keep its hefty federal contracts. United Technologies and its subsidiaries collect about $6 billion annually from U.S. government contracts, making up about 10 percent of its overall revenue, according to CNN Money.\" This Carrier move seems to epitomize the good, bad, and ugly of what the bully pulpit will look like in a Trump administration. The good: saving jobs and promoting the achievement. The bad: the federal government using arm-twisting tactics on a corporation. The ugly: potentially holding a business's federal contracts as hostage to enact change. House Democrats: Wash, rinse, repeat That's maybe the best way to summarize Nancy Pelosi's 134-63 victory to remain House Democratic leader. House Democrats once again failed to win back the House (or even get close to it), and Pelosi is still in charge. \"My heart is broken that we did not win the White House this time,\" Pelosi said after the vote, per Roll Call . \"Where we can engage, we will. Where we need to oppose, we will.\" More from Pelosi: \"I, quite frankly, feel more liberated than I ever have after a vote after such a hard charging campaign.\" Cabinet Watch Here is our running list of possible candidates we've been hearing about so far. We'll continue to update it as the president-elect's team makes its choices final.

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Dan Lamothe December 1 at 7:52 PM Follow @danlamothe President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis to be secretary of defense, according to people familiar with the decision, selecting a former senior military officer who has said that responding to \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d is the major security issue facing the United States. Mattis, who retired as chief of U.S. Central Command in 2013, has often said that Washington lacks an overall strategy in the Middle East, opting to instead handle issues in an ineffective one-by-one manner. \u201cIs political Islam in the best interest of the United States?\u201d Mattis said at the Heritage Foundation in 2015, speaking about the separate challenges of the Islamic State and Iranian-backed terrorism. \u201cI suggest the answer is no, but we need to have the discussion. If we won\u2019t even ask the question, how do we even recognize which is our side in a fight?\u201d To take the job, Mattis will need Congress to pass new legislation to bypass a federal law stating that defense secretaries must not have been on active duty in the previous seven years. Congress has granted a similar exception just once, when Gen. George C. Marshall was appointed to the job in 1950. An announcement is likely by early next week, according to the people familiar with the choice. Jason Miller, a spokesman with the Trump transition team, tweeted Thursday evening that no decision had been made. Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr., meanwhile, retweeted a report saying that Mattis got the job. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet The retired general, contacted Thursday evening by The Washington Post, said only, \u201cI\u2019m remaining silent.\u201d [ How Trump Mattis as Pentagon chief would break with 65 years of history ] Mattis, 66, served more than four decades in the Marine Corps and is known as one of the most influential military leaders of his generation, serving as a strategic thinker while occasionally drawing rebukes for his aggressive talk. Since retiring, he has served as a consultant and as a visiting fellow with the Hoover Institution, a think tank at Stanford University. Like Trump, Mattis favors a tougher stance against U.S. adversaries abroad, especially Iran. The general, speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in April, said that while security discussions often focus on terrorist groups such as the Islamic State or al-Qaeda, the Iranian regime is \u201cthe single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.\u201d [ What Trump may not know about the generals he\u2019s eyeing for top positions ] Mattis said the next president \u201cis going to inherit a mess\u201d and argued that the nuclear deal signed by the Obama administration last year may slow Iran\u2019s ambitions to get a nuclear weapon but will not stop them. But he added that \u201cabsent a clear and present violation,\u201d he did not see a way that Washington could go back on it, because any unilateral sanctions issued by the United States would not be as valuable if allies were not on board. \u201cIn terms of strengthening America\u2019s global standing among European and Middle Eastern nations alike, the sense is that America has become somewhat irrelevant in the Middle East, and we certainly have the least influence in 40 years,\u201d Mattis said. President-elect Donald Trump walks out with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis after a meeting at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Nov. 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) But Mattis may break with Trump\u2019s practice of calling out allies for not doing enough to build stability. Mattis served from November 2007 to August 2010 as the supreme allied commander of transformation for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, focused on improving the military effectiveness of allies. Trump called NATO \u201cobsolete\u201d earlier this year before saying later that he was \u201call for NATO\u201d but wanted all members to spend at least 2\u00a0percent of their gross domestic product on defense, a NATO goal. \u201cThe president-elect is smart to think about putting someone as respected as Jim Mattis in this role,\u201d said a former senior Pentagon official. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior, scholar and straight shooter \u2014 literally and figuratively. He speaks truth to everyone and would certainly speak truth to this new commander in chief.\u201d [ Trump is surrounding himself with generals. That\u2019s dangerous. ] But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump\u2019s personnel choices, said: \u201cIf there\u2019s any concern at all, it\u2019s the principle of civilian control over the military. This role was never intended to be a kind of Joint Chiefs of Staff on steroids, and that\u2019s the biggest single risk tied to Mattis. For Mattis, the biggest risk for him personally is that he will have a national security adviser in the form of Mike Flynn whose management style and extreme views may arch Mattis\u2019s eyebrows and cause conflict over time. It\u2019s no fun to be secretary of defense if you have to constantly feud with the White House.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy ] Mattis, whose nicknames include \u201cMad Dog\u201d and the \u201cWarrior Monk,\u201d has had a leading hand in some of the U.S. military\u2019s most significant operations in the past 20 years. As a one-star general, he led an amphibious task force of Marines that carried out a November 2001 raid in helicopters on Afghanistan\u2019s Kandahar province, giving the Pentagon a new foothold against the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Using the call sign \u201cChaos,\u201d he commanded a division of Marines during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and returned there the following year to lead Marines in bloody street fighting in the city of Fallujah. Mattis continued to rise through the ranks and establish his credentials as a military thinker, co-authoring the U.S. military\u2019s new counterinsurgency manual with then-Army Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus while Mattis was a three-star general at Quantico, Va. He was considered a leading contender to become commandant of the Marine Corps in 2010 but was bypassed in favor of Gen. James F. Amos. Instead, Mattis replaced Petraeus as the chief of Central Command, overseeing U.S. military operations across the Middle East. Even though Central Command did not encompass Israel, Mattis made a concerted effort to reach out to his Israeli military counterparts, according to Steven Simon, who worked with Mattis when he served on Obama\u2019s National Security Council. Simon, who now teaches at Amherst College, said Mattis made frequent stops in Israel during trips to the region, part of an effort to encourage the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors to work together to counter Iranian influence. \u201cThey respected Mattis because they saw him as a straight shooter and a good listener,\u201d Simon said of the Israelis and Arabs. The general retired from that position in 2013, about five months earlier than expected, prompting speculation that he was forced out after clashing with some in the Obama administration on Iran policy. U.S. officials denied that was the case at the time, and Mattis declined to comment. [ Trump signals intent to keep hard-line positions with national security picks ] Mattis occasionally has come under scrutiny for impolitic remarks. Most notably, he said in 2005 during a panel discussion in San Diego that \u201cit\u2019s fun to shoot some people\u201d and \u201cI like brawling,\u201d drawing criticism from the Marine commandant at the time, Gen. Michael Hagee. But Hagee also later backed Mattis, saying the general often spoke with candor to reflect the horrors of war. Other supporters noted that he often stressed to his troops that it was important to treat civilians in a combat zone with care. It is unclear whether the legislation required to make Mattis the Pentagon chief will be difficult to obtain from Congress. A 1947 national security law said that a general must wait 10 years from leaving active duty before becoming defense secretary. An exception was granted on a one-time basis for Marshall, with lawmakers saying in special legislation at the time that it was the \u201csense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of Secretary of Defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.\u201d The 10-year period was reduced to seven years in 2008 for several senior civilian defense positions, including defense secretary. Congress could follow the model set by Marshall\u2019s nomination to similarly waive restrictions for Mattis, and leaders may try to vote on legislation paving the way for Mattis\u2019s nomination early next year, before Trump formally takes office. In years past, Senate committees have also held confirmation hearings for Cabinet secretaries before incoming presidents deliver their formal nominations following inauguration.

By Aaron Blake December 1 at 4:28 PM Follow @aaronblake Speaking at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Dec. 1, President-elect Donald Trump said he decided to call the company so it would not ship jobs abroad after watching a television news report about the factory. (The Washington Post) One of the best explanations of the Donald Trump 2016 phenomenon is this, via Salena Zito : \"The press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.\" But apparently some\u00a0supporters took him\u00a0both\u00a0seriously and literally.\u00a0And Trump, rather amazingly, is surprised by this. During his attempted victory lap in Indiana on Thursday celebrating the fact that Carrier opted to keep jobs in the state thanks to $7 million in incentives, Trump candidly admitted that he didn't even remember having promised to keep Carrier's jobs in the state and insisted that he hadn't actually meant to make that promise. He said his mention of keeping Carrier's jobs was meant to signify other manufacturing companies that might be tempted to move jobs outside the country \u2014\u00a0as Carrier long planned to do \u2014\u00a0in the future, and that he didn't even realize he\u00a0had said it until he saw on the news that Carrier's workers expected him to\u00a0make it happen. \"About a week ago, I was watching the nightly news,\" Trump said, adding an obligatory dig at the media. \"But they were doing a story on Carrier. And I say, 'Wow, that's something. I want to see that.'\" Trump recalled a \"handsome\" employee who was interviewed for the piece who didn't seem worried about the company's plans to move production to Mexico. \"He said something to the effect, 'No we're not leaving, because Donald Trump promised us that we're not leaving,'\" Trump said. \"And I never thought I made that promise \u2014\u00a0not with Carrier. I made it for everybody else. I didn't make it really for Carrier. And I said, 'What's he saying?'\" Trump went on: \"And they played my statement. I said, 'Carrier will never leave.' But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier, like all other companies from here on in. Because they made the decision a year and a half ago. But he believed that that was \u2014\u00a0and I could understand it.\" He was apparently referring to this Nov. 14 NBC Nightly News clip: Carrier a/c became a rallying cry for Trump on the campaign trail. Now employees are counting on him to fulfill his promise. Watch @kevtibs . pic.twitter.com/vS4fgi8Zfg Here is the exact comment Trump made back in August : We're bringing jobs back to our country. We're not going to let Carrier leave. Here's the thing: You can make an argument that Trump was perhaps speaking more generally and using Carrier as an example of the type of company that would no longer be leaving under his presidency. But this is a statement he made while in Indiana\u00a0\u2014 in front of people who had a very strong interest in taking him literally. They did, and yet he was apparently surprised by that.\u00a0Any studied politician would know that if you are in Indiana and you say Carrier won't leave, you had better mean those exact words. That doesn't bode well for the hundreds of promises Trump has made \u00a0that\u00a0some highly interested stakeholders may have taken very seriously. Zito's overall statement may hold true \u2014\u00a0that people read into Trump what they want and that they didn't take everything he said 100 percent literally. But for everyone who voted for Trump, you can bet there's something they hope he was being very literal about \u2014\u00a0whether prosecuting Hillary Clinton, building a wall, taxing outsourcers (which Trump pledged to do yet again Thursday) or repealing Obamacare. There's quite simply no way Trump will ever fulfill all (or even most) of those promises, and perhaps his supporters will understand that. But many likely won't. For the first time, the president-elect has been asked to cash a check that his mouth wrote. There will be more. politics ",

A Wells Fargo bank branch in downtown Los Angeles. (Frederic J Brown / AFP/Getty Images) Wells Fargo & Co. customers who learned that bank employees opened accounts without their consent later discovered another problem when they tried to sue to recover lost fees and for other damages. They  couldn\u2019t. The San Francisco-based bank says that clauses in contracts the customers signed when they opened legitimate accounts forced all disputes \u2014\u00a0even those over the roughly 2 million unauthorized accounts \u00a0in the scandal \u2014\u00a0into private arbitration. Now, two federal lawmakers want to change that.\u00a0 Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Porter Ranch) on Thursday introduced the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act, which would allow\u00a0Wells Fargo customers to have their day in court. \u201cIf a customer never authorized the opening of a credit card or checking account, that same customer should not be bound by an arbitration agreement for a separate, legitimate account,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cCheated customers should have the choice to opt out of phony contractual arbitration provisions and seek justice in court,\u201d he said. Wells Fargo agreed to a $185-million settlement in September with Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to end investigations into the unauthorized accounts. Brown and Sherman said their bill is backed by several consumer and advocacy groups, including Consumers Union, the California Reinvestment Coalition and the NAACP. But the legislation\u2019s fate is uncertain in the Republican-controlled Congress.\u00a0Although many Republicans said they were angered by the Wells Fargo scandal, the bill\u2019s 11 co-sponsors in the House and 14 in the Senate so far are all Democrats. Republicans generally oppose expanding the right for consumers to file class-action lawsuits. Last month, in response to a class-action suit, Wells Fargo asked a federal judge in Utah to order customers to submit claims over unauthorized accounts \u00a0to binding arbitration. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Greeson Dunn said the bank\u2019s goal \u201cis to always make things right for our customers.\u201d If a problem with an unauthorized account can\u2019t be resolved directly by the bank, it provides \u201cfree mediation services for the resolution of disputes, through an objective third-party,\u201d she said. Arbitration would only take place after that. \u201cWells Fargo fully intends to address all consumers impacted by improper sales practices,\u201d Dunn said. Brown said that\u2019s not good enough. \u201cWells Fargo\u2019s customers never intended to sign away their right to fight back against fraud and deceit,\u201d he said Thursday.\u00a0\u201cWe need to give customers back the ability to seek justice in court so they can be made whole again.\u201d The bill would end a legal strategy The Times documented last year in which Wells Fargo argued that arbitration clauses signed by customers in opening genuine accounts covered all disputes with the bank. Attorneys for bank customers have called that argument \u201claughable\u201d and said there\u2019s no way customers knew they would be giving up the right to sue over accounts they never authorized. But local and federal judges have ruled in favor of the Wells Fargo. \u201cThe arbitration provisions in the plaintiffs' customer agreements with Wells Fargo are broad,\u201d covering any dispute between customers and the bank, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote in a 2015 order forcing a suit over unauthorized accounts to go to arbitration. Brown\u2019s bill would allow customers to sue even if they agreed in other valid contracts with Wells Fargo\u00a0that all disputes would be resolved through arbitration. Brown and Sherman said their bill would work in conjunction with proposed rules from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would prevent arbitration clauses for financial products from including language that bans customers from joining class-action lawsuits. Such bans are common in mandatory arbitration clauses. The bureau\u2019s latest proposal, released in May, could take effect next year.\u00a0 But the arbitration rule could be changed if President-elect Donald Trump replaces bureau director Richard Cordray after taking office in January. Republicans have criticized how aggressively Cordray has run the agency, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. A federal appeals court last month \u2014 in a case brought by a mortgage lender fined by the agency \u2014\u00a0handed down a ruling that said the president should be able to fire the CFPB\u2019s director at any time, rather than only for cause, as spelled out in Dodd-Frank. That ruling, which the CFPB is appealing, might allow Cordray to be replaced prior to the end of his term in 2018. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump announced an agreement to keep Carrier\u2019s factory jobs in the states , it\u2019s been a year since the San Bernardino attack that killed 14 and injured 22 , legalized marijuana supporters are worried about Trump's pick for attorney general , and more and more Central Americans who can't get into the U.S. are trying to start over in Mexico .

They're not going to be taking people's hearts out,\" Trump said at an appearance at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Indiana. \"They're not going to be announcing, like they did at Carrier, that they're closing up and they're moving to Mexico.\" The air-conditioning manufacturer had planned to move production at its Indianapolis plant to Mexico, where operations would be cheaper, taking some 1,400 jobs out of the state. Under the deal worked out by the Trump administration \u2014 which Vice President-elect Mike Pence took a leading role in shaping \u2014 Carrier will keep about 1,000 of those jobs in the state. Related: Trump Reaches Deal to Keep Nearly 1,000 Jobs in Indiana Trump spoke to Carrier employees after touring the plant, saying he was struck by an employee featured in a news story about the shuttering plant who said he was confident Trump would save his job. It was his first public event since being declared the president-elect on November 9. \"I never thought I made that promise. Not with Carrier. I made it for everybody else. I didn't make it really for Carrier. And I said, 'What's he saying?' And he was such a believer,\" Trump said. \"And then they played my statement. And I said, 'Carrier will never leave.' But that was a euphemism. I was talking about Carrier like all other companies from here on in.\" \"Thanks to the initiative and the leadership of President-elect Donald Trump that Carrier has decided to stay and grow right here in America,\" Pence said. To note in this: Carrier will still close its Huntington plant and move the 700 jobs at that facility to Mexico. One worker: pic.twitter.com/Fs8mKP9uA7 \u2014 Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) December 1, 2016 A source with knowledge of the state's negotiation with United Technologies said the deal would grant the parent company of Carrier Corp. $7 million in financial incentives over 10 years in exchange for a guarantee that the air and heating conditioning company would retain at least 1,000 jobs and invest $16 million into its Indiana operation. Carrier confirmed Thursday that \"the state of Indiana has offered Carrier a $7 million package over multiple years, contingent upon factors including employment, job retention and capital investment.\" The deal, however, did include Carrier's plant in Huntington, Indiana, where CNBC reports 700 jobs will be lost when a plant there closes. Employees from the Huntington facility protested the Trump event with signs reading \"What about our jobs in Huntington?\" A top member of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. \u2014 which will have to approve the Indianapolis deal offered to Carrier to keep them in the state \u2014 said the tax cuts are likely not the biggest reason Carrier's keeping its plant in Indiana.

In 2006, the Starbuck's CEO told 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley of his humble beginnings. Today, he announces plans to offer college degrees to employe... Schultz, 63, will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer, the company said in a statement. Schultz will remain executive chairman of the Starbucks board, the company added, noting that that no other executive changes are planned. Johnson -- a technology executive at Juniper Networks and Microsoft before joining Starbucks -- has overseen the coffee giant\u2019s global supply chain, its human resources department, and its marketing and technology efforts, including launches of digital and mobile sales platforms. He\u2019s also been a member of the Starbucks board for seven years. According to Schulz, Johnson is better qualified than he is to lead the company.\u00a0 \u201cThis move ideally positions Starbucks to continue to profitably grow our business around the world,\u201d Schulz said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Thursday, adding that the two years since Johson became President have been the best financially in the company\u2019s history. \u00a0\u201cKevin deserves a tremendous amount of credit for those results.\u201d For years, Starbucks has struggled to prepare food that its customers find appealing. John Blackstone reports how the company is betting big on a... After he becomes Starbucks\u2019 barista-in-chief, Johnson will certainly have his work cut out for him. Starbucks, once one of the fastest-growing and most profitable private enterprises in U.S. history, faces significant challenges to deliver the kind of growth investors have been used to from the Seattle-based company. Shares plunged 3.3 percent to $56.57 in after-hours trading after the news was released. The company\u2019s stock already had been down 3 percent so far this year on disappointing earnings that have raised concerns among many investors about future growth prospects. Meanwhile, rival Dunkin\u2019 Brands (DNKN) has surged more than 27 percent so far this year. Wall Street analysts are forecasting sales will hit $23 billion in 2016 and earnings of $2.14 per share. The sales growth represents a 9 percent gain, but that pales in comparison with the double-digit gains investors enjoyed in years past. Schulz has left Starbucks before, in 2000, only to return 8 years later as the chain and the rest of the U.S. economy faced the fallout from the financial crisis. During the conference call, Schulz noted that the company\u2019s circumstances are far different today than they were then. Moreover, Schulz is retaining his ties to Starbucks be keeping his board seat. ",

Police dispatchers received a 911 call form a Mueller Park Junior High School teacher around 8:15 a.m. who stated that there was an individual in the school firing a weapon, according to Bountiful City Police Chief Tom Ross. The teen's parents had gone to the school to look for their son and arrived before the shot was fired, Ross said. After they heard the gun go off, they were able to find and disarm him, Ross said. An officer arrived on scene within two minutes of the initial 911 call, and the teen was then taken into custody. Active Shooter at Muller Park Jr. Suspect in custody, no injuries reported. Officers conducting clear of school now. \u2014 BountifulCityPD (@bountifulcityPD) December 1, 2016 Police said the teen entered a classroom with 26 students and fired a shot to the ceiling. He did not speak to anyone in that instance, they said. A shotgun and a handgun were recovered from the scene, as well as additional ammunition, police said. It is unclear which weapon was discharged. The teen's parents went to the school because they were \"worried\" about their son and were \"concerned that there were weapons missing from the home,\" Ross said. Police said that they also believed their son had been acting strangely. Someone had also tried to talk him out of carrying out the act, police said. A motive is not known at this time. No others were involved in the ordeal, and the it is unclear if there were any targets, police said. The teen is being held in a juvenile detention center. No charges have been filed as of yet. ",

The Green Lady has announced it will stop selling all Miller-Coors products after the owner learned that Pete Coors,\u00a0who sits on the board of Molson Coors, the parent company of MillerCoors, co-hosted a fundraiser for then presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Brennan Linsley / AP) Josh NoelChicago Tribune A Chicago bar is dropping all MillerCoors products five months after a member of the Coors family co-hosted a fundraiser for president-elect Donald Trump . Melani Domingues, owner of The Green Lady on North Lincoln Avenue,\u00a0 announced Wednesday on Facebook that she would sell off her last five cases of Miller Lite and Miller High Life for an inflated cost of $6 per bottle, donate all profits to Planned Parenthood in the name of Vice President-elect Mike Pence \u00a0and\u00a0then stop patronizing the company. Domingues said she only recently became aware of the July fundraiser co-hosted by Pete Coors \u2014 who sits on the board of Molson Coors, the parent company of MillerCoors \u2014 and it struck her as an outlet to take a stand on Trump\u2019s surprising win and what she feels has been an avalanche of negative discourse coming from the Republican Party . \"I\u2019m not trying to judge anyone for what they do, but as a publican and a citizen, this is how I can stand up and be counted and model behavior for my 5-year-old girl,\" Domingues said Thursday morning. \"I\u2019ve been struggling over the last few weeks with what to say to her when she asks how can so many people vote for someone so mean. I say that a lot of people are trying to figure that out.\" In a statement Thursday, Chicago-based MillerCoors said Pete Coors' support of Trump is independent of the company:\u00a0\"Neither MillerCoors nor Molson Coors takes a position on Presidential races. Whomever our employees choose to support is their business, not ours. As a citizen, Pete Coors exercised his right to personally support the nominee of his political party. We respect Pete\u2019s right to support any candidate in the same way we support that same right for any of our employees. \"MillerCoors is made-up of 8,100 hard-working beer people who rely on their jobs to provide for their families. Calling for a boycott of our brands only harms them and the hundreds of businesses across the country, large and small, which we are proud to call our partners.\" MillerCoors spokesman Marty Maloney said the company has traditionally been active in progressive causes such as LGBT equality in the workplace \u2014 it was named Corporation of the Year by the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce in 2015 \u2014\u00a0and funding\u00a0scholarships for minority students. Pete Coors is\u00a0a long-time prominent Colorado conservative, including a failed bid for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2004. He was previously chief executive officer\u00a0of Molson Coors and chairman of MillerCoors.\u00a0The Coors\u00a0brand has traditionally been associated with right-leaning politics, and\u00a0been the\u00a0target of sporadic boycotts since the 1960s. The Green Lady is the third business in Chicago's craft beer industry to oppose Trump in some fashion since the real estate mogul and former reality television star declared his candidacy for president. In June 2015, Bedford Park\u2019s 5 Rabbit Cerveceria pulled a beer it had made for Trump Hotel Chicago and sent it to bars across the city (including The Green Lady) renamed Chinga Tu Pelo \u2014 a salty Spanish reference to Trump\u2019s hair. Last summer, Spiteful Brewing released a beer called Dumb Donald, which featured an unmistakable likeness of Trump on the label. Just before the election, Dick Yuengling, owner of\u00a0Pennsylvania's\u00a0D.G. Yuengling & Son, endorsed Trump, causing a swift backlash from bars and drinkers. The Green Lady, 3328 N. Lincoln Ave., is one of the more progressive craft beer bars in Chicago but sells $3 bottles of Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite and Miller High Life during its weekly\u00a0trivia competitions.\u00a0 On Wednesday night, Domingues revealed her decision to drop MillerCoors products on The Green Lady\u2019s Facebook page, listing 24 \"beers to avoid\" that are owned by the company, including Leinenkugel, Blue Moon and all Miller products. She also posted a link to the Denver Post article that clued her into the fundraiser, which the Post reported was co-hosted by Pete Coors and former Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan for \"at least $10,000 per couple to attend the lunch at Shanahan\u2019s Denver home.\" Domingues said she\u2019s not trying to turn away business from Trump voters \u2014 few as they may be on the North Side of Chicago \u2014 and is open to any \u201copen-minded, productive discussion.\u201d Though she could lose a few customers, she said that\u2019s not her concern. \"Everyone has a choice of where and how they spend their money,\" she said. \"If they support us, that\u2019s awesome, and if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s awesome too because they\u2019re taking their own stand.\" Asked if she would boycott MillerCoors products if Pete Coors had hosted a fundraiser for a more typical Republican candidate who later won the election, she called\u00a0it \"a tough question to answer.\" \"It wasn\u2019t a normal election, and now it boils down to the hate spewing,\u201d Domingues said \u201cIt\u2019s all due to circumstances we're living in now in this post-election landscape.\u201d jbnoel@chicagotribune.com \u00a0 \u00a0 Here are the restaurants\u00a0that Ina Pinkney, who owned iconic West Loop breakfast spot Ina's for more than 30 years, has\u00a0loved the most this year\u00a0for coffee and a morning meal. \u00a0 The Food & Dining team is trying\u00a0dozens of burgers to find Chicago's best.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Matt Zapotosky December 1 at 4:46 PM Follow @mattzap Donald Trump, on the campaign trail, would occasionally compare the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information with the case of former CIA director David Petraeus. In Trump\u2019s view, Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information, was pursued unfairly, while Clinton deserved to be treated more harshly. \u201cThe system is rigged,\u201d Trump tweeted after the FBI recommended that Clinton not be charged. \u201cGeneral Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.\u201d That assessment has long irked Clinton supporters and even the FBI \u2014 which feels that Petraeus\u2019s case was a clear-cut example of criminal wrongdoing with aggravating factors, while Clinton\u2019s was not. Now, Petraeus is under consideration for a job in Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 possibly even as secretary of state, the job Clinton used to hold. Petraeus and Trump met this week, and Trump wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cvery impressed!\u201d [ Unlike Petraeus and others, Clinton\u2019s case lacked malicious intent or other nefarious elements ] Retired Army general David Petraeus has emerged as a potential pick for secretary of state in the upcoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) If nominated to be secretary of state, Petraeus would have to undergo a potentially bruising confirmation hearing that would probably reexamine the lurid case that led to his conviction and dredge up old comparisons to Clinton. His and Clinton\u2019s cases both involve investigations of mishandling of classified information, but under dramatically different circumstances. Petraeus pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information, admitting that he gave sensitive materials to his former lover and biographer, Paula Broadwell. He was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $100,000. His probation includes several restrictions that could complicate his holding a Cabinet position \u2014 for instance, he must have work-related travel approved by the U.S. Probation Office, and he must submit to warrantless searches by his probation officer at any time. Petraeus\u2019s probation expires in April 2017, and Trump, upon taking office, could commute his sentence. Jeffrey H. Smith, an attorney for Petraeus, said that his client has made frequent international trips in the past 19\u00a0months, and all have been approved by the probation office. Smith said it would be \u201cpremature and wrong, in my judgment \u2014 simply because he admitted to this one mistake and was convicted of a federal misdemeanor \u2014 that he cannot serve as secretary of state.\u201d \u201cFrom his point of view, he admitted his mistake, he\u2019s paid the price, and the Senate and the country ought to view him in that regard,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe stood up and took his medicine, and given everything he\u2019s done for the country, and given the potential that he could be secretary of state and what he could bring to the table, he wants all that to be considered as a whole.\u201d [ The full probation conditions for David Petraeus ] Those involved in the Petraeus case at one point contemplated much more serious charges of lying to the FBI and violating a section of the Espionage Act. Officials have said the information contained in the eight notebooks Petraeus gave to Broadwell could have caused grave damage to national security, if disclosed. The information included war strategies and the identities of covert officers, the officials said. Petraeus also told agents that he had not provided classified information to Broadwell or facilitated her obtaining it, which FBI Director James B. Comey said was a lie. Smith said Petraeus realized soon after he gave the journals to Broadwell \u201cthat was a mistake,\u201d and he asked for them back. He said Broadwell had agreed that she would not use classified material in her book, and none was included. Smith also disputed that Petraeus intentionally misled investigators, saying that Petraeus \u201chad forgotten about the journals\u201d when the FBI asked him whether he gave Broadwell classified information. At a congressional hearing this year, Comey asserted forcefully that the Petraeus case was worthy of prosecution, while the Clinton case was not. He said the Petraeus case \u201cillustrates importantly the distinction\u201d with the Clinton matter. \u201cSo the question is, do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, \u2018got in trouble for far less,\u2019 end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?\u201d Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) asked the FBI director. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the reverse,\u201d Comey said. \u201cAnd what do you mean by that?\u201d Cummings said. \u201cHis conduct, to me, illustrates the categories of behavior that mark the prosecutions that are actually brought. Clearly intentional conduct. Knew what he was doing was a violation of the law. Huge amounts of information that \u2014 even if you couldn\u2019t prove he knew it \u2014 it raises the inference that he did it. An effort to obstruct justice. That combination of things makes it worthy of a prosecution, a misdemeanor prosecution, but a prosecution nonetheless.\u201d [ How David Petraeus avoided felony charges and possible prison time ] Smith declined to comment on the direct comparison of Petraeus\u2019s case and Clinton\u2019s. FBI agents investigated Clinton to determine whether classified information was mishandled because of her use of a private server while she was secretary of state. Comey said Clinton and her staffers were \u201cextremely careless\u201d in how they handled sensitive material, and there was \u201cevidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.\u201d But Comey said that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would actually bring a case against her. Classified material did traverse Clinton\u2019s private server. Information in 110 emails contained information sensitive enough to be classified at the time it was sent or received, and eight email chains included information properly classified as \u201ctop secret,\u201d the highest level of classification, Comey said. But Comey said agents could find no substantive evidence that Clinton intended to mishandle classified information, that she lied during her interview with agents, or that she made any efforts to obstruct justice. Clinton has said using the private server was a mistake and one she wishes she had not made. Comey did not fully clear Clinton of wrongdoing. Were an FBI employee to do what she did, Comey said, the employee might face professional consequences, such as a loss of a security clearance, suspension or even termination. But he said he did not feel she should be charged with a crime. Petraeus \u2014 a retired Army general and former CIA director who left the agency amid revelations about his relationship with Broadwell \u2014 would need a security clearance to serve as secretary of state. The CIA suspended his security clearance after his conviction and it remains suspended, U.S. officials said. A CIA spokesman declined to comment. Smith said that Petraeus does not hold a security clearance. A criminal conviction would not automatically preclude Petraeus from obtaining a clearance. He would have to pass a background check that assesses his \u201cstrength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and a willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information,\u201d according to information on the State Department\u2019s website . Whether to grant a clearance is a \u201cdiscretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel,\u201d according to the site. A State Department official said the department would \u201cnot speculate on prospects for that process.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Petraeus\u2019s lawyer.

Led by Dr. David Agus, who is also a CBS News contributor, the University of Southern California study concluded that if older Americans with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease take low-dose aspirin every day, it would save 900,000 lives over the next 20 years, improve life expectancy by 0.3 percent (more than three months), and save $692 billion in health costs by 2036. \u201cWhen you talk about health reform, when you talk about health care finance reform \u2013 this is the real health reform,\u201d Agus said.\u00a0 \u201cEight-one milligrams of this compound every day reduces the death rate of cancer by 30 percent, heart disease by 22 percent and stroke by 17 percent.\u201d\u00a0 The benefit is most pronounced for people ages 50 and older, when heart disease and cancer rates start to rise.\u00a0 \u201cSome of the cancer studies start at age 40, which is when I started aspirin \u2013 but clearly at age 50,\u201d Agus said. \u201cBut have a talk with your doctor first before you start a medicine.\u201d The USC study follows guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for who should be taking low-dose aspirin. The study recommended that adults 50 to \u00a059 years old with a 10 percent or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, who aren\u2019t at an increased risk for bleeding and have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, take low-dose aspirin every day to prevent heart attack, stroke and\u00a0 colorectal cancer .\u00a0 Still, many of those who should be taking it are not, Agus said. Ironically, part of the problem may be that aspirin is so cheap. \u201cWhen you have a drug that costs several dollars a year, nobody\u2019s going to spend money marketing it. We don\u2019t perceive value in it, but the data are clearly there,\u201d Agus said. \u201cLet\u2019s educate people to take a pill that makes a benefit.\u201d The study also notes some side effects from taking low-dose aspirin, including increased gastrointestinal bleeding risks. But Agus said the study determined that for many people the \u201cbenefits dramatically outweigh the risks.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

A for sale sign outside a home in Park Ridge. The housing market in the Chicago area is expected to be the weakest of any of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas during 2017, according to Realtors.com. (Tim Boyle / Getty Images) Gail MarksJarvis Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The housing market in the Chicago area is expected to be the weakest of any of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas during 2017, leaving opportunity for people to buy homes at affordable prices while perhaps frustrating home sellers. Both prices and sales will increase, but at a stunted rate compared with other areas, according to a forecast by Realtor.com, a website for the National Association of Realtors . The prices of homes throughout the Chicago metropolitan area are expected to climb just 1.95 percent, and sales of new and existing homes are expected to increase 2.27 percent. Nationally, home prices are anticipated to climb 3.9 percent and home sales are predicted to rise 2.6 percent, according to the research. Phoenix is ranked at the top, with prices jumping 5.94 percent and sales climbing 7.24 percent. Chicago's problem is a combination of slow growth in both population and jobs, said Jonathan Smoke, an economist at Realtor.com. The area's population is expected to increase only 1 percent next year. Given the size of Chicago, the city should be among the nation's top three markets for job creation, Smoke said. Instead, Chicago is ranked eighth, with job growth much stronger in areas such as Dallas and Phoenix. Both job creation and population growth drive home sales because new people moving into areas need homes. In areas with strong job growth people also tend to have paychecks that allow them to buy first homes and move up to better homes. Nationally, Chicago has been among the slowest areas to recover from the housing market crash. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index released this week, Chicago's home prices on average remain about 20 percent below July 2007 levels. Meanwhile, the average price for the largest 20 metropolitan areas is now above pre-crash levels. ",
