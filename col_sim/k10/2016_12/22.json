Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday claimed loyalists of Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, are responsible for Monday's slaying of Ambassador Andrey Karlov at an Ankara art gallery, Reuters reported. Gunman Mevlut Mert Altintas gestures after shooting the Russian ambassador to Turkey. Burhan Ozbilici / AP Secretary of State John Kerry has raised concerns about the overall \"rhetoric coming out of Turkey\" about U.S. involvement in the killing, State Department spokesman John Kirby later told reporters. \"It's a ludicrous claim, absolutely false, there's no basis of truth in it whatsoever,\" Kirby said of rhetoric suggesting the U.S. supported the assassination \"because of the presence of Mr. Gulen here in the United States.\" The gunman captured on video and in photos firing at Karlov was identified as 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of Ankara's riot police. Related: Photographer Who Captured Ambassador's Assassination Recounts Shooting No motive has been released for why he opened fire on the envoy, but senior Turkish officials don't believe Altintas was a lone wolf . Witnesses said he shouted about jihad and Aleppo before police shot him dead at the scene. Karlov later died at the hospital. Turkey considers supporters of Gulen, the self-imposed exiled cleric and opposition leader who has lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, as the leading force behind July's failed military coup . Turkey wants him extradited from the U.S. to stand trial. U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers Turkey blames for a failed coup, speaks to journalists at his home in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, on July 16, 2016. Greg Savoy / REUTERS TV / Reuters, file In a statement first released Monday, Gulen, 75, denied any involvement in the assassination and condemned it as a \"heinous act of terror.\" \"This despicable act of shooting an ambassador, who represents an entire nation, only exacerbates the Syrian conflict that has already taken too many lives and driven too many from their homelands, like adding fuel to a fire,\" Gulen said. Kirby asked for patience while investigators, which includes a team of Turkish and Russian authorities, finish their work in the case. \"Any notion that the United States was in any way supportive of this or behind this or even indirectly involved is absolutely ridiculous,\" he added.

A phone call from an Indiana state prison inmate inquiring about a little girl possibly being held in a plywood box led authorities to a home in North Judson where they found the 3-year-old curled up asleep inside a 24-by-24-inch box early Wednesday morning, the sheriff told FoxNews.com. The revelation led to nine arrests\u2014including the girl\u2019s father and his wife, authorities said. The box was located inside the family\u2019s living room. The child was not identified, but she was found in a plywood box inside the family\u2019s living room. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those deals, you go there and think, \u2018Hopefully, this is not true,\u201d Jeff Richwine, the Pulaski County sheriff, told reporters. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to have a small girl in a box, that\u2019s just not going to happen \u2026 You\u2019re thinking, \u2018my God, who would do this?\u201d Christopher Short, 25, the girl\u2019s father, and his wife, Donna, 42, were charged with neglect of a dependent.\u00a0 In court documents, they both stated that the girl would go into the box of her own accord. Expand / Contract The box smelled of urine and had dead bugs on the floor, authorities said. Richwine said evidence collected at the scene and interviews with other children who were at the house did not appear to support their claim. He said investigators found rope and a \u201cmetal eye\u201d on top of the box, which indicated that it could be locked. The child was reportedly kept in the box during the evening for extended periods of time. The initial tip came from Donna\u2019s ex-husband, an inmate in state prison, Richwine said. Like all calls from prison in the state, the call was recorded by authorities. The inmate was later interviewed by detectives, which led officers to visit the home, Richwine said. Just after midnight last Wednesday, authorities executed a no-knock search warrant and found the girl curled up inside the box with the lid down, Richwine said. She was sleeping, appeared non-verbal but did not appear to be otherwise physically harmed, he said. The conditions were horrible \u2013 the box smelled of urine, and there were dead bugs in the corners. \u201cNobody spoke up about a little girl in a box,\u201d Richwine told reporters . \u201cEven while we were in there and started taking people out, nobody spoke up and said, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s a little girl over here in a box.\u2019\u201d Frank Jackson, the girl's maternal grandfather, told WNDU.com that Short barely let him see his grandchildren after his daughter died a few years ago. \"I've seen people treat their animals better. It's like a nightmare and I wish I'd wake up,\" Jackson said. Deputies said in a statement that five additional juveniles were located inside the residence and were released to the Pulaski County Indiana Department of Child Services.\u00a0 Jackson wondered, \"What kind of health issues are my grandkids going to have later in the future because of this? It could affect them for life.\u201d Edmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com. Follow him on Twitter @EDeMarche . Advertisement ",

Eduardo Soteras /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Eduardo Soteras /AFP/Getty Images People scream during a protest Tuesday in the neighbourhood of Yolo in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Eduardo Soteras /AFP/Getty Images Tensions are rising in the Democratic Republic of Congo as the government cracks down on demonstrations against President Joseph Kabila extending his term past his constitutional two-term limit. Human Rights Watch says it documented at least 26 deaths during protests Tuesday in multiple cities and called the country a \"powder keg.\" It said it is still verifying the number of dead. Kabila's term expired on Monday, but he has delayed elections until April 2018. Protesters have been rallying since Kabila indicated that he would stay in office. As his mandate expired on Monday evening, reports indicate that demonstrators voiced their opposition by blowing whistles and banging pots and pans. \"It is unfortunate that DRC security forces responded to this expression of democratic sentiment with tear gas, arrests, and warning shots,\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement . Congo To Block Social Media Sites Ahead Of Protests Against The President In Kinshasa and the southern city of Lubumbashi, Human Rights Watch said that \"military and police forces were heavily deployed and fired gunshots in some neighborhoods to disperse the whistling protesters.\" It added that security forces carried out door-to-door searches and erected checkpoints to question people about their links to the opposition. The U.N. said Tuesday that it has \"documented 113 arrests in the country, including opposition leaders and sympathizers, civil society activists and human rights defenders, media professionals and other individuals\" in the previous three days. The government says nine people were killed in Kinshasa, including one police officer, according to The Associated Press. \"The opposition wanted to demonstrate to take power by force. What kind of state would not defend itself against such behavior?\" Jean-Pierre Kambila, Kabila's Cabinet director, told the wire service. \"We had to deter people from demonstrating, otherwise there would have been deaths like in September.\" Article continues after sponsorship Talks about a possible timeline for elections were set to resume Wednesday between the government and opposition groups, brokered by Catholic bishops, as NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports from Dakar, Senegal. She adds that the elections were delayed after a deal between the president and a minor opposition coalition; the main opposition coalition was opposed to the plan. Now, Ofeibea adds, the \"main opposition leader has called for peaceful resistance to defy Kabila and force him to go.\" Etienne Tshisekedi made the appeal in a video message posted on YouTube. Before Monday's protests, the government ordered telecom companies to block social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Skype, YouTube and LinkedIn, as we reported . A Reuters reporter said on Wednesday evening that social media sites were still blocked in Kinshasa. ",

Pisciarelli fumaroles and mud pools from the Campi Flegrei caldera, a super volcano, steam and boil near Naples on June 6, 2013. (Carmine Minopoli / AFP/Getty Images) Sarah KaplanThe Washington Post The Italian name for the caldera -- Campi Flegrei, or \"burning fields\" -- is apt. The 7.5-mile-wide cauldron is the collapsed top of an ancient volcano, formed when the magma within finally blew. Though half of it is obscured beneath the crystal blue waters of the Mediterranean, the other half is studded with cinder cones and calderas from smaller eruptions. And the whole area seethes with hydrothermal activity: Sulfuric acid spews from active fumaroles; geysers spout water and steam and the ground froths with boiling mud; and earthquake swarms shudder through the region, 125 miles south of Rome. And things seem to be heating up. Writing in the journal Nature on Tuesday, scientists report that the caldera is nearing a critical point at which decreased pressure on rising magma triggers a runaway release of gas and fluid, potentially leading to an eruption. Forecasting volcanic eruptions is a famously dicey endeavor, and right now, it's impossible to say if and when Campi Flegrei might erupt, according to lead author Giovanni Chiodini, a volcanologist at the National Institute of Geophysics in Rome. But now more than ever, the caldera demands attention: An eruption would be devastating to the 500,000 people living in and around it. The site's last major eruption happened over the course of a week in 1538, when it expelled enough new material to create the cinder cone mountain Monte Nuovo. But the caldera itself is some 39,000 years old, formed by an eruption larger than anything else in the past 200,000 years of European history. A 2010 study in the journal Current Anthropology suggested that this prehistoric outburst -- which spewed almost a trillion gallons of molten rock and released just as much sulfur into the atmosphere -- set off a \"volcanic winter\" that led to the demise of the Neanderthals, who died out shortly afterward. Today, the Campi Flegrei caldera is increasingly restless. For half a century, scientists have measured \"bradyseism\" events -- slow movements of the ground -- that are indicative of molten rock slowly filling the mountain's magma chamber. Significant uplift in the past decade prompted Italian authorities to raise the supervolcano's alert level from green (quiet) to yellow (scientific attention) in 2012. \"These areas can give rise to the only eruptions that can have global catastrophic effects comparable to major meteorite impacts,\" Giuseppe De Natale, head of a drilling project to monitor the caldera, told Reuters after that change was made in 2012. Now, Chiodini and his colleagues have identified the volcano's \"critical degassing pressure\" -- a vital data point in understanding the likelihood of an eruption. As molten rock from the Earth's interior rises through the crust, it is subject to less pressure, and this decline in pressure causes volatile gases dissolved within it to be released. At the critical degassing pressure point, this process accelerates tenfold. Huge amounts of steam are injected into the surrounding rock. If the magma loses too much water, it may harden and cease its upward motion, stopping the eruption in its tracks. Alternatively, the injections of steam could destabilize the rock, accelerate the deformation process and ultimately cause the volcano to blow. Chiodini said scientists have seen an increase in ground deformation and low-level seismic activity around the caldera in recent years. This pattern compares with activity seen around similar volcanoes before their eruptions. This doesn't mean residents of Naples should be heading for cover. \"In general, unfortunately, volcanology is not a precise science,\" Chiodini wrote in an email. \"We have many uncertainties and long-term previsions are at the moment not possible! For example, the process that we describe could evolve in both directions: toward pre-eruptive conditions or to the finish of the volcanic unrest.\" What's more, volcanoes operate on time scales far beyond the scope of most scientific records. Campi Flegrei has had a major eruption only twice in the past 40,000 years, and both happened long before the invention of the first writing systems, let alone seismometers. There are written accounts of the 1538 eruption, but there are limits to the scientific insight those descriptions they provide. What they lack in data, however, they make up for in vividness. Take this recollection, written by Italian philosopher Simone Porzio: \"The large tract of land which lay between the foot of the mountain ... and the sea ... was seen to rise and take the form of the newly produced mountain. And on the same day, at the second hour of the night, this mount of earth opened like a mouth, with a great roaring, vomiting much fire and pumice and stones.\" ",

    "text": "How to Plan a Weekend Getaway By SHIVANI VORA Photo Credit Lars Leetaru Can\u2019t take time off for a weeklong vacation? Getting away for a weekend is still a way to recharge your batteries, said Shawna Huffman Owen, the president of Huffman Travel , a travel consultancy based in Chicago. \u201cIf you plan well,\u201d she said, \u201ca quick trip can be a great break and even feel longer than it is.\u201d As a frequent weekend vacationer, she has plenty of advice on getting the most out of a little time off. Here, her top tips: KNOW YOUR GOAL Do you want to completely disconnect and relax, be active, hit popular nightclubs and restaurants or bond with your family? \u201cYour weekend trip will be a waste if it doesn\u2019t accomplish what you\u2019re looking to do,\u201d Ms. Huffman Owen said. Travelers interested in cultural attractions, for example, might not appreciate a stay in a countryside retreat with few sights nearby, while those who like to be pampered wouldn\u2019t enjoy a property without a spa or one where the spa is small and has a limited menu of services. Plan a trip according to what interests you most. PICK AN EASY-TO-REACH DESTINATION Enjoying your destination \u2014 not spending all of your time traveling to and from it \u2014 is crucial when you have limited time off. Consider places that are within a four-hour drive or a nonstop flight from home. For travelers who live on the East Coast or in the Midwest of the United States, Ms. Huffman Owen\u2019s favorite spots for weekend trips include South Beach, Charleston , Quebec City , Montreal, Newport and the New England region; West Coast and Southwest residents could consider Cabo San Lucas or San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and Big Sur , Vancouver, Seattle, Sonoma and Napa. FULFILL A DREAM The exception to choosing an easily accessible destination, Ms. Huffman Owen said, is using your weekend getaway to fulfill a travel fantasy such as flying to Paris to have dinner in that three-Michelin-star restaurant you have always wanted to dine at, going to London to catch a tennis match at Wimbledon or heading to Morocco for a two-day trek in the Sahara, a trip that the adventure travel company Epic Tomato can arrange. \u201cTrips like these may require more effort and a bigger budget,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they will be ones that you will never forget and can be rejuvenating in their own way.\u201d DO YOUR HOMEWORK Planning is crucial to making the most of your weekend away and avoiding disappointment. If you\u2019re heading to a spa, for example, be sure to book treatments and fitness classes as far in advance as possible because many spas can be fully booked on weekends, and exercise classes, such as spinning, may have a limit on the number of participants. It\u2019s also a good idea to book tables at nightclubs and restaurants, and reserve theater tickets and poolside and beachside cabanas at resorts.

Meanwhile, the market itself reopened, just two days after the attack. (Dec. 21) AP An undated handout photo made available by German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) on Dec. 21, 2016, shows suspect Anis Amri who is searched for in connection to the Dec. 19, Berlin attacks. (Photo: BKA / Handout, EPA) A Europe-wide manhunt for the truck driver who is suspected in Monday's fatal Christmas market attack in Berlin\u00a0is\u00a0underway. Here's what we know about the Tunisian man believed to be\u00a0linked to the rampage that\u00a0killed 12 people: Who is the Tunisian suspect?\u00a0 Anis Amri, who turns 24 on Thursday,\u00a0became a suspect after investigators discovered a wallet with his identity documents in the truck used in Monday's attack. Amri, who entered Germany last year, was the subject of a terrorism investigation in the country\u00a0earlier this year. He was not deported in July even though his bid for asylum had been rejected because he did not have valid identity papers, said\u00a0 Ralf Jaeger, the interior minister of western North Rhine-Westphalia state. Germany hunts 'armed' Tunisian suspect in truck attack On Wednesday, German media published photos of Amri\u00a0and federal prosecutors issued a public appeal for information about him.\u00a0The notice said he could be \"violent and armed\" and offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros ($104,000). Amri has at times used at least six different names and three different nationalities, according to a different arrest warrant from Germany obtained by the Associated Press.\u00a0Amri is said to be of average height and weight, with black hair and brown eyes.\u00a0 His birthdate is listed in the warrant as Dec. 22, 1992, according to\u00a0the AP. German lawmaker Stephan Mayer said after being briefed by security officials Wednesday that Amri is thought to have links\u00a0to Islamic extremists. When did Amri arrive in Germany?\u00a0 He came to Germany in July 2015 and has lived in three German regions since February, mainly in Berlin, according to Jaeger. After Christmas market attack, Berlin shaken but still stoic Was he being investigated before the attack? Yes. State prosecutors told the AP they had launched an investigation of Amri on March 14 after a tip from federal security agencies. The tip said Amri could be planning a break-in to buy automatic weapons for an attack. Surveillance showed that Amri was involved in drug dealing in a Berlin park and a bar fight, but did not confirm\u00a0the initial tip. The investigation was called off in September. Has Amri been identified by the Islamic State?\u00a0 No. The Islamic State did not name Amri when it said Tuesday that a \"soldier\" committed\u00a0the deadly attack. No evidence has emerged establishing a connection to the militant group, which has staged and inspired assaults across Europe and the United States. ",

Donald Trump Paul Sancya / Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump arrives to speak to supporters at a rally held in Grand Rapids, Mich. on Dec. 9. President-elect Donald Trump arrives to speak to supporters at a rally held in Grand Rapids, Mich. on Dec. 9. (Paul Sancya / Associated Press) Cathleen Decker Contact Reporter Nothing about the 2016 presidential election was predictable \u2014 not the purloined emails, vulgar videotaped bragging, the insults flung every which way, or the riotous, raucous ascent of a reality television star as he defeated the first woman nominated for the presidency. Debates over precisely what led to Donald Trump \u2019s victory may continue for decades. Undeniable even now is that one factor played a huge role: A deep desire for change. The question for 2017: Is the change Americans get the change they wanted? As the new year approaches, mixed signals abound. Take a look back at the politics year you'll never forget \u00bb Trump campaigned relentlessly on repealing his predecessor\u2019s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Mentions of his plan to tear it down beginning on his first day in office prompted explosive applause during his campaign rallies. Several of Trump\u2019s early Cabinet picks are forcefully against Obamacare, reinforcing his intent to repeal. But on Capitol Hill, the repeal is being fashioned by House Speaker Paul Ryan into a plan to cut benefits to Medicaid and Medicare recipients. That unpopular proposal is something Trump opposed during the campaign; he suggested at one point that benefits should increase. The posture distinguished Trump from his Republican primary competitors and helped persuade historically Democratic voters \u2014 working class Americans who are often recipients of such aid \u2014 that Trump was in their corner. If that is the price of repeal, it\u2019s not clear which path Trump will take. His end game is similarly unclear when it comes to jobs. 2016 Year in Review: Highlights and heartbreaks \u00bb Trump has heightened the theatrics over jobs during his pre-presidency \u2014 he engineered a public relations coup when, with the help of millions in taxpayer money and the threat of lost federal contracts, he helped persuade an Indiana-based air conditioning and heating company to spare several hundred jobs that otherwise would have gone to Mexico, a plan he emphatically opposed during the campaign. But he ignored the company\u2019s plans to send other jobs to Mexico, and he has yet to concoct a framework that could replicate his move across the entire country in any fiscally reasonable way. Will Trump by lauded for the jobs he saves, or impugned for the jobs he doesn\u2019t? Exit polls of voters casting November ballots demonstrated how Trump capitalized on change. ",

Marsha Blackburn leaves the stage during the 2016 Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena. (Photo: Rodney White, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican chairman of a\u00a0congressional panel wrapping up its investigation into the medical and business practices of abortion providers said Wednesday it has submitted 15 criminal referrals to federal and state officials for further investigation into possible violations of the law. The referrals, issued over the course of the panel\u2019s year-long investigation, target biomedical companies in California, the University of New Mexico, abortion clinics in Arkansas and Florida, and Planned Parenthood affiliates in Texas and California. Three\u00a0of the referrals \u2013 against the biomedical company StemExpress and the University of New Mexico \u2013 were made earlier this year. The other referral letters, however, were sent in November and December and have not been previously made public. The panel, formally known as the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, has spent a year looking into how abortion providers handle fetal tissue. Democrats on the panel have blasted the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and issued\u00a0their own report earlier this month report arguing it had found no evidence of wrongdoing by health care providers, researchers, or tissue procurement companies. But the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, said in a statement Wednesday the investigation uncovered evidence that abortion clinics and companies that procure fetal tissue for research may have violated a federal law that makes it illegal to profit from the sale of human fetal tissue. The panel\u2019s referrals also suggest that StemExpress may have destroyed documents that were the subject of congressional inquiries and that some entities may have violated the privacy rights of women for the purpose of collecting fetal tissue to make money. \u201cSpeaking as a woman, I am deeply troubled by what we have learned about the mistreatment of patients at a particularly difficult and vulnerable time in their lives,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cThey are being treated with a disregard for their best interests and their rights as patients.\u201d Blackburn said the panel has seen instances where \u201cprofit-driven\u201d procurement companies have acted in conjunction with abortion clinics to violate women\u2019s privacy rights and other instances where women have been asked to sign misleading consent forms saying fetal tissue has been used to cure diseases for which there is currently no cure. The criminal referrals suggest the biomedical companies may have profited illegally from the sale of fetal tissue, that the University of New Mexico may have improperly received fetal tissue from an abortion provider and that the other abortion providers may have illegally sent fetal tissue to StemExpress. StemExpress and the university have said they are confident they have not broken the law. The panel also asked the Texas Attorney General and the U.S. Justice Department to investigate claims that a Texas abortion provider violated numerous state and federal laws regulating late-term abortions. The 14-member panel was formed last year after a firestorm over undercover videos that accused Planned Parenthood of breaking federal laws by selling the tissues and organs of aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood and its supporters said the videos were deceptively edited. A\u00a0number of state investigations cleared the organization of any wrongdoing. The panel\u2019s final report will be completed by the end of the year, a spokesman said, but Blackburn and other committee members will decide when to make it public. ",

By Nick Anderson December 21 at 4:31 PM Follow @wpnick Yale University, in New Haven, Conn., is building two new residential colleges as it prepares to increase the size of its freshman classes, in part to accommodate growing international demand. The number of incoming foreign students at the elite school rose 46 percent from 2004 to 2014. (Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post) NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 A major increase in international enrollment in recent years has intensified the competition for entry to America\u2019s top private colleges and universities, as ever-growing numbers of applicants angle for the limited supply of seats. That tension is particularly evident in the eight prestigious Ivy League schools: Federal data shows that their freshman classes grew slightly from 2004 to 2014 \u2014 5 percent \u2014 while the number of incoming foreign students rose 46 percent. At the same time, applications to the schools shot up 88 percent. At Yale University, where just 6 percent of 30,000 applicants are accepted, the foreign share of the freshman class has grown from single digits to 11 percent. As Yale\u2019s undergraduate enrollment has edged upward since 2004, foreigners have accounted for almost all of the growth, reflecting a deliberate strategy to deepen Yale\u2019s engagement with the world. \u201cWe want to bring together an in\u00adcred\u00adibly diverse student body \u2014 diverse in every way,\u201d said Jonathan Holloway, dean of Yale College. \u201cIf we want to train the next generation of global leaders, we better have the globe here.\u201d Foreign and domestic demand grew so high that Yale has embarked on its biggest expansion since its undergraduate college opened to women in 1969. Next fall Yale will open two new residential complexes, a $500 million project to lift enrollment capacity 15 percent. [ Yale to expand for first time in 40 years ] International growth has fostered an increasingly cosmopolitan culture on campuses across the country, with academic benefits for domestic and foreign students alike. It gives colleges an additional path toward ethnic and racial diversity, opening doors to students from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe. But it also injects pressure into the admissions scramble that U.S. high school seniors are starting to experience this month as schools release early-admission decisions. Harkness Tower at Yale. (Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post) Charles Deacon, dean of admissions at Georgetown University, said he is concerned that international enrollment could be nearing an unacceptable level at some schools by potentially crowding out qualified U.S. students. \u201cWe\u2019re in a global world,\u201d Deacon said. \u201cThere certainly is an argument for the presence of foreign nationals at U.S. universities. But is there a tipping point where this is too many? That is an issue we have to reckon with.\u201d The international share of freshmen at Georgetown rose from 3 percent in 2004 to 11 percent in 2014, on par with Yale. During that time, Georgetown\u2019s admission rate fell 5 points, to 17 percent. Deacon said those numbers are reasonable for a university in the nation\u2019s capital with a school of foreign service and a global profile. \u201cWe think it works well for us,\u201d he said. U.S. applicants to elite schools are largely unaware of the growth of international enrollment and what it could mean for their chances, said Bruce Vinik, an admission consultant in Montgomery County, Md. He said the subject could draw \u201cpretty strong\u201d reactions from students anxious about whether their top-choice schools will accept or reject them. \u201cSome kids would probably be upset it has increased competition and made it tougher to get into these colleges,\u201d Vinik said. \u201cOthers \u2014 quite a few, actually \u2014 would see the benefits\u201d of diversity. Except for a brief period after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, international enrollment at U.S. colleges has grown for generations. \u201cBased on history, we think the United States will continue to be a destination of choice and foreign students will continue to want to come here, for all the reasons they come here today,\u201d said Allan Goodman, chief executive and president of the Institute of International Education. There were about 427,000 international undergraduates at U.S. colleges and universities in the 2015-2016 school year, according to the IIE. That was up 79 percent over a decade ago. The top supplier was China, followed by Saudi Arabia, South Korea, India and Vietnam. Among these students is Yifu Dong, 21, a Yale senior from Beijing majoring in history. His father writes columns for a Chinese newspaper, and his mother is a civil engineer. They are a middle-class family, Dong said, and he receives financial aid. \u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening for me,\u201d he said. \u201cYour ideas are constantly being challenged. I really like this kind of education, the liberal arts.\u201d Yifu Dong, 21, of Beijing, attends Yale University. (Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post) The foreign influx has helped offset stagnation in the annual supply of graduates from U.S. high schools. Public universities often use international recruiting to help balance budgets when states cut funding for higher education. At the University of California at Berkeley, federal data shows the foreign share of freshmen in 2014 \u2014 13 percent \u2014 was four times higher than in 2004. Many tuition-dependent private colleges have similar motives, seeking to fill seats with students who can pay full or nearly full price. [ Grinnell College weighs revenue needs and global learning in heartland ] But the calculus is different for top-ranked private schools with an abundance of qualified applicants. For these schools, going global often appears to be more of a strategic choice than a financial necessity. Some give international students significant financial aid. Federal data on \u201cnonresident aliens\u201d shows the international share of freshmen doubled at Duke University, from 5 percent in 2004 to 10 percent in 2014. The share also doubled at Brown University, to 12 percent, and Columbia University, to 15 percent. It quadrupled at Claremont McKenna College, to 20 percent. The only Ivy League schools with single-digit international shares in 2014 were Dartmouth College (8 percent) and Cornell University (9 percent). The share at highly ranked Stanford University was 8 percent. At the 50 schools that U.S. News and World Report ranks as top-25 national universities or liberal arts colleges, the number of freshman seats in those schools grew 14 percent from 2004 to 2014, to about 65,000. The number of freshmen who were foreigners more than doubled, to about 6,900. [ See the sortable chart below on a separate page ] Admission rates, meanwhile, plummeted, meaning that it is far more difficult for applicants to gain acceptance. About a dozen schools routinely reject at least 90 percent of applicants, a threshold rarely reached a decade ago. Stanford, the most selective, now turns down 19 of every 20 students seeking admission. For U.S. applicants, the increase in foreign competition adds another layer of difficulty. They\u2019re now up against a growing pool of the world\u2019s best students. The University of Chicago recently set a goal for international enrollment of 15 percent. The foreign share of its freshmen in 2014 was 11 percent, up from 9 percent in 2004. The university\u2019s admission rate plunged in that time, federal data shows, from 40 percent to 9 percent. The entrance to the University of Chicago quadrangle, in a file photo from 2007. \u201cTo me it would be peculiar \u2014 given the evolution of problems in the world, the challenges the world faces, and the flow of ideas and capital and everything else \u2014 if we didn\u2019t have a much more global perspective embedded within the university,\u201d said University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer. [ U-Chicago leader: Beware the \u2018speech police committee\u2019 ] International students are often stereotyped as rich kids from abroad who can pay full freight. Many are wealthy. But enrollment officers at prominent schools deny that foreign recruiting is all about money. \u201cFor us, it was really philosophical,\u201d said Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning for the University of Southern California, where 18 percent of freshmen in 2014 were international, up from 7 percent in 2004. \u201cIf this is truly a national and global university, we really do believe the undergraduate population ought to better mirror the world in which our students are going to live and work and make their way.\u201d USC\u2019s admission rate fell in that decade from 27 percent to 18 percent. At Emory University, the international share of freshmen tripled over a decade, to 17 percent in 2014. John Latting, Emory\u2019s dean of admission, said the growth reflected a spike in international applications. Fifteen years ago, he said, South Korea was big. Then China emerged. \u201cNow we see India, big time,\u201d he said, with that country supplying 44 freshmen this year in a class of about 1,360. That\u2019s equal to the number from Maryland. Emory also has become more selective, this year admitting 25 percent of applicants. In 2004, it admitted 42 percent. \u201cSure, it\u2019s tougher,\u201d Latting said. \u201cIt\u2019s tougher for everybody \u2014 international and domestic \u2014 to get in.\u201d The admission rate for international students, he said, is about half the rate for domestic students. At Claremont McKenna, where international enrollment has soared, the school lets in about 1 in 10 applicants. In 2004, more than 1 in 5 were accepted. But Jefferson Huang, vice president for admission and financial aid, said foreign and domestic applicants are accepted in almost equal proportion. \u201cIf we wiped out the international student population \u2014 which would be a horrible, horrible thing to do \u2014 our domestic student population would still have a frighteningly low admit rate,\u201d Huang said. Huang said the college draws huge interest from Pacific Rim countries because of its location in Southern California, home to vibrant Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese immigrant communities. Globalization is central to the college\u2019s appeal, he said.: \u201cPart of the reason domestic students want to come is because of what we\u2019ve done here.\u201d At Yale, U.S. students say contact with international peers is invaluable. Zunaira Arshad, 21, a senior from Illinois, said conversations with classmates from Syria and Turkey enriched her perspective on the Syrian crisis. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to empathize and care about people and think about other people besides myself,\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be more of that. Please, don\u2019t let it be less.\u201d Zunaira Arshad, a senior from Hawthorne Woods, Ill., is pursuing a double major in global affairs and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at Yale University. She says contact with international peers is invaluable. (Stan Godlewski/For The Washington Post) Yale\u2019s push to globalize accelerated after the school celebrated its tricentennial in 2001. The university is one of a few to say that it considers all applications, domestic and foreign, without regard to financial need and meets full need for all who enroll. \u201cA big advantage for us from a marketing perspective,\u201d said Dean of Admissions Jeremiah Quinlan. Several international students said they applied to Yale because of that policy. The full price of tuition, fees, room and board exceeds $65,000 a year. That doesn\u2019t include plane tickets and other expenses. \u201cTheir financial aid package was the best,\u201d said Camila Franco, 21, a junior from Buenos Aires majoring in biomedical engineering. \u201cI feel in\u00adcred\u00adibly lucky to be here.\u201d She said she chose Yale after applying to 11 U.S. schools, drawn to the university\u2019s global atmosphere. \u201cMy roommate is from Burma,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has definitely opened up my mind.\u201d The university receives about 5,000 international and 26,000 domestic applications a year. Foreigners are admitted at a lower rate, Quinlan said. Quinlan said he is elated to be able to offer admission to between 300 and 400 more students next year as the university prepares to open the new residential colleges. \u201cI might be the happiest man on campus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we will be able to open up increased spots for students from all over the world.\u201d Eighteen-year-old political science major Elias Mastakouris of Long Island replants American flags that had blown over in front of Sterling Library at Yale University on Veterans Day.

The incident, which was recorded by another customer, happened Tuesday afternoon at the Jefferson Mall in Louisville, Kentucky, and garnered more than 5.6 million views on Facebook. \"Everybody here probably feels the same way I do,\" the unidentified woman, who is white, says in the video after she sees one of the Latina shoppers checking out and the other joining her at the register with a last-minute purchase. An expletive-laced tirade was captured by another shopper at a mall in Kentucky. Renee Buckner \"Go back to wherever the f*** you come from, lady,\" the woman says as a JCPenney cashier asks her to \"please watch your language.\" \"Speak English. You're in America. If you don't know it, learn it.\" \"Hey, tell them to go back where they belong. They can't act like the hero, they come here to live and act like everybody else,\" the woman continues, as stunned shoppers look on. \"Get in the back of the line like everybody else does and be somebody. That's the way I look at it. You're nobodies, just because you come from another country, it don't make you nobody.\" She then berates the two as \"probably on welfare.\" One starts to respond, and the woman responds, \"It's OK, speak English. You're in America. If you don't know it, learn it.\" The shocking video was shot by Renee Buckner, a Louisville resident who was finishing up her Christmas shopping at JCPenney at the time. \"This Hispanic lady was purchasing items and the transaction was almost complete, then her friend brings up some shirts to be added to her purchase instead of getting in line,\" Buckner wrote in her Facebook post. \"And this lady went off!!!\" Buckner did not want to speak to the media and directed calls to her pastor. \"She said there was so much more that didn't get taped, and that they did end up taking down the cameras to actually confront the lady, because she talked about how Donald Trump is going to 'fix' this,\" said Pastor Timothy Findley, Jr., of Kingdom Fellowship Christian Life Center in Louisville, where Buckner has been a church member for the last four years. \"But she felt really obligated to get this on camera.\" After the video stopped rolling, the woman continued \"to just racially heckle these women, and again, she made specific comments regarding Donald Trump and fixing it, he's going to get this country together again, he's going to make it great again,\" Finley said Buckner told him. Related: Chobani Founder Gets Threats, Calls for Boycott for Employing Refugees JCPenney said in a statement to NBC News that it was \"deeply disturbed\" by the incident \"in which one customer made extremely inappropriate remarks to two other customers.\" \"We absolutely do not tolerate this behavior in our stores, and are working with our associates to ensure any future incidents of this nature will be addressed quickly and appropriately,\" the chain said. \"JCPenney is asking for the community's help in identifying the two women who were targeted for such remarks, as we would like to reimburse them for their entire purchase and offer a sincere apology for their experience.\" Jefferson Mall said it was working with JCPenney to identify the woman and would permanently ban her from the mall once she was identified. Louisville Metro Police Department did not immediately return calls from NBC News about whether they had gotten involved. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted that he was \"sad and disappointed\" to see what had happened and apologized to the women on behalf of the community. As a country of immigrants, we must understand we only move forward through peace, acceptance and embracing those who are different from us \u2014 Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) December 21, 2016 \"As a country of immigrants, we must understand we only move forward through peace, acceptance and embracing those who are different from us,\" he tweeted. Buckner has since removed her Facebook profile because of the overwhelming amount of responses \u2014 including criticism for filming the rant and not interfering. But Findley said he thought she did \"a service to the country\" by putting the video online and said Buckner was part of a group who confronted the woman after the video ended. \"It's shocking, but it's necessary, and I think many minorities feel almost a responsibility, even in the face of consequences, to put it out there,\" he told NBC News. \"Not just minorities will see this, but others will say, we're not going to stand for this, and we're going to come together.\" Elizabeth Chuck ",

    "text": "Dec 21 2016, 7:19 pm ET Man Pleads Guilty to First Federal Charge of Hate Crime Against Transgender Person by Phil McCausland advertisement File photo of Josh Vallum's July court date. WLOX via WECT A Latin Kings gang member pleaded guilty on Wednesday to the first federal hate crime charge filed against the murderer of a transgender person by the U.S. Justice Department in American history. According to unsealed court documents, Josh Vallum, 29, \"willfully caused bodily injury\" to 17-year-old Mercedes Williamson by tasing her, stabbing her multiple times in the head and body and striking her with a hammer, because of Williamson's \"actual and perceived gender identity.\" Though he had previously denied it, Josh Vallum confessed that he murdered Williams because of her gender identity. The Department of Justice utilized the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act \u2014 which passed in 2009 and expanded the 1969 federal hate-crime law to include crimes against those crimes motivated by a victim's gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability \u2014 to file the hate crime charge. This is the first prosecution for targeting a transgender victim in U.S. history under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Vallum had previously pleaded guilty to a Mississippi charge of murder by deliberate design, which earned him a life sentence with parole. He now faces an additional sentence of life without parole and up to $250,000 in fines when he attends his March 21 sentencing hearing. As a policy, the National Center for Transgender Equality doesn't applaud or condemn specific decisions to prosecute or convict or sentence any individual, but their policy director Harper Jean Tobin told NBC News that they were encouraged that crimes such as this one were being investigated. \"We are heartened whenever community leaders and public officials stand up for the dignity and the lives of transgender people and say that our lives are not disposable,\" Tobin said. \"We have seen that from the Justice Department.\" However, Tobin added that the center is concerned whether the incoming administration will continue to defend transgender people and investigate these types of crimes. President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who voted against the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. \"We are very troubled that we won't soon have a Justice Department that feels that way if we have an attorney general who doesn't feel that way and voted against this Hate Crimes Prevention Act,\" Tobin said. The Latin Kings prohibit homosexuality, and prosecutors alleged that Vallum killed Williamson to hide the fact that he had maintained a sexual relationship with her. For members of the transgender community, the specifics of this case are all too familiar. \"In a case like this one, it seems that sometimes people believe the stain of being associated with a transgender person is so intense that someone decides to kill them,\" Tobin said. \"The stigma facing transgender people is literally deadly.\" Phil McCausland First Published Dec 21 2016, 7:19 pm ET ",

    "text": "Senators Urge Action to Block Drastic Drug Price Hikes By matthew perrone, ap health writer WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 21, 2016, 5:01 PM ET 0 Shares Email Angered by skyrocketing drug prices, a pair of senators on Wednesday urged Congress to block companies from cornering the market on old, off-patent drugs. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., released findings from a year-long investigation into companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals, which generated national outrage last year after hiking the price of a life-saving anti-infection drug by more than 5,000 percent. Committee investigators concluded that Turing and several other companies \"engaged in price gouging ... to make massive profits from decades-old life-saving therapies.\" The lawmakers, top members of the Special Committee on Aging, presented similar findings at three hearings over the past year. The 131-page report comes as lawmakers and pharmaceutical executives try to gauge President-elect Donald Trump's interest in government intervention to curb rising drug prices, a leading health care concern among patients. While campaigning, Trump said he would support efforts to allow Medicare \u2014 the massive government health plan for seniors \u2014 to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, a step long opposed by the pharmaceutical lobby. That policy does not appear among the health care proposals currently outlined on Trump's website. The list includes a policy allowing importation of cheaper drugs from Canada and other countries, another proposal opposed by drugmakers. Representatives for Trump did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. A day earlier, 19 senators sent a letter to Trump, urging him to follow-through on pledges to help lower drug prices. \"During your campaign, you promised to implement bold reforms to bring down the cost of prescription drugs ,\" states the letter, signed by 17 Democrats and independent Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine. \"We are ready to advance bipartisan reforms that will help achieve the goal we all share: reducing the burden exorbitant drug prices are placing on hard-working Americans. The new report draws similarities between the tactics of companies such as Turing and Valeant Pharmaceuticals and investment firms that profit by buying under-valued stocks and pushing up prices. Investigators note that Turing's former CEO, Martin Shkreli , and several other executives probed by the committee previously worked at hedge funds. \"This may help explain why these companies may have been run more like hedge funds than pharmaceutical companies,\" the report states. Shkreli stepped down as the head of Turing after prosecutors charged him with securities fraud late last year. Valeant is the target of more than 10 government probes, plus multiple shareholder lawsuits. Turing said in a statement Wednesday that it has taken several steps to increase access to its drug, daraprim, including offering discounts to hospitals. The drug still carries a list price of $750 per pill. \"It is disappointing that the report takes out of context and selectively highlights certain comments, including from past employees that are not reflective of Turing's current commitments and efforts,\" the company said. A Valeant spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An AP analysis published last month found that congressional investigations have had little effect on drug prices. A review of nearly 30 brand-name and generic medications targeted by Congress \u2014 including those probed by the Aging committee \u2014 showed that most have not budged since coming under federal scrutiny. Many pharmaceutical companies increase prices annually as a matter of doing business. But the drastic increases profiled in the report helped turn drug pricing into a national issue, reverberating from late-night television to the campaign. The tactics seemed to confirm some of the public's worst fears about pharmaceutical companies: that they are more Wall Street-driven investment vehicles than actual makers of medicines. \"We've got to find ways to increase competition for medicines and ensure that patients and their families aren't being gouged,\" said McCaskill. McCaskill and Collins call for several legislative steps intended to increase price competition, including giving priority review to drugmakers that develop cheaper versions of drugs that are only available from a single company. Elsewhere, lawmakers favor short-term importation of drugs in short supply to help bring down U.S. prices. 0 Shares ",

Earlier this month, Trump made headlines for blasting the company on Twitter for alleged cost overruns with the new fleet of Air Force One planes. Trump called on the government to cancel the contract and called the supposed $4 billion price tag out of control. Boeing\u2019s Dennis Muilenburg, who met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., addressed the media after the meeting and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done for less than that, and we\u2019re committed to working together to make sure that happens.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump adviser the founder of SkyBridge Capital, tweeted about the price reduction and called it a \u201cbig win for taxpayers.\u201d Trump also met Wednesday with Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s Marillyn Hewson after he criticized the cost of its F-35. \"Trying to get the costs down, costs.

According to a senior U.S. intelligence official, part of the message read: \"International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace...\" \"We will hold Russia to those standards.\" Related: Why Obama Didn't Do More About Russian Hacks At least one of President Obama's senior advisers urged him to warn the Russians that any tampering on Election Day would be considered an act of war.

But a senior intelligence official told NBC News, in his opinion, the message ultimately sent to the Kremlin was \"muddled.\" The Russians seem to agree. Play ",

In the Chicago area this year, about 192,744 consumers enrolled for Jan. 1 coverage. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) Lisa Schencker Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Despite Obamacare 's shaky future, more Illinois residents signed up for health insurance through the law's exchange this year than last, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. This year, 247,818 people in Illinois signed up on the exchange by the Dec. 19 deadline to purchase coverage that would begin Jan. 1. That's compared with 232,750 who signed up for coverage last year, said Jonathan Gold, a department spokesman. This year's enrollment period was two days longer than last year. Across the country, 6.4 million consumers signed up for coverage \u2014 400,000 more than the same time last year, according to the department. In the Chicago area this year, about 192,744 consumers enrolled for Jan. 1 coverage. Consumers still have until Jan. 31 to choose insurance on the exchange, but their coverage won't begin with the new year. Many observers wondered whether consumers in Illinois and elsewhere would continue to buy coverage on the exchange. Many consumers said they felt frustrated by 2017 plan choices, which don't always include all of their preferred doctors and hospitals. A number of insurers decided not to participate next year, and prices for coverage generally increased. Donald Trump's election also cast uncertainty over the enrollment period. Trump has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and Congress is expected to take action in coming weeks to strip away parts of the law. What Obamacare offers The basics of Obamacare. Oct. 28, 2016.\u00a0 The basics of Obamacare. Oct. 28, 2016.\u00a0 But the numbers released Wednesday prove that Americans still want coverage, said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell in a call with reporters Wednesday. \"Doomsday predictions about the marketplace were wrong,\" Burwell said. Kathy Waligora, director of the health reform initiative of EverThrive Illinois, said the numbers show that Illinois residents value access to health care. \"I think uncertainty about the future of their health insurance plan is still less of a risk than uncertainty about their financial security if they don't have health insurance,\" Waligora said.

A gender-neutral sign is posted outside a bathroom at Oval Park Grill in Durham, N.C., in May. (Sara D. Davis / Getty Images) Jenny Jarvie It was billed as an opportunity to end the nation\u2019s most bitter political stalemate over LGBT rights. Yet as dusk fell on North Carolina\u2019s Capitol on Wednesday, legislators refused to repeal House Bill 2, which limits transgender bathroom access and curbs legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. On Monday, Gov.-elect Roy Cooper, a Democrat, announced that Republican House and Senate leaders had assured him that after the city of Charlotte repealed its anti-discrimination ordinance, a special session would be called to \u201crepeal HB2 in full.\u201d Yet after hours of intense backroom maneuvering Wednesday, legislators in the Senate offered only a compromise bill that repealed HB2 while introducing a moratorium, or \u201ccooling-off period,\u201d that would prevent local governments across the state from crafting or changing anti-discrimination ordinances\u00a0 After 5:30 p.m., the House voted 58 to 45 to adjourn, ignoring the pleas of two Democratic representatives. The Senate did the same less than an hour later. In a June 2016 file photo, then-North Carolina Atty. Gen. Roy Cooper speaks during a forum in Charlotte, N.C.

Roy Cooper speaks during a forum in Charlotte, N.C. (Chuck Burton / AP) \u201cI can\u2019t bring myself in good conscience to leave this building without a full and unequivocal repeal of House Bill 2,\u201d said Chris Sgro, a gay Democratic representative who is executive director of the advocacy group Equality NC. \u201cIf we adjourn, we are clear on who is playing politics with the people of North Carolina.\u201d Earlier, Senate leader Phil Berger had tried to persuade Democrats and Republicans to compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple bill, and the concept is that we have to take the state back to the status quo before Charlotte passed its ordinance,\u201d Berger said Wednesday morning as he introduced the compromise bill. \u201cThis is the right thing to do for our state. It gives everyone an opportunity to start over.\u201d One by one, a parade of Democrats in the Senate stood up on the floor to oppose Republican bills and amendments, accusing senators of betrayal and trickery. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the deal,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Jackson, who argued that Charlotte officials had acted in good faith in overturning its ordinance before the special session. \u201cThis bill breaks that deal.\u201d \u201cIt's smoke and mirrors, a mirage,\u201d Democratic Sen. Angela Bryant said to Republicans, criticizing another amendment that extended the moratorium on future ordinances from six months to more than a year. \"I don't know if you think the public is stupid.\" The upper galleries of the House and Senate chambers were packed with hundreds of activists and campaigners as Democrats railed against conservative, rural legislators who had supported HB2 and now seemed to be reneging on a repeal. Why a repeal of North Carolina's bathroom bill comes with a price for LGBT advocates \u00bb Republicans maintain strong majorities, with veto power, in the House and Senate. A repeal would have required moderate Republicans to side with Democrats, and a number of Democrats to switch positions: In March, 11 rural Democrats supported HB2, allowing the bill to pass the House by a 82-26 vote. As the House and Senate declared recess after recess, Republican legislators spent hours huddled behind closed doors. Outside the chambers, protesters held up placards saying, \u201cY\u2019all means all\u201d and \u201cFull repeal and go home.\u201d The standoff over LGBT rights began in February when Charlotte, the state\u2019s largest city, passed an ordinance that expanded nondiscrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity and allowed people to choose restrooms according to the gender with which they identify. Swiftly, Republicans rushed through the law, formally known as the Public Facilities and Privacy Security Act, which orders schools and public agencies to require multiple-occupancy restrooms to be used by people based on the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law also prevents cities from extending anti-discrimination laws to LGBT people and from passing any increase in the $7.25 minimum wage. The prospect of a repeal came Monday when Charlotte\u2019s predominantly Democratic City Council announced it had voted to rescind part of its ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity.\u00a0 Charlotte\u2019s abrupt turnaround shocked many Republicans and LGBT activists. In May, the City Council had refused to repeal the ordinance in exchange for the state modifying HB2, arguing it would not compromise LGBT rights. In September, when legislators offered to repeal HB2 entirely if the city repealed its ordinance, Mayor Jennifer Roberts again declined to make the first move.\u00a0\u00a0 Many hoped a repeal would offer a rare show of unity and bipartisanship between Democrats and Republicans, capping off a year of intense acrimony. After a razor-thin gubernatorial election, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory refused to concede to Cooper for nearly a month. And last week, the Capitol was the scene of angry protests as Republican leaders organized a special session to pass two laws designed to rein in Cooper's powers when he becomes governor Jan. 1. Cooper in turn threatened a lawsuit. Yet it was not to be. At the end of the day, both sides traded recriminations. \"Today, the legislature had the chance to do the right thing for North Carolina and they failed,\u201d Cooper, the governor-elect, said at a late-night news conference. \u201cRepublican legislative leaders have broken their word to me and they have broken their trust with the people of North Carolina.\u201d Although Democrats railed at Republican leaders for failing to bring their caucus into line, Republicans in turn blamed Democrats for steadfastly rejecting any repeal that would have included a moratorium on cities passing nondiscrimination ordinances. Republicans also lashed out at Charlotte\u2019s leaders for only partially repealing their ordinance on Monday, a fact that some Republicans cited as a sticking point \u2014 even after the City Council reconvened Wednesday morning for an emergency meeting to fully repeal changes it made in February. \u201cWe were told that Charlotte had repealed and it turned out they had not,\u201d House Rules Chairman David Lewis said after the House adjourned, noting that this had made it more of a challenge for him to persuade wary Republicans to trust the city. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what a huge hurdle that was.\u201d Unlike the city\u2019s partial repeal on Monday, its fuller repeal on Wednesday was no longer contingent on legislators overturning HB2, a fact that ultimately took away some of the urgency for legislators to act. \u00a0 Republicans resistant to repealing the law also got encouragement at the beginning of the day when Lt. Gov. Dan Forest spoke out against a repeal. \"No economic, political or ideological pressure can convince me that what is wrong is right,\u201d Forest said in a statement. \u201cIt will always be wrong for men to have access to women's showers and bathrooms. \"With certainty, if HB 2 is repealed, we will fight this battle all over again with another city or county. The names will change, but the national groups who are pushing this agenda will not stop until their social engineering is accomplished.\" Although a group of rural legislators seemed reluctant to repeal HB2 on moral or ethical grounds, some business-minded Republicans were open to repealing HB2 on the basis that the law hurt the state\u2019s economy and reputation. HB2 triggered an overwhelming backlash across the nation, generating boycotts and strong opposition from major corporations including Apple and Google. PayPal abandoned its plan to bring 400 jobs to the state, entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts, and the NBA relocated its All-Star game from Charlotte. \u201cDeep in the bones of the state is a yearning to be a strong economic entity,\u201d said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cAt root, both Democrats and Republicans, even in their stark differences, put economic development first.\u201d At the end of the day, however, Republicans and Democrats seemed wholly divided on the prospects of a future repeal. \"I think today was our best shot,\" said Brian Turner, a Democratic representative. \"I don't think there's going to be another opportunity.\" Republican leaders, he argued, just could not seem to whip their representatives into line. \"Through gerrymandering, there are now Republican seats that are so safe that the leadership has lost the ability to control them. It's almost like a Frankenstein's monster,\" Turner said. Still, some Republican leaders said they would be committed to working out a solution in the new year. \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for me and it\u2019s a priority for many Republicans,\u201d Lewis, the House rules chairman, said after the House adjourned. \u201cWe in the state of North Carolina are going to find a way to respect everyone\u2019s basic human rights. \u201cYou know, I am a Republican, and our party was founded and grew under the belief that everyone\u2019s entitled to equal protection under the law,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow we can find a way to craft legislation to find a solution.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

German police have identified the suspect as 24-year-old Anis Amri. He was being sought in Germany and across Europe's border-free travel zone, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said after briefing Parliament's domestic affairs committee. A reward of up to 100,000 euros ($105,000) is being offered for information that leads to his capture. Anis Amri is being sought by German police in connection with the Christmas market truck ramming in Berlin. Bundeskriminalamt Two U.S.intelligence officials confirmed to NBC News that the Germans were seeking the man in connection with Monday's rampage. Another suspect, a Pakistani migrant, was released Tuesday without charge after police said there was insufficient evidence . Twelve people were killed and 48 wounded when the stolen 27.5-ton truck smashed into wooden huts serving mulled wine and sausages in the capital's Breitscheidplatz on Monday night. The city's police department posted on Twitter that \"508 leads regarding [the attack] were received by our colleagues answering the tip-line \u2026 thank you.\" There were signs of a struggle in the truck's cab and traces of the suspect's DNA were found, regional state broadcaster RBB reported , saying officers searched local hospitals in case the culprit had sought medical treatment. A second arrest was made overnight but that suspect was also released, it added. Meanwhile, Der Spiegel reported that an identity document belonging to a Tunisian man was found in the cab and that a police operation was underway in the region of North Rhine Westphalia. None of those reports could immediately be verified by NBC News. \"We must not be afraid\" Authorities sought to calm nervous Germans who find themselves in the midst of manhunt during the traditionally busy final shopping days before Christmas. \"We must not be afraid,\" Berlin Mayor Michael M\u00fcller told ZDF early Wednesday. \"It would be fatal now if we locked ourselves up at home and did not go out. It is right that we remind people that we have a tense situation and that people must remain vigilant.\" The truck that crashed into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany. Tobias Schwarz / AFP - Getty Images Most of the approximately 60 Christmas markets in Berlin were expected to re-open Wednesday, although Breitscheidplatz remained closed off by forensic teams. Police in Cologne expressed fear of copycat attacks and added extra armed patrols but said closing Christmas markets was not an option. Andre Schulz, national chairman of the Federation of German Detectives, expressed optimism that the investigation would be quick. \"I am relatively confident that we will perhaps [Wednesday] or in the near future be able to present a new suspect,\" he told a discussion panel on ZDF.

Vast majority of HOLA's participants are Latino. Over nearly 30 years, the program has helped hundreds go to college. A handful of students from Orozco's scientific arts program at HOLA have pursued successful technical careers. But Orozco says a lot of his students shy away from the tech industry, despite technical talents: They don't want jobs with any economic risk \u2014 something quite common for work at a startup or in computer science in general. The leak in the pipeline It's even harder to get girls interested. At HOLA, younger kids don't get to choose their classes, but programs become elective for high-school students. Orozco's scientific arts program is \"girl-heavy\" in elementary and middle school, he says. At the high-school level, only two of his 13 students are girls. Article continues after sponsorship And this is one of the clear leaks of the talent pipeline that feeds workers to the tech industry. Year after year, Silicon Valley companies have been criticized for their slow process in employing more women and other underrepresented groups, which for tech are black and Latino. And often, they say they simply can't find enough qualified workers to hire. Why Some Diversity Thinkers Aren't Buying The Tech Industry's Excuses As you go through the tech talent \"pipeline\" to find where it leaks, HOLA illustrates a major one. Somewhere between middle school and high-school graduation, girls' interest in tech peaks and wanes. Down the line, women make up roughly half of U.S. workers and of the U.S. population \u2014 but on average represent less than a third of tech companies' employees. For black and Hispanic workers, the numbers drop into single-digits: These groups tend to comprise 3 percent or less of tech companies' employees. And it's not just technical fields, but all staff and leadership roles. The MySpace gateway Attempting to reverse-engineer interest in tech, we asked women in a Slack group called \" Techquer\u00eda \" for Latinos in tech: How did you first get into it? I like to think about it as, I walked in the back door, so that I could open the front door for everybody else. Raquel V\u00e9lez, on being a Latina in tech A surprising number of women replied: MySpace. The now-arcane social network allowed for a lot of customization \u2014 users could mess with the color schemes, fonts, add bells and whistles by tinkering with the source code. The site's popularity in the mid-2000s introduced many middle- and high-school girls to basic HTML. Dalia Icedo was the queen of cool MySpace designs: She got so good at customizing profiles that she created a whole separate page where other people could get her themes. \"I would change the color scheme literally every day, probably,\" she says, \"because I was 12, I had nothing else to do.\" The skills came in handy after high school, when she started an online shop to sell things like band pins and earrings \u2014 and began tinkering with visuals that bugged her, like margins that felt too wide. \"So I started to just go into the code and started to see a lot of the HTML and CSS that I had learned before. And then from there I just started to pick up JavaScript,\" says Icedo, who is in college and wants to become a UX (user experience) designer in Silicon Valley. \"It gave me a lot more confidence of being able to pick up coding.\" The consumer/creator breakdown Today, social media is no less popular than 10 years ago \u2014 and girls are more avid users than boys, especially on Snapchat and Instagram. But as technology has become more user-friendly, it's also become less customizable \u2014 even grandparents can use Facebook, but how many of us understand how it works? And talking with young girls, few are drawing the connection between using popular apps and thinking that they could program them. The number of women studying math and computer science in college peaked in the 1980s \u2014 even as overall, women receive the growing majority of bachelor's degrees. NPR's Planet Money podcast dug into this phenomenon , zeroing in on the year 1984: \"Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. ... And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.\" When Women Stopped Coding Now, both the corporate marketers and the diversity activists have been trying to figure out the sensitive matter of how to market tech to girls. The line between \"girly\" and \"for girls\" can be thin. What matters is what girls can actually do with the technology, says Deldelp Medina , co-founder of Latina-focused accelerator Avion Ventures who's now at tech diversity nonprofit Code2040. A small pink computer isn't terrible per se, Medina argues: Smaller keyboards are actually nice to prevent carpal tunnel in smaller hands. What's insulting is if this computer comes with less processing power, memory or useful software than a regular one. \"There's a difference,\" she says, \"between wanting to celebrate your femininity and shrinking and pinking something.\" The mentorship challenge Targeting girls with technology can get thorny. But Andrea Guendelman, creator of Latinos-in-tech social network BeVisible , says one \u2014 if not the only \u2014 thing that works is mentorship. In the summer of 2014, Jazmine Fernandez was one of the young women in the Girls Who Code program. Being raised by a single mother and sisters, Fernandez knew there's little women can't do. But when she heard she got placed at Facebook, Fernandez felt intimidated \u2014 excited, but mostly scared. Women and everybody who's currently underrepresented in the tech industry has to gain those skillsets, because otherwise, it will not go well for any of us. Deldelp Medina, on the tech-worker shortage \"Because when I went, there was just a lot of...\" Her voice trails off. \"There was... How do I say this?\" Her mentor, Raquel V\u00e9lez, steps in: \"There weren't a lot people who looked like you, huh?\" Fernandez heard V\u00e9lez give a talk at Facebook headquarters, and she made a huge impression: Latinas can get jobs in Silicon Valley. \"One of my favorite quotes ever is, 'You can't be it if you can't see it,' \" says V\u00e9lez, engineering manager at software company NPM. \"Believe me, I have like 25 mentors, and it's the only way I can make it through, because so often I'm the only one.\" Fernandez is now studying computer science at San Francisco State University. She expects the field to always be a struggle. In one of her classes, a guy once basically tried to argue that girls can't code. And to be Latina in tech, V\u00e9lez says you have to work four times as hard. \"I like to think about it as, I walked in the back door, so that I could open the front door for everybody else.\" The end of the pipeline Where mentorship particularly comes into play is at the end of the pipeline, where underrepresented groups struggle to get hired and stay hired. Silicon Valley is a boys' club whose networks tend to stay white, male and affluent. One company trying to break the cycle is Atipica. It has built a computer program to sift through resumes \u2014 skipping human managers to avoid hiring biases, like subconscious discrimination based on a last name or school attended. 'Diversity' Is Rightly Criticized As An Empty Buzzword. So How Can We Make It Work? Atipica's isn't the only resume-reading artificial intelligence. But often, algorithms reflect the biases of humans who write them. Atipica CEO Laura Gomez says her company specifically focused on designing an unbiased AI. (Neither Gomez, nor her clients, which include Slack, agreed to discuss how well Atipica's program works.) Chicago-based Opternative offers another example of tackling diversity head-on. It's a startup that lets people do their own eye exams. In many ways, Opternative operates like many other startups, relying on referrals from its existing employees. Yet it's grown into a pretty diverse group because from the get-go, its team wasn't just white guys and it views diversity of life experiences as an asset. The blind spot But here's the tricky part: While both companies get high marks for being racially diverse, gender equity remains a challenge. Atipica, a Latina-run company, has one other female employee . Opternative's technical team has women on the design side and in junior positions, but all four of its senior engineers \u2014 the leaders and decision-makers \u2014 are male. More Than A Pipeline Problem: In Search Of Diversity In Silicon Valley Gomez and Opternative CTO Ayo Jimoh say the women they've seen apply for their job openings were under-qualified for those positions. It's effectively the pipeline argument. Jimoh's diagnosis is that people self-select \u2014 they don't want to pursue careers that are stacked against them, they need role models, success stories of others like them. So then, who is responsible for creating those role models? Couldn't Jimoh or Gomez, for example, spend extra time to find a female senior engineer or promote from within? \"There is a part of me that says, let me me show,\" says Gomez, \"but I have to put my business first and foremost.\" Jimoh, too, says he has to balance that responsibility for equity with his other responsibilities \"to my company, to my team, to myself, to my family.\" In a way, the push for diversity in tech is still so new, it's often treated as a cause or a mission \u2014 and fighting for a cause and running a business aren't the same. At the end of the day, Atipica and Opternative weren't founded to heal Silicon Valley's diversity problem \u2014 but to fill what they see as a market need. Intel Discloses Diversity Data, Challenges Tech Industry To Follow Suit And these are small companies \u2014 the gender balance of staff is even harder to shift at massive ships like Facebook or Google. A few companies, such as Intel and Twitter, have recently started releasing hiring goals, putting diversity in quantifiable terms. The targets are very far from lofty, but they're specific, public \u2014 presumably someone's measurable responsibility. The future of the economy And now, there's a new challenge. As Donald Trump takes over as president of the United States, diversity advocates are worried about a push against the very concept of promoting multiculturalism. \"I think we need to double-down on diversity and inclusion, quite frankly,\" says Daisy Dominguez-Auger, global head of diversity at Google. \"Companies are going to have to take a stronger look at what their practices are ... in a much more collaborative way.\" Fundamentally, the Trump administration's economic policy is expected to focus heavily on manufacturing jobs. One of the first conversations Trump had with a tech leader after the election, was a call with Apple CEO Tim Cook, in which Trump pushed for Apple to build plants in the United States. Trump And Technology Executives Try To Reconcile Rough Relationship From what we know, Trump has yet to address the shortage of skilled tech workers. And many economists predict, that's a major challenge for the future of America: The economy of the future is one where almost everyone has to interact with computers and code. Diversity advocate Medina says sidelining large swaths of the population from the tech industry is no way to make sure America isn't left behind. \"We're going to have a jobs deficit that is so huge, that if we don't fill it, we're going to have severe economic consequences,\" she says. \"Women and everybody who's currently underrepresented in the tech industry has to gain those skillsets, because otherwise, it will not go well for any of us.\" Latino USA's Jeanne Montalvo, Noam Hassenfeld and Julia Shu contributed to this report.

But Messmer put them on his feet before singing the national anthem at Wrigley Field before Game 5 of the World Series , the same size 9\u00bd Ds he was wearing April 9, 1994, when he was shot in the neck and nearly died. To Messmer, slipping the shoes on again helped a man full of gratitude feel grounded. As he announced his footwear choice to his wife, Kathleen, she winked like a woman who understood the significance of the steps her husband would take that day. \"An extremely personal moment,'' Wayne said. \"Some people will find it creepy or disturbing but if you get it, you really get it. \u2026 She got it.'' She lived it. \"Those shoes remind Wayne that life is precious and that you never know when the gifts you've been given could be taken away,'' Kathleen said. Without walking a mile in Messmer's shoes, as they say, it seems easy to understand why this was not your ordinary fashion statement. The near-death experience more than two decades ago still frames every day for Messmer, 66, best known for the baritone voice that made Anthem Singer a brand in Chicago. Around 1:50 a.m. after a Blackhawks victory that April night, Messmer walked the 1 1/2 blocks to his car after leaving Hawkeye's Bar and Grill at 1458 W. Taylor St. When Messmer attempted to drive away, two men approached the vehicle and one, a 15-year-old, shot him in the neck from point-blank range with a 9 mm pistol. Cubs fans 17 long minutes to ponder their panic and question curses \u2014 a cat, a goat, a fan and a first baseman. Mother Nature also allowed Jason Heyward to summon the longtime Lovable... A rain delay helped end a drought. The sky opened over downtown Cleveland that unseasonably warm Nov. 2 night, giving Cubs fans 17 long minutes to ponder their panic and question curses \u2014 a cat, a goat, a fan and a first baseman. Mother Nature also allowed Jason Heyward to summon the longtime Lovable... (Chicago Tribune staff) Somehow, Messmer drove back to the bar where he stumbled out of the car and into an ambulance that rushed him to Cook County Hospital. The \"Save The Children Foundation\" tie they used to stop the bleeding from Messmer's neck until they reached the hospital now hangs in a frame on a wall at his home. After 10 hours of surgery and 2 1/2 days asleep, Messmer woke up feeling like the luckiest man in the city. One doctor later told Messmer he had no medical explanation why he survived, and with his voice intact. \"When you get that close to death, you get past why did it happen and ask why did I get better? What am I going to do with this gift?'' said Messmer, who also still has the leather Blackhawks jacket with a bullet hole in the collar. \"It was nothing short of miraculous. So I can't possibly have a day I'm not totally grateful.'' After recovering, Messmer visited both men responsible for hurting him in jail to forgive them, a remarkable gesture. \"I discovered that the only antidote for revenge is forgiveness,'' Messmer said. The senior executive vice-president of the Wolves AHL team found strength writing about the ordeal in a book, \"The Voice of Victory,'' and giving motivational speeches. Ultimately, he persevered, as Messmer vowed to do lying in his hospital bed when he established three goals with a patched hole in his throat: Sing with his wife again, record an album of songs from his heart and sing the anthem before a Cubs World Series game. \"I needed to grab onto something,'' Messmer said of the goals. \"It was a moment of tremendous anger and frustration and disappointment that everything of my fondest dreams may have been stolen \u2026 so I was not going to allow it.'' He and Kathleen sang again months after the incident and, in 2012, Messmer released \"So Lucky To Be Loving You,'' with noted pianist Judy Roberts. The recording of that album marked the other occasion Messmer pulled out his special black dress shoes, which stayed neatly in his closet until hours before Game 5 of the World Series. Photos from Game 5 of the World Series at Wrigley Field on Oct. 30, 2016. Managing nerves surprisingly challenged the die-hard Cubs fans who later joked he had bruises from pinching himself so much. As much as Messmer kept his composure kibitzing pre-game, the magnitude of the moment hit him when he looked at home plate and saw the World Series 2016 logo. \"I remember thinking this isn't a Tuesday afternoon in May against the Phillies,'' Messmer said. \"But then I also thought, it's still the same exact thing. The act doesn't change. To me, the last thing I want to sound is cocky, but I think I earned that spot to be there after 32 years of bad baseball. So I was ready.'' In layman's terms, Messmer crushed it. Cubs manager Joe Maddon hugged Messmer after his final note and the crowd went crazy, appreciation mixed with anticipation. He had risen to the occasion just as the Cubs would later in a 3-2 victory, punctuating each syllable with the proper panache and finishing with his signature flourish \"home of the brave.'' Performing the anthem at the 1991 NHL All-Star game at old Chicago Stadium days after the Gulf War began carved a niche in Chicago sports lore for Messmer, who has sung for every team in town. He ranks that 1991 career highlight up there with singing at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., where broadcasting legend Mel Allen introduced him, and at O'Hare during President George W. Bush's visit Sept. 27, 2001. He has sang the anthem publicly nearly 5,000 times, the latest stirring rendition coming Sunday in the bitter cold at Soldier Field. But Messmer never has been prouder of the version he delivered Oct. 30 at Clark and Addison, where the dreams of a boy and the vows of a man also intersected. \"I rarely do any flash but I threw a little fist pump at the end of (the anthem),'' Messmer said. \"I loved it. Yep. I knew. That was my moment.'' It must have been the shoes. dhaugh@chicagotribune.com Twitter @DavidHaugh Caption A city's love for the Cubs at parade and rally Chicago came out to support the 2016 World Series champion\u00a0Cubs during a parade and rally on Nov. 4, 2016.

    "text": "Email \"Obamacare\" seems to be holding its own. The administration said Wednesday that 6.4 million people have enrolled for subsidized private coverage for 2017 through HealthCare.gov, ahead of last year's pace. Despite rising premiums, dwindling insurers, and the Republican vow to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law , about 400,000 more people signed up through Monday than for a comparable period in 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services Department said. \"Today's enrollment numbers confirm that doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out,\" said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell. Still, it's too early for supporters of the Affordable Care Act , or ACA, to say \"I told you so.\" It's unclear if the administration will meet its target of 13.8 million sign-ups. That's partly because the share of new customers is down when compared with current consumers re-upping for another year. New customers are 32 percent of the total this year versus 40 percent around the same time last year. Administration officials said they're going to focus on getting more new customers between now and the end of open enrollment Jan. 31. Other vital signs for HealthCare.gov were encouraging. \"There are zero signs that the ACA's marketplaces are in danger of imminent collapse,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, who has followed the health care law from its inception. That carries an implicit warning for President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who have promised to move quickly to repeal the law. That repeal would be followed by a GOP-inspired replacement. Although immediate changes affecting 2017 are unlikely, the whole process could take several years, creating uncertainty for people with coverage. As if on cue, Democratic governors Wednesday fired off a letter to GOP congressional leaders, calling the repeal plan \"nothing more than a Washington, D.C., bait-and-switch\" that would leave millions uninsured and shift to states an estimated $69 billion over a decade in uncompensated care costs. The statistics released Wednesday are for 39 states served by the federal online insurance marketplace. Numbers from states running their own markets have not been fully tallied, and will be added later, raising the total. Toward the end of this month, several million current customers who are being re-enrolled automatically will be added to the count. Some of the biggest sign-up numbers so far are coming from states Trump won in the presidential election , including Florida (1.3 million); Texas (776,000); North Carolina (369,000); Georgia (352,000), and Pennsylvania (291,000). Vice president-elect Mike Pence's home state of Indiana had 119,000 residents enrolled. Premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan in HealthCare.gov states are going up an average of 25 percent next year, driven by lower-than-expected enrollment and higher medical costs. At the same time, about one-third of U.S. counties will have only one marketplace insurer next year because some major commercial carriers have left the market, and many nonprofit insurance co-ops created by the law have collapsed. The impact of premium increases has been softened by the law's subsidies, which are designed to rise if the cost of insurance goes up. A study last week from the nonpartisan Center for Health and Economy found that the average monthly subsidy will increase by $76, or 26 percent, from $291 currently to $367 in 2017. But that means taxpayers will fork over nearly $10 billion more. The study estimated that the cost of premium subsidies will increase by $9.8 billion next year, rising from $32.8 billion currently to $42.6 billion. Even if the law's rising subsidies are working to keep customers in the market, independent analyst Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health said the apparent slow-down in new consumers should concern the administration. \"At this time, enrollment appears to be slightly behind the pace needed to reach the administration's goal of signing up 13.8 million people,\" she said. \"However, if more people who are currently in the market renew their coverage, then that goal could still be achieved.\" HealthCare.gov's advertising in the closing weeks of open enrollment will be aimed at attracting new customers, said HHS Secretary Burwell. In addition, the IRS will be sending people who paid fines for being uninsured a not-too-subtle nudge, reminding them that they can avoid higher penalties for 2017 by signing up now. Republicans plan to repeal \"Obamacare\" early next year, but it could take up to several years to replace it. During the interlude, party leaders have promised an orderly transition to a new system. It's unclear what that would involve, but presumably some of the law's popular provisions \u2014 such as subsidies and protection for those with pre-existing medical conditions \u2014 would be kept in place. The 2010 health overhaul added coverage for about 20 million people through a combination of subsidized private health insurance and a state option to expand Medicaid. Several Republican states adopted the Medicaid expansion, including Indiana under Pence. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ",

    "text": "By Dan Ruetenik The Aegean route is mostly closed, but the migrants keep coming, from Eritrea, Ethiopia and elsewhere. They cross the Mediterranean to Italy, a country struggling to deal with the influx. A political crisis is blooming, and the country\u2019s institutions are straining to keep up. The Italian Coast Guard has its hands full responding to the barrage of calls for rescue placed over satellite phones by distressed migrants at sea. Local municipalities have no housing for the migrants who try to keep moving north, and the police face the gruesome task of identifying the waterlogged bodies of those who die before they reach shore. The European Union\u2019s flailing response to the migrant crisis is driving political upheaval in Italy, where voters are taking a critical look at the country\u2019s membership in the union. Anti-European parties like the Five Star Movement and the Northern League led the opposition to a package of measures endorsed by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi that voters rejected in a referendum on Dec. 12, prompting Mr. Renzi to resign. Still, some Italians refuse to give up trying to help the migrants, seeing the humanity in their plight. These videos explore the overwhelmed Italian institutions, and the individuals fighting for the migrants. Video Dr. Pietro Bartolo tends to newborn twins flown to Lampedusa island on Aug. 29, the largest single day of sea rescues of migrants in the history of the Italian Coast Guard. Credit Alessandro Pavone for The New York Times Publish Date December 21, 2016 Many migrants reach Libya, the starting point for the sea journey to Europe, after fleeing war and famine in their own countries. Many arrive malnourished or injured, only to be herded aboard flimsy rafts and rickety boats by smugglers for the treacherous journey north. With luck, they will be rescued in international waters shortly after they embark. Those who are in the most desperate need of medical attention \u2014 suffering from gunshot wounds, perhaps, or pregnant \u2014 are taken to a small hospital on Lampedusa, the resort island that is the southernmost point of Italy. This hospital has essentially become the trauma ward for the Mediterranean. Video Andrea Costa, the director of the Baobab migrant camp, addresses a group of migrants in Rome. Credit Dan Ruetenik for The New York Times Publish Date December 21, 2016 Migrants who reach Italian shores are initially housed in camps, mostly in Sicily. But most want to reach countries farther north, so they leave the camps and head for Italy\u2019s borders by bus or train. Municipal governments along the way are swamped with migrants and are unable to provide all of them with food or shelter, so the task falls to private Italian citizens. In Rome, Andrea Costa has organized an informal camp for migrants. \u201cThey deserve to meet Rome, to meet Roman people in the best way possible,\u201d he says. Video Professor Cristina Cattaneo attempts to determine the identities of the bodies of migrants who died at sea. Credit Dan Ruetenik for The New York Times Publish Date December 21, 2016 The bodies of migrants who die on the way to Italy usually provide few clues about their identities. But to properly return their remains to next of kin, someone must determine who they were. Forensic pathologists like Prof. Cristina Cattaneo often have no hard information to work with. \u201cI think these dead people and their families, they deserve the same treatment as other victims of mass disasters have,\u201d Professor Cattaneo said. \u201cAnd they have not had it.\u201d What's Next ",

The right-wing website Breitbart drew attention to the presence of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirts on Walmart\u2019s site earlier this month, which prompted some on Twitter to call for a boycott of the retailer.\u00a0 \u2014 Brenda Jones (@bjonesbrazil) December 21, 2016 Like many retailers doing business online, Walmart offers merchandise from third-party sellers on its website, which can be distinguished by a small note on the product page. As of Wednesday afternoon, shirts with the \u201cBulletproof\u201d slogan could not be found on Walmart\u2019s website. Plenty of other merchandise with phrases like \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cBlue Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d and even \u201cJournalists Lives Matter\u201d was available at $18 to $42 apiece. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

A man pours beer into another man's mouth as fans in Wrigleyville celebrate the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup victory\u00a0June 15, 2015. (Erin Hooley, Chicago Tribune) Matt LindnerChicago Tribune Lakeview is living up \u2014 or down, depending on how you view it \u2014 to its reputation as one of the biggest party neighborhoods in the city of Chicago. Just-released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Lakeview has the highest rate of binge drinking in the city, and one of the highest in the country. Geolocation coordinates provided by the CDC rank the area around Wrigley Field as having the 20th highest rate of binge drinking in the country and the highest in the city of Chicago, with 34.1 percent of all residents engaging in the activity within the past 30 days. The CDC defines binge drinking as \"drinking 5 or more drinks on an occasion for men or 4 or more drinks on an occasion for women,\" and heavy drinking as \"drinking 15 or more drinks per week for men, or 8 or more drinks per week for women.\" The CDC ranked 29,000 census tracts as part of its 500 Cities project . A quick analysis of the CDC's data shows that overall, Chicago has 13 census tracts among the top 50 highest binge drinking rates in the country. Taking a look at the map of the city of Chicago shows a sharp contrast in the drinking habits of residents north and south of I-290. The vast majority of neighborhoods north of the interstate and closer to Lake Michigan show at least 24.4 percent of all residents in the area have engaged in binge drinking within the past month. Head south of I-290 and you'll see vast swaths of areas where 12.7 percent or fewer residents have engaged in the behavior in the past month. The fact that Lakeview has such a high concentration of binge drinkers is likely about as big of a surprise as the fact that it gets cold in Chicago during the winter given the fact that the neighborhood includes both Wrigleyville and Boystown, two areas of the city well known for their nightlife.

    "text": "<p>President-elect Donald Trump looks toward the media as he arrives at a costume party at the home of hedge fund billionaire and campaign donor Robert Mercer in Head of the Harbor, New York, Dec. 3, 2016.</p> Close Reuters/Mark Kauzlarich Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is asking State Department officials to reveal how much of their funding goes towards international environmental groups, according to a new Washington Post report. The query, posed in a list of questions to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, asked, \u201cHow much does the Department of State contribute annually to international environmental organizations in which the department participates?\u201d State Department spokesperson John Kirby noted Wednesday, however, that there is \u201cnothing out of hte norm\u201d regarding questions being asked by the transition team.\u00a0 The questions, Kirby told reporters, were \u201cvery much aligned with their need to better understand the bureaucracy and organization that they\u2019re about to lead.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNothing falls outside the normal inquiries,\u201d Kirby said.\u00a0 Despite State Department assurances, the inquiry has increased worries that the president-elect\u2019s transition team is prioritizing a rollback of the Obama administration\u2019s actions on climate change and conservation efforts.\u00a0 Tom Steyer, a billionaire hudge fund manager and vocal environmentalist, expressed his concerns to CBS News following the report on the State Department.\u00a0 \u201cDonald Trump is hellbent on destroying the protections and programs the American people want and deserve,\u201d Steyer said in a statement. \u201cTrump needs to stop taking orders from Big Oil cronies and polluters and start listening to the American people.\u201d While Mr. Trump has met with prominent climate change activists since his election victory, the president-elect has also tapped several people to lead government agencies that have agendas contrary to Mr. Obama\u2019s own climate and renewable fuel focus. For instance, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt -- who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency -- is a vocal denier of climate change science and has even sued the Obama administration over its clean power plant rules. Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, oil magnate Rex Tillerson, has said climate change could pose \u201csignificant\u201d risks, but there is little indication that the Exxon Mobil executive will prioritze the issue.\u00a0 Mr. Trump also threatened during his campaign to scuttle the United States\u2019 involvement in the landmark Paris climate change accord, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and try to reverse global warming effects. The Paris treaty holds the U.S. accountable for donating $3 billion over four years to the Green Climate Fund, which is devoted to helping poorer countries weather the detrimental effects of climate change. Similarly, the Energy Department was also recently sent a questionnaire to divulge the names of employees who had worked on climate change policies. The department said it would not be complying with that request, and the Trump transition team disavowed the original questionnaire , saying it \u201cwas not authorized.\u201d The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment confirming the Post report. According to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget , of the State Department\u2019s 2016 budget of $30.91 billion, about $128 million was allocated for natural resources and the environment. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "3 Things to Consider After the Latest Yahoo Breach By Adam Levin Dec 21, 2016, 11:09 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Yahoo Data Breach Could Be Largest in History 0 Shares Email No payment card or banking data were compromised in a breach of 1 billion user accounts at Yahoo, according to reports. But what if they had been? The truth is that for most users, it would be annoying but not the end of the world. So why is this big news? First of all, Yahoo can now claim two of the biggest security breaches in history. It is noteworthy that such a distinction should be attributable to a single entity. The response to the latest breach has been huge. Ask any three experts and you'll probably get three different figures, but according to tech news site ZDNet, the number of users exposed in the two Yahoo breaches nearly double the total records compromised from 2005 to 2013. The first breach, affecting 500 million user accounts, occurred in 2014 but was not disclosed by Yahoo until this September. Earlier this month, Yahoo revealed that a separate hack of 1 billion user accounts took place in 2013. \"We believe that the August 2013 incident is likely distinct from the incident we disclosed on Sept. 22, 2016,\" a Yahoo representative told Credit.com. However, \"there is some overlap in the population of potentially affected users' accounts across the 2013 and 2014 events,\" said a source familiar with the situation. After Yahoo revealed the 2013 breach, various news outlets published commentaries and articles. Some advised users to delete their Yahoo accounts. Others predicted that the latest bad news would further negatively affect Yahoo's sale to Verizon, if not kill it. But Yahoo is not the problem, per se. First of all, let's be crystal clear: This latest news does not refer to the 500 million Yahoo users who were affected by the breach reported this September. While there may be some overlap, this is a different breach with different issues. The bad news here is that this unsettling state of affairs \u2014 of having your information out there at the fingertips of bad players looking to make a quick buck \u2014 is not confined to Yahoo users. The real bad news is that we are all willing or unwitting conspirators in the exploitation of our information, which has been sloshing around the hold of a virtual, somewhat unmanned freighter for years. There is, however, a bit of good news here. There are ways you can better protect yourself. Subscriptions to all the identity theft monitoring services in the world cannot replace your active participation in your own defense. You are your own best guardian. Regardless of whether you choose to stay with Yahoo, it's a good idea to change your behavior to stay safe, and that means changing your outlook and approach to the digital world. The main point is this: We are always about to get got. You don't need breaking news coverage to know that you are exposed. With literally billions of compromised files floating around, you have to be exceedingly lucky not to be within easy reach of a thieves looking to make bank at your inconvenience. While there is no way out of the information inferno we all inhabit, there is a way to live in it. I go into the details more thoroughly in my book, \u201cSwiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers and Identity Thieves,\u201d but the basics of the practice I explain there can be summed up by three Ms: Minimize your risk of exposure: This can be anything from how you use the internet to what you choose to carry in your wallet. The goal is to decrease your attackable surface. Monitor your identity: Get a free copy of your credit reports from each of the major credit reporting agencies at least once a year (some states permit more than one) at AnnualCreditReport.com. Consider subscribing to a credit and identity monitoring service. Set up transaction notices with your bank and credit card accounts, and pay attention. If you stay on top of things, you make it harder for crooks to get a foothold into your financial life. And if you have reason to believe you've been the victim of identity theft \u2014 unexplained accounts and mysterious addresses are two warning signs \u2014 don't ignore it. Manage the damage: Notify the authorities if you have become a victim. Get an identity theft incident report that you can use to straighten out your credit and identity issues. Check with your insurance agent, financial services rep and the human resources department where you work to see if they offer identity theft protection programs and if you are enrolled. You may be pleasantly surprised to learn that they do and you are enrolled free or can access one at a discount as a perk of your relationship. You may also want to consider freezing or placing a fraud alert on your credit as well, depending on what's been compromised. Never forget: The ultimate guardian of the consumer is the consumer, and no one has a bigger stake in protecting your economic security and well-being than you. Adam Levin is a co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911. His experience as former director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs gives him unique insight into consumer privacy, legislation and financial advocacy. He is a nationally recognized expert on identity theft and credit and is the author of \"Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers and Identity Thieves.\" Any opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Twitter Gov. John Kasich signed Ohio's \"campus carry\" bill into law this week, making it legal to carry a concealed weapon at day care facilities and on college campuses. Kasich also signed a bill that bars cities and counties from setting their own minimum wage rates. The new laws are among 17 bills that Kasich signed this week. As member station WOSU reports , the minimum wage law is part of a \"Petland bill\" that overrides \"local laws restricting where pet stores could get the animals they sell.\" The legislation was expanded to cover other areas in the Ohio lawmakers' lame-duck session. Another new law signed by Kasich, Am. HB 154, aims to make roads safer for cyclists by setting a 3-foot-minimum safe passing distance when a motor vehicle overtakes a bicycle on the road. But the wage and gun laws are attracting the most interest. Here are more details: The ban on local minimum wage laws is a setback to proponents of a $15-an-hour minimum pay rate, reports the Ideastream member station . \"Clevelanders were set to vote next May on a proposal to phase in that wage increase over the next few years. Many city leaders, including council president Kevin Kelley, opposed raising the wage in the city alone.\" Article continues after sponsorship The station adds, \"Ohio's minimum wage is $8.10 an hour for non-tipped employees. It's set to increase by five cents next year.\" The gun legislation also applies to public areas of airports (but not beyond security screening stations), in addition to colleges and day cares. The Cleveland Plain Dealer provides these details about how guns might be carried on campuses: \"College boards of trustees would have to vote to allow concealed firearms; child care centers and in-home daycare would have to post a sign if firearms aren't allowed. \"The law also allows active-duty military to carry concealed guns without a permit and prohibits employers from banning permit holders from bringing guns into company parking lots. It takes effect in 90 days.\" Two other notable bills were left in limbo, WOSU says: \"Kasich has not taken action on the measure extending the freeze on the state's renewable energy requirements for electric utilities till 2020. And he also didn't sign the legislation that would require state lawmakers to review cabinet-level agencies periodically or they could disappear.\" ",

    "text": "CBS News December 21, 2016, 8:55 AM YouTube star Adam Saleh speaks out after being kicked off Delta flight Email Last Updated Dec 21, 2016 5:39 PM EST YouTube celebrity Adam Saleh, whose prank videos have garnered him a significant online following, has accused Delta Air Lines of kicking him off flight because he spoke Arabic to his mom on the phone before takeoff.\u00a0 \u201cI speak to my mom on the phone every flight,\u201d Saleh told CBSN shortly after video he posted on Twitter showing his removal went viral. \u201cShe only speaks Arabic.\u201d According to Saleh, a woman in the seat in front of him turned around and told him he ought to speak English. Saleh said he told her he can speak whatever language he likes, and her husband responded by standing up and screaming at him. Then about 20 people allegedly said they were uncomfortable with Saleh and his companion. The pair were approached by the captain, who Saleh said \u201cseemed ashamed and embarassed\u201d when he asked them to leave the plane because of the other passengers\u2019 complaints. \u00a0 In a statement, Delta said:\u00a0 \u201cMaintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the cooperation of all of our customers in conjunction with adherence to directions from our crew members. This is a Delta policy and is required by U.S. regulations as well as others governing aviation worldwide. \u201cTwo customers were removed from Delta flight 1 departing London-Heathrow today after a disturbance in the cabin resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort. \u201cWe have spoken with the customers who were removed; they were rebooked on another flight. Plans are in place to immediately speak with our crew and other passengers when the flight lands this afternoon. We will provide an update once we have more information.\u201d Saleh has more than 1.6 million subscribers to his TrueStoryASA \u00a0YouTube channel, and more than 2.2 million subscribers to his Adam Saleh Vlogs YouTube channel. Saleh\u2019s YouTube channels are full of prank videos as well as videos about Muslim life, and he is a self-described \u201cprofessional idiot.\u201d Saleh has a history of posting staged videos designed to look like the real thing, including an\u00a0 infamously faked viral video \u00a0that alleged to have shown anti-Muslim bias from the NYPD. In 2014, Saleh\u2019s video \u201c RACIAL PROFILING EXPERIMENT! \u201d showed him and friend staging a fight twice in front of an alleged police officer, once in Western street clothes, and once in Muslim clothes.\u00a0 The Smoking Gun revealed the hoax \u00a0relatively quickly, but two years later, as of Wednesday morning, Saleh still does not indicate that the video was staged in its description. In February 2016, Saleh posted a video of a\u00a0 self-described \u201csocial experiment\u201d \u00a0in which he counts down from 10 in Arabic aboard a plane.\u00a0 Just last week,\u00a0 Saleh was called out for faking a video \u00a0allegedly showing him sneaking onto a flight inside a suitcase. @omgAdamSaleh Nice try Adam, but definitely a few inconsistencies with this vid, namely the fact we have footage of you boarding the plane! \u2014 Tigerair Australia (@TigerairAU) December 14, 2016 In one video Saleh posted to Twitter, that was retweeted more than 500,000 times, he can be seen getting escorted off the London-to-New York flight. (WARNING: Video contains some strong language that some readers may find offensive.) We got kicked out of a @Delta airplane because I spoke Arabic to my mom on the phone and with my friend slim... WTFFFFFFFF please spread pic.twitter.com/P5dQCE0qos \u2014 Adam Saleh (@omgAdamSaleh) December 21, 2016 As he is slowly walking down the aisle of the jet, Saleh says he is being kicked off for \u201cspeaking a different language.\u201d He said he was just innocently talking to his mother when \u201cwhite\u201d people around him began complaining about his use of Arabic. This led to a handful of Delta personnel asking Saleh to leave the flight. In the video, some passengers can be seen telling the apparent Delta employees that they did not want Saleh removed, while others can be seen waving and saying \u201cbye\u201d as he walks away. He later tweeted that police and security officials interviewed him and the other person kicked off the flight multiple times. UPDATE: We're being security checked AGAIN right now. \u2014 Adam Saleh (@omgAdamSaleh) December 21, 2016 Saleh later said he got on a flight to New York with a different airline after being \u201cchecked\u201d for 30 minutes. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let this go,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cWhat if they do this to people like my mother who can\u2019t even speak English?\u201d No official accounting of what exactly transpired on the flight has been released by the airline or airport security.\u00a0 Some of the passengers on the flight spoke to CBS News after the plane landed at JFK Airport. \u201cIt was clear that this guy knew what he was doing, because as he was leaving the plane he would stop, he would kind of make eye-contact with people. He would say \u2018Delta, Delta is kicking me off the plane.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t alone, he was travelling with somebody else,\u201d Rev. Karen Georgia Thompson told CBS News. Another passenger told CBS News that she felt it was not discriminatory in any way. \u201cI was sitting towards the front of the plane and just heard a lot of commotion actually,\u201d said passenger Jacqueline Willemsen. \u201cWhen he came up to the front he was just screaming that it was an injustice and that he was being kicked off for speaking loudly in Arabic. To be really honest it seemed like more of a scene than anything that actually happened.\u201d \u00a0 However, another passenger told CBS News he had a bit of a different perspective. \u201cI think the guy was giving a bit of a prayer, just before take off, which is not unusual. Somebody heard him speaking in Arabic and I think reported him,\u201d said passenger Chris Ashford. \u201c\u2026Whether Delta performed or acted in the manner they were supposed to, I\u2019m assuming, for protocol, yes. There definitely seemed to be a bit of a misunderstanding.\u201d\u00a0 ",

Of the dead, 26 victims were found at the scene and six died at area hospitals, Jos\u00e9 Manzur, government secretary for the State of Mexico, said at a news conference Wednesday. Eighteen victims have yet to be identified, he said. The explosion occurred at the open-air San Pablito market in Tultepec, in the State of Mexico. Officials said Wednesday that 59 people were wounded during the blasts, with 46 still in hospitals, five of them in grave condition. PHOTOS: Mexicans Survey Devastation After Deadly Fireworks Explosion A 4-year-old girl was flown to Shriners Children's Hospital in Galveston, Texas, for treatment, said Fundaci\u00f3n Michou y Mau, a Mexico City children's charity. The foundation told NBC News that it was trying to transfer another child, a 13-year-old boy named Juan Carlos, who it said had suffered burns over 35 percent of his body. Roberto L\u00f3pez, the charity's director general, told NBC station KPRC of Houston that the organization eventually hopes to send as many as eight children to the United States. \"We're still locating people,\" he said.

Officials have not yet given a cause for the explosions. A 12-year-old witness, Yahir David Sanchez Ortega, said he was outside and going to buy something when the first stand began to explode and \"all the bricks from the fireworks market started flying.\" Yahir said he saw people \"running with blood on their heads\" and screaming for help. \"Everything was exploding until you went deaf, where you couldn't hear all the noise,\" he said. \"I felt like the roof was going to cave and crush my head.\" \"I thought I was going to die,\" he said. Another witness, Juan Carlos Salda\u00f1a, told NBC News on Wednesday that he was still waiting for news on three relatives who have been missing since the explosions. \"We feel devastated, with hope of still finding them,\" he said. Salda\u00f1a said he and his family have not been able to rest as they await word. In addition to his three missing relatives, two other relatives are hospitalized, he said. Salda\u00f1a described running to try to help people who were inside the market as the explosions began. \"I went in to look for my family,\" he said. Mexico has a history of fireworks explosions in market areas, including two previous explosions in Tultepec. At least 62 people were killed in the La Merced market in Mexico City in one of the incidents, on Dec. 12, 1988. Daniella Silva ",

    "text": "Facebook Twitter Updated at 6:25 p.m. ET Two Democratic members of Congress want three federal agencies to work together to get a more accurate count of coal miners suffering from progressive massive fibrosis, the worst stage of the fatal disease known as black lung. The request is a response to an NPR investigation that shows 10 times as many cases of the advanced stage of black lung as identified and reported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. \"This shocking report requires a full accounting of the number of known cases of advanced black lung disease,\" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., who joined Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., in asking federal agencies to respond. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health sent a mobile testing unit to a fire station in Wharton, W.Va., in 2012 to screen coal miners for black lung disease. Howard Berkes/NPR hide caption toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health sent a mobile testing unit to a fire station in Wharton, W.Va., in 2012 to screen coal miners for black lung disease. Howard Berkes/NPR \"A worker who descends into the depth and darkness of our nation's coal mines should not have to suffer in silence,\" Casey added. \"We must work to identify those with black lung and ensure they get the care they need.\" NPR surveyed black lung clinics across Appalachia. Eleven responded, reporting 962 cases of what is also known as \"complicated\" black lung so far this decade. In roughly the same time period, NIOSH reported just 99 cases nationwide. A letter signed by Scott and Casey asks NIOSH to lead a study of complicated black lung cases identified by its own national testing program, by black lung claims handled by the Labor Department's Coal Mine Workers' Compensation Program and by black lung clinics funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Article continues after sponsorship \"It is our larger goal to understand the full dimensions and potential burden of PMF ... diagnosed among current and former coal miners, particularly with regards to the impacts on the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund,\" the lawmakers' letter says. Advanced Black Lung Cases Surge In Appalachia The letter cites the NPR investigation , which raised concerns that unreported and seemingly unrecognized cases of this most severe form of black lung could create unanticipated burdens on the federal program that pays black lung benefits. The program is nearly $6 billion in debt and faces ongoing funding challenges given shutdowns and bankruptcies of some of the mining companies that pay into the fund. \"A large number of PMF cases go undetected by NIOSH,\" the letter says. The lawmakers want each agency to count PMF cases and eliminate any duplication among the agencies \"to learn how the surveillance efforts ... can be improved and so that the full dimensions of black lung in all of its forms can be more readily identified.\" HRSA doesn't require its federally funded black lung clinics to report cases of progressive massive fibrosis. Many of the clinics contacted by NPR were able to provide only partial or incomplete information. Some were unable to provide any data. That suggests the number of cases is much higher than the clinics reported. The lawmakers say they \"understand that NIOSH is willing to take the lead on aggregating and reporting the information\" and hope that the other agencies will find that \"agreeable.\" A spokeswoman for NIOSH said the agency official involved is out of the office for the holidays and not available for comment. A spokesman for HRSA says the agency will respond to Casey and Scott directly. The CMWCP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Black lung is caused by inhalation of coal mine dust. NIOSH and the clinics responding to NPR report advanced cases among much younger miners than historically reported and more rapid progression to severe stages of disease. PMF is incurable and fatal, and is believed to be caused by inhaled silica dust, which is generated when mining companies cut rock and coal together in thin coal seams embedded in quartz. ",

About 50 people gathered at the American Indian Center in Uptown to denounce Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's policies on affordable housing, mental health services, police accountability and education. Three black coffins stood at the front of the center's auditorium underneath a slideshow displaying the names of more than 700 homicide victims. One of the speakers, Camiella Williams, 29, said she has lost many friends and family members to gun violence. \"I am broken. Words cannot describe my pain,\" she said.

(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) Williams and several other speakers, including Black Lives Matter Chicago activist Kofi Ademola Xola, called on Emanuel to hold police accountable for shootings and to fund education, create affordable housing and establish mental health clinics. After the speeches, the crowd marched in a silent procession to Emanuel's home in Ravenswood. They laid the coffins side by side on a snowy patch in front of the mayor's house and placed white flowers and small electronic candles on top. The demonstrators then prayed and took turns speaking to demand change. \"This is genocide being committed against us. Making sure we don't have jobs, education, mental health care, that is to show that we are colonized. We are still fighting for our lives,\" Ademola Xola said. ",

    "text": "Dec 21 2016, 5:27 pm ET Trump's Health Secretary Pick Favors the Rich, Not the Sick, Experts Argue by Maggie Fox advertisement The Georgia Republican congressman being nominated to head the Health and Human Services Department next year under a new Trump administration would gut Obamacare and replace it with plans that favor the well-to-do, two experts argued Wednesday. They say Rep. Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon, would free insurance companies to return to some of their worst abuses of patients and take away subsidies that help the poor afford medical care. WU.S. Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) speaks at the Brookings Institution. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rep. Price to become the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. Alex Wong / Getty Images If he had his way, he'd funnel federal money to people who do not need it, the two former HHS officials who are now health policy experts argue in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Price has sponsored legislation that supports making armor-piercing bullets more accessible and opposing regulation on cigars, and he has voted against regulating tobacco as a drug,\" Sherry Glied, dean of the graduate school of public service at New York University, and Richard Frank, a health care policy professor at Harvard Medical School, wrote in their joint commentary. Related: Trump Taps Price to Head HHS Both were also HHS assistant secretaries under Democratic presidents. \"He has also voted against funding for combating AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; against expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program; and in favor of allowing hospitals to turn away Medicaid and Medicare patients seeking nonemergency care if they could not afford copayments,\" they wrote. \"He opposes stem-cell research and voted against expanding the National Institutes of Health budget and against the recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act, showing particular animus toward the cancer Moonshot,\" they added. \"He opposes stem-cell research and voted against expanding the National Institutes of Health budget.\" Price's office did not immediately return a request for comment from NBC News. Trump's pick of Price has been praised because the congressman is a physician, a rare choice to head HHS \u2014 the agency that oversees the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Medicare and Medicaid. HHS is also where the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, was written and is implemented. Related: Trump HHS Pick Signals Aggressive Obamacare Remake Two other medical doctors have been HHS secretary: Otis Bowen under former president Ronald Reagan, and C. Everett Koop under George H.W. Bush. That should be a plus, Glied and Frank said. \"In their work at HHS, both men, serving in Republican administrations, drew on a long tradition of physicians as advocates for the most vulnerable, defenders of public health and enthusiastic proponents of scientific approaches to clinical care,\" they wrote. \"Tom Price represents a different tradition.\" He may profess to want more accountability in health care, they said. \"But as compared with his predecessors' actions, Price's record demonstrates less concern for the sick, the poor, and the health of the public and much greater concern for the economic wellbeing of their physician caregivers,\" they wrote. Price has been a leading voice for the repeal of Obamacare, which not only set up marketplaces for people to buy subsidized health insurance, but which ended insurance company practices of turning away sick customers and capping payments once patients got expensive to treat. Obamacare rules also require insurance companies to provide preventive care such as cancer screenings and vaccinations without charging patients anything. \"Price's plan would withdraw almost all the ACA's federal consumer protection regulations, including limits on insurer profits.\" Price has criticized Obamacare, saying it's not offering enough options. \"The Obama administration has also admitted that 20 percent of those shopping for insurance on the Obamacare exchanges will have only one coverage option to choose from. That is not actually a choice,\" Price wrote on the House Republicans' blog on Nov. 1. \"Furthermore, those plans that are offered come with narrower networks meaning fewer choices of physicians and less access to quality care.\" Related: 6.4 Million Sign Up for Obamacare But Glied and Frank argue that Price's replacement ideas would not help people who need it most. \"Price's plan would withdraw almost all the ACA's federal consumer protection regulations, including limits on insurer profits and requirements that plans cover essential health benefits,\" Glied and Frank said. His plan would eliminate the expansion of Medicaid that states have used to cover many low-income working adults, and replace it with flat tax credits based on age, not on income. \"In sum, Price's replacement proposal would make it much more difficult for low-income Americans to afford health insurance,\" they wrote. \"It would divert federal tax dollars to people who can already buy individual coverage without subsidies and substantially reduce protections for those with preexisting conditions.\" Maggie Fox ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story The de Blasio administration declined to comment. Mr. Castorina and Ms. Malliotakis said on Wednesday that they welcomed the judge\u2019s ruling as a small victory, an acknowledgment by the court that there were \u201cissues\u201d with destroying the documents. In their suit, they said that destroying the records would threaten national security and that the data should be preserved and made accessible under New York State\u2019s freedom of information law. Lawyers for the city argued that the state law did not cover the release of such private data. The city said on Dec. 7 that it would stop keeping personal data after new applications were approved starting next year. Justice Minardo denied a separate request to stop the destruction of the new documents being collected, at least until there could be a full hearing. While officials and lawyers wrangled over the program, cardholders and immigrant advocates said they feared that President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s administration could use the data if it moved to deport any of the estimated 11 million unauthorized residents of the country. Photo The ID cards allow registration in public schools, are accepted by the New York Police Department as a form of identification for people reporting crimes and grant free admission to museums. \u201cOur credibility is at stake with the immigrant communities that we work with,\u201d said Manny Castro, executive director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment , which works with day laborers in Queens. He added: \u201cIf something were to happen with this data that led to a family getting detained or deported, then how are immigrants supposed to believe the city when it comes to providing information to the police or public schools? It took decades for the city to build this credibility.\u201d The IDs have also been popular with some of New York\u2019s most vulnerable residents: those living in homeless shelters, victims of domestic violence and transgender people. The cards allow entry to public schools, are accepted by the Police Department as a form of identification for people reporting crimes and grant free admission to museums . According to the city, more than half of cardholders use the IDs as their primary form of identification. Since the program\u2019s inception and somewhat rocky start , the city has issued 988,066 cards. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The application does not ask applicants their immigration status. To obtain a card, an applicant can, for example, use a valid foreign passport or a consular identification, along with a utility bill that verifies a city address. An expired foreign passport is acceptable for up to three years, but the applicant may require two additional forms of proof. In addition, proof of residency in a homeless shelter for 15 days can be a form of identification. Mr. Castorina said he became alarmed in September when New York State\u2019s banking superintendent encouraged all state-licensed banks and credit unions to accept IDNYC. Only 13 banks in New York City accept the ID, and the de Blasio administration had pushed the superintendent to make such a recommendation to expand access to financial services for undocumented immigrants. \u201cIt raised concern that a person with nefarious intent or a criminal enterprise could utilize this ID to finance terror or engage in fraud,\u201d Mr. Castorina said. He and Ms. Malliotakis, the only Republicans from the city in the Assembly, sit on the chamber\u2019s banking committee. Under the law that created the ID program, which was negotiated with the Police Department, records of the documents used to apply were to be kept for two years and made available only through a judicial subpoena . According to city records, the program had released information on only seven cardholders in response to judicial requests through Sept. 30. A total of 92 applications for IDs had been flagged as highly likely to be fraudulent, and the city had denied 7,130 applications over all because of insufficient proof of identification.

Credit Mark Lennihan/Associated Press At the Lower East Side People\u2019s Federal Credit Union in Manhattan, the same types of identification that can be used to apply for the IDNYC program \u2014 a consular card or a foreign passport \u2014 are accepted for opening accounts. That made it easier for the credit union to trust the city\u2019s vetting process, said Alicia Portada, the institution\u2019s marketing director. \u201cIt is not a concern if they keep the records for one year, three years or not at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as they have confirmed eligibility, then that is enough for us.\u201d Nisha Agarwal, the city\u2019s immigrant affairs commissioner, said officials were confident in the strength of the program\u2019s internal vetting process. Advertisement Revising the policy to purge personal information immediately, she said, \u201cshows a commitment to protecting people\u2019s information and moving forward.\u201d Mr. Castorina insisted that the lawsuit was \u201cnot about immigration.\u201d Ms. Malliotakis, a child of Cuban and Greek immigrants, said that the records should be kept for the five years that an IDNYC card was valid and that she opposed purging records that could be useful in cases of fraud or money laundering. She said she was not aware of any such cases. Before filing their suit, Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Castorina filed a freedom of information request in November to obtain the records for all IDNYC cardholders, which the city denied. Lawyers for the city called the suit a \u201clast-minute ploy to nullify a legislative directive and eviscerate\u201d the city\u2019s promise to protect applicants\u2019 privacy. The state\u2019s freedom of information law, the city\u2019s lawyers said, did not grant wide public access to the information of private individuals. On Tuesday, the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, submitted an amicus brief in support of the city, urging that state freedom of information requests \u201cnot become a mechanism for undermining governmental pledges of confidentiality.\u201d Yet nobody knows how strongly the Trump administration might try to pursue the information, said Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. \u201cThat\u2019s the wild card,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to utilize the entire muscle of the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to try to get this information? I think that would be a ridiculous waste of time and a terribly corrosive message to the entire country.\u201d Correction: December 21, 2016 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of a New York State Assembly member.

David Goldfein is introduced as the nominee for U.S. Air Force chief of staff by Defense Secretary Ash Carter at the Pentagon on April  29, 2016. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. \u2014\u00a0The Air Force\u2019s top officer said the service is critically short of personnel and needs to expand by more than 30,000 active-duty service members\u00a0to\u00a0meet its security obligations, including an air war against Islamic State militants. \u201cWe just got too small too fast and we\u2019ve got to grow,\u201d Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, told USA TODAY in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re at a risk level I\u2019m not comfortable with.\u201d Goldfein, who is completing a five-day tour of air bases around the country, \u00a0said the trip reinforced his concerns that the service is stretched thin. \u201cThe shortage of people has fundamentally changed the way we do business,\u201d he said.\u00a0\"To most of the American people they still think they have the Air Force of Desert Storm (1990-91 Gulf War)\u00a0and we\u2019re not even close.\" President-elect Trump, who promised to rebuild the military, will likely face an array of\u00a0requests from the services,\u00a0which have lobbied for more troops and weapons in years past but have had to preside over smaller forces more recently because of budget pressures\u00a0despite a resurgence of new threats, particularly in the Middle East. Goldfein said he will recommend expanding the size of the active duty Air Force from its current size of about 317,000 to 350,000. It would probably take five or six years to reach the higher level. Under current plans, the Air Force had planned to grow to 321,000. The increase in personnel size would cost about an additional $3 billion a year on top of the Air Force's $151 billion budget. The U.S. military\u00a0withdrew from Iraq in 2011 and has\u00a0reduced the size of its force in Afghanistan to less than 10,000. In 2014, however, the Islamic State swept into Iraq and other parts of the Middle East,\u00a0prompting the Obama administration to deploy roughly\u00a05,000 troops in Iraq and begin a bombing campaign over Iraq and Syria. U.S. aircraft have dropped thousands of munitions targeting the Islamic State in both countries. The Air Force is ferrying tons of weapons and ammunition to Iraqi forces battling the Islamic State, and has air-dropped supplies to a rebel force marching on Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital in Syria. It is also responding to other global crises. \u201cIt seems like every two weeks we\u2019re responding to a crisis or event around the globe,\u201d said Gen. Carlton Everhart, commander of the Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base in\u00a0Illinois. Meanwhile, Russia and China are emerging as potential threats that could challenge the U.S. military in ways the Islamic State has not. China is expanding its presence in the South China Sea and Russia has become a major player in Syria's civil war, siding with the regime of President Bashar Assad. China agrees to return U.S. drone seized in South China Sea, Pentagon says The U.S. Air Force has rarely been challenged in the skies during its campaign against the Islamic State.\u00a0That could change if the United States were to face another nation's military capable of challenging\u00a0the U.S. military's\u00a0technological advantages. In this March 29, 2014 photo provided by the U.S. Air Force, an RQ-4 Global Hawk comes in to land at Grand Forks Air Force Base, N.D. \u00a0(Photo: David Dobrydney, AP) Earlier this week, Goldfein spent a night with a crew in an underground nuclear control facility in a remote windswept corner of Nebraska.\u00a0Airmen guard the facility round the clock and a pair of young officers sit at the controls that would launch nuclear-tipped Minuteman III missiles from nearby silos if the president orders\u00a0strikes. At\u00a0Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado, he\u00a0spoke to airmen manning 24/7 operations centers where the service controls satellites that provide GPS and communications coverage around the world. 5343 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 64 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ick0Bh NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

USA TODAY People line up at one of the most popular lottery shops (Dona Manolita) to buy tickets for El Gordo in Madrid, Spain, Dec. 19, 2016. (Photo: Victor Gonzalez, EPA) El Gordo has arrived, and it's a lot more fun than El Ni\u00f1o or El Chapo. El Gordo, Spanish for \"The Fat One,\" is Spain's annual Christmas lottery taking place Thursday. The world's richest sweepstakes, this year's prizes will total a fat $2.4 billion, give or take a hundred million. There is a catch, though. No one walks away with billions\u00a0\u2014 the grand prize is about $4 million before taxes. The good news is there are scores of grand prizes, and almost 15,000 people cash in\u00a0some kind of winning ticket. Many people buy several tickets with the same number, hoping to multiply their good fortune. You don't have to be Spanish to play\u00a0\u2014 tickets were available online for about $40\u00a0\u2014 but the deadline for purchasing tickets everywhere has now passed. Many people buy \"participation\" tickets at a fraction of the cost, worth part of the prize. Spain is obsessed with El Gordo, forming long lines for tickets. Villagers and other groups often buy the same number, casting their lot together. In 2011, residents of the little town of Sodeto all bought in on magical 58268 and walked away\u00a0with winnings totaling more than $100 million. Tourists and journalists who have visited Sodeto since its most merry Christmas say it is little changed. Locals bought tractors, not sports cars. Still, everyone in the village\u00a0of 250 was instantly rich. Well, not everyone. Greek filmmaker Costis Mitsotakis was living in a barn he was renovating and somehow was missed when townspeople were circulating tickets. Mitsotakis shrugs off questions about disappointment, saying he is happy. His now-wealthy neighbors believe him. \"His world is the images and the movies and the documentaries and for him that makes him rich,\" villager Sandra Garcia del Pozo told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. \"And he's got a great story now. .... And I think that will be his lottery, and it will be much better than ours.\" 6748 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ifRfiU NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

(Photo: Robb Cohen, AP) ORLANDO, Fla.\u2014The family of The Voice\u00a0singer Christina\u00a0Grimmie is suing the promotional company and the Orlando venue where she was fatally shot while signing autographs. Grimmie's family filed suit Tuesday against AEG Live and the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra Plaza Foundation, which owns the venue, accusing them of failing to take adequate security measures, leading to her murder in June, according to The Orlando Sentinel . 'Voice' singer Christina Grimmie dies after being shot at Orlando concert Grimmie, 22,\u00a0finished third during season six of NBC's The Voice\u00a0in 2014, and her videos on YouTube have garnered millions of views since then. She was shot to death after giving a concert in Orlando last June, by a man, Kevin Loible, 27, of St. Petersburg, who then killed himself. Police said his motive was mysterious but he may have been a deranged fan. In wake of Orlando shootings, venue safety comes into question A\u00a0spokesman for The Plaza Live venue couldn't be reached for comment. Grimmie was killed just two days before a\u00a0gunman opened fire in a gay nightclub in Orlando, killing 50 people in the deadliest shooting spree in U.S. history. The tragedies helped renew concerns about venue safety for entertainers and audiences alike. In August Grimmie's family released a \u00a0series of\u00a0music videos \u00a0she recorded to accompany her\u00a0Side A\u00a0EP, released in February. The videos were\u00a0part of a series called The Ballad of Jessica Blue, in which Grimmie played Jessica Blue. ",

State Journal 8:31 p.m. EST December 21, 2016 x Share Rachael Denhollander is one of two former gymnasts who have contacted IndyStar about alleged sexual abuse by longtime USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. She filed an August criminal complaint in Michigan. (Robert Scheer/IndyStar) Larry Nassar (Photo: Courtesy photo) GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2014 The Federal Bureau of Investigation found\u00a0 at least 37,000 images and videos of child pornography on hard drives seized during a search of Larry Nassar's property in Holt,\u00a0as well as videos that\u00a0show the former Michigan State University doctor\u00a0sexually assaulting girls under the age of 12, an agent testified Wednesday in federal court in Grand Rapids. The hard drives were found in a garbage can on Nassar's property while law enforcement executed a search warrant, special agent Rod Charles testified during a detention hearing for Nassar. Nassar, 53, is charged with two child pornography counts in federal court. His\u00a0indictment was unsealed\u00a0last week. It\u00a0said that, during a nearly 14-year stretch, Nassar collected \"thousands of images of child pornography\" including those of someone younger than 12. Ex-USA Gymnastics doctor arrested on child porn charges Nassar,\u00a0who\u00a0was fired\u00a0in September,\u00a0served as USA Gymnastics\u2019 team physician\u00a0during four Olympic Games and is one of the figures in a nationwide scandal involving how the\u00a0organization handles allegations of sexual assault. Nassar was in court Wednesday afternoon\u00a0for a series of hearings, which included a formal arraignment and pretrial conference. He wore jeans, a red long-sleeved fleece sweatshirt and glasses. He was led into the courtroom by two federal agents with\u00a0his hands cuffed behind his back. Federal Magistrate Judge Ray Kent ordered that Nassar remain detained without bond, saying he was the \"worst\" kind of danger to the community. Kent characterized\u00a0the evidence as \"very heavy against Dr. Nassar.\" Charles testified that, when Nassar turned in a work laptop to Michigan State University, its hard drive had been wiped clean. In a statement released Monday, MSU Spokesman Jason Cody said, \"The current (federal) charges do not relate to Nassar\u2019s employment at MSU. Also, according to MSU Police, the investigation into the child pornography charges has not revealed any images of victims in the complaints of criminal sexual conduct that the department also is investigating.\" Michigan State fires former USA Gymnastics doctor amid abuse allegations Matt Newburg, Nassar's attorney, said his client knew about criminal investigations as early as August and has cooperated with police. He asked Kent to order Nassar to be detained in\u00a0his Holt home and on a GPS monitor. Trash collection was running late the day of the search warrant, Charles testified,\u00a0and an officer checked the garbage bin by the curb. The officer found several external hard drives, some that had Nassar's name or phone number written on them, Charles testified. The FBI recovered videos that showed Nassar sexually assaulting young girls in a pool, Charles said. Charles testified that the FBI continues to conduct forensic reviews of computers collected from Nassar, some of which appear to have had their hard drives cleared. He added that the child pornography included photographs of young girls exposing themselves as well as videos of young girls being raped. In asking for Nassar to remain detained, Sean Lewis, assistant U.S. attorney, said Nassar was \"a hands-on offender in any context he can put himself into.\" He\u00a0emphasized\u00a0to Kent that some of the sexual assault allegations date back decades. He emphasized the\u00a0ages of the alleged victims, which include\u00a0one as young as 6. USA Gymnastics asks former federal prosecutor to review sex assault policies \"If true, that's appalling,\" Kent said. \"And I'm not going to set Dr. Nassar loose in our community until this (case) is resolved.\" Nassar\u00a0was charged last month in Ingham County\u00a0with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving a person younger than 13. He had been free on $1 million bond. Nassar faces five to 40 years in prison, and up to lifetime supervision upon release, if convicted on the federal charges. He faces up to life in prison if convicted on the Ingham County\u00a0charges. State and local law enforcement officials have said\u00a0about 50 women have come forward since this summer\u00a0with allegations that Nassar sexually assaulted them, some saying it occurred during medical procedures. The wave of allegations came after The Indianapolis Star detailed sexual assault allegations\u00a0against Nassar by two women. During the hearing Wednesday, Charles, the FBI agent, estimated the number of women who have come forward with allegations could now be closer to 60. Elite gymnasts, Olympians demand USA Gymnastics make sexual assault claims priority Newburg said Children's Protective Services\u00a0investigated Nassar\u00a0recently and that his children made no claims of\u00a0sexual misconduct. The university and its police department investigated Nassar in 2014 after a then recent graduate alleged that Nassar sexually assaulted her during a visit to his campus office for a treatment for hip pain. The university's Title IX investigator cleared Nassar and the Ingham County Prosecuting Attorney's Office declined to issue charges. Officials have said both cases have been reopened. Charles testified that a teen girl has alleged that Nassar sexually assaulted her during medical appointments between the fall of 2015 and earlier this year.

(Photo: Michael Reynolds, European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 On the theory that it's never too early to launch the next campaign, the new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll has identified an overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. It's someone entirely new. Literally. Not an identifiable person. Just \"someone entirely new.\" When that description was included on a list of possible contenders, 66% of Democrats and independents said they would be \"excited\" to see such a person jump in the race; just 9% thought he or she shouldn't run. That's an overwhelming yes-please-run score of 57 percentage points for, you know, whomever. Compare that to the downbeat sentiment toward the party's 2016 nominee, former secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Even though she won the popular vote\u00a0\u2014 to be sure, Republican Donald Trump on Monday carried the count that mattered, in the Electoral College \u00a0\u2014 just 23% were excited about the prospect of her running again; 62% said they would prefer she not. That's a please-don't-run score of 39 points. Read more: ",

At least 12 people were killed and almost 50 were wounded. Clemens Bilan/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Anthony Faiola , Stephanie Kirchner and Souad Mekhennet December 21 at 3:46 PM Follow @Anthony_Faiola Follow stephi_says Follow @smekhennet BERLIN \u2014 The prime suspect sought in the deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market \u2014 a 24-year-old Tunisian migrant \u2014 was the subject of a terrorism probe in Germany earlier this year and was not deported even though his asylum bid was rejected, a senior German official said Wednesday. The suspect \u2014 who went by numerous aliases but was identified by German authorities as Anis Amri \u2014 became the subject of a national manhunt after investigators discovered a wallet with his identity documents in the truck used in Monday\u2019s attack that left 12 dead, two law enforcement officials told The Washington Post.\u00a0 Meanwhile, a clearer portrait took shape of the suspect, including accusations that he had contact with a prominent Islamic State recruiter in Germany. German authorities issued a 100,000 euro ($105,000) reward for information leading to his capture, warning citizens not to approach the 5-foot-8, 165-pound Amri, whom they described as \u201cviolent and armed.\u201d His record, however, further deepened the political fallout from Monday\u2019s bloodshed \u2014 pointing to flaws in the German deportation system and putting a harsh light on Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s humanitarian bid to open the nation\u2019s doors to nearly 1\u00a0million asylum seekers last year. (Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Although the vast majority of those who flooded into Europe were on the move to escape war and unrest, dozens of terrorism suspects have slipped into Germany and neighboring nations posing as migrants. Amri, officials said, was not part of the surge of migrants who entered Europe via the onetime main route from Turkey and Greece \u2014 a path that has been now largely cut off. Rather, he came to Germany last year via Italy, where he apparently had entered as early as 2012. He applied for German asylum but was rejected in June and later faced deportation. Amri was the subject of a terrorism probe on suspicion of \u201cpreparing a serious act of violent subversion,\u201d and he had known links to Islamist extremists, authorities said. Why a failed asylum seeker with such links and no passport was walking German streets is \u201cthe question 82 million Germans probably want an answer to,\u201d said Rainer Wendt, Chairman of the German Police Union. He added: \u201cHow many more ticking time bombs are roaming around here? . . . We saw how much damage one person can do with a truck.\u201d [ Gallery: Festive corner of Berlin now a sad memorial ] The dragnet for the suspect appeared to initially focus on the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as Berlin, both places where the Tunisian suspect once lived. Police units had been due to stage raids Wednesday, officials said, but they remained mysteriously on hold. 45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized View Graphic 45 years of terrorist attacks in Europe, visualized The interior minister in North Rhine-Westphalia, Ralf J\u00e4ger, said the Tunisian man had bounced around Germany since arriving in July 2015, living in the southern city of Freiburg and later in Berlin.\u00a0 Although authorities have sought to accelerate the deportation of rejected asylum seekers this year, there is still a backlog in Germany of tens of thousands, many of whom are able to resist because their countries of origin refuse to take them back. Amri, J\u00e4ger said, was one of them.\u00a0 Amri had not been deported because \u2014 like many asylum seekers in Germany \u2014 he did not have a passport. The Tunisian government, J\u00e4ger explained, initially denied that he was a national and delayed issuing his passport. Pending his deportation, Amri had received a \u201ctoleration\u201d status from the government.\u00a0 Amri\u2019s new Tunisian passport, J\u00e4ger\u00a0said, finally arrived Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment further on that circumstance,\u201d said a visibly angered J\u00e4ger. [ Berlin attack: How the events unfolded ] Importantly, authorities knew that Amri had \u201cinteracted\u201d with Abu Walaa, a 32-year-old of Iraqi descent arrested in November on charges of recruiting and sending fighters from Germany to the Islamic State. Key evidence in Walaa\u2019s case came from an Islamic State defector who had returned to Germany and accused Walaa of helping to recruit him and arrange his travel to Syria. \u201cAnis Amri was engaging with extremist salafist circles in Germany,\u201d a German security official said. According to Karen M\u00fcller, spokeswoman for the Berlin prosecutor, Amri had also been under police surveillance for several months until September of this year, because he was suspected of planning a burglary in Berlin to finance the purchase of \u00a0weapons. The suspicion wasn\u2019t confirmed. He was, she said, found only to be a small-time drug dealer. The leaking of the suspect\u2019s name and photograph in the press, authorities said, may have upset attempts to find him. Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, would tell reporters in Berlin only that Germany had registered \u201ca suspect\u201d as wanted on European databases. He refused to give further details. The two German law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive case, said investigators discovered the man\u2019s documents in the cabin of the truck that barreled into the market. It remained unclear whether authorities believe the Tunisian man drove the truck, but police nevertheless made tracking him a priority. Revelation of the asylum seeker\u2019s background sparked outrage among conservative politicians and seemed set to damage Merkel, who is running for reelection next year. \u201cThere is a connection between the refugee crisis and the heightened terror threat in Germany,\u201d said Stefan Mayer, parliamentary spokesman on domestic affairs for the Christian Social Union party. \u201cThis can also be seen in the case of this Tunisian.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. Speaking outside his Mar-a- Lago resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin. \u201cYou know my plans,\u201d Trump said. He went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him. \u201cAll along, I\u2019ve been proven to be right. One hundred percent correct,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is disgraceful.\u201d [What\u2019s known so far about the Berlin investigation ] Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper said Amri had several aliases and was apparently born in the southern Tunisian desert town of Tataouine in 1992. Witnesses described one man fleeing the scene after the truck \u2014 packed with a cargo of steel \u2014 roared into revelers at a traditional Christmas market. One suspect, a Pakistani asylum seeker, was arrested Monday night, but authorities later released him because of a lack of evidence. The new information emerged as German investigators raced for clues in the hunt for Amri and other possible suspects in the assault. They pored over forensic evidence and GPS data as they sought to retrace the steps of the runaway attacker. They were re-questioning witnesses and analyzing DNA traces found in the truck, as well as on the body of a dead Polish man in the passenger seat.\u00a0 The Pole worked for a trucking company and was delivering a payload of steel to Berlin. Investigators are going on the assumption that he was taken hostage by the assailant \u2014 and may even have died a hero. J\u00f6rg Radek, deputy chairman of the German Trade Union of the Police, said evidence suggested that \u201ca fight took place in the driver\u2019s cabin.\u201d As it barreled toward the crowded market, the truck was not driving straight, but \u201cin a zigzag line,\u201d he noted. [ After Berlin, security tightens at Christmas markets ]\u00a0 The Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for inspiring the unknown attacker \u2014 a claim as yet unproven and possibly just opportunistic. But it prompted some politicians to quickly point the finger at Merkel\u2019s refu\u00adgee policy, even as others pushed back, calling the accusations a politicizing of tragedy that had no place in progressive Germany.\u00a0 There were also growing calls for the deployment of more police on the streets with military-style weapons \u2014 an unusual move in pacifist Germany. At the normally quaint and picturesque Christmas markets in at least three German cities \u2014 Mainz, Magdeburg and Dresden \u2014 concrete barriers were quickly erected to add security. In Magdeburg, police officers armed with automatic weapons were guarding the entrance. Yet others argued that living in a free society was perhaps more important and that Germans were willing to accept a certain measure of risk to preserve that openness.\u00a0 \u201cIf we want to maintain the freedom of our society, we simply have to live with the risk contained in this decision,\u201d Die Tageszeitung said in a Wednesday editorial. Dan Eggen in Washington contributed to this report. Read more\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

Solis It was not immediately clear whether McClinton is represented by an attorney.\u00a0 An investigation continues, but a state official said authorities don\u2019t believe politics was the reason for the fire. \u201cWe do not believe it was politically motivated. There may have been some efforts to make it appear politically motivated,\u201d Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, who is also the state fire marshal, told The Associated Press. Greenville is a Mississippi River port city of about 32,100 people, and about 78 percent of its residents are African-American. While it\u2019s not unusual for people of different racial backgrounds to work and eat lunch together, local residents say the congregations at most churches remain clearly identifiable by race. Hopewell was founded in 1905 in the heart of an African-American neighborhood, and the congregation now has about 200 members. While some walls of the beige brick church survived the fire, the empty windows are boarded up and church leaders have said the structure will likely be razed. Rebuilding could take months.

The Hopewell bishop, Clarence Green, said last month the generosity of First Baptist demonstrates that \u201cunlimited love\u201d transcends social barriers. James Nichols, senior pastor at First Baptist, said the Hopewell members are welcome to stay as long as they need a home. Greenville is in Washington County, a traditional Democratic stronghold in a solidly Republican state. In the Nov. 8 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump easily carried Mississippi, but Democrat Hillary Clinton received more than twice the vote of Trump in Washington County - 11,380 for Clinton to 5,244 for Trump.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Expand / Contract (Worldwide Auctioneers) The 1962 Aston Martin DB4 has been rotting away on a Massachusetts property since it was brought there from California by its second owner in the 1970s, according to Worldwide Auctioneers . Trees grew around it as it settled into the soil and its engine bay filled up with leaves and weeds over the years. Expand / Contract (Worldwide auctioneers) One of just 1,113 DB4s produced, the four-seat coupe is largely original, save for the new engine and paint job it appears to have picked up prior to its trip east. Its 3.7-liter inline six was rated at 240 hp when new, and the car features a 4-speed transmission with Laycock Overdrive, disc brakes and \u201cknock-off\u201d wire wheels. Worldwide Auctioneers will be pushing the car across the block at its Scottsdale, Ariz., event on January 18 , and estimates that it will sell for somewhere in the $375,000 - $475,000 range. If that sounds like a lot for a derelict, the Hagerty Price Guide says that it could be worth at $2.5 million or more when fully restored. Or if you don't want to go to the trouble, you could buy a brand new one from Aston Martin, which is producing 25 continuation cars next year for about $1.9 million each. ---------- Return of the Shelby Daytona Coupe: Trending in Auto ",

By Philip Rucker and Karen Tumulty December 21 at 6:27 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @ktumulty Clockwise from top left: Donald Trump, Gen. James Mattis, Gen. George S. Patton, actor George C. Scott as Patton (Washington Post illustration using images from Getty, Reuters and iStock) Donald Trump believes that those who aspire to the most visible spots in his administration should not just be able to do the job, but also look the part. Given Trump\u2019s own background as a master brander and showman who ran beauty pageants as a sideline, it was probably inevitable that he would be looking beyond their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for a certain aesthetic in his supporting players. \u201cPresentation is very important because you\u2019re representing America not only on the national stage but also the international stage, depending on the position,\u201d said Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller. To lead the Pentagon, Trump chose a rugged combat general, whom he compares to a historic one. At the United Nations, his ambassador will be a poised and elegant Indian American with a compelling immigrant backstory. As secretary of state, Trump tapped a neophyte to international diplomacy, but one whose silvery hair and boardroom bearing project authority. The parade of potential job-seekers passing a bank of media cameras to board the elevators at Trump Tower has the feel of a casting call. It is no coincidence that a disproportionate share of the names most mentioned for jobs at the upper echelon of the Trump administration are familiar faces to obsessive viewers of cable news \u2014 of whom the president-elect is one. \u201cHe likes people who present themselves very well, and he\u2019s very impressed when somebody has a background of being good on television because he thinks it\u2019s a very important medium for public policy,\u201d said Chris Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, he\u2019s a showbiz guy. He was at the pinnacle of showbiz, and he thinks about showbiz. He sees this as a business that relates to the public.\u201d \u201cThe look might not necessarily be somebody who should be on the cover of GQ magazine or Vanity Fair,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the look and the demeanor and the swagger.\u201d As Trump formally announced his vice presidential pick in July, he said that Mike Pence\u2019s economic record as Indiana governor was \u201cthe primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he\u2019s got an incredible family, incredible wife and family.\u201d And in picking retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as his nominee for defense, Trump lauded him as \u201cthe closest thing to General George Patton that we have.\u201d Mattis has a passing physical resemblance to the legendary World War II commander, as well as to the late actor George C. Scott, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Patton in the 1970 biopic. Trump also seems particularly enamored with a nickname that Mattis is said to privately dislike. \u201cYou know he\u2019s known as \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis, right? \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 for a reason,\u201d Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) The president-elect, however, does not mention Mattis\u2019 other sobriquet, which is \u201cWarrior Monk.\u201d Or his call sign: \u201cChaos.\u201d On the other hand, in Trump\u2019s book, not having the right kind of appearance is tantamount to a disqualifier. During the presidential campaign, he stirred a controversy when he pronounced that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lacked \u201ca presidential look, and you need a presidential look.\u201d Battling through the GOP primary, Trump frequently made barbed comments about his opponents\u2019 appearances. Those kind of skin-deep standards helped make Trump a success as a reality-television star and international brand, but his critics say they are worrisome in the Oval Office. His personnel choices show signs of being \u201ccast for the TV show of his administration,\u201d said Bob Killian, founder of a branding agency based in Chicago. \u201cThey are all perfectly coifed people who look like they belong on a set.\u201d But Trump spokesman Miller insisted that some qualifications do not lend themselves to lines on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \u201cPeople who are being selected for these key positions need to be able to hold their own, need to be doers and not wallflowers, and need to convey a clear sense of purpose and commitment.\u201d (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) All of which has led him to some unconventional picks. If confirmed by the Senate, ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson will become the first secretary of state in modern history to come to the job with no experience in government. Then again, Trump himself has none. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) has little obvious foreign policy experience to qualify her for United Nations ambassador, but she is a rising political star who brings diversity to Trump\u2019s largely white and male picks for top jobs. Given how she and the president-elect had clashed during the 2016 campaign, Haley\u2019s selection also suggests that Trump is willing to bring adversaries into the fold when they suit his needs. In hiring, Trump has long trusted his own impressions, at times more than a candidate\u2019s expertise or experience. In 1981, he saw a security guard at the U.S. Open tennis championships masterfully eject some hecklers. Trump asked Barbara Res, one of his top construction executives, to hire the man. \u201cBut you\u2019ve never even met him!\u201d she protested. Trump said he liked how the man looked when he handled the situation. That security guard, Matthew Calamari, has worked for Trump for 35 years and is now chief operating officer of Trump Properties. His son, Matthew Calamari Jr., started with Trump five years ago as a security guard and is now the Trump Organization\u2019s director of surveillance. Trump\u2019s closest aides have come to accept that he is likely to rule out candidates if they are not attractive or not do not match his image of the type of person who should hold a certain job. \u201cThat\u2019s the language he speaks. He\u2019s very aesthetic,\u201d said one person familiar with the transition team\u2019s internal deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cYou can come with somebody who is very much qualified for the job, but if they don\u2019t look the part, they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d John R. Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, at the elevator at Trump Tower on Dec. 2 (Justin Lane/Bloomberg News) Several of Trump\u2019s associates said they thought that John R. Bolton\u2019s brush-like mustache was one of the factors that handicapped the bombastic former United Nations ambassador in the sweepstakes for secretary of state. \u201cDonald was not going to like that mustache,\u201d said one associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d Trump was drawn to Tillerson and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney for secretary of state because of their presence and the way they command a room when they walk in. Rex Tillerson (left) and Mitt Romney with Donald Trump (Washington Post illustration using images from Getty, Reuters and iStock) The president-elect considered Romney despite the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s scathing criticism of him during the presidential campaign. Several Trump associates say he was drawn to Romney, and later to Tillerson, by their \u201ccentral casting\u201d quality, a phrase the president-elect uses frequently in his private deliberations. People close to Trump said he has been eager to appoint a telegenic woman as press secretary or in some other public-facing role in his White House \u2014 both because he thinks it would attract viewers and would help inoculate him from the charges of sexism that trailed his presidential campaign. Clockwise from top left: Kellyanne Conway, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Laura Ingraham and Monica Crowley (Washington Post illustration using images from Getty, Reuters and iStock) His first choice was his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who has resisted the offer. Others under consideration included Laura Ingraham, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Monica Crowley, all of whom are conservative pundits familiar to the viewers of Fox News Channel. The current favorite for press secretary is Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer, who has impressed Trump with his tough and unyielding defenses of the incoming administration in hostile interviews on cable news networks. Crowley, meanwhile, has been picked to become communications chief for Trump\u2019s National Security Council, where the deputy director will be K.T. McFarland, another longtime denizen of the Fox green room. Trump is also said to be considering CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow for head of his Council of Economic Advisers. That is normally an all-but-invisible spot given to a prestigious economist, but Kudlow has neither an undergraduate nor graduate degree in the subject. Kudlow is, however, known for his ardent advocacy of tax cuts, which are also a top priority for the incoming president. In Trump\u2019s administration, the job description may be to formulate his policies \u2014 and also help sell them on TV.

    "text": "By Abby Phillip and Abigail Hauslohner December 21 at 3:03 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @ahauslohner President-elect Donald Trump called Monday's attacks in Europe \"terrible\" as he spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday. One reporter asked Trump if the assassination of Russia's ambassador to Turkey caused him to \"rethink\" his policy on immigration and a ban on Muslims. \"You've known my plans all along, and I've been proven to be right,\" Trump said. (Reuters) President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to stand by his plans to establish a registry for Muslims and temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from the United States. Speaking outside his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump did not walk back the proposals after he was asked by a reporter whether he was rethinking or reevaluating them in the wake of a fresh terrorist attack in Berlin. \u201cYou know my plans,\u201d Trump said. He went on to add that the attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which was claimed by the Islamic State, had vindicated him. German authorities are seeking a 24-year-old Tunisian migrant, who they say has ties to Islamist extremists, in connection with the attack, which killed 12 people and injured dozens. \u201cAll along, I\u2019ve been proven to be right. One-hundred-percent correct,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is disgraceful.\u201d [ Tunisian suspect in Berlin Christmas market attack faced past German terror probe, official says ] Trump has long called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and has expressed openness to a registry of Muslims already in the country. A year ago, in a statement, Trump said he wanted a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d The proposal was sharply criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike.\u00a0And later, Trump's senior aides and surrogates sought to soften the proposal, suggesting that Trump would support a ban on immigration\u00a0only from countries that had been \"compromised by terrorism.\" But given an opportunity on Wednesday to clarify his remarks, Trump suggested that his plans stood as he had articulated them early in his campaign. The statement proposing a \u201ccomplete\u201d shutdown of Muslim immigration remains on Trump's website . And Trump has not clarified how exactly he would address the issue as president. The issue is the source of anxiety for Muslims and advocates across the country. \u201cI think that at this point, we don\u2019t quite know what he means when he says Muslim ban,\u201d said Faiza Patel, who co-directs the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU\u2019s Law school. \u201cA lot of people have interpreted that as he intends to revive the NSEERS system, which was made in-operational a few years ago,\u201d she added, referring to the registry system developed by current Trump adviser Kris Kobach, which civil rights groups and security experts said unfairly targeted Muslims and provided few security benefits. Jaime \u201cMujahid\u201d Fletcher, who founded IslamInSpanish, a center for Muslim Latinos in Houston, said the issue of a registry came up last week when he and other area Muslim leaders met with FBI agents in Houston. \u201cWe met with the head of the FBI in their office,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cIt was all about this new administration coming in: what can we expect from them? Is this going to be a change in the way they approach our community?\u201d He said the meeting was reassuring. Muslim leaders said they felt that a registry would take America backward and the FBI seemed to agree. \u201cThey didn\u2019t foresee us going back to the past. They were reassuring. This is the way they see it,\u201d Fletcher said. It was good to hear, but area Muslims are still concerned, he said. \u201cObviously the community feels there are orders and commands from higher up and if those are sent down to a local level, will they act? And how much of what they think now could change in the future?\u201d In response to other questions from reporters outside Mar-a-Lago, Trump said that he had last spoken to President Obama two days ago. President-elect Donald Trump called the attack in Berlin on a Christmas market an attack against \"humanity.\" A Tunisian man who is still at large is suspected of carrying out the attack, which killed 12 and injured dozens more. (Reuters) He was also asked about his characterization of the Berlin attack as an attack on Christians. \u201cISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad,\u201d Trump had said in a statement issued after the attack on Monday. On Wednesday, Trump appeared unfamiliar with the statement issued in his name. \u201cWho said that?\u201d Trump countered, challenging the reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on humanity. That\u2019s what it is. An attack on humanity, and it\u2019s got to be stopped.\u201d politics ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Navarro\u2019s appointment reinforces a basic division among Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers. The people he has chosen to oversee trade policy, Mr. Navarro and Wilbur Ross , another billionaire investor, both favor increased trade restrictions. But Mr. Trump\u2019s broader circle of advisers is dominated by proponents of free trade, including Mr. Icahn; Gary D. Cohn , the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council; Rex W. Tillerson , the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who was tapped for secretary of state; and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for ambassador to China . Mr. Trump is also considering the appointment of Larry Kudlow, a strong proponent of trade, to lead his Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Trump has also promised to edit the federal rule book, removing what he has described as overly burdensome restrictions. He said last month that the government would eliminate two regulations for each new rule it put on the books. For Mr. Icahn, who will not draw a salary, the new role formalizes his relationship with Mr. Trump, whom he advised on economic issues throughout the campaign. Mr. Icahn, 80, has no experience in government; like a growing number of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees, he was prized for his success as a businessman. Mr. Icahn, a brash New York billionaire who vocally supported Mr. Trump during the campaign, made his fortune as a \u201ccorporate raider,\u201d buying stakes in corporations and demanding changes to reward shareholders. \u201cCarl was with me from the beginning, and with his being one of the world\u2019s great businessmen, that was something I truly appreciated,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cHis help on the strangling regulations that our country is faced with will be invaluable.\u201d ",

Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, is sworn in at a House panel hearing in February. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) Melody Petersen Contact Reporter A U.S. Senate committee detailed in an investigative report Wednesday how drug companies were exploiting the market by acquiring decades-old crucial medicines and suddenly raising their prices astronomically. \u201cWe must work to stop the bad actors who are driving up the prices of drugs that they did nothing to develop at the expense of patients just because, as one executive essentially said, \u2018because I can,\u2019 \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins , a Maine Republican, who chairs the Senate Aging Committee. Over the last year, the committee investigated four drug companies, which it said had all used a similar business model that included egregious price hikes to maximize profits. Here are some of the key findings in the committee\u2019s 131-page report on those companies, which included Turing Pharmaceuticals, Retrophin Inc., Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and Rodelis Therapeutics. The companies raised prices \u2013 not to fund research to discover new drugs \u2013 but to boost profits for executives and investors. In essence, they operated more like hedge funds than traditional pharmaceutical companies. Turing, headed by executive Martin Shkreli, bought Daraprim, a 62-year-old medicine for a deadly parasitic disease, on Aug. 7, 2015, and raised the price overnight from $13.50 to $750 a pill. When asked by investors about the expected revenues from the drug, Shkreli wrote, \u201cI think it will be huge\u2026. So 5,000 paying bottles at the new price is $375,000,000 \u2013 almost all of it is profit, and I think we will get 3 years of that or more. Should be a very handsome investment for all of us.\u201d The companies bought critical life-saving drugs made by one manufacturer and then worked to keep competitors out. The committee found that Turing tried to keep other companies from making generic versions of Daraprim by restricting its distribution. Patients could not get the drug at the corner drug store. Instead, it was delivered by a specialty pharmacy. Turing executives explained that this kept competitors from acquiring enough of the medicine to perform studies that are required to prove they can make the same drug. The company\u2019s programs to help patients afford the drugs weren\u2019t charities, but a way to increase profits on their monopolies. The committee said that Valeant offered a program that covered the cost of co-pays for privately-insured patients because executives knew it would reduce patients\u2019 \u201cincentive to complain to the press about Valeant\u2019s outrageous price increases.\u201d By increasing prices rapidly, but covering patients\u2019 co-pays, the companies could still make big profits, the committee said. They used the example of a drug priced at $100,000 that cost $10,000 to manufacture and distribute, leaving a potential profit of $90,000. If the company covered the patient\u2019s $20,000 co-pay, the insurance company still paid $80,000 for the drug, resulting in a $70,000 profit for the company. The patient assistance programs were a key method that Valeant used in raising the price of Cuprimine, used since 1956, and Syprine, developed in 1969, the committee said. Both drugs are used to treat Wilson disease, a rare condition in which the body cannot process copper. Valeant raised the prices of Cuprimine and Syprine from about $500 to about $24,000 for a 30-day supply, the report said. \u201cThe committee believes that these programs were driven not by altruism, but by Valeant\u2019s desire to extract monopoly profits and then conceal that fact from the public,\u201d the report said. Valeant issued a statement saying it has established a \u201cpatient access pricing committee\u201d and has \u201cimproved transparency\u201d under a new executive team. The companies raised prices on life-saving drugs that patients were desperate to get. Committee members asked Michael Pearson, the former chief executive of Valeant, about this at an April hearing. \u201cIn your thinking about this free market system you are describing, is it a factor \u2026 [that] \u2026 the absence of Syprine could lead to liver failure or a liver transplant or even death? Is that a factor?\u201d asked Sen. Tim Kaine , a Virginia Democrat. \u201cIt is,\u201d Pearson responded. The price increases are threatening the economic stability of American households and also the health of patients who can\u2019t afford the drugs they need. Shannon Weston told the committee how she was devastated in May 2015 when her 2-month-old daughter was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, which can lead to blindness and death, and she learned the price of Daraprim. \u201cI was hopeless and depressed at the thought of what would happen to my perfect little girl if I was not able to help her,\u201d Weston said. \u201cI looked into any way I could think of to come up with the almost $360,000 necessary to treat my daughter for a year.\u201d The strategy was not limited to four companies. The senators said they had evidence that other companies had used the same strategy to aggressively raise prices. They called for policy changes to stop the practices, including improving transparency of prices, preventing the misuse of patient assistance programs and co-pay coupons, and allowing temporary imports of certain medicines to lower prices.

USA TODAY Donald Trump addresses the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, D.C., in March. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 As Inauguration Day approaches, Donald Trump has made little progress in uniting a divided nation or reassuring the voters who didn't support him in November, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds. Instead, a majority of Americans, including one in five Trump voters,\u00a0say the president-elect hasn't done enough to prevent conflicts between his business interests and the nation's interests. And by nearly 2-1, those surveyed say the incoming administration should investigate whether Russia tried to meddle in the American election, a conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that Trump initially dismissed. \"Obviously, he's going to be the president, and we have to give him a chance,\" Kathleen Hoynes, 56, of Upper Gwynedd, Pa., said in a follow-up phone interview after being polled. She didn't support Trump during the campaign, first backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries and then voting for Hillary Clinton on Election Day. \"I'm willing to do that, but he's going to have to prove to a lot of us that he can do the job.\" Nearly four in 10 \u2014 38% \u2014 say they feel \"alarmed\" by the prospect of Trump moving into the Oval Office next month. An equal 38% feel \"hopeful\" and another 16% are \"excited.\" At least almost no one is \"bored\": Only 4%. The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Dec. 14-18, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Read more: Paleologos on the poll: Evaluating Obama's legacy, Trump's transition Trump has seen his favorable-unfavorable ratings improve since the election, from a dismal 31%-61% in the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll in late October to 41%-46% now. That said, he still significantly trails previous presidents-elect in the modern era. During a post-election honeymoon, they have been viewed favorably even by some of those who supported their opponents. But Trump's standing continues to lag even the 46.1% proportion of the vote he carried. In the new survey, 5% of those who supported him have an unfavorable opinion\u00a0and 11% are undecided. Americans split on how he's handled the transition to date: 41% approve, 40% disapprove. Trump does have fervent supporters who argue, accurately, that the real-estate mogul and reality-TV star consistently was underestimated by the pundits and the political establishment. \"It was annoying when people had to hide the fact that they did vote for Trump,\" says David Ockrim, 30, who helps operate\u00a0a small food-truck firm in New York City called Yankee Doodle Dandy. \"While he may not be the most polished or political-like, I think he's a breath of fresh air America needed.\" President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrive to speak at a 'Thank You Tour 2016' rally in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 16, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images) Among Trump supporters, four in 10 predict history ultimately will judge Trump to be a \"great\" president. Another third say he'll end up being a \"good\" one. However, almost half of Democrats say Trump will send up being seen as a\u00a0\"failed\" president. \"I feel dread,\" says Megan Glidewell, 37, a college counselor from Waconia, Minn., who voted for Clinton. She chokes up when she remembers how excited her mother, who died of cancer in September, had been by the idea of a woman being elected president. Since Trump won, Glidewell has adopted \"an ostrich\u00a0approach,\" deliberately paying\u00a0less attention to the news because she finds it upsetting. \"The politics aside, I can't get past the ego; I can't get past the things he said about women; I can't get past just the kind of campaign he ran that created so much division,\" she says of Trump. \"I imagine on top of all that, Trump sitting and talking to other world leaders and being in delicate diplomatic situations. I don't think he has the capacity of behaving. For better or worse, we're all going to find out.\" Americans are clear on what they want Trump to address first: jobs. Close to half, 46%, say creating and preserving jobs should be his first priority. That's triple the second-ranking issue, fighting terrorism and the self-proclaimed Islamic State. At third is changing the way Washington works by \"draining the swamp.\" Read more: Fact-checking 2016: Trump dominates annual review of political falsehoods Low on the list are the crusades that fueled the loudest chants at Trump's campaign rallies. \"Build the wall\"? Only 7% say building a wall along the Southern border and deporting illegal immigrants should be his top concern. \"Lock her up\"? A minuscule 1% say investigating Hillary Clinton should be his No. 1 issue. Trump's supporters are willing to cut him some slack on his campaign promises, which could give him the political space to strike compromises with Congress and others. Half of those who voted for Trump say he should do what needs to be done even if it means reversing\u00a0positions he had advocated. Thirty-nine percent say he should closely follow the policies and promises he made during the campaign. \"I would love for him to get out and set his generals loose and take care of ISIS,\" says Stephen Spence, 69, a retiree from Mesa, Ariz., who voted for Trump. \"But our people are starving here, so I think ... first, jobs within the United States and second, ISIS, and third, probably, the budget deficit. That's my top three.\" There are some other issues pressing on Trump's agenda. \u2022 By 53%-35%, a majority of Americans say he needs to do more to address conflicts between his business interests and the country's interest. That includes 19% of Trump voters. \"He can't have his children take over for him,\" Hoynes protests. \"He can't run the country like he runs a business.\" \u2022\u00a0By 62%-33%, those surveyed say the Trump administration and Congress should investigate whether Russia tried to meddle in the presidential election. Trump voters by 48%-47% support an investigation. \"I don't really understand why Russia would have such a vested interest in nudging the election in that particular direction,\" Glidewell says. \"That's the part that concerns me the most.\" Posted!

(Photo: Richard Lee (top) and JC Reindl, Detroit Free Press) DETROIT \u2014The world's first combination International House of Pancakes and Applebee's restaurant will happen next year downtown. The 300-seat gastronomic experiment will be located inside the Millender Center, across from the Renaissance Center, and be oriented to serving guests in nearby hotels as well as downtown visitors, office workers and residents. The co-branded restaurant's menu is still being developed, sources said Wednesday. And it's not known yet\u00a0whether guests could order IHOP pancakes and omelets throughout the day\u00a0alongside plates of Applebee's boneless wings and Fiesta Lime Chicken. Glendale, Calif.,-based\u00a0DineEquity ( DIN ), formed in 2008 after IHOP Corp. completed its acquisition of Applebee's restaurants in late 2007, closed up 12 cents Wednesday to $78.63, $3.58 above its 52-week low. The\u00a0company is excited to have its two brands under the same roof for the first time,\u00a0DineEquity CEO Julia Stewart said in a statement. Breakfast is an increasingly tasty strategy for restaurant industry The 12,000-square-foot Detroit restaurant would replace the former Sweet Lorraine's cafe and be a franchise of TEAM Schostak Family Restaurants. It is expected to open in late 2017 and employ more than 100 people. The restaurant will feature a coffee bar and Detroit-centric interior design, Executive Chairman Mark Schostak said. \"This is the first IHOP/Applebee's combo that\u2019s ever been built anywhere,\" Schostak said. The Schostak company \"is proud to expand our portfolio by uniquely combining two nationally recognized and family-oriented brands.\" IHOP's short stack of pancakes \u00a0(Photo: IHOP) This IHOP will be the second in Detroit and not affect operations at the existing IHOP restaurant east of downtown. The IHOP/Applebee's co-brand concept, if expanded, might help DineEquity regain growth in the ever-competitive casual dining restaurant business. Applebee's locations nationwide have seen a modest decline in year-over-year sales figures in recent quarters\u00a0while the IHOP brand has seen slower growth amid pressure from the popular All Day Breakfast initiative at McDonalds. In 2015, the company had franchised more than 2,000 Applebee's restaurants worldwide and more than 1,500 IHOPs. \"We've been serving breakfast all day for 58 years,\" Stewart said earlier this year at the Baird Global Consumer, Technology and Services Conference. \"Breakfast was one of the few categories in the restaurant industry that was really growing. So our little secret became everybody else's secret.\" The Schostak firm will lease the new restaurant space from Riverfront Holdings, a subsidiary of General Motors. Schostak also operates Olga's Kitchen restaurants, several Del Tacos, MOD Pizza and 66 other Applebee's, including an\u00a0Applebee's on 8 Mile that opened last year in Detroit's Gateway Marketplace shopping center. \u201cThis offers more selections for people as they can find breakfast, lunch and dinner at a single location when they visit, work or stay in Detroit\u2019s most iconic building,\u201d Claudia Killeen, manager of Renaissance Center development, said in a statement.

Lisa Marie Naegle, 36, who worked as a nurse and was a contestant on the reality TV show \"Bridalplasty\" in 2010, where she vied for a chance to win a plastic surgery makeover before her wedding to Derek Harryman. Man Held in Presumed Killing of Ex-Reality Show Contestant Officials said Naegle was killed early Sunday morning after leaving the party with one of her nursing students, Jackie Jerome Rogers, 34. He was arrested on suspicion of murder and is being held in lieu of a $2 million bond. Harryman, who wed Naegle one year after her \"Bridalplasty\" appearance, said he last heard from his wife via text message after the party around 2:30 a.m. Sunday to say she was getting food and on her way home. \"I felt helpless. Lost. Miserable. Sad. Angry. I just wanted answers,\" he told ABC News. Naegle's family members reported her missing earlier this week and started their own investigation into her disappearance. The family secured surveillance video from the night of the party that showed Naegle getting into an SUV and leaving with Rogers. The family said that when Rogers was confronted, he denied leaving the party with her. \"I feel like this man had something to hide,\" Naegle's sister, Danielle Naegle-Kaimona, told ABC News. \"Why didn't he tell us and be forthcoming, knowing that every one of us just wants her home? That's what I don't understand.\" Police said they were led to Naegle's body after Rogers confessed that he buried her in the backyard of his home. His car has been impounded and is being searched for evidence. Authorities are not revealing details on the relationship between Naegle and Rogers, saying only that the two knew each other. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "US Denies Relations With Russia Are 'Frozen' By JUSTIN FISHEL Dec 21, 2016, 4:50 PM ET 0 Shares Star Bryan R. Smith/Getty Images Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and United States Secretary of State John Kerry speak during the International Syria Support Group meeting, Sept. 22, 2016 in New York. 0 Shares Email The U.S. State Department pushed back against claims today from the Kremlin that diplomatic dialogue between the two countries has \"frozen\" almost entirely. \u201cI don't know exactly what to make of that comment,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters today. \"Obviously, we don't agree and have issues with Russia on a variety of issues, but dialogue has not been broken.\" Russian news agencies quoted President Vladimir Putin 's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, saying today that \"a dialogue with the United States has been frozen on practically all levels.\" He also signaled that Putin maybe we waiting out the Obama administration, telling Mir TV that the Kremlin expects the new administration to have a \"fresher and more constructive approach.\" Diplomatic relations with Russia have been at a post-Cold War level since Russia's annexation of Crimea and have worsened during the conflict in Syria and its cyber-intrusions into U.S. political organizations. Russia's comment comes the day after foreign ministers from Turkey, Iran and Russia met in Moscow to discuss future plans for Syria without inviting the United States. Natalia Kolesnikova/Getty Images Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu attend a press conference in Moscow, on Dec. 20, 2016. Kirby said today the U.S. doesn't see it as a snub. \u201cI would push back on this idea that they've excluded us from Syria,\" Kirby said. \"Yes, we weren't in the meeting in Moscow, but it's not as if we haven't had communication with them before and then right after that meeting. So, there's been no exclusion of the United States with respect to the issue of Syria.\u201d In early October the White House officially called off bilateral talks with Russia over the Syria crisis. Nevertheless, Secretary of State John Kerry has since spoken with the Russian foreign minister on several occasions. The Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Germany Seeks Tunisian Tied to Berlin Christmas Market Attack By MELISSA EDDY Continue reading the main story Photo Anis Amri is wanted by German police in connection with the Berlin Christmas market attack. Credit German Federal Police BERLIN \u2014 Investigators undertook a Europe-wide manhunt on Wednesday for a young Tunisian ex-convict with multiple aliases who had been denied asylum in Germany and was considered a security risk, linking him to a deadly truck rampage through a Berlin Christmas market. The attack on Monday killed 12 people and wounded 48 \u2014 12 of them seriously. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the assault, one of Germany\u2019s deadliest acts of terrorism in decades. The aftermath has been complicated by a botched search for the driver, who has remained at large. The revelations added to the growing pressure confronting Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who decided last year to open the country\u2019s border to roughly a million migrants and refugees. A European arrest warrant identified the Tunisian as Anis Amri, 23, and said he had a history of providing false names and nationalities and should be considered armed and dangerous. German news agencies reported that the man had ties to Abu Walaa, a 32-year-old Iraqi Salafist arrested in Germany last month and accused of recruiting would-be jihadists to fight for the Islamic State. A reward of 100,000 euros, or about $104,000, was offered for information leading to his arrest. Continue reading the main story It was not clear if the Tunisian was the actual driver. But the furious effort by the authorities to find someone who only months earlier faced deportation was outrageous, said Stephan Mayer , the home affairs spokesman for the conservative parliamentary bloc that includes Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union. Video German Interior Minister on Manhunt Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, the interior minister of Germany, confirmed on Wednesday that there was a new suspect in Monday's attack on the Berlin Christmas market, and that authorities were searching for him. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Michael Kappeler/European Pressphoto Agency. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed The German interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, confirmed that a manhunt was underway but would not get into specifics. \u201cSuccess counts, and not speed or speculation,\u201d he told reporters in Berlin. Mr. Amri was recorded as having entered Italy in 2012, according to German news accounts. He traveled to Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum in April this year, receiving papers that allowed him to stay in the country temporarily. He lived for a time in housing designated for asylum seekers in the city of Emmerich am Rhein, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, and in Berlin. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a news conference in D\u00fcsseldorf, Ralf J\u00e4ger , the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, said that federal prosecutors had been observing the Tunisian man \u2014 he did not use Mr. Amri\u2019s name \u2014 on suspicion that he might have been plotting an attack. When the man moved to Berlin in February, state authorities there picked up the monitoring. The man was to have been deported in June, Mr. J\u00e4ger said. But because he did not have a valid passport, and because Tunisia did not initially acknowledge that he was a citizen, it was not possible to send him home. (Only on Wednesday did the Tunisian authorities issue a passport, he said.) Mr. Mayer, the lawmaker, said the Tunisian man had spent a day in custody pending deportation, but because the authorities were unable to establish his identity \u201cbeyond doubt,\u201d he was released. \u201cThis is a person who apparently was known to be potentially dangerous and who apparently was to be deported,\u201d Mr. Mayer said. In August, Mr. Amri was arrested in the southern city of Friedrichshafen with a fake Italian document and released a short while later, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. Video In Berlin: \u2018We Share Your Pain\u2019 Mourners spoke of unity and strength after the Christmas market attack that killed 12 people on Monday. By THE NEW YORK TIMES. Photo by Britta Pedersen/European Pressphoto Agency. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed An identity document found in a wallet left on the floor of the truck led the German authorities to seek the Tunisian man, said Frank Tempel of the Left Party. The document showed that the suspect had been allowed to remain in Germany but that he had not been granted full asylum. Several of the men involved in the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, in Brussels in March and in Nice in July were of Tunisian origin, but the number of Tunisians in Germany is low. Mr. Amri is believed to come from the impoverished south of Tunisia, on the edge of the Sahara. His father told a Tunisian radio station , Mosa\u00efque FM, that his son left Tunisia about seven years ago and served four years in prison in Italy after he was accused of setting fire to a school. The son was sentenced in absentia in Tunisia to five years in prison for violent robbery, the radio station reported. Tunisians make up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and Libya and have held leadership roles in the Islamic State. Tunisian security officials say the militants have been active in recruiting young volunteers in Tunisia and have links to immigrant networks in Europe. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A prominent Tunisian commander in the Islamic State, Boubaker al-Hakim, who was wanted in connection with terrorist attacks in Tunisia and was linked to the January 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, was reported killed last month in a drone strike in Raqqa, Syria. According to the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the Tunisian man being sought in Germany had lived in the city of Dortmund with a man named Boban S., who has been arrested and accused of involvement with the Islamic State. Photo A makeshift memorial on Wednesday near the site of the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. Credit Clemens Bilan/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Boban S., in turn, is reported to have connections with Abu Walaa, the Iraqi who is known as \u201cthe man with no face,\u201d because he often preached in Arabic and in poor German, with his back to the camera. The authorities arrested Abu Walaa on Nov. 8. Abu Walaa, who has also been identified by officials as Ahmed Abdulaziz A., made his base in Hildesheim, a city of 100,000 south of Hanover, where he drew an increasingly devoted following and even offered his own app in 2014. He was charged with recruiting terrorists and openly supporting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Officials emphasized that they were not yet certain that the Tunisian man had carried out the attack, and officials cautioned against jumping to conclusions. On Tuesday, the authorities arrested a 23-year-old Pakistani man who had applied for asylum in Germany, but they released him hours later, citing a lack of evidence. Ms. Merkel and other officials have emphasized that they did not want the attack to jeopardize Germany\u2019s commitment to a free and open society, and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier reaffirmed that idea on Wednesday. \u201cWe want to uphold this way of life, and not let it be destroyed by anyone, not even whoever was responsible for what happened here,\u201d he told reporters. Christmas markets in major German cities appeared to heed a call by Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re , the interior minister, to stay open. In Bonn, crowds continued to show up under the watch of the police. In cities like Dresden , the Berlin attack had its ominous presence felt with large obstacles to keep vehicles from getting among the stalls. The same was true in Vienna\u2019s two famous markets , in neighboring Austria. Photo The European arrest warrant for Anis Amri. Credit German police, via Associated Press Laws and traditions in Germany strongly emphasize personal privacy, and the identities of the victims of the attack have barely begun to emerge. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman from Neuss, a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, according to news reports. Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, an Italian transportation specialist who has been living in Germany for three years, has been missing since Monday, and her father, Gaetano Di Lorenzo, said he feared the worst. \u201cWe are here with my wife, waiting for the DNA results,\u201d he said in an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. \u201cWe are waiting for confirmation, but I am not deluding myself.\u201d The daughter\u2019s cellphone and transit pass were found near the scene immediately after the attack, her relatives and friends reported on Tuesday on social media. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the attack \u201cmay have claimed the life of an Israeli citizen.\u201d He was referring to Dalia Elkayam, who has been missing since Monday and whose husband, Rami Elkayam, was seriously injured in the attack. Another victim of the attack was a Polish truck driver, Lukasz Urban, 37, who had a wife and young child and who was found dead in the cab of the truck. He had been stabbed and shot.

Children from the Suri tribe stand in Ethiopia's southern Omo Valley near Kibbish on Sept. 25. The Suri are a pastoralist Nilotic ethnic group in Ethiopia. The construction of the Gibe 3 dam, the third largest hydroelectric plant in Africa, and large areas of very \"thirsty\" cotton and sugar plantations and factories along the Omo river threaten the lives of tribes living in the Omo Valley who depend on the river for their survival and way of life. Human rights groups fear for the future of the tribes if they are forced to scatter, give up traditional ways through loss of land or ability to keep cattle as globalization and development increases. Ethiopia aims to produce 15,000 megawatts of electricity through its dams in the coming five years. Carl De Souza / AFP - Getty Images 19.

Police use water cannons on demonstrators during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota on Nov. 20. Since August, the camp on federal land near the reservation and the pipeline route has been home to thousands of people protesting the four-state $3.8 billion pipeline designed to carry oil to a shipping point in Illinois. The tribe argues that the pipeline would impact drinking water and sacred sites on its 2.3-million acre reservation straddling the North Dakota-South Dakota border. A federal court battle over whether the developer of the Dakota Access oil pipeline can finish the $3.8 billion project will linger at least into the first couple months of the new year.

    "text": "NTSB to Finally Examine Long Lost Black Box of Eastern Airlines Flight 980 By JEFFREY COOK Dec 21, 2016, 3:14 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH The Lost Tapes: The Hunt for the Black Boxes of Eastern Airlines Flight 980 0 Shares Email The National Transportation Safety Board is arranging to retrieve the remains of a black box belonging to Eastern Airlines Flight 980 from a Boston apartment, according to an email from an NTSB official that was shared with ABC News. The email says Bolivian authorities have requested that the NTSB obtain the evidence and examine it in its lab in Washington, D.C. In May 2016, best friends Dan Futrell and Isaac Stoner of Boston climbed Bolivia 's Mount Illimani and, at an elevation of 16,000 feet, recovered remains of what appears to be a black box from the doomed U.S. airliner. Two Americans search for black box from Eastern Airlines Flight 980, which crashed into a Bolivian mountain in 1985. https://t.co/H0Wuw4nFn0 pic.twitter.com/a7Z9VBF5xz \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) December 15, 2016 Flight 980 crashed on Jan. 1, 1985, on its approach to the airport outside La Paz, Bolivia. There were 29 people on board, including eight Americans. No one survived, and multiple international efforts to recover the flight recorders ended fruitlessly because of the inaccessibility of the crash site, the NTSB previously said. International regulations dictate that the nation where an accident occurs is in charge of any investigation. After the discovery by Futrell and Stoner this spring, the NTSB offered its services, but the agency needed the green light from Bolivia before proceeding. Futrell and Stoner said their phone calls, emails and certified letters sent to the Bolivian Embassy in Washington went unanswered. ABC News' efforts to reach Bolivian diplomats in the United States were unsuccessful. On Dec. 1, Capt. Edgar Chavez, the operations inspector at the General Directorate of Civil Aviation of Bolivia, told ABC News that the Bolivian government would allow the NTSB to look at the tape found by Futrell and Stoner. He was unable to say when that would occur, however, adding that his agency was \"still working on the paperwork.\" Chavez did not responded to follow-up calls and emails from ABC News requesting an update or another interview. Wednesday's news that the NTSB received permission to examine the black box is a significant step forward in the search for answers to what many call the biggest aviation mystery of the 20th century. Many experts, including those at the NTSB, thought finding the flight recorders would be impossible, given the conditions on Mount Illimani. It is unclear when, where or how the evidence will be handed over to the NTSB. The recorders remain in Futrell's apartment in a suburb of Boston. 0 Shares ",

That didn\u2019t happen\u2026 not by a long shot. \u201cI was really surprised by the reaction to the tree,\u201d Pelletier told FoxNews.com of the 88-foot, gangly tree in the city\u2019s Quartier des spectacles. \u201cWe want to show people a natural Quebec Christmas tree, so that\u2019s what we got.\u201d When a flatbed truck accompanied by police escort brought the balsam fir through the streets of the Canadian city in late November \u2013 broken branches, bare spots and all \u2013 Montrealers were far from impressed.

Last year the company hosted the first Pan-Am Tree Toss in Montreal \u2013 but the scorn and criticism for the lanky tree is something he didn\u2019t expect. He added that the tree \u2013 which they found in a rural area near Quebec border with the United States \u2013 is what a real Christmas tree looks and that the one in Rockefeller is not what a tree looks like in nature.

    "text": "advertisement Computers have revolutionized the art of making music. Using software like Audacity or GarageBand, even symphonic neophytes can learn to record, arrange, and edit their own songs. So far computers have been mere tools for helping humans become creators. But artificially intelligent machines are now becoming our collaborators \u2014 and maybe even artists in their own right. Meet ALYSIA, the latest song-writing AI. Short for Automatic LYrical SongwrIting Application, ALYSIA is a \"co-creative system.\" Unlike other recent song-writing AIs, ALYSIA is designed for the human and computer to engage in a true creative partnership. Humans supply ALYSIA with lyrics. ALYSIA turns those lyrics into melodies. Related: How Virtual Reality is Redefining Live Music \"It can make meaningful contributions in the same way as any other artist,\" says ALYSIA co-creator Maya Ackerman, a computer scientist at San Jose State University in California. ALYSIA's output won't chart anytime soon, but its first songs aren't bad for an amateur songwriter \u2014 especially a machine. Just listen to the trio of pop songs ALYSIA created recently with help from Ackerman and David Loker, a data scientist at San Jose State who helped co-create the system. Just as musicians are inspired by what they listen to, ALYSIA hones its craft by taking in existing songs. Ackerman and Loker programmed the features of two dozen pop songs into ALYSIA: lyrics, key signature, time signature, and rhythm. When a human feeds lyrics to ALYSIA, it analyzes the songs in its database to generate a rhythm and melody to accompany the words. From those key elements, human artists can then flesh out details like harmonies and instrumentation. Joshua Palkki, a professor of Vocal/Choral Music Education at California State University in Long Beach, uses ALYSIA. Maya Ackerman Ackerman and Loker were ALYSIA's first collaborators, but in recent months other artists have signed on to work with the machine. One new song, written with California State University in Long Beach music professor Josh Palkki, uses a melody ALYSIA created based on words from the Emily Dickinson poem \"Hope is the Thing With Feathers.\" Other new collaborations use an ALYSIA-based system that was trained with songs from Puccini operas instead of top-40 hits. Dubbed Robocini, the system is currently working with two San Francisco based-composers: Davide Verotta is using ALYSIA to create an aria and James Morgan is working with the system to craft the first collaborative computer-human opera. Rafael P\u00e9rez y P\u00e9rez, an expert in the emerging field of computational creativity at Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico City calls ALYSIA's contributions \"interesting and original.\" Related: How Computers Are Learning to Predict the Future \"From a practical point of view, a system like ALYSIA has a great potential for supporting the development of musical skills in humans,\" he says. \"Particularly, I am thinking of those people that do not have the opportunity to have formal studies but nevertheless have the necessity of expressing themselves through music.\" Hang Chu, a graduate student in computer vision at the University of Toronto who has built his own song-writing AI system, points out that music made with ALYSIA raises some interesting creative rights issues. \"In its current stage, the system isn't fully automatic yet,\" he says. \"Because of this, it is difficult to tell who should get the credit of composing the amazing songs.\" Ackerman and Loker built ALYSIA, but how much should we credit them for the music it creates? This question will be even more pressing as we develop music-writing AI systems equipped to generate songs without humans adding the finishing touches. \"We are so used to thinking of computers as tools, with which we don't need to share credit,\" she said. \"It's new and, hopefully, exciting to think of sharing credit with them.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

The market in Tultepec, on the outskirts of Mexico City, exploded the day before. (Christian Palma / Associated Press) Laura Tillman Jesus Rodriguez Ernesto Ortiz leaned against his bike Wednesday and peered through a chain-link fence at the wreckage of the San Pablito fireworks market. In this community, the sale of fireworks touches nearly every family, and so too did the explosion Tuesday afternoon that left the market a field of twisted metal, burned-out cars, broken glass and human remains.\u00a0 At least 32 people were killed and 46 others remained hospitalized Wednesday after an eruption of sparks and flames engulfed the crowded network of stalls that was once considered Latin America's safest fireworks market. By Wednesday morning, along with a sense of mourning across Mexico, there were also recriminations. It was the third major explosion at the San Pablito market since 2005. \"You can\u2019t explain that these tragedies continue to repeat themselves, and the authorities just lament them and send condolences,\u201d said Alejandra Barrales, president of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party. \u201cThis demonstrates the lack of care and attention not just here, but in the whole state.\u201d (Patrick J. McDonnell and Laura Tillman) But many here in Tultepec, like Ortiz, have lived a life defined by fireworks sales and the culture of the pirotecnicos. Even after the devastation of the previous day, they were quick to defend the artisanal explosives crafted here through the generations as a source of income, celebration and strength for the community.\u00a0 Now 22, Ortiz has been selling fireworks since he was 12. He knows to have a fire extinguisher and buckets of water handy, and he instructs customers to keep a distance of several feet when they ignite the elaborate standing displays, or castles, that he makes for parties. Ortiz showed pictures of his castles on his phone. He'd experimented with different materials\u00a0and was proud of the level of detail he put into their construction.\u00a0 ''I like the creativity, it's really fun. It's even more fun when you light it and people are watching,'' he said. On his grandmother's birthday, he estimated, nearly 600 people came into the street to watch him light up the castle he'd made for her as a gift. They had the same enthusiasm they\u2019d shared since they were all children \u2014 a mix of glee and fear on their faces. He found himself watching their faces instead of the spectacle.\u00a0 This week though, for the families who had not been spared, the horror that fireworks could cause was all too real. At a clinic near the blast site, Alvaro Hernandez Urban searched for his sister-in-law. She had worked at a fireworks stand that each November and December in the busy holiday season became her home. Now she was missing. Frustrated that he hadn't been given information from any hospital, nor permitted to see whether any of the unidentified bodies at the morgue might be her, he continued to check lists of names in hopes of finding some new information. ''She's a wonderful person,'' he said. ''It's worrisome, we have zero information.'' Rolando Lomas, looking for his brother-in-law, was equally desperate. He had already looked in all the hospitals where the wounded had been sent. ''I heard some people were helping victims in their homes,'' he said.\u00a0 Juan Martinez Leon, who escaped from the blast along with his mother and sister, doesn't sell fireworks but works with his family at the market selling hand-sewn hats from a cart. When the explosions started, he tried to grab his things, but finally gave up and just ran.\u00a0 Juan Martinez Leon with his mother, Lorenza Leon Lopez, and sister, Marie Cruz Aguilar Mendoza, who all survived the explosion, at their home in Tultepec's San Antonio Xahuento neighborhood. Laura Tillman / For The Times Juan Martinez Leon with his mother, Lorenza Leon Lopez, and sister, Marie Cruz Aguilar Mendoza, who all survived the explosion, at their home in Tultepec's San Antonio Xahuento neighborhood. Juan Martinez Leon with his mother, Lorenza Leon Lopez, and sister, Marie Cruz Aguilar Mendoza, who all survived the explosion, at their home in Tultepec's San Antonio Xahuento neighborhood. (Laura Tillman / For The Times) ''I can say I didn't lose anything \u2014 the material isn't important. I have my mother and sister,\u201d said Leon, who was wearing a sweatshirt with a picture of Santa Claus and the word, in English, \u201cBelieve.\u201d \u201cWhen I was separated from them, that uncertainty and the fear were the worst part,'' he said. But his daughter, Sara Elizabet Vidal Hernandez, was not so calm. She shook as she spoke about the explosion, describing how emergency workers had instructed bystanders to bring water to pour on the bodies in the rubble to stop them from burning. \u00a0 While her father defended the pirotecnicos, saying they lift the whole community with the income they generate, Hernandez was no longer convinced.\u00a0 ''I think they should close. Because this isn't the first time, it's been three times that it exploded,'' she said. ''I understand it's their work here in the community, the fireworks, but it's dangerous, and too many people died.'' Along La Saucera Street, a long dirt road lined by concrete-block buildings housing dozens of businesses that sell raw materials for fireworks, there was a sense of resignation. At one company, Piroquim, a match setting fire to its name on the marquee, Pedro Sanabria estimated that up to 90% of the community benefits from the fireworks trade.\u00a0 ''That's how you eat for many people,'' he said. As for how the explosion could have occurred, that was more complicated. ''There are many versions,\u201d he said. \u201cSome say it was provoked, some people didn't want the market there.'' Is it possible, as Ortiz had wondered earlier that day, that it could have been caused by a child playing around? ''No,'' Sanabria said, definitively. ''Children already know what fireworks are, they know a cometa, a mecha.'' They know the dangers of a tamalito, a cracker, a trabuco.\u00a0 Other children in other places might have accidents with fireworks, Sanabria said. But certainly not the children of Tultepec.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

When detectives went to a home in the 5000 block of West 106th Street in Lennox, they found\u00a0Lisa Marie Naegle\u2019s body in a shallow grave. Veronica Rocha A nursing student arrested in the death of a former reality show contestant was allegedly having an affair with her and gave her family inconsistent stories about being with her after she disappeared, the dead woman\u2019s\u00a0sister said. As Lisa Marie Naegle\u2019s family investigated her mysterious disappearance on Sunday, they tracked down surveillance video that showed Naegle entering Jackie Jerome Rogers\u2019 black SUV after a birthday party at a restaurant in Torrance and driving off, her sister, Danielle Naegle-Kaimona, told KABC-TV News. The family also had photographs of the pair at the party and security camera images of them at a gas station, the TV station reported. But when they confronted Rogers seeking information about Naegle\u2019s whereabouts, he denied having left with her or taking\u00a0her home, Naegle-Kaimona said. Rogers later admitted to police that he changed his\u00a0story because he and Naegle, who was married, were having an affair, Naegle-Kaimona told KABC. Police said Rogers gave information to investigators that led them to believe Naegle had been\u00a0murdered.\u00a0 When detectives went to his family\u2019s home in the 5000 block of West 106th Street in Lennox on Tuesday, they found Naegle\u2019s body in a shallow grave. Rogers, 34, was arrested\u00a0on suspicion of murder. The L.A. County coroner\u2019s office will make the final determination of how Naegle\u00a0died, said Officer Tony Im, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department . Rogers was a nursing student of Naegle\u2019s. The dead woman had taught at West Los Angeles College. Hours after her body was discovered, her husband, Derek Harryman, expressed devastation on Facebook. \u201cI love you so much Lisa and will never be the same without you,\u201d he wrote.\u201cUntil we meet again baby cakes. My little flower.\u201d Naegle, who appeared on the E! reality show \u201cBridalplasty,\u201d went missing after attending a party at the Alpine Village restaurant on Saturday night. She called her husband about 2:30 a.m. Sunday and said she would be grabbing food on her way home. She never arrived home and didn\u2019t show up to teach her next nursing class. Her husband tried to find her and call her. But calls made to her cellphone went to voicemail, he said. Naegle was reported missing Monday after her family spoke with Rogers. Naegle competed with other brides for a dream wedding and a plastic surgery procedure in the 2010 reality show. Naegle was eliminated in Episode 7. Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss ",

A new drug may provide relief from the most devastating form of MS.\u00a0 Six years ago, at age 45, Jerrie Gullick suddenly developed leg and back pain, numbness, and severe fatigue. She was barely able to walk, and working at a demanding job became impossible. \u00a0Jerrie Gullick, who has multiple sclerosis.\u00a0 Close CBS News \u201cI had to quit about 7-8 months after I got my diagnosis,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fatigue was overwhelming.\u201d\u00a0 The diagnosis was multiple sclerosis.\u00a0 Many MS patients can manage their disease through the use of several helpful medications, but Gullick is one of the 10 to 15 percent who have progressive MS, which has no approved treatment and continuously gets worse. Three years ago, she joined a trial of a new intravenous drug called Ocrelizumab.\u00a0 It targets an immune system cell which, in MS, is felt to mistakenly attack the nervous system.\u00a0 In the more serious progressive form that Gullick has, the drug slowed down the rate of disability by about 25 percent. Jamie-Lynn Sigler on life with multiple sclerosis Neurologist Dr. Fred Lublin of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City worked on the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal. You have to start with success and this is the start. And so this is for us the start of treating progressive MS, the treating progressive MS era,\u201d she said.\u00a0 Gullick said this drug is giving her new hope. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m gonna have for the next 20 years and that\u2019s okay, whereas before I was thinking in 5 years I\u2019m going to be bedridden,\u201d said Gullick. Gullick can see the silhouette of at least an acceptable future.\u00a0 This drug works by suppressing the immune system, and researchers are still looking at it closely for any serious side effects. The FDA is expected to make a decision about possible approval by the end of March. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

He said on Twitter that campaigning for an electoral victory is \u201cmuch more difficult & sophisticated\u201d than an effort to win the popular vote, slamming Clinton for her focus \u201con the wrong states:\u201d Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016 I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016 I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2016 The series of tweets comes just after the nonpartisan Cook Political Report announced that Clinton\u2019s final popular vote tally totaled 65,844,610, compared to Mr. Trump\u2019s 62,979,636. That\u2019s a difference of 2,864,974 or an edge of 2.1 percentage points. About 7.8 million people also voted for other candidates in the race. Some of the other interesting facts about the election gathered by the Cook Political Report included these observations about specific parts of the country: Texas saw an increase of 12.2 percent in the number of votes cast for president, the greatest increase nationwide. In contrast, Mississippi had the largest decrease in votes cast for president -- it was down 6.7 percent. \u00a0 Clinton performed better that Mr. Obama did in 2012 in Arizona, Georgia and Virginia, although as was the case in 2012, Clinton lost Arizona and Georgia and won Virginia. Howard County, Iowa, was the lone county that both voted for Mr. Obama by more than 20 percent in 2012 and also voted for Mr. Trump by more than 20 percent in 2016. Orange County, California voted Democratic for president for the first time since 1936. And Elliott County, Kentucky voted Republican for the first time since it was founded in 1869. Contrary to other criticisms of media coverage of the election, an analysis by the Report found that the most frequently talked about issue on broadcast television regarding the presidential race related to jobs. According to ad tracking data by Kantar Media, jobs were mentioned in 21 percent of general election ads. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Dec 21 2016, 1:38 pm ET How Facebook's Zuckerberg Crushes His New Year's Resolutions by Alyssa Newcomb advertisement If you need a New Year's resolution role model, check Facebook. This week Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off his artificially intelligent assistant, Jarvis,which he spent 2016 building from scratch as one of his New Year's resolutions . Mark Zuckerberg's smart home includes a t-shirt cannon and a robot that is programmed to say no to some of his wife's requests. REUTERS/Rick Wilking REUTERS But that's hardly the first impressive accomplishment that has come from Zuckerberg, who is known for setting and tackling ambitious and unpredictable New Year's resolutions. While he hasn't told us what's in store for 2017 yet, here's a look back at the various resolutions the social media entrepreneur has completed: Reading More Books Last year, Zuckerberg committed to reading a new book every other week and announced each title on the \"A Year of Books\" Facebook page, where he encouraged other Facebook users to join him. Writing One Thank You Note Per Day The billionaire admitted the daily gratitude challenge in 2014 was surprisingly a tough one. \"There are people who see the beauty of things,\" he said at a Facebook Town Hall meeting that year. \"Then there are people who see things and want to make them better, and I tend to be the latter.\" Meet Someone New Every Day Bad news: Your best odds for being Mark Zuckerberg's new friend may have been in 2013. That year, Zuckerberg made it a resolution to meet someone new - who doesn't work at Facebook - every day. That meant having a conversation, not a simple passing \"hello\" or handshake. \"It's going well\u2014I've done a bunch of things in the community and just tried to get broader exposure,\" he told Fortune that year. A Return to His Coding Roots Zuckerberg returned to coding in 2012 -- something he hadn't had a chance to do as Facebook exploded. The refresher clearly paid off again in 2016 as he showed off Jarvis. Eat What You Kill Zuckerberg mostly ate vegetarian in 2011, with exceptions for meat he killed himself. While it may sound macabre, the CEO said on his Facebook page that the resolution allowed him to \"be more connected to the food I eat and the animals that give their lives so I can eat them.\" Learning Mandarin Mandarin Chinese is a challenging language to learn, especially for a native English speaker, but Zuckerberg was determined to become proficient as part of his 2010 resolution. Not only did this ultimately allow him to communicate with members of his wife's family, but he also showed off his skills in 2014, when he casually participated in a 30-minute question and answer session in Mandarin at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Suited Up Zuckerberg ditched his trademark t-shirts and hoodies in 2009 and wore a tie every day to work - a markedly different look for the laid-back CEO. While he gave it an admirable effort for the year, this resolution clearly didn't stick, as Zuck went back to his classic uniform in the following years. Alyssa Newcomb ",

    "text": "(Steve Schmadeke) \"We pursued the same charges in this case as we would any other case with similar circumstances and respectfully disagree with the Court's decision,\" the state's attorney's office said in a statement issued later Wednesday. After the ruling, Gorman hugged  his former police partner, Timothy Neylon, who was with him on the day of the shooting and testified on his behalf at the trial. Gorman has been suspended without pay for a few months, his attorney said, while Neylon remains on paid desk duty because of the same incident. Gorman was blocks from the Morgan Park police district headquarters when he fired five rounds from his personal handgun at an oversized pickup carrying an off-duty suburban cop and his friend. Those two testified they tried to intervene after seeing Gorman driving erratically and nearly striking a street vendor, then sped away after seeing Gorman emerge from his car with a gun. But Gorman's attorney, Michael Clancy, said his client acted in fear for his life after being chased and harassed for miles by the two men in a truck, who Gorman testified sped toward him after he got out of his personal car. \"The bottom line is the actions that he took were completely in self-defense,\" Clancy told reporters after the judge's ruling. \"The situation he was in \u2014 it was a split-second decision. He got out with the intention of showing his identification and telling these aggressors in the big truck, 'Hey knock it off, get away from me.'\" Prosecutors argued at trial that Gorman, who had refused to submit to a Breathalyzer, was drunk when he opened fire. By the time he was compelled to submit to the exam by internal affairs investigators, more than five hours had passed. His blood alcohol content was 0.07 percent, just below the legal limit of 0.08 percent. Since so many hours had passed, he was charged with misdemeanor DUI. Prosecutors later dropped the charge because Gorman tested under the legal limit, Clancy said. Judges at the Leighton Criminal Court Building have acquitted Chicago police officers in two high-profile criminal cases over the last two years. Former Chicago police Detective Dante Servin, who fatally shot a 22-year-old woman during an off-duty incident near his West Side home, was cleared of involuntary manslaughter in April 2015 by Judge Dennis Porter, who ruled prosecutors brought the wrong charges. Last December, Judge Diane Cannon acquitted police Lt.Glenn Evans on charges he shoved his gun down a man's throat and threatened to kill him despite evidence showing the alleged victim's DNA on Evans' gun. A rare conviction came earlier this month when Judge Matthew Coghlan found a Chicago police officer guilty of felony perjury for falsely testifying at a 2014 drug hearing, but he acquitted two other officers \u2014 one from Chicago and the other from Glenview, saying he was  drawing a distinction between \"knowingly false\" statements and mistakes.

Nikki Haley, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. (AP, Getty and EPA photos) Philip Rucker, Karen TumultyThe Washington Post Donald Trump believes that those who aspire to the most visible spots in his administration should not just be able to do the job, but also look the part. Given Trump's own background as a master brander and showman who ran beauty pageants as a sideline, it was probably inevitable that he would be looking beyond their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for a certain aesthetic in his supporting players. \"Presentation is very important because you're representing America not only on the national stage, but also the international stage depending on the position,\" said Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller. To lead the Pentagon, Trump chose a rugged combat general, whom he compares to a historic one. At the United Nations, his ambassador will be a poised and elegant Indian American with a compelling immigrant backstory. As secretary of state, Trump tapped a neophyte to international diplomacy, but one whose silvery hair and boardroom bearing project authority. The parade of potential job-seekers passing a bank of media cameras to board the elevators at Trump Tower has the feel of a casting call. It is no coincidence that a disproportionate share of the names most mentioned for jobs at the upper echelon of the Trump administration are familiar faces to obsessive viewers of cable news - of whom the president-elect is one. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. \"He likes people who present themselves very well and he's very impressed when somebody has a background of being good on television because he thinks it's a very important medium for public policy,\" said Chris Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Trump. \"Don't forget, he's a showbiz guy. He was at the pinnacle of showbiz and he thinks about showbiz. He sees this as a business that relates to the public.\" \"The look might not necessarily be somebody who should be on the cover of GQ magazine or Vanity Fair,\" Ruddy said. \"It's more about the look and the demeanor and the swagger.\" As Trump formally announced his vice presidential pick in July, he said that Mike Pence's economic record as Indiana governor was \"the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family.\" And in picking retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as his nominee for defense, Trump lauded him as \"the closest thing to General George Patton that we have.\" Trump picks retired Gen. James Mattis as Defense secretary President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Gen. James N. Mattis to head the Defense Department. This decision fills a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. Dec. 1, 2016.\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Gen. James N. Mattis to head the Defense Department. This decision fills a critical national security position in the emerging Cabinet. Dec. 1, 2016.\u00a0 See more videos Mattis has a passing physical resemblance to the legendary World War II commander, as well as to the late actor George C. Scott, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Patton in the 1970 biopic. Trump also seems particularly enamored with a nickname that Mattis is said to privately dislike. \"You know he's known as 'Mad Dog' Mattis, right? 'Mad Dog' for a reason,\" Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times. The president-elect, however, does not mention Mattis' other sobriquet, which is \"Warrior Monk.\" Or his call sign: \"Chaos.\" On the other hand, in Trump's book, not having the right kind of appearance is tantamount to a disqualifier. During the presidential campaign, he stirred a controversy when he pronounced that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lacked \"a presidential look, and you need a presidential look.\" Battling through the GOP primary, Trump frequently made barbed comments about his opponents' appearances. Those kind of skin-deep standards helped make Trump a success as a reality-television star and international brand, but his critics say they are worrisome in the Oval Office. His personnel choices show signs of being \"cast for the TV show of his administration,\" said Bob Killian, founder of a branding agency based in Chicago. \"They are all perfectly coiffed people who look like they belong on a set.\" But Trump spokesman Miller insisted that some qualifications do not lend themselves to lines on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9: \"People who are being selected for these key positions need to be able to hold their own, need to be doers and not wallflowers, and need to convey a clear sense of purpose and commitment.\" ",

AP South of the snow area, ice storms could slick southern Minnesota and central Michigan south into Iowa, with severe thunderstorms stretching all the way south through Texas, forecasters said. A few Christmas tornadoes could even be possible in southern areas. Farther east, a messy mix of snow, rain and ice is likely to develop beginning Friday from northern New England on south. Forecasters said significant icing is possible over a large area from northern Iowa through the upper Midwest, including Minneapolis and Detroit, into Sunday. The ice could arrive in upstate New York and northern New England on Monday, where \"you may have some travel concerns,\" said Domenica Davis, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel. AAA said that with Christmas falling on a Sunday, the holiday travel period is a day shorter than usual. Even so, it expects 103 million Americans, the most on record, to travel for the holidays this year. Nine out of 10 of them will do so by road, said AAA \u2014 which predicted that it will have to rescue almost 1 million of them. Alex Johnson ",

That\u2019s why we have a vice president and a speaker of the House and a whole line of people. They can just keep dying.\u201d Bornstein took aim at Hillary Clinton , calling her an \u201cold lady,\u201d according to the interview, despite the fact that she is a year younger than Trump. In the interview , released today, Bornstein maintained that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing seriously wrong\u201d with Trump\u2019s health. \u201cHe\u2019s a few pounds overweight, which everybody can see, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said, adding that Trump, 70, isn\u2019t \u201can old man the way my grandfather was an old man.\u201d Donald Trump Says He'll Release Full Medical Records Bornstein wrote and released a letter last December describing Trump\u2019s health with phrases like \u201castonishingly excellent\u201d and \u201cextraordinary.\u201d The letter was criticized at the time of its release for its exuberant language and later, after Bornstein revealed he wrote the assessment in a matter of minutes. Trump released a more complete medical assessment in September 2016. Bornstein said he has not spoken with Trump since the election and was unsure if he would be permitted to continue as Trump's physician, since presidents are usually attended to by military doctors, according to Stat. Bornstein noted that he and his wife have been hassled since the election for caring for the Trump family. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so many harassing phone calls,\u201d his wife, Melissa Brown-Bornstein, told Stat. The Trump camp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS News December 21, 2016, 7:09 PM Delta defends ousting YouTube star Adam Saleh from flight Email Delta Airlines is defending removing YouTube celebrity Adam Saleh , whose prank videos have garnered him a significant online following, from a flight Wednesday.\u00a0 Saleh said earlier Wednesday that he was removed from the flight because he spoke Arabic to his mom on the phone before takeoff.\u00a0 \u201cI speak to my mom on the phone every flight,\u201d Saleh told CBSN shortly after video he posted on Twitter showing his removal went viral. \u201cShe only speaks Arabic.\u201d But according to a Delta, Saleh sought to disrupt the cabin.\u00a0 In statement to CBS News Delta said: \u201cUpon landing the crew was debriefed and multiple passenger statements collected. Based on the information collected to date, it appears the customers who were removed sought to disrupt the cabin with provocative behavior, including shouting. This type of conduct is not welcome on any Delta flight. While one, according to media reports, is a known prankster who was video recorded and encouraged by his traveling companion, what is paramount to Delta is the safety and comfort of our passengers and employees. It is clear these individuals sought to violate that priority.\u201d According to Saleh, a woman in the seat in front of him turned around and told him he ought to speak English. Saleh said he told her he can speak whatever language he likes, and her husband responded by standing up and screaming at him. Then about 20 people allegedly said they were uncomfortable with Saleh and his companion. The pair were approached by the captain, who Saleh said \u201cseemed ashamed and embarassed\u201d when he asked them to leave the plane because of the other passengers\u2019 complaints. \u00a0 In an earlier statement, Delta said:\u00a0 \u201cMaintaining a safe, comfortable and orderly onboard environment is paramount for every flight and requires the cooperation of all of our customers in conjunction with adherence to directions from our crew members. This is a Delta policy and is required by U.S. regulations as well as others governing aviation worldwide. \u201cTwo customers were removed from Delta flight 1 departing London-Heathrow today after a disturbance in the cabin resulted in more than 20 customers expressing their discomfort. \u201cWe have spoken with the customers who were removed; they were rebooked on another flight. Plans are in place to immediately speak with our crew and other passengers when the flight lands this afternoon. We will provide an update once we have more information.\u201d Saleh has more than 1.6 million subscribers to his TrueStoryASA \u00a0YouTube channel, and more than 2.2 million subscribers to his Adam Saleh Vlogs YouTube channel. Saleh\u2019s YouTube channels are full of prank videos as well as videos about Muslim life, and he is a self-described \u201cprofessional idiot.\u201d Saleh has a history of posting staged videos designed to look like the real thing, including an\u00a0 infamously faked viral video \u00a0that alleged to have shown anti-Muslim bias from the NYPD. In 2014, Saleh\u2019s video \u201c RACIAL PROFILING EXPERIMENT! \u201d showed him and friend staging a fight twice in front of an alleged police officer, once in Western street clothes, and once in Muslim clothes.\u00a0 The Smoking Gun revealed the hoax \u00a0relatively quickly, but two years later, as of Wednesday morning, Saleh still does not indicate that the video was staged in its description. In February 2016, Saleh posted a video of a\u00a0 self-described \u201csocial experiment\u201d \u00a0in which he counts down from 10 in Arabic aboard a plane.\u00a0 Just last week,\u00a0 Saleh was called out for faking a video \u00a0allegedly showing him sneaking onto a flight inside a suitcase. @omgAdamSaleh Nice try Adam, but definitely a few inconsistencies with this vid, namely the fact we have footage of you boarding the plane! \u2014 Tigerair Australia (@TigerairAU) December 14, 2016 In one video Saleh posted to Twitter, that was retweeted more than 500,000 times, he can be seen getting escorted off the London-to-New York flight. (WARNING: Video contains some strong language that some readers may find offensive.) We got kicked out of a @Delta airplane because I spoke Arabic to my mom on the phone and with my friend slim... WTFFFFFFFF please spread pic.twitter.com/P5dQCE0qos \u2014 Adam Saleh (@omgAdamSaleh) December 21, 2016 As he is slowly walking down the aisle of the jet, Saleh says he is being kicked off for \u201cspeaking a different language.\u201d He said he was just innocently talking to his mother when \u201cwhite\u201d people around him began complaining about his use of Arabic. This led to a handful of Delta personnel asking Saleh to leave the flight. In the video, some passengers can be seen telling the apparent Delta employees that they did not want Saleh removed, while others can be seen waving and saying \u201cbye\u201d as he walks away. He later tweeted that police and security officials interviewed him and the other person kicked off the flight multiple times. UPDATE: We're being security checked AGAIN right now. \u2014 Adam Saleh (@omgAdamSaleh) December 21, 2016 Saleh later said he got on a flight to New York with a different airline after being \u201cchecked\u201d for 30 minutes. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let this go,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cWhat if they do this to people like my mother who can\u2019t even speak English?\u201d No official accounting of what exactly transpired on the flight has been released by airport security.\u00a0 Some of the passengers on the flight spoke to CBS News after the plane landed at JFK Airport. \u201cIt was clear that this guy knew what he was doing, because as he was leaving the plane he would stop, he would kind of make eye-contact with people. He would say \u2018Delta, Delta is kicking me off the plane.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t alone, he was travelling with somebody else,\u201d Rev. Karen Georgia Thompson told CBS News. Another passenger told CBS News that she felt it was not discriminatory in any way. \u201cI was sitting towards the front of the plane and just heard a lot of commotion actually,\u201d said passenger Jacqueline Willemsen. \u201cWhen he came up to the front he was just screaming that it was an injustice and that he was being kicked off for speaking loudly in Arabic. To be really honest it seemed like more of a scene than anything that actually happened.\u201d \u00a0 However, another passenger told CBS News he had a bit of a different perspective. \u201cI think the guy was giving a bit of a prayer, just before take off, which is not unusual. Somebody heard him speaking in Arabic and I think reported him,\u201d said passenger Chris Ashford. \u201c\u2026Whether Delta performed or acted in the manner they were supposed to, I\u2019m assuming, for protocol, yes. There definitely seemed to be a bit of a misunderstanding.\u201d\u00a0 ",

    "text": "vgajic/Getty Images vgajic/Getty Images Researchers looking into whether a shorter course of antibiotics would treat young children's ear infections as well as a longer course, found that not only was the shorter treatment less effective, it didn't reduce antibiotic resistance or side effects. The study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, comes as physicians and researchers are trying to come up with ways to curb the unnecessary use of antibiotics, including the possibility of using them for a shorter time against some common infections. The goal is to prevent bacteria from developing resistance to antibiotics. While that strategy didn't pan out in this particular study, shorter antibiotic courses are still being used and studied in other contexts. The study included 520 children between 6 and 23 months old who were diagnosed with an acute middle ear infection, a very common childhood illness . Half of the children were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanate, while the other half received 5 days of the drug plus another five days of a placebo. If the children experienced another ear infection during the period they were in the study, they received the same treatment. Parents, researchers and clinicians didn't know what treatment a child was getting. Article continues after sponsorship The kids were tracked for the severity of their symptoms and had regular office visits to check their health, plus additional visits if they were ill. The researchers also checked to see if their throats had been colonized by bacteria that were resistant to the antibiotic. The researchers found that initial treatment failed in 34 percent of the children treated with the five days of antibiotics, compared to 16 percent of children who had the longer treatment. Symptoms were also worse in the group that received the shorter treatment regimen. And there was no difference between the groups in the rate of colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The results were a surprise, says Dr. Alejandro Hoberman , chief of the division of general academic pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and an author of the study. \"I also expected that if you used an antibiotic for a shorter period of time, there would be fewer adverse events,\" he says. But that didn't happen; rates of diarrhea and diaper rash, both of which are side effects of antibiotics, were similar in both groups. The authors said the findings can't be generalized to children who are older than two years, or to adults. A 2010 Cochrane Review of research found that using antibiotics for less than seven days increased the likelihood of treatment failure. But Hoberman says many of the previous trials had some flaws, including less strict diagnostic criteria. This study was designed to address those gaps. \"This study really shows the importance of doing clinical trials,\" says Dr. Helen Boucher , an infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center and a member of the board of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA.) There's a push to see if the optimal dose of antibiotics could be shortened in some contexts, but that has to be studied with specific combinations of infections, antibiotics and patient populations, she says. \"The whole notion of really figuring out the optimal duration of therapy is one we've been advocating heavily for.\" For example, a study of a shorter course of antibiotics against urinary tract infections in children is ongoing. And based on the existing research, the IDSA and the American Thoracic Society recommended earlier this year that most patients who develop pneumonia in the hospital receive a short course of antibiotics. Another prong of the strategy is to limit the use of antibiotics to bacterial infections, says Dr. Pranita Tamma , a pediatrician and director of the pediatric antimicrobial stewardship program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Parents often come to the doctor when their kids have upper respiratory infections, but most of those are colds caused by a virus and can't be helped by antibiotics. A 2014 study found that displaying posters in exam stating the clinicians' commitment to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for upper respiratory infections lowered the rate of inappropriate prescriptions. \"Antibiotics can be life-saving when used properly,\" says Tamma. \"But every day that an antibiotic is used, whether it's indicated or not, can put you at additional risk.\" Katherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

What happens now? Sean Rossman , USA TODAY 8:01 p.m. EST December 21, 2016 x Share North Carolina lawmakers hold a special session Wednesday to consider repealing a law that limits protections for LGBT people. House Bill 2 mandates transgender people use public restrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. (Dec. 21) AP Hunter Schafer, of Raleigh, holds a sign in favor of repealing North Carolina HB2 during a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly in Raleigh, N.C., Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016. North Carolina's legislature is reconvening to see if enough lawmakers are willing to repeal the 9-month-old law that limited LGBT rights, including which bathrooms transgender people can use in public schools and government buildings. (Photo: Ben McKeown, AP) A deal has fallen apart to undo the North Carolina law known as the \"bathroom bill\" in a sign of the state's bitter political divide. The state's legislature was called into a special session Wednesday to consider repealing the law known as HB2 after months of pressure, including lost jobs and canceled sporting events and concerts. But the Republican-controlled legislature showed once again that it preferred to go its own way. The latest special session was called by Gov. Pat McCrory after Charlotte gutted a local nondiscrimination ordinance that Republicans had blamed for necessitating the statewide law. Among other things, HB2 requires transgender people to use restrooms corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings. Here's what led to where we are now. What sparked it? In February, the Charlotte City Council approved an ordinance revising the city\u2019s non-discrimination ordinance, expanding protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity and allowing people to use restrooms of the sex by\u00a0which they identify. That drew the ire of McCrory, once Charlotte\u2019s mayor, who warned such leniency was a threat to public safety. He also hinted at state legislative action. In March, the state\u2019s house and senate passed the bill in a special session. \u00a0Just hours later, McCrory signed the bill, which overturned Charlotte's expansions. The fallout The bill\u2019s passage stoked protests in North Carolina , the disapproval of various companies and celebrities as well as resulted in two federal lawsuits. Google, Apple and Microsoft came out against the bill as well as the NBA\u2019s Charlotte Hornets and the NHL\u2019s Carolina Hurricanes. The NBA moved its All-Star game from Charlotte to New Orleans over the law and various musicians canceled North Carolina performances,\u00a0 including Bruce Springsteen , Ringo Starr, Boston, Pearl Jam, Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato. The U.S. Justice Department found the law discriminates against transgender people. The federal government and North Carolina later sued each other over the issue. The issue inserted itself into the state's gubernatorial race earlier this year. Democratic challenger Roy Cooper attacked McCrory for the bill. Cooper, the state's attorney general,\u00a0eventually\u00a0 unseated\u00a0McCrory. What happened today? The legislature reconvened Wednesday morning to consider repealing the law after the Charlotte City Council\u2019s decision to revoke part of its anti-discrimination ordinance. In a statement after the vote, the city cited the \u201congoing negative economic impact\u201d resulting from the ordinance and House Bill 2. The move prompted McCrory, who had who promised to re-consider the bill if Charlotte reversed course, to call a special session of the legislature on Wednesday.

By Mark Berman and Sandhya Somashekhar December 21 at 8:33 PM Follow @markberman Follow @sandhyawp Outgoing North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) during a debate this year. (Gerry Broome/AP) North Carolina lawmakers failed Wednesday to repeal a law regulating transgender people\u2019s use of public restrooms, despite convening in a special legislative session for the express purpose of rescinding the controversial law. The legislature adjourned Wednesday evening after a brutal day in which Republicans feuded over whether to fully or partially repeal the measure, and Democrats accused them of reneging on a pledge to eliminate completely the so-called \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which requires people to use the public restroom that matches with the sex on their birth certificate regardless of their gender identity. After a series of attempts to come to an agreement, the Senate voted down a bill to repeal the law and the House adjourned without acting. They are both scheduled to convene next in January. Gay and transgender rights groups immediately condemned the outcome of the nine-hour session, and\u00a0criticized Republicans for preserving the \u201chateful\u201d legislation that had led to boycotts, cost the state\u00a0 millions of dollars in lost tourism revenue and prompted the NBA and the NCAA to move games. [ Why North Carolina lawmakers were set to consider repealing the bathroom bill ] \u201cToday, the public trust has been betrayed once again. Lawmakers sent a clear message: North Carolina remains closed for business,\u201d Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. Republicans, meanwhile, blamed Democrats, who rejected a version of the repeal that would have included a six-month moratorium on cities passing nondiscrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people. They also blamed the governor-elect, Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), who had paved the way for repeal by negotiating an agreement with the city of Charlotte to pull back a nondiscrimination ordinance it had enacted earlier this year. \u201cMake no mistake: Roy Cooper and Senate Democrats killed the repeal\u201d of the bill, Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) said in a statement. \u201cTheir action proves they only wanted a repeal in order to force radical social engineering and shared bathrooms across North Carolina, at the expense of our state\u2019s families, our reputation and our economy.\u201d The special session came amid intense acrimony in the North Carolina political scene, as Republican lawmakers recently passed legislation\u00a0 aimed at stripping power \u00a0from the Democratic governor-elect, who in turn has threatened a lawsuit. The disaster & shame caused by #HB2 was created by #NCGA for no reason other than hate & fear mongering. Accept nothing but full repeal. \u2014 ACLU-North Carolina (@ACLU_NC) December 21, 2016 A proposal Berger had introduced Wednesday would have repealed\u00a0the bathroom bill, also known as House Bill 2 or H.B. 2 . But its imposition of a\u00a0temporary ban on any local government effort to \u201cenact or amend an ordinance\u201d regulating access to restrooms\u00a0angered groups that had long opposed H.B. 2, which, in addition to its bathroom provision, also reversed local ordinances expanding protections for LGBT people. Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who this month conceded to Cooper, had called the special session on Monday, hours after Charlotte city officials said they would repeal the\u00a0nondiscrimination ordinance the city passed in February . State lawmakers hastily introduced H.B. 2 in March, and McCrory quickly signed the bill, setting off a firestorm. McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, has long criticized the city\u2019s measure as \u201cgovernment overreach\u201d and said H.B. 2 was needed to combat that ordinance and protect women. Opponents of the bathroom bill, a group that includes the Justice Department , decried it as discriminatory, and big businesses and sports leagues echoed these concerns, halting planned expansions and relocating numerous games. The half-measure proposed Wednesday did not satisfy gay and transgender rights groups, who pledged to continue to fight a state law that they had criticized as one of the most discriminatory in the nation. \u201cIt is unacceptable. It\u2019s a gimmick. It\u2019s H.B. 2.0,\u201d said Mara Keisling, president of the National Center for Transgender Equality. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay and any legislature that would do that wouldn\u2019t really be doing that for only six months.\u201d Our #HB2 lawsuit marches on. We will continue to fight this blatant discrimination against #LGBT NCers in court. #NCGA #NCPol \u2014 Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) December 22, 2016 The ugly battle in North Carolina could be a deterrent for other states to either pass broad anti-discrimination measures or enact laws regulating bathroom use by transgender people. Still, transgender rights groups expect a number of states to propose the latter next year. Among them is Texas, where Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R ) has said passing a \u201c women\u2019s privacy act \u201d will be one of his top priorities next year. \u00a0 Earlier Wednesday, the Charlotte City Council held an emergency meeting to repeal its own ordinance in full, a move meant to spur state lawmakers into action.\u00a0A spokeswoman for the city said the repeal vote Monday had affected only the part of the ordinance dealing with public accommodations, such as bathrooms, which council members thought would \u201csufficiently [fulfill] the requests of the general assembly\u201d and lead to H.B. 2\u2019s repeal. [ \u2018Not about bathrooms\u2019: Critics decry North Carolina law\u2019s lesser-known elements ] Some state Republicans were critical of Charlotte for its partial repeal. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, posted a statement on Facebook saying that Cooper and the Charlotte City Council \u201clied to the public about a full repeal,\u201d and his group went on to call this a \u201cdishonest, disgraceful shame.\u201d Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) pushed back against the party\u2019s statement, saying in an email to The Washington Post that the state GOP \u201cis incorrect and they need to stop playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\u201d In a statement Wednesday night, the city of Charlotte said officials\u00a0there are \u201cdisappointed with this unfortunate outcome.\u201d \u201cThe Charlotte City Council acted in good faith to do everything it understood was needed to necessitate the state legislature repealing HB2,\u201d the statement said. The socially conservative North Carolina Family Policy Council had\u00a0 urged members \u00a0Tuesday to call lawmakers to demand that they vote no on a repeal.\u00a0Dan Forest, the state\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, said that even if the bill was\u00a0repealed, \u201cwe will fight this battle all over again with another city or county.\u201d [ North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits over transgender rights ] \u201cThe names will change, but the national groups who are pushing this agenda will not stop until their social engineering is accomplished,\u201d Forest, a supporter of H.B. 2, said in a statement Wednesday morning. On the other side, a newspaper in the liberal city of Asheville argued that the compromise was a losing proposition for gay and transgender people \u2014 as well as the state. \u201cEven if everything goes as planned, the damage done to the state\u2019s reputation is a bell that cannot be unrung,\u201d the Asheville Citizen-Times editorial board wrote Tuesday . \u201cFurther, Charlotte\u2019s gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents are back where they were a year ago, without the protections they deserve.\u201d Demonstrators in Raleigh, N.C., urge the repeal of House Bill (HB2), which has put North Carolina at the center of a national debate over LGBT rights. (Reuters) [ How a backlash built against North Carolina\u2019s law ] Opponents of expanded transgender rights say that allowing explicit protections, particularly in the public sphere, not only breaks with long-standing social mores when it comes to gender and bathrooms but could open the door to sexual predators gaining access to women\u2019s restrooms. Rights groups, however, contend that such arguments are rooted in offensive stereotypes and do not reflect the reality of most transgender people, who have already been quietly using their preferred bathrooms without incident. Protesters decrying the bill gathered outside the governor\u2019s mansion in March. (Jill Knight/The News & Observer via AP) After the bathroom bill was signed, musicians including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled shows in North Carolina, while Cirque de Soleil scrapped several performances in the state. The NBA, which has a franchise in Charlotte, moved this season\u2019s All-Star Game from that city because of \u201cthe climate created by\u201d H.B. 2. The NCAA took even more extensive action, relocating the seven championship games set to take place in North Carolina during this season, including two rounds of the lucrative men\u2019s Division I basketball tournament. Big businesses, including Google and Apple, spoke out against the law. PayPal, a California-based online payment firm, and Deutsche Bank, a German financial giant, called off planned expansions in North Carolina. These expansions would have brought a combined 650 jobs to North Carolina and been worth millions of dollars to the state, officials said.

The state's\u00a0legislators will repeal the contentious law that limited protections for LGBT people and led to an economic backlash, Gov.-elect Roy Cooper said Dec. 19. (Chuck Liddy / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Amid deepening acrimony, a supposedly bipartisan deal to kill the North Carolina law known as the \"bathroom bill\" fell apart Wednesday night, ensuring the likelihood that global corporations and national sports events will continue to stay away from the state. The law limits protections for LGBT people and was best known for a provision that requires transgender people to use public restrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates. It was passed earlier this year after Charlotte officials approved a sweeping anti-discrimination ordinance. The repeal compromise touted by both Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper and GOP Gov. Pat McCrory called for Charlotte to do away with its ordinance. In exchange, lawmakers would undo the LGBT law. But both sides balked: GOP lawmakers cried foul when Charlotte leaders initially left part of the city's ordinance in place. And when the Senate bill called for a months-long ban on cities passing similar ordinances, Democrats said Republicans were going back on their promise. Cooper said the moratorium essentially doubled down on discrimination. \"The legislature had a chance to do the right thing for North Carolina, and they failed,\" he said. \"This was our best chance. It cannot be our last chance.\" The troubles in reaching a resolution exposed the intense distrust within the legislature that has only intensified over the years, especially since Republicans took over control of state government in 2013. Cooper's victory was greeted last week by Republicans acting in a special session to strip away several powers. \"This has been a long and ultimately frustrating day,\" Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the session ended. (Amber Phillips) He blamed Cooper and Charlotte leaders for sinking the deal. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue criticized McCrory for calling the special session a few days before Christmas when there didn't seem to be an agreement. And House Republicans couldn't seem to figure out what they wanted. They spent most of the day in closed-door meetings fighting about whether to approve a repeal bill. People crowded the House and Senate galleries and in the third-floor rotunda all day, keeping watch on the action, or lack thereof. But the mood was much more docile than the angry demonstrations of last week when more than 50 demonstrators were arrested over two days. Social conservatives were thrilled with the preservation of HB2. North Carolina Values Coalition executive director Tami Fitzgerald praised lawmakers \"who stood up for what is right and represented the will of voters by stopping the move to cower and cave-in to the City of Charlotte and the Human Rights Campaign.\" Roy Cooper Chuck Burton / AP North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper speaks during a forum in Charlotte, N.C. on June 24, 2016.\u00a0 North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper speaks during a forum in Charlotte, N.C. on June 24, 2016.\u00a0 (Chuck Burton / AP) Conservative groups said HB2 provides privacy and protection for children using restrooms and locker rooms. Lawmakers have worked \"hard to protect our families, and women and children from the risk that might be imposed by these lunatic ordinances that the lunatic left in Charlotte and other places want to enact,\" said Republican Sen. Buck Newton, who championed HB2 when it was passed in March and supported it ever since. The U.S. Justice Department and others contend the threat of sexual predators posing as transgender persons to enter a bathroom is practically nonexistent. \"This was a counterproductive exercise in reaffirming to the rest of the country that North Carolina wants to remain mired in this divisive dispute,\" said Simone Bell, Southern regional director at Lambda Legal, a gay-rights group. HB2 has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in conventions, jobs and sporting events like the NBA All-Star Game shunning North Carolina. Corporate critics of the law included Deutsche Bank and Paypal, which both backed out of projects that would have brought hundreds of jobs to the state. The law was also seen as a referendum on McCrory, who became its national face. He lost by about 10,000 votes to Cooper. Meanwhile, fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. McCrory was the first sitting North Carolina governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election. Repealing the state law could also have ended protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access. Cooper said earlier this week that Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore had assured him that Charlotte's vote to repeal its ordinance would lead to a full repeal. He had lobbied Charlotte's city council to gut its local nondiscrimination ordinance. Republicans fired back that it was Charlotte city leaders who passed a partial repeal of its ordinance Monday. Council leaders disagreed with that assessment, but still met Wednesday morning \u2014 an hour before the special session began \u2014 to repeal other portions of the ordinance. The local repeal was contingent on undoing HB2 by Dec. 31. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a release that the law will continue to burden Republicans. \"Today, the public trust has been betrayed once again. Lawmakers sent a clear message: North Carolina remains closed for business,\" Griffin said. Associated Press ",

Under the agreement, the enormous construction conglomerate Odebrecht will pay $2.6 billion , and its petroleum subsidiary Braskem will pay approximately $957 million , for their dealings with the state-controlled Brazilian oil company, Petrobras. The U.S. Justice Department said it was the agency's largest corporate bribery resolution ever. The investment research firm Morningstar described the multiyear investigation in its coverage of Petrobras: \"The anticorruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, has led to the arrests of dozens of executives of construction companies for their involvement in the graft scheme, in which builders overcharged Petrobras for projects and then channeled some of the money to politicians and their parties. Scores of politicians are also under investigation by the probe.\" Although Odebrecht and Braskem are both based in Brazil, they trade their stock on U.S. markets and conduct business through U.S. banks, making them subject to U.S. anti-bribery laws. Both companies pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Article continues after sponsorship Odebrecht is one of the largest construction firms in Latin America. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro reported on the company's importance in Brazil last year: \"It's really hard to explain just how omnipresent Odebrecht is in Brazil, and Latin America generally. They are everywhere and they have had a hand in building almost everything \u2014 four of the World Cup stadiums alone. For the Olympics, the company is helping to build the Athletes' Village, an express bus line and the Olympic Park, plus a subway line. But that's really just the tip of the iceberg \u2014 they operate in dozens of countries around the world, too, including in the U.S.\" Earlier this month, Odebrecht released an unvarnished statement of guilt titled \"Odebrecht Apologizes For Its Mistakes,\" which began \"Odebrecht acknowledges its participation in illicit actions in its business activities\" and said the company had given in to \"external pressure.\" The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges Braskem \"made approximately $325 million in profits through bribes ... paid to a government official at Brazil's state-controlled petroleum company as well as Brazilian legislators and political party officials,\" according to a Justice Department announcement.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Wednesday that several Goldman traders, including the head of the bank\u2019s Interest Rate Products Trading Group in the U.S., used trades and false reports to manipulate the benchmark between 2007 and 2012. Wall Street insiders head to White House Specifically, the bank sought to manipulate what is known the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix. The scheme to affect the global benchmark for interest rate products was an effort to benefit Goldman\u2019s derivatives holdings, the CFTC said. In internal communications, Goldman traders had \u201cgamed the fix\u201d in order to benefit related positions, according to the commission. The penalty \u201cdemonstrates the breadth of this kind of misconduct across the industry, and within Goldman, the extent of the misconduct across trading desks and product lines,\u201d said Aitan Goelman, the CFTC\u2019s Director of Enforcement, in a statement. In addition to the fine, Goldman must also implement internal controls and report to the CFTC on whether those controls have been effective. Goldman says it is pleased to have the matter resolved. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said the unidentified Employment Services worker mocked a woman's faith at the city's One-Stop Career Center on Dec. 5 before snatching her hijab. Newark police arrested the employee and banned him from the business. They declined to identify the worker, but said he faces harassment charges. Capt. Derek Glenn said the worker is a 67-year-old Brooklyn man. His name wasn't released due to retaliation concerns. He has been suspended without pay, said Amanda Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The state agency is pursuing his termination in accordance with department policy. But that's not enough, Baraka said. The mayor believes prosecutors should've charged the man with a hate crime and has asked U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman to investigate the incident. \"This was an act of hate against the Islamic faith, as well as an attack on her as a woman,\" Baraka said. \"In the present climate of violence against Muslims across America and around the world, hate crimes must be recognized for what they are and they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" The New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations also condemned the alleged incident, The Record reported. \"Unlawful, bigoted acts cannot be tolerated and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" the group's Executive Director James Sues said. \"In a civil society such as ours, the rights of all citizens to observe their faith without fear for their safety and security must be vigorously protected.\" Katherine Carter, the public information officer for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office, said they concluded the incident wasn't criminal under state law. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show the last name of Newark's mayor is Baraka, not Baracka. 0 Shares ",

Icahn, an investor and big player on Wall Street, will advise Trump on matters of regulatory reform. USA TODAY NETWORK Chairman of Icahn Enterprises Carl Icahn participates in a panel discussion at the New York Times 2015 DealBook Conference at the Whitney Museum of American Art on November 3, 2015 in New York City. (Photo: Neilson Barnard, Getty Images for New York Times) Wall Street maven Carl Icahn will advise President-elect Trump on matters of regulatory reform, giving the famed investor a key say in how his own industry is monitored. Icahn will advise Trump on regulatory topics as an individual, not as a federal employee\u00a0and won't have any specific duties, according to a release from the Trump transition team. But it's clear Icahn and Trump agree on what needs to be done - reduce rules. \u201cUnder President Obama, America\u2019s business owners have been crippled by over $1 trillion in new regulations and over 750 billion hours dealing with paperwork,\" Icahn said in a statement released by the Trump transition team. \"It\u2019s time to break free of excessive regulation and let our entrepreneurs do what they do best: create jobs and support communities.\" Icahn could play a role in naming the successor to Mary Jo White as the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. White has announced plans to step down from the post in January 2017. Some are surprised by the move, especially given the fact that Icahn - a big Wall Street player - will have a hand crafting regulations over his own business and industry. \"It is very disconcerting and troubling to people who take investor protection issues seriously,\" says Andrew Stoltmann, partner at securities law firm Stoltmann Law. \"It's a little like asking the fox to guard the hen house.\" Icahn and Trump have had close business dealings before, as well. Icahn's investment firm Icahn Enterprises bought Trump Entertainment Resorts in February 2016 after the struggling casino operating company exited\u00a0bankruptcy for the fourth time. Now Icahn, \"will also be in charge of overseeing regulatory overhauls while simultaneously controlling or owning stock\u00a0in companies that could benefit from the changes he makes,\" says Democratic National Committee's spokesman Eric Walker, calling the appointment a \"quid-pro-quo 25 years in the making.\" \"The corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated. Voters who wanted Trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud,\u201d Walker says. 2454 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 106 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2igGD3g NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Steven Dean Gordon, who killed four women in Orange County in 2013 and 2014 with alleged accomplice Franc Cano, represented himself at his trial. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) An Orange County jury on Wednesday decided a serial killer should be executed for the abduction and murder of four women. Representing himself at his trial in Santa Ana, Steven Dean Gordon\u00a0did not dispute his responsibility for the deaths of the women, who had been working as prostitutes in Anaheim and Santa Ana in late 2013 and early 2014. Nor\u00a0in his closing argument to jurors Tuesday\u00a0did Gordon, 47, disagree with a prosecutor's argument that he ought to be executed for his crimes. \"If you kill four people like this in cold blood, you deserve to die \u2014\u00a0I believe that,\" Gordon told jurors. \"My actions were evil and horrible, and you're gonna get your justice very shortly.\" He said he was sorry\u00a0to have caused pain to the families of Kianna Jackson, 20;\u00a0Josephine Vargas, 34;\u00a0Martha Anaya, 27;\u00a0and Jarrae Estepp, 21 \u2014\u00a0the women he was convicted last week of killing. Gordon told jurors he had to fire his public defender because she would not let him plead guilty and he wanted to speed the case along. He also said he had to take the case to trial because defendants representing themselves cannot plead guilty in capital cases under the law. Prosecutor Larry Yellin told jurors to think of the terror Gordon and his co-defendant Franc Cano, who is expected to be tried next year, inflicted on the victims. Yellin described the men \u2014\u00a0who had been registered sex offenders wearing ankle monitors during the period of the killings \u2014\u00a0as \"two incredibly sadistic, cruel, vile people\u201d brought together by \u201cthe strangest and wrongest happenstance.\"\u00a0 During his trial, Gordon raged against his former parole and probation agents, saying that if they had watched him properly they would not have allowed him to associate with Cano and the victims would be alive. Gordon also railed against Cano, calling him \"that little bastard\" and blaming him for certain acts of violence. He said Cano had bitten Estepp and stomped on her neck to ensure she was dead. Estepp's body was found at an Anaheim recycling plant in March 2014. The other victims' bodies have never been found. Jurors deliberated for about a day before deciding Gordon should be executed.

But CBS News has also noticed a hacking attack that could be a future means to the U.S. Last weekend, parts of the Ukrainian capitol Kiev went dark. It appears Russia has figured out how to crash a power grid with a click.\u00a0 Last December, a similar attack occurred when nearly a quarter of a million people lost power in the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Ukraine when it was targeted by a suspected Russian attack. \u00a0 Vasyl Pemchuk is the electric control center manager, and said that when hackers took over their computers, all his workers could do was film it with their cell phones. \u201cIt was illogical and chaotic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like something in a Hollywood movie.\u201d Vasyl Pemchuk in the control center that was hacked CBS News The hackers sent emails with infected attachments to power company employees, stealing their login credentials and then taking control of the grid\u2019s systems to cut the circuit breakers at nearly 60 substations. The suspected motive for the attack is the war in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are fighting against Ukrainian government forces.

In Ukraine, they restarted the power in just hours. But an attack in the U.S. could leave people without electricity for days, or even weeks, according to experts.

He made sure to have a private area to play, a guest to sit with him, a dealer who spoke Mandarin Chinese and an automatic card shuffler during baccarat games at the Borgata in Atlantic City , for instance, officials say. On the surface, it appeared that his superstitions paid off, lady luck paid him a visit often. But a civil complaint from Borgata alleges his good fortune was nothing more than an elaborate card trick -- a complex scheme involving secret commands in Chinese and \"edge sorting\" cards to gain the upper hand on the house. The complaint lays out in breathtaking detail the way Ivey and his alleged accomplice, Cheng Yin Sun allegedly hoodwinked the casino over the course of several trips there using a card-marking technique that leaves no trace. The technique allegedly exploited the asymmetry of the pattern on the back of the cards so that the players would know if the first card dealt in each game was important, increasing their chances from a 1 percent house advantage to an almost 7 percent advantage in their favor. In the wake of the alleged scheme, New Jersey federal Judge Noah Hillman ruled in favor of Borgata, saying the casino is entitled to more than $10 million after Ivey purportedly won that amount playing baccarat and craps there. According to the complaint, filed in 2014, on several occasions, Ivey and Sun \"played Baccarat with cards that had been manipulated and 'marked' so that their value was identifiable to Ivey and Sun before bets had to be placed and before the cards were dealt.\" \"Because of Ivey and Sun\u2019s misconduct, unfair play and the use of their influence as 'high rollers' to deceive Borgata, Ivey and Sun succeeded in manipulating the Baccarat game to deprive the game of its essential element of chance,\" the complaint alleges. To do this, \"Sun would identify minute asymmetries on the repeating diamond pattern on the backs of the playing cards to identify certain cards' values, and would have the dealer turn those strategically important cards so that they could be distinguished from all other cards in the deck,\" Hillman wrote in his opinion. \"Ivey and Sun would then be able to see the leading edge of the first card in the shoe before it was dealt, giving them 'first card knowledge,' and Ivey would bet accordingly.\" Ivey and Sun allegedly requested several accommodations from the casino \"to make the edge sorting scheme work\" including a private area in which to play, a dealer who spoke Mandarin Chinese, as well as \"(3) a guest (defendant Sun) to sit with him at the table while he played; (4) one 8-deck shoe of purple Gemaco Borgata playing cards to be used for the entirety of each session of play; and (5) an automatic card shuffling device to be used to shuffle the cards after each shoe was dealt, which retained the orientation of each card that Sun requested to be turned,\" Hillman wrote. According to the complaint, Ivey first contacted Borgata in April 2012 about visiting to play baccarat, and \"because of his notoriety as a high-stakes gambler, and the amount of money he intended to gamble, Ivey was able to negotiate special arrangements.\" At Ivey's request -- under the pretext he was superstitious -- he was granted the accommodations he requested, the complaint said. Ivey first played in April 2012, accompanied by Sun. The complaint said Sun spoke to the dealer in Mandarin Chinese and alleged \"Sun gave instructions to the dealer on how to flip over and lay the cards out on the table.\" \"It is not uncommon for Baccarat players to make special requests for how the cards are dealt based on individual superstitions,\" the complaint said, adding, \"Borgata accommodated Sun\u2019s request for how cards were to be dealt.\" \"At no time did Sun or Ivey disclose the true purpose behind Sun\u2019s request for how the cards were to be dealt.\" Ivey purportedly won $2,416,000 on the April trip, the complaint said. In May 2012, Ivey made a second trip to the casino and \"requested the same arrangements as his first trip,\" the complaint said, and, \"Sun again spoke to the dealer in Mandarin Chinese, giving him instructions on how to turn the cards as they were dealt.\" During the May 2012 trip Ivey purportedly won $1,597,400, the complaint said. In July 2012, Ivey made a third trip to the casino with the same arrangements and again played with Sun at the table, the complaint said. During the July 2012 trip, Ivey purportedly won $4,787,700. In October 2012, Ivey made a fourth trip to Borgata to play Baccarat with \"the same arrangements,\" the complaint said. He arrived at Borgata around Oct. 5, 2012, but didn't play baccarat until after Sun arrived the next day. This trip, he purportedly won $824,900, according to the complaint, which alleged \"Ivey intentionally lost a portion of his winnings.\" According to the complaint, edge sorting exploits \"manufacturing defects\" in the cards where the pattern on one of the long edges is slightly different than on the other. The dealer could then flip the card so that it was clear, the next time the card was used, if it was important or not. \"It is not uncommon for Baccarat players to make special requests for how the cards are dealt based on individual superstitions,\" the complaint says. \"The dealer would first lift the card so that Sun could see its value before it was flipped over all the way and placed on the table,\" the complaint said. Sun would then either tell the dealer the Mandarin word for \"good card,\" or \"bad card,\" the complaint said. \"By telling the dealer 'good card' or 'bad card' in Mandarin, the dealer would place the cards on the table so that when the cards were cleared and put in the used card holder, the leading edges of the strategically important cards could be distinguished from the leading edges of the other cards in the deck,\" according to the complaint. The complaint said Ivey and Sun also requested an automatic card shuffler to keep the edges of the cards facing the same direction. \"Once the 'edge sorting' was completed, Ivey and Sun were able to see the leading edge of the first card in the shoe before it was dealt, giving them 'first card knowledge,'\" the complaint said. In October 2016, the court ruled that Ivey and Sun breached their contract \"when they knowingly engaged in a scheme to create a set of marked cards and then used those marked cards to place bets based on the markings,\" Hillman wrote in his opinion. On Dec. 15, Hillman ordered that Ivey and Sun return the $9,626,000 Ivey won from Baccarat and the $504,000 he won from Craps after Baccarat. Ivey's attorney, Ed Jacobs, told ABC News that the judge found that Ivey \"committed absolutely no fraud and followed every single rule of the game of Baccarat. Nonetheless, the judge disapproved of his gambling technique.\" \"This was simply a skilled patron of the casino combining his intellect, his visual acuity and his skills to beat the casino at his own game,\" Jacobs said. \"He did absolutely nothing wrong, he never touched the cards,\" Jacobs said, adding that it's \"therefore impossible that he could have marked the cards. ... He was simply able to out-think and out-strategize the casino.\" Jacobs said they are appealing. \"This case is not over,\" he said. \"That's round one, we will be back.\" The Borgata did not immediately provide a response to ABC News' request for comment. Editor\u2019s note: This story was amended after publication to clarify that the court documents cited were part of a civil complaint filed by Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "460 Million Chinese Residents Suffering From 'Airpocalypse' By JULIA JACOBO Dec 21, 2016, 4:43 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Beijing Smog Clogs ABC News' Air Filter 0 Shares Email Severe smog in northern China today has caused schools to close and hundreds of flights to be canceled, according to reports. The \"airpocalypse\" is affecting 460 million people, with an estimated 200 million people living in areas experiencing hazardous levels of smog \u2014 10 times above guidelines set by the World Health Organization , according to Greenpeace East Asia. Beijing and 21 other Chinese cities are currently on red alert, the highest level in China's four-tier pollution warning system, according to China's Ministry of Environmental Protection . Hundreds of flights out of Beijing Capital International Airport were canceled, according to state media. AFP/Getty Images The cities experiencing the most severe pollution are in the county's largest steel or coal industry clusters, which have seen a major uptick in production recently, Greenpeace said. Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images An elderly man walks in front of a group of people during heavy smog at a the Temple of Heaven park in Beijing, Dec. 20, 2016. Handan, a steel production city in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, recorded an average air quality index of 780 on Monday, surpassing the official scale of 0 to 500, according to Greenpeace. The AQI for Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei, exceeded 700 as well. The Ministry of Environmental Protection has identified factories across the region that may have violated warnings to reduce or halt operations.

Greenpeace posted a photo of students in the city of Linzhou in Henan province taking exams outdoors in the haze. Wow: in China, exams don't stop, even during an #airpocalypse https://t.co/7rMIY0r3aL pic.twitter.com/WOkwvx4Wun \u2014 Greenpeace East Asia (@GreenpeaceEAsia) December 21, 2016 Officials are investigating whether local governments have taken appropriate measures to address heavy pollution, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said Friday. At least 687 Chinese officials have already been held accountable for their \"poor environmental protection records,\" the ministry said. China's air pollution , among the worst in the world, can largely be blamed on its reliance of coal for energy and factory production and a surplus of old cars on the road, according to AP. Beijing and other cities have switched power plants from coal to natural gas \u2014 as well as adding fleets of electric buses and taxis \u2014 in an effort to improve air quality, AP reported.

The palace said the pair had been planning to travel by train to the queen's country estate Wednesday but have postponed the trip. The royal family traditionally spends Christmas at Sandringham, the queen's private estate in the Norfolk countryside 110 miles (175 kilometers) north of London. They usually attend a church service on Christmas morning and then have lunch at the estate. The palace did not say when they will be well enough to travel. The queen turned 90 this year and Philip is 95. They have maintained a busy schedule despite their advancing years, although Elizabeth has announced she will cut back next year. 0 Shares ",
