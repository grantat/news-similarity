SUSPECT IN MURDER OF ACTRESS, YOGA TEACHER CHARGED IN 6 OTHER CRIMES IN 2016 Gary Love, of Wadsworth, Ohio, was held without bond.\u00a0Iredell County Sheriff Darren Campbell told local media the mother and daughter were violently assaulted in what he called a \"demonic\" crime. Deputies found the woman dead Monday morning after her daughter texted the friend for help.\u00a0The daughter told deputies she had been tied up since Christmas Eve. EX-STUDENT WHO FATHERED SON WITH TEACHER KILLED BOTH, POLICE SAY The friend told WSOC the kidnapped teen texted her \"to call 911, me and my mom need help fast.\" She was treated at a local hospital and is staying with relatives.\u00a0Authorities were awaiting autopsy results to determine how the mother died. Love, 47, told officers who came to check on the two that they were at a funeral, before he ran out the back door. He was arrested soon afterward. It's unclear if he has an attorney. Media outlets are not identifying the woman and daugher, as investigators say they expect to add sexual abuse charges. Love had been in North Carolina for several months, Campbell said. The suspect and the woman knew each other years ago when they lived in New York, according to a sheriff's office release. Local media outlets reported Love was wanted in Ohio for domestic violence and had a protection order against him. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Chief Warrant Officer 5 Glen Webb says names of the victims are being withheld until their relatives are notified. The helicopter was based at nearby Ellington Field. Witnesses said the aircraft broke apart in the air late Wednesday afternoon. Debris and a small oil slick were on the bay. A piece of the chopper's blade was found on land near the crash site. Divers were working into the night to retrieve the victims. The wheels of the helicopter poked above the water's surface about 25 yards from shore near a vacant cruise ship terminal. 0 Shares ",

By Carol Morello and Ruth Eglash December 28 at 4:56 PM Follow @CMorelloWP Follow @reglash Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Wednesday harshly criticized Israeli settlements in the West Bank, saying their growth threatens to destroy the viability of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that the United States was obliged to allow passage of a U.N. resolution condemning the activity in order to preserve the possibility of peace. Kerry noted that the number of Israelis living in settlements has grown significantly and that their outposts are extending farther into the West Bank \u2014 \u201cin the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state.\u201d \u201cNo one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of what the settlements pose to that peace,\u201d he said. Kerry, in the hour-long speech delivered at the State Department, also condemned Palestinian incitement to violence as a barrier to direct negotiations. But his focus was on defending the Obama administration\u2019s policies and highlighting Israel\u2019s actions at a moment of high tension between the two governments, following the passage of the U.N. resolution. [ Read the transcript of Kerry\u2019s speech ] (Reuters) \u201cRegrettably, some seem to believe that the U.S. friendship means the U.S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles \u2014 even after urging again and again that the policy must change,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect.\u201d He said the vote at the United Nations was about \u201cIsrael\u2019s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That\u2019s what we are trying to preserve, for our sake and for theirs.\u201d Saying the two-state solution was in \u201cserious jeopardy,\u201d Kerry said Israel would never improve its relations with Arab countries if it precludes the possibility of a separate state for Palestinians. \u201cIf the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot be both.\u201d Some Israeli politicians applauded Kerry\u2019s speech. Former prime minister Ehud Barak tweeted that it was a \u201cPowerful, lucid speech. World & majority in Israel think the same.\u201d But most Israeli leaders and the political right immediately took umbrage, accusing Kerry of trying to dictate policy to an elected government. \u00adIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the speech \u201ca big disappointment.\u201d (Reuters) \u201cHe deals obsessively with the settlements, he fails to deal with the Palestinian failure to recognize a Jewish state,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cIf he put the same emphasis on Palestinian incitement and terror that he did on settlements then maybe we will be on the way to peace.\u201d Kerry acknowledged that his vision is not shared by President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cPresident Obama and I know that the incoming administration has signaled that they may take a different path, and even suggested breaking from the long-standing U.S. policies on settlements, Jerusalem \u2014 and possibly the two-state solution,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThat is for them to decide \u2014 that\u2019s how we work. But we cannot, in good conscience, do nothing, and say nothing, when we see the hope of peace slipping away. This is a time to stand up for what is right.\u201d Trump has said that he will move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a move freighted with political significance in advance of any settlement, and his nominee to be ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, has said Jewish settlements in the West Bank are legal. [ Trump picks a supporter of West Bank settlements for ambassador to Israel ] About two hours before Kerry started speaking, Trump tweeted his criticism of the Obama administration: \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but . . . not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d Netanyahu, in turn, promptly tweeted his gratitude: \u201cPresident-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel!\u201d Although he did not mention Netanyahu by name, Kerry addressed head-on the Israeli leader\u2019s assertions that the United States had \u201ccolluded\u201d in and \u201corchestrated\u201d last week\u2019s U.N. resolution affirming that settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has \u201cno legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution.\u201d Kerry denied that the United States drafted or promoted the resolution. But he acknowledged that the United States took part in preliminary discussions, as is routine. Kerry said the diplomats told other Security Council members they would oppose a resolution that did not condemn Palestinian incitement to violence. They also said if the text were more \u201cbalanced,\u201d it was \u201cpossible\u201d the United States would not block it. Kerry called the current Israeli governing coalition the most right-wing in country\u2019s history and said it is driven by an extremist settler agenda inimical to a two-state agreement. \u201cThe result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as \u2018more committed to settlements than any in Israel\u2019s history,\u2019 are leading in the opposite direction,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThey\u2019re leading towards one state.\u201d \u201cThe vote in the United Nations was about preserving the two-state solution,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were standing up for.\u201d Kerry offered six principles that he said would satisfy Israeli security needs and Palestinian aspirations for a homeland. Most have been proven sticking points in previous negotiations \u2014 among them, Jerusalem as a mutual capital for two states; normalized relations with Arab states in the region; and financial compensation for Palestinian refugees, along with acknowledgment of their suffering. Kerry returned from vacation to give his speech, which was being worked on until a few minutes before he walked on stage in the Dean Acheson Auditorium. It was a sign that the administration was still struggling to deal with the political firestorm ignited by the resolution vote. The outrage in the Israeli government has been matched among some members of Congress. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Kerry\u2019s speech \u201cat best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration.\u201d The U.S. abstention has been condemned by several Democrats as well, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who is the party\u2019s incoming leader. But for Kerry it was a speech that captured the pent-up frustration that has grown in the two years since his nine-month effort to broker a peace agreement collapsed, and his attempts to tamp down Palestinian violence came to nothing. And Kerry, famous for always sounding a hopeful note, was clearly pessimistic about whether his words would make any difference. \u201cWe can only encourage them to take this path,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot walk down it for them.\u201d Eglash reported from Jerusalem.

    "text": "Email On the road to Raqqa A Kurdish-Arab force is closing in on the Islamic State\u2019s capital in Syria, but there is still no plan to seize it. Photos by Alice Martins Published on December 28, 2016 TAL SAMAN, Syria \u2014 \u201cRaqqa we are coming\u201d say the words spray-painted in Kurdish at the entrance to this empty little town, which lies on the front line of a U.S.-backed advance toward the Islamic State\u2019s capital. The city of Raqqa is 17 miles away, a tantalizingly short hop to the place showcased in the militants\u2019 propaganda videos as an Islamist utopia, where the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels were planned and where, U.S. officials warn, new plots against the West are being forged. Above: Civilians fleeing fighting between the Syrian Democratic Forces and Islamic State militants in the countryside of Syria\u2019s Raqqa province wait at a screening center in Ain Issa. But a full offensive to retake the city could still be months or more away, despite hopes in Washington that an operation to take the Islamic State\u2019s most symbolically significant stronghold would be well underway before President Obama left office. A rare visit to the Raqqa front line illustrated how near and yet far off the defeat of the Islamic State may be. The battle for Mosul in neighboring Iraq has stalled, the attack in Berlin has brought home the continued threat of terrorism, and there is still no plan for an offensive on Raqqa, making the war one of the most immediate, and complicated, challenges the Trump administration will have to confront. Meanwhile, a preliminary operation to isolate and besiege Raqqa is going well. Over the past month, a Kurdish-Arab alliance called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has been slicing briskly through Islamic State lines in the northern and western countryside of Raqqa province. The fighters have captured some 140 villages and nearly 800 square miles of mostly empty rural land on two fronts in a just over a month, encountering little resistance along the way. Graffiti in Tal Saman, Syria, reads \u2018\u2018YPG\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Raqqa we are coming.\u2019\u2019 This is not the battle for Mosul, where large armored formations are converging from different directions. There are more sheep than soldiers scattered across the empty fields. Flocks trot through the landscape herded by boys on donkeys as the lightly armored pickup trucks and SUVs used by the Kurdish and Arab militias weave among them. Every now and then, American soldiers hurtle past, a reminder that the U.S. military is very much invested in the Raqqa front, however remote it may be. There are around 600 Special Operations troops embedded with the SDF in northeastern Syria, a number that could rise before the battle fully takes shape, U.S. officials say. One of those troops was killed on Nov.\u00a024, the first U.S. casualty of the war in Syria. He died in Tal Saman, a victim of one of the mines and booby traps that have become the Islamic State\u2019s hallmark defense against advancing foes in Iraq and Syria. Otherwise, the militants have put up little resistance, firing mortars as the soldiers advance but retreating well before their enemies arrive. Bigger obstacles loom, however, in the form of a geopolitical tangle that could prove more daunting than any defenses mounted by the Islamic State. At the heart of the issue is the U.S. military\u2019s policy of sending arms to the area controlled by the main Syrian Kurdish militia, the People\u2019s Protection Units, widely known as the YPG. A building in Hisha, recently recaptured from Islamic State control, serves as a military base for fighters with the Syrian Democratic Forces. The decision has paid off so far. The YPG \u2014 which constitutes the Kurdish component of the SDF \u2014 has proved to be the United States\u2019 most effective military ally in Syria, and it has retaken vast swaths of territory. It is also expanding deep into Arab areas as it presses forward against the militants, raising questions among observers about the long-term sustainability of the gains. The cooperation has, moreover, provoked the ire of Turkey, because of the YPG\u2019s long-standing ties to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara and Washington. Turkey is waging its own offensive against the Islamic State in nearby Aleppo province but has hinted it may soon turn on the SDF alliance and perhaps then make its own push for the Islamic State capital. \u201cWe have proved that we are the most effective fighters.\u201d \u2014Rojda Felat, YPG commander The Syrian government also opposes the Kurdish expansion and has repeatedly said it plans to retake Raqqa, which it lost control of in 2013. Syria is backed by Russia, which is forging a new alliance with Turkey over Syria, potentially setting the stage for a global clash over who wins the prize goal. To ameliorate the concerns of NATO ally Turkey, the U.S. military says it is giving arms only to Arab fighters within the umbrella SDF, formed last year to serve as a vehicle for the delivery of military aid. There are 13,000 Arabs now serving with the SDF, alongside 45,000 Kurds with the YPG, according to a U.S. military spokesman, Col. John Dorrian. Rojda Felat, a YPG commander, speaks on the radio at the entrance of Tal Saman shortly after the village was captured. But there seems to be little doubt that the YPG is leading the fight. Its flags flutter over the checkpoints along the newly liberated rural roads and at the military bases closest to the front lines. Its graffiti is scrawled over the walls of the captured towns and villages, as in Tal Saman, where the initials \u201cYPG\u201d were spray-painted\u00a0alongside the pledge to take Raqqa. The Kurdish-Arab alliance, with U.S. assistance, plans to recruit and train an additional 10,000 Arab fighters for an offensive on Raqqa, said Rojda Felat, one of the commanders of the offensive to encircle the city. But YPG participation will be essential \u201cbecause we have proved that we are the most effective fighters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will even go past Raqqa,\u201d she added, to other areas farther south controlled by the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Whether it is wise to send an overwhelmingly Kurdish force to capture the overwhelmingly Arab city of Raqqa is in question, however. A Kurdish push on Raqqa risks alienating the local population, perhaps encouraging residents who otherwise would not support the Islamic State to fight on its behalf, according to Abu Issa, a commander with the rebel Free Syrian Army\u2019s Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa, or Raqqa Revolutionaries Brigade. \u201cWe saw in Iraq and other places that if the local people are not involved in the liberation, there won\u2019t be any stability,\u201d he said in an interview at his headquarters, in a remote farmhouse in the countryside of Raqqa province. He and his group are from Raqqa, and though they are loosely allied with the SDF, they fly the flag of the Free Syrian Army. \u201cAll the Arabs know that the SDF are YPG, and if things continue as they are, there will be big problems in the future, sectarian clashes and conflict,\u201d Abu Issa said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand why the YPG are going to Raqqa. It\u2019s an entirely Arab area, and the Arabs feel marginalized.\u201d Assad regime ",

Trump takes credit for Sprint, start-up decisions Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 1:08 a.m. EST December 29, 2016 x Share Donald Trump is touting plans by a Japanese mogul to bring 8,000 jobs to the United States while speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort. AP Donald Trump speaks in Iowa in November. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014 President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said telecommunications giant Sprint is moving 5,000 offshore jobs back to the United States and OneWeb, a satellite Internet start-up, is adding 3,000 more jobs in the U.S. The jobs were made possible, Trump said, through Softbank CEO\u00a0Masayoshi Son, a Japanese billionaire and technology investor, who met with Trump in New York earlier this month. After that meeting, the two businessmen announced Softbank would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs. Trump: SoftBank to add $50B, 50K jobs in U.S. Softbank owns 80% of Sprint and this month it invested $1 billion in OneWeb, a venture that intends to offer affordable Internet access. Son called the investment a \"first step\" in his commitment to Trump. \"Because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope, I was just called by the head people at Sprint and they're going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States and taking them from other countries,\" Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. \"They're bringing them back to the United States and Masa and some other people were very much involved in that so I want to thank them,\" Trump said. \"And OneWeb, a new company, is going to be hiring 3,000 people and that's very exciting.\" It is unclear where the 8,000 jobs will be based and if they are part of Softbank's 50,000 jobs plan. In his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to create or bring back jobs to the U.S. Earlier this month, he announced a controversial deal to keep furnace manufacturer Carrier from outsourcing about 1,100 jobs to Mexico. Carrier will get $7 million in state tax incentives to keep the jobs in Indiana. Son, who became a billionaire through investments in Japan and China, is in the midst of raising a $100 billion investment fund with\u00a0Saudi Arabia\u00a0and others.

Construction continues at the site of the new Apple store at Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River on Dec. 2, 2016, in Chicago. The store is scheduled to open in October. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Ally Marotti Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune It turns out the new Apple store going up on North Michigan Avenue along the Chicago River is going to cost far less than the company initially reported. A building permit submitted to the city at the end of October put the price of the glass-enclosed store at $62 million, not including permit fees. About a week later, Apple submitted a revision to the construction costs. The new price tag: $26.9 million. The numbers in building permits are self-reported by the companies that file the paperwork, a spokeswoman from the city said. The new store is being constructed along the southern border of Pioneer Court at 401 N. Michigan, with its entrance overlooking the riverwalk. The store is expected to help extend the Magnificent Mile's retail stretch farther south. Landlords are watching the effect it will have on surrounding retail rents. Apple will relocate to the site from its current post at 679 N. Michigan. The new store is scheduled to open in October. Zeller Realty Group, owner of the property, first unveiled plans for the new store in November 2015. Now the building is well underway, its frame starting to climb higher than the temporary black fence surrounding it. amarotti@chicagotribune.com Twitter @AllyMarotti Photos: Renderings for a new Apple store in Chicago's Pioneer Court over the riverwalk near the building at 401 N.

Trump, who takes office January 20, said the other 3,000 jobs will be hires from a new company called One Web. Trump was elected in part on the promise to return to the United States jobs that American companies had moved overseas, in search of cheaper labor costs. Last month, he announced that Carrier would keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, after months of criticizing the air-conditioning corporation on the campaign trail for plans to move the jobs to Mexico. Trump spoke Wednesday from his Mar a Largo estate in Palm Beach, Florida. The wealthy businessman-turned politician also said he had a \u201cnice\u201d and \u201cgeneral\u201d conversation earlier in the day with outgoing President Obama. Trump opposed the Obama administration\u2019s move last week to allow the United Nations to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building more settlements in the disputed West Bank. He said Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s speech earlier Wednesday defending the administration\u2019s U.N. decision \u201cspoke for itself.\u201d Trump, who in recent days has been especially critical of the U.N., also said that the international body \u201chas tremendous potential but is not living up to itself.\u201d Trump added he had help on the jobs deals from several people including Massayoshi Son, the chief executive officer for SoftBank of Japan, which owns Sprint. Trump has had previous business dealings with Son, whom he described on Wednesday as a \u201cterrific guy.\u201d \u00a0 ",

By Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis December 28 at 5:00 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @brady_dennis Aerial view of Gravel Canyon and Jacobs Chair in the west part of Bears Ears National Monument. (Robert Fillmore) President Obama on Wednesday created new national monuments in a sacred tribal site in southeastern Utah and in a swath of Nevada desert, after years of political fights over the fate of the areas. The designations further cement Obama\u2019s environmental legacy as one of the most consequential \u2014 and contentious \u2014 in presidential history. He has invoked his executive power to create national monuments 29 times during his tenure, establishing or expanding protections for more than 553 million acres of federal lands and waters. Environmental groups have praised the conservation efforts, but critics say they amount to a federal land grab. Some worry that the new designations could fuel another armed protest by antigovernment forces inspired by the Cliven Bundy family, such as the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon this year. Obama\u2019s newest designations include two sprawling Western landscapes that are under threat, yet also where local residents are deeply divided on how the land should be used. [ Even from jail, the Bundys\u2019 defiance still echoes in the Nevada desert ] Jose Witt, Southern Nevada director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, points out petroglyphs while leading a hike this fall in Gold Butte. The area is now one of the newest national monuments. (Ronda Churchill/for The Washington Post) In Utah, where the federal government owns about two-thirds of the land, the designation of another 1.35\u00a0million acres to create the Bears Ears National Monument undoubtedly will prove polarizing. For the first time, Native American tribes will offer management input for a national monument through an inter-tribal commission. Five tribes that often have been at odds \u2014 the Hopi, Navajo, Uintah and Ouray Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and Pueblo of Zuni \u2014 will together have responsibility for protecting an area that contains well-preserved remnants of ancestral Pueblo sites dating back more than 3,500 years. \u201cWe have always looked to Bears Ears as a place of refuge, as a place where we can gather herbs and medicinal plants, and a place of prayer and sacredness,\u201d Russell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, said in a call with reporters Wednesday. \u201cThese places \u2014 the rocks, the wind, the land \u2014 they are living, breathing things that deserve timely and lasting protection.\u201d While many environmentalists and archaeologists supported the monument, most Utah politicians opposed the site\u2019s unilateral protection. Instead, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and a fellow Utah Republican, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, devoted three years to drafting a land-use bill that would have protected a large portion of the site but would have allowed some development. The bill stalled in the House. In a statement Wednesday, Chaffetz said he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the designation, saying Obama\u2019s decision \u201cpoliticizes a long-simmering conflict.\u201d \u201cThe midnight move is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes,\u201d he said, vowing to work with the Trump administration to try to repeal the decision. \u201cIt does not have the support of the Governor, a single member of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, nor any local elected officials or state legislators who represent the area.\u201d Meanwhile, the Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada has been a site of contention for more than 15 years. As Las Vegas sought to expand, local, state and federal managers agreed to protect species such as the imperiled desert tortoise in Gold Butte. But they did little for either the animals or the actual sagebrush steppe and Mojave Desert in the approximately 300,000-acre area marked by fossilized sand dunes and panels of petroglyphs that tower over the landscape. Although all the legal grazing permits in the area northeast of Las Vegas were sold more than a decade ago as part of a deal with environmental groups and county officials, a single family \u2014 headed by cattle rancher Cliven Bundy \u2014 refused to recognize federal officials\u2019 authority over the government land. The Bundys engaged in an armed standoff with Bureau of Land Management officials in 2014; several still await trial for the confrontation. Their followers occupied the Malheur refuge in January. In a statement, Obama said Wednesday\u2019s designations \u201cprotect some of our country\u2019s most important cultural treasures, including abundant rock art, archaeological sites, and lands considered sacred by Native American tribes. Today\u2019s actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes.\u201d [ In Bears Ears, several tribes\u2019 and Mormons\u2019 origin stories collide ] Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who has put more than 5 million acres of federal land in his home state off-limits to development, pressed relentlessly for Obama to invoke his executive authority on behalf of Gold Butte. Reid intensified his campaign when the Bundys were jailed this year for a takeover at the Oregon wildlife refuge, arguing that any pushback would be minimized while they were incarcerated. \u201cGold Butte is a fascinating place full of natural wonders,\u201d Reid said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cProtecting Gold Butte ensures that generations of people will continue to have the opportunity to experience Nevada\u2019s natural beauty. We\u2019ve done something lasting and historic today.\u201d Obama on Wednesday created both sites using his authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act, which gives the president power to designate national monuments without approval from Congress. But Republicans have raised the prospect of curtailing the law when they control both the executive and legislative branches next year. How their effort fares could determine not only what safeguards persist for the landscape, rock carvings and other archaeological sites in Bears Ears and Gold Butte, but also what power future presidents can wield over the nation\u2019s most ecologically and historically significant federal holdings. Kristen Brengel, vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in an interview that she and others \u201cjust hope the American public rejects\u201d efforts to curtail the act. Both Bishop and the congressman Donald Trump has tapped to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), support changes. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful law that allows the president to make quick decisions to protect areas when they need it,\u201d Brengel said. \u201cWhy would we want to destroy that?\u201d BLM officials have documented acts of vandalism and looting in Bears Ears, but Bishop said he does not view it as being \u201cin imminent danger.\u201d He met on Dec.\u00a05 with members of Trump\u2019s transition team to discuss whether the next administration would consider overturning any designation Obama made in the area. [ Obama creates what could be the last large national park site on the East Coast, in Maine ] The Antiquities Act \u201cdoes not prohibit a president from abolishing or modifying the terms of a previously declared monument which has not been ratified by Congress,\u201d Bishop said in a statement after the meeting. In a few instances, presidents have modified the size of monuments established by their predecessors: Woodrow Wilson slashed nearly half the acreage of Mount Olympus National Monument, which Theodore Roosevelt had established. But in 1938, the U.S. attorney general wrote a formal opinion saying the Antiquities Act authorized a president to establish a monument but did not grant a president the right to abolish one. According to John Leshy, a former Interior solicitor general who now teaches at the University of California Hastings College of Law, neither the unilateral modification nor abolishment of a national monument \u201chas been tested in court.\u201d Congress, though, can potentially do both of those things. \u201cWe do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo this,\u201d Christy Goldfuss, managing director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said Wednesday. Only Franklin D. Roosevelt has used the Antiquities Act more than Obama. And the president is likely to either match Roosevelt\u2019s record with a 30th designation, according to several individuals briefed on the White House\u2019s plans, or possibly to exceed it by doing two more before leaving office Jan.\u00a020. Administration officials are eyeing an expansion of the California Coastal National Monument and Oregon\u2019s Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument as well as the establishment of one monument in South Carolina and two in Alabama to commemorate the Reconstruction and civil rights eras, respectively. [ Obama designates the first-ever marine monument off the East Coast, in New England ] Yet given Republicans\u2019 presidential and congressional victories last month, several proposals are likely to remain unrealized. Some activists are disappointed that Obama may not designate the Greater Grand Canyon Heritage National Monument, which would stretch more than a million acres and protect the area from new uranium mining. The monument has been supported by Native American tribes and, according to polling, a majority of Arizonans. But the state\u2019s two GOP senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have opposed it, in part because of concerns it would prevent public access and complicate forest-thinning efforts necessary to prevent wildfire hazards. Rep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva (Ariz.), the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee and supporter of the Grand Canyon designation, noted that Congress has considered more than a dozen pieces of legislation aimed at curtailing, restricting or eliminating the president\u2019s authority under the Antiquities Act. Until now, the threat of an Obama veto effectively blocked those efforts. That won\u2019t be the case going forward. \u201cThat battle will come. I don\u2019t see it going away,\u201d Grijalva said. And it will set up a key question for Trump: \u201cHow willing is this new president to give up power?\u201d ",

Abbas Farajpour was quoted as saying by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency. Tasnim, which is close to Iran's military, said the aircraft included U.S. fighter jets and drones. Calls to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain , rang unanswered Wednesday. In recent months, the 5th Fleet has complained about interactions with Iran's military at sea and in the air. Iranian air defense units began an exercise involving 17,000 personnel stationed over 190,000 square miles in southern Iran on Monday. Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency said troops taking part in the drill test-fired a long-range S-200 surface-to-air missile, destroying a drone. 0 Shares ",

Burke Ramsey, facing the camera, hugs his father, John Ramsey, at a funeral for Patsy Ramsey on June 29, 2006. (Ric Feld / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The older brother of JonBenet Ramsey is suing CBS and others for $750 million, saying his reputation was ruined after a television series that concluded he killed his 6-year-old sister two decades ago. In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Burke Ramsey claims that the network, its production company and the experts interviewed in the series on the unsolved murder conspired to defame him for publicity and profit. The series, called \"The Case of JonBenet Ramsey,\" aired in September ahead of the 20th anniversary of JonBenet's death. The beauty pageant star was found dead in the basement of her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, the day after Christmas in 1996. A prosecutor cleared her parents and brother in 2008 based on DNA evidence. But the district attorney currently overseeing the case has said it was premature to exonerate the Ramseys and ordered additional tests using new DNA testing technology that authorities hope will further the investigation. Police have collected and studied thousands of pieces of evidence and say the case remains open. CBS spokesman Dustin Smith declined to comment on the lawsuit, which is the second Burke Ramsey has filed over the television series. In October, Ramsey, 29, sued a forensic pathologist featured on the show who said he bludgeoned his sister to death. The pathologist is also named in the latest lawsuit, which was filed in Michigan, where Burke Ramsey lives. The new lawsuit says CBS and its featured experts set out to conduct a \"sham reinvestigation\" of the murder with \"the preconceived the story line\" that Ramsey killed his sister and conspired with his parents to cover it up. \"The accusation that Burke Ramsey killed his sister was based on a compilation of lies, half-truths, manufactured information, and the intentional omission and avoidance of truthful information about the murder of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey,\" the lawsuit says.

The Chicago skyline looms as a Metra train pulls into the Berwyn Metra station in Berwyn on Sept. 1, 2016. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Mary Wisniewski Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The year 2017 will see some changes in getting around the Chicago area by road and rail \u2014 higher Metra fares along with renovations that can cut delays; a completed Jane Addams Tollway but continued work on several highway interchanges and intersections like Western and Belmont avenues; and new laws intended to improve road safety. Public transit To start with, the commuter rail service Metra is increasing fares for the third time in three years, starting Feb. 1. Fares for its 150,000 daily commuters will increase by an average of 5.8 percent, or $11.75 for monthly passes and $2.75 for 10-ride passes. Metra Union Pacific North riders this spring will see the next phase of a project to replace bridges on Chicago's North Side, from Grace Street to Balmoral Avenue. As part of this two-year $30 million project, the new inbound half of the Ravenswood station will be built, spokesman Michael Gillis said. Metra and Union Pacific also plan to start a $118 million project to remove two bottlenecks along the UP West Line by installing a third set of tracks in the remaining double-track segments \u2014 a 1.8-mile segment from River Forest to Melrose Park, and a 6.1-mile segment from West Chicago to Geneva. Metra also will begin the $34 million construction of a new bridge on the Milwaukee West Line over the Fox River in Elgin. The single-track bridge, originally built in 1881, will be replaced by a two-track bridge. The CTA also has a number of projects and goals for 2017, spokeswoman Tammy Chase said. The $203 million Wilson Avenue station and track reconstruction should be done by the end of next year, agency officials said. Work should be completed in the middle of the year on the $75 million Washington/Wabash station. New Wilson station Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune The CTA's Wilson station, seen March 22, 2016, has been undergoing an upgrade. The CTA's Wilson station, seen March 22, 2016, has been undergoing an upgrade. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Work will continue on the $280 million 95th Street Red Line terminal, set for completion in 2018, the agency said. The CTA also plans to begin work on the $18 million Quincy Brown Line station renovation project and the $15 million Belmont Blue Line station upgrade, while completing a $23 million renovation at the Illinois Medical District. Future projects are in the works, with the CTA planning a final project alignment for the long-discussed Red Line extension from 95th Street to 130th, as well as doing planning for the Red and Purple Line modernization north of Belmont. The CTA also plans to issue a request for proposals to buy 20 to 30 all-electric buses. Pace riders will be able to take advantage of a managed flex lane on I-90 in mid-2017, which should allow buses to move faster from Elgin to Schaumburg and Rosemont. The suburban bus service also plans two park-and-rides at Barrington Road and Route 25. On the Tollway Some good news for 2017 is that the long, painful rebuilding of the Jane Addams Tollway wrapped up at the end of December, with four lanes open in each direction. Jane Addams Tollway James C. Svehla / Chicago Tribune The new lanes of the Jane Addams Tollway (I-90) are seen in Schaumburg on Nov. 18, 2016. The new lanes of the Jane Addams Tollway (I-90) are seen in Schaumburg on Nov. 18, 2016. (James C. Svehla / Chicago Tribune) Work should be completed next year on an eastbound exit ramp at I-90 and Barrington Road, and construction will continue on the Elmhurst Road interchange. The Illinois Tollway also has partnered with Cook County for a westbound I-90 entrance ramp at Roselle Road. Work continues on installing \"smart road\" features on a 16-mile segment of I-90 between Barrington and the Kennedy Expressway. The Illinois Tollway is installing high-tech gantries over the road every half mile intended to provide drivers with information about travel times, traffic incidents and lane closures \u2014 with directional arrows to show which lane is moving faster, said Greg Bedalov, the Illinois Tollway's executive director. \"We can give real-time information to the motoring public,\" said Bedalov, who noted that the Tollway will integrate its information with navigation apps like Mapquest and Waze. On other parts of the Tollway system, the authority plans to continue I-390's march east, with the goal of reaching Route 83 by the end of the year. This is part of the Tollway's plan to provide western access to O'Hare International Airport, Bedalov said. The work will include 17 ramps and 15 bridges, with new interchanges at Prospect Avenue/Arlington Heights Road and Wood Dale Road. \"It's absolutely critical as part of the Elgin-O'Hare western access project, which has been identified as a project of regional and national significance,\" Bedalov said. The extension will not go as far this year as the Canadian Pacific tracks to the west of the airport. The railroad refused the Tollway access over the tracks, and the Tollway responded in November by suing CP before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. In other Tollway news, work should be completed next year on the new Farnsworth Avenue interchange at I-88, a $20 million project near the Aurora outlet mall. Also next year, planning and design work will ratchet up for the rebuilding of I-294 from 95th Street to Balmoral Avenue, Bedalov said. IDOT and CDOT On Illinois freeways, the rebuilding of the outbound I-55 and Lake Shore Drive interchange should be done by this summer, and the inbound will be done by the fall, said Illinois Department of Transportation spokeswoman Gianna Urgo. The project costs $134 million. Work will proceed on the Cumberland flyover at I-90; on I-90 from Cumberland Avenue to Harlem Avenue; and on the Jane Byrne Interchange project, including I-290 from Racine Avenue to the Post Office, Urgo said. In DuPage County, work on Irving Park Road at York Road should be complete next year, Urgo said. In Lake County, work on the Milburn bypass at U.S. Highway 45 and on the Union Pacific railroad bridge over Route 132 in Gurnee will start this spring. In Will County, work on the U.S. Highway 6 and I-55 interchange will finish up in 2017, while reconstruction of U.S. Highway 6 from Cedar Road to Will-Cook Road starts next fall. In Chicago, the $25.6 million Adams Street Bridge rebuilding, which has clogged up traffic going in and out of downtown, is expected to be done by the spring, as should the $23.5 million reconfiguration of the Elston, Fullerton and Damen intersection, according to Mike Claffey, spokesman for the Chicago Department of Transportation.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune Traffic on North Western Avenue in Chicago passes debris from the Belmont Avenue-Western Avenue viaduct demolition project on March 7, 2016. Traffic on North Western Avenue in Chicago passes debris from the Belmont Avenue-Western Avenue viaduct demolition project on March 7, 2016. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) The tricky $25.7 million reconfiguration of the Western/Belmont/Clybourn intersection will take a little longer and should wrap up by mid-2017, Claffey said. As some projects end, others begin. Reconstruction of the Oakwood Boulevard (39th Street) bridge over Metra and Canadian National railroad tracks is expected to start in mid-2017. Construction also will start next summer on the Riverview Bridge along the east side of the river under Addison Avenue, then crossing over to the west side of the river. It will provide bike and pedestrian access between Clark Park to the south and California Park to the north. Work also begins on the Irving Park Road Bridge, which will include a pedestrian/bike underpass on the west side of the river, connecting California Park on the south to Horner Park on the north. Speaking of bike and pedestrian projects, the next two phases of the Navy Pier flyover section of the Lakefront Trail will be completed in 2017, with sections over the Ogden Slip, DuSable Park the Chicago River. The project should be complete in 2018, Claffey said. New laws The new year also brings in new transportation laws. One law that takes effect Jan. 1 more clearly defines bicycles as vehicles on the streets of Illinois, with the same right-of-way-privileges and rights of motor vehicles. Another law requires Illinois drivers education teachers to tell student drivers how to handle themselves during a traffic stop by police. Failure to stop at a railroad crossing will cost you more. The fine will go up to $500 from $250 for a first violation and to $1,000 from $500 for a second violation. Of course, the ultimate price would be getting yourself and the others in your car killed. Jeffrey Kroll, an attorney who specializes in transportation-related injuries, said he hopes the higher railroad crossing fines will decrease crashes. But he sees distracted driving as the biggest problem on the roads right now and wants higher fines for that too. The top fine for using a hand-held mobile device while driving in Illinois is $150, which Kroll called \"nominal.\" \"If we want to avoid distracted driving, I think we want to hit motorists where it hurts most \u2014 in the pocketbook,\" he said. Finally, look for the city of Chicago to present a long-awaited, three-year \"Vision Zero\" plan to improve traffic safety, following a tough year for bike and pedestrian fatalities. Vision Zero is an international road safety project that aims for zero deaths and serious injuries from traffic crashes. Ten city departments are involved in the city's plan, including police, fire and the CTA. mwisniewski@chicagotribune.com ",

USA TODAY Sports Doug Martin (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) One season after he was named first-team All-Pro, Doug Martin was a surprise inactive Sunday. On Wednesday, clarity was found. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u00a0running back announced in a statement that he was notified last week of a four-game suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy. \"My initial instinct was to appeal the suspension and finish the season with my teammates,\" Martin said.\u00a0\"However, after numerous discussions with people close to me - including Coach (Dirk)\u00a0Koetter - I am starting the suspension immediately so I can enter a treatment facility and receive the help I truly need. \u201cOn the field, I must be strong and determined to push through both pain and injuries to become an elite NFL running back. Off the field, I have tried that same approach in my personal life. My shortcomings in this area have taught me both that I cannot win these personal battles alone and that there is no shame in asking for help.\u00a0 \u201cI sincerely apologize to the Glazer family, General Manager Jason Licht and the entire Tampa Bay organization, my teammates and our tremendous fans. This was not the season I envisioned and I have let everyone down, including myself. However, adversity yields opportunity and I ask for your support in my battle to overcome these personal issues.\u201d NFL playoff picture: Packers-Lions showdown could be play-in game Martin rushed for 1,402 yards and six touchdowns during a breakout campaign in 2015. This season has been anything but. He's averaged just 2.9 yards per carry during eight starts with only three touchdowns. \u201cDoug has been a valued member of our organization for the past five seasons and we respect and support his decision to seek help,\"Bucs GM Jason Licht said. \"Right now, he is working through issues that are much larger than the game of football. Our primary concern is that he takes this time to focus on getting the help that he needs in order to move forward with his personal and professional life.\u201d The Bucs have faint playoff hopes, but\u00a0Martin will miss\u00a0the season finale against the Carolina Panthers (he'll also be sidelined for the first three games of the 2017 season). Martin has\u00a0averaged just 2.9 yards per carry during eight starts with only three touchdowns. He\u00a0missed six games this season with a hamstring injury suffered in Week 2 after signing a five-year, $35.75 million deal during the offseason. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Argus Leader 3:55 p.m. EST December 28, 2016 The Sapienza, left, and the McDowell homes in the McKennan Park neighborhood Monday, June 27, 2016, in Sioux Falls. The McDowells, are asking a judge to force the Sapienzas to bring the home into compliance with city code. The trial was scheduled to start Tuesday, June 28. (Photo: Joe Ahlquist / Argus Leader) SIOUX FALLS,\u00a0S.D. --- The owners of a new home in McKennan Park that sparked a bitter neighborhood feud must reduce the its height and size or relocate the home to comply with historic building standards, a judge has ruled. Circuit Court Judge John Pekas ruled that the home built by Joseph and Sarah Sapienza violated historic standards for height and massing. Pekas also ruled that the city of Sioux Falls, which approved the home but failed to apply federal standards for historic districts, may also have been negligent. \u201cThe court finds that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the Sapienzas have violated historic requirements in the McKennan Park Historic District, which disrupts the character of the neighborhood and does not fit the size and space requirements under current regulations,\u201d Pekas wrote. Family sees historic district 'dream home' as nightmare Pierce and Barbara McDowell, who own the home just north of the Sapienzas\u2019 house, filed suit in 2015 after the new home was built within 7 feet of their home. The new house towered above the McDowells\u2019 home, blocking out sunlight. During construction, the McDowells learned from a fire inspector that they could no longer use a wood burning fireplace because it was within 10 feet of the Sapienza house. \u00a0Pekas ruled that the value of the McDowells\u2019 home suffered irreparable harm because it lost value and its historic context undermined by the new home.

A coalition of five Indian nations formally proposed the monument, attempting to preserve the area's archeological sites from looting and grave robbing. William Yardley Contact Reporter Further burnishing his environmental legacy, President Obama on Wednesday designated two new national monuments in rugged areas of Utah and Nevada \u2014\u00a0places that have deep cultural importance for Native Americans but that have become flashpoints in the debate over control of public land\u00a0in the West. The larger and perhaps more controversial of the two, the Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah, encompasses 1.35 million acres of desert and canyons that are ancestral lands of several Indian tribes, including the Navajo Nation, whose reservation is just to the south. Now, members of the Navajo, Hopi, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute, and Zuni tribes, all of which pushed for the designation, will serve on what the administration described as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d special commission that will advise the federal government on how to protect the area while also ensuring access so tribal members can collect traditional medicinal plants and perform tribal ceremonies.\u00a0 While both national monuments will be open for recreation, their designation means they will be better protected from development such as mining and oil and gas production. In the West, where half of the land is controlled by the federal government, many states and elected officials have long accused the government of putting up barriers to local economic development. Yet on Wednesday, Russell Begaye, the president of the Navajo Nation, invoked history older than any government, saying that the area had provided food and sanctuary to tribes for millennia. \u201cThese places \u2014 the rocks, the wind, the land \u2014 they are living, breathing things,\u201d Begaye said. (David Montero) The monument, which is directly south of Canyonlands National Park, is smaller than the 1.9 million acres the tribal groups had sought but larger than the 1.2 million acres that Utah\u2019s congressional delegation had proposed for protection under legislation that has stalled in Congress. Begaye said the tribal coalition was\u00a0elated\u00a0by the designation. \u201cThat area that we most want is fully covered by the 1.35 million,\u201d he said. Obama also designated the Gold Butte National Monument, 300,000 acres along Nevada\u2019s border with Arizona that is between Lake Mead, a crucial reservoir for the drought-stricken Colorado River, and the Grand Canyon. The administration said the\u00a0area holds important tribal sites as well as historic ranching structures and sites related to early Spanish settlements. It is near the ranch of Cliven Bundy, whose family led standoffs with the government in Nevada in 2014 and at Oregon\u2019s Malheur National Wildlife Refugue this year, protesting what it said were unfair federal land policies. The administration said Wednesday that both monument areas had been subject to\u00a0vandalism and that the designation would bring them greater protection. It also said the Gold Butte National Monument would improve \u201cclimate resilience\u201d by preserving corridors for wildlife to travel. (Nigel Duara) Obama said in a statement that the monuments would \u201cprotect some of our country\u2019s most important cultural treasures, including abundant rock art, archaeological sites, and lands considered sacred by Native American tribes\u201d and \u201censure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes.\u201d Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat and the departing minority leader, has long pushed for the Gold Butte designation.\u00a0On Wednesday, he\u00a0called Gold Butte \u201cquintessential Nevada,\u201d with landscapes \u201cunlike anything else in the world.\u201d Critics said the designations would stir further resentment among people angry about federal land\u00a0policy. About 65% of the land in Utah is owned by the federal government. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said the president\u2019s \u201cunilateral decision to invoke the Antiquities Act in Utah politicizes a long-simmering conflict\u201d and \u201cthreatens to further inflame controversies that were near resolution.\u201d Using executive power under the Antiquities Act of 1906, the president has designated more than two dozen national monuments, totaling more than 550 million acres, though the vast majority of that area is protected water. As they have with other conservation measures enacted at the end of his administration, the designations on Wednesday raised questions about whether his Republican successor, Donald Trump , may try to reverse them. Christy Goldfuss, managing director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, noted on Wednesday that no president had reversed a previous president\u2019s monument designation and that the act does not specify the authority to do so. Yet Goldfuss conceded that Congress, now under Republican control, has the power to change the law. Goldfuss noted that Bears Ears had been considered for protection since the 1930s. Despite that\u00a0history, Chaffetz called the designation a \u201cmidnight move.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with President-elect Trump to follow through on his commitment to repeal midnight regulations,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cWe will work to repeal this top-down decision and replace it with one that garners local support and creates a balanced, win-win solution.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caption Hypodermic needles and syringes washing up in Newport Beach Hypodermic needles and syringes\u00a0have been washing ashore in Newport Beach at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, an area that see a high degree of flotsam and jetsam following storms.

Debbie Reynolds, who lit up the screen in \"Singin' in the Rain\" and other Hollywood classics despite a tumultuous life, has died a day after losing her daughter, Carrie Fisher. Reynolds was 84. Her son, Todd Fisher, said Reynolds died Wednesday. \"She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,\" Fisher said from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where his mother was taken by ambulance earlier Wednesday. He said the stress of his sister's death on Tuesday \"was too much\" for Reynolds. Carrie Fisher, who was 60, had been hospitalized since Friday. SAG Awards | 2015 Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times Carrie Fisher presents her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Life Achievement Award at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Jan. 25, 2015. Carrie Fisher presents her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Life Achievement Award at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Jan. 25, 2015. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) \"She said, 'I want to be with Carrie,'\" her son said. \"And then she was gone.\" Reynolds enjoyed the heights of show business success and endured the depths of personal tragedy. She lost one husband to Elizabeth Taylor and two other husbands plundered her for millions. Fisher, who found lasting fame as Princess Leia in \"Star Wars\" and struggled for much of her life with drug addiction and mental health problems, died after falling ill on a plane. Reaction to Reynolds' death was swift. \"Debbie Reynolds, a legend and my movie mom. I can't believe this happened one day after Carrie,\" Albert Brooks, who played opposite Reynolds in \"Mother,\" said on Twitter. \"I can't imagine what Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds' family are going through this week. I send all of my love,\" Ellen DeGeneres tweeted. (Tribune news services) Reynolds found superstardom early. After two minor roles at Warner Bros. and three supporting roles at MGM, she was cast alongside Gene Kelly in \"Singin' in the Rain.\" She was 19 with little dance experience, and she would be appearing with two of the screen's greatest dancers, Donald O'Connor and Kelly. \"Gene Kelly was hard on me, but I think he had to be,\" Reynolds, who more than held her own in the movie, said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. \"I had to learn everything in three to six months. Donald O'Connor had been dancing since he was three months old, Gene Kelly since he was 2 years old.\" The 1964 Meredith Willson musical \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,\" with Molly's defiant song \"I Ain't Down Yet,\" brought Reynolds her only Academy Award nomination. She also received a Tony nomination in 1973 for her starring role in the Broadway revival of \"Irene,\" in which her daughter also appeared. After her transition from starlet to star, Reynolds became popular with teenage girls and even more so when in 1955 she married Eddie Fisher, the pop singer whose fans were equally devoted. The couple made a movie together, \"Bundle of Joy,\" which seemed to mirror the 1956 birth of Carrie. The Fishers also had a son, Todd, named for Eddie's close friend and Taylor's husband, showman Mike Todd. Debbie Reynolds Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times Debbie Reynolds photographed at her Los Angeles home on Jan. 15, 2012. Debbie Reynolds photographed at her Los Angeles home on Jan. 15, 2012. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) During this period, Reynolds had a No. 1 hit on the pop charts in 1957 with \"Tammy,\" the Oscar-nominated song from her film \"Tammy and the Bachelor.\" But the Cinderella story ended after Mike Todd died in a 1958 airplane crash. Fisher consoled the widow and soon announced he was leaving his wife and two children to marry Taylor. The celebrity world seemed to lose its mind. Taylor was assailed as a husband stealer, Fisher as a deserter. Reynolds won sympathy as the innocent victim, a role emphasized when she appeared before news cameras with diaper pins on her blouse. A cover headline in Photoplay magazine in late 1958 blared: \"Smiling through her tears, Debbie says: I'm still very much in love with Eddie.\" Fisher's singing career never recovered, but Reynolds' film career flourished. She starred with Glenn Ford in \"The Gazebo,\" Tony Curtis in \"The Rat Race,\" Fred Astaire in \"The Pleasure of His Company,\" Andy Griffith in \"The Second Time Around,\" with the all-star cast in \"How the West Was Won\" and Ricardo Montalban in \"The Singing Nun.\" She also provided the voice of Charlotte in the 1973 animated \"Charlotte's Web.\" But over the years, her marital woes continued. Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2016. In 1960 Reynolds married shoe magnate Harry Karl. The marriage ended in 1973 when she discovered that Karl, a compulsive gambler, had devastated her assets. Reynolds' third marriage, to Virginia businessman Richard Hamlett in 1984, proved equally disastrous. In 1992, against friends' advice, she paid $10 million to buy and convert a faded Las Vegas hotel into the Debbie Reynolds Hotel and Casino. She performed nightly and conducted tours of her movie memorabilia. Reynolds, who ended up filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and selling the property at auction the next year, accused Hamlett of making off with her money. \"All of my husbands have robbed me blind,\" she asserted in 1999. \"The only one who didn't take money was Eddie Fisher. He just didn't pay for the children.\" In her later years, Reynolds continued performing her show, traveling 40 weeks a year. She also appeared regularly on television, appearing as John Goodman's mother on \"Roseanne\" and a mom on \"Will & Grace.\" Her books included the memoirs \"Unsinkable\" and \"Make 'Em Laugh.\" In 1996 she won critical acclaim in the title role of Albert Brooks' movie \"Mother.\" Reynolds and her daughter were featured together in the HBO documentary \"Bright Lights,\" scheduled for release in 2017. Tribune archives: After nearly 4 decades, Debbie Reynolds still can pack a theater Open link Mary Frances Reynolds spent the first eight years of her life in Depression-era poverty in El Paso, Texas, where she was born on April 1, 1932. Her father, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad, was transferred to California and the family settled in Burbank, near Warner Bros. studio. The girl flourished, winning 48 Girl Scout merit badges, excelling in sports and playing French horn and bass viola in the Burbank Youth Symphony. Girlfriends persuaded her to enter the beauty contest for Miss Burbank, and she won over the judges. Eventually, she teamed up with Taylor \u2014 long since divorced from Fisher \u2014 and two other veterans, Joan Collins and MacLaine, for the 2001 TV movie \"These Old Broads.\" The script, co-written by Reynolds' daughter, was about aging, feuding actresses who get together for a reunion show. Reynolds would look back wryly on the Taylor affair, acknowledging that no man could have resisted her and that she actually voted for Taylor when she was up for best actress in 1960. The former romantic rivals had reconciled years before Taylor died in 2011; Reynolds recalled they had both been passengers on the Queen Elizabeth. \"I sent a note to her and she sent a note to me in passing, and then we had dinner together,\" she told The Huffington Post a few months after Taylor's death. \"She was married to Richard Burton by then. I had been remarried at that point. And we just said, 'Let's call it a day.' And we got smashed. And we had a great evening, and stayed friends since then.\" Reynolds received an honorary Oscar in 2015, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, but was too ill to attend the ceremony. Her granddaughter, actress Billie Lourd, accepted the statuette in her honor. \"I'm so sorry that I'm sick, but I am thrilled beyond words, shocked, and you couldn't be more amazed that a little girl from Burbank even came near this sort of accolade,\" she said in a pre-recorded statement. She was recognized for her decades-long commitment to various charities, including the mental-health organization she founded, the Thalians. Associated Press ",

He appeared to be highlighting previously made jobs announcements. OneWeb, which is building a network of satellites to deliver high-speed Internet access, said on Dec. 19 that it expected to create\u00a0nearly 3,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next four years after securing $1.2 billion in funding, mostly from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. And the head of\u00a0SoftBank, which owns Sprint, said on Dec. 6 that the company had agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs here. The announcement by SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son came after he met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump touted it that day. Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on Wednesday, Trump said Sprint was \"going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the United States.\" \"They have taken them from other countries. They are bringing them back to the United States,\" Trump said. Sprint, though, said in a statement that the jobs would be a mixture of new positions and others that were reinstated.\u00a0It wasn't clear whether those jobs were part of the 50,000 that were mentioned earlier in the month at Trump Tower. \u201cWe are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,\u201d said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. \u201cWe believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans.\u201d Trump also said the OneWeb hiring \"is very exciting.\" OneWeb did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 3:25 p.m.: This story was updated with comment from Sprint.

    "text": "Dec 28 2016, 6:43 am ET Japan Minister's Visit to War Dead Shrine Prompts Anger in China, South Korea by F. Brinley Bruton and Eric Baculinao Share advertisement A senior Japanese official paid his respects at a controversial shrine for war dead on Wednesday, potentially marring Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's earlier groundbreaking visit to Pearl Harbor with President Barack Obama. The visit by Masahiro Imamura, Abe's cabinet minister for reconstruction, to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine for war dead \u2014 seen by China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan's past militarism \u2014 prompted a sharp rebuke from Beijing. South Korean college students march with portraits of deceased former South Korean sex slaves who were forced to serve for the Japanese military in World War II during a rally against Japanese government in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday. Kim Ju-sung / AP \"China is firmly against any visit by Japanese cabinet members to the Yasukuni Shrine which worships class-A criminals in the Second World War,\" Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, referring to the regular visits to the shrine by a small group of officials. She added in a statement: \"We once again urge the Japanese side to look squarely at and deeply reflect upon the past history of aggression, take a responsible attitude to properly handle relevant issues, and make tangible moves to win the trust of its Asian neighbors and the world.\" Abe's visit 75 years after the attack on Pearl Harbor and his attendance at the USS Arizona Memorial marked the first such trip in decades by a Japanese prime minster. During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 2,403 Americans were killed on Dec. 7, 1941. Visitors pray at the Yasukuni Shrine, which honours millions of Japanese war dead but also senior military and political figures convicted of war crimes after World War II, in Tokyo on Wednesday. KAZUHIRO NOGI / AFP - Getty Images Some Abe critics noted the Japanese leader's visit, and the reconciliation with the United States that it symbolized, underscored the stark contrast in its relationship with China and South Korea. Anger toward Japan runs deep in both countries, where many feel that Japan has not fully atoned for their brutal behavior during World War II. Especially sensitive in China is the sack of Nanking, where hundreds of thousands of Chinese are believed to have been killed and raped during the Japanese army's vicious 1937 attack. In South Korea, which Japan occupied for much for the first half of the 20th Century, the plight of so-called comfort woman \u2014 essentially sex slaves serving Japanese soldiers \u2014 is still a live issue that causes grief and anger.

By John Wagner December 28 at 4:05 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner President-elect Donald Trump answers questions from the media during transition team meetings at the Mar-a-Lago Club on Dec. 28. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) After having repeatedly praised President Obama\u2019s efforts to ensure a smooth transition, President-elect Donald Trump reversed course on Wednesday, accusing the current occupant of the Oval Office of putting \u201croadblocks\u201d in his way. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 9 a.m., saying he was \u201cdoing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.\u201d Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 \u201cThought it was going to be a smooth transition \u2014 NOT!\u201d the\u00a0Republican president-elect wrote. The White House\u00a0declined to comment on Trump's tweet and others that followed. President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump had kind words for each other in the aftermath of the election. Then things seemed to change after Christmas. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s assessment comes amid days of verbal sparring between the outgoing and incoming president. During a ceremony Tuesday marking the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, Obama cautioned against \u201cthe urge to turn inward\u201d and stressed a need to \u201cresist the urge to demonize those who are different\u201d \u2014\u00a0remarks some thought were aimed partly at Trump. Trump also made it clear Wednesday that he is perturbed by a number of steps the Obama administration is taking in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech that was planned Wednesday by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Middle East policy. We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but....... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,\u201d Trump wrote in another series of tweets. \u201cThey used to have a good friend in the U.S., but \u2026 not anymore.\u201d Trump said the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d was the \u201chorrible\u201d Iran nuclear deal reached last year that was supported by a coalition of world powers but vigorously opposed by Israel. Trump was also highly critical this week of the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \u201cStay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his inauguration date. During a conference call with reporters later Wednesday morning, transition spokesman Sean Spicer at first declined to elaborate on Trump's tweets, saying they \u201cspeak for themselves.\u201d He later said that Obama and his administration officials have been generous with their time during the transition process and helpful with \u201cmechanical\u201d issues. On Wednesday afternoon, during a brief appearance before reporters at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump was asked about whether he thinks the transition is going smoothly. \u201cOh, I think very, very smoothly,\u201d he replied. \u201cVery good. You don't think so?\u201d Trump also sounded more conciliatory later in the afternoon, when he told reporters that Obama had called him earlier in the day. \u201cHe\u00a0called me, we had a very nice conversation,\u201d Trump said, without offering much elaboration. Trump\u2019s view of his Democratic predecessor\u00a0soured earlier this week when Obama said on a podcast hosted by his former adviser, David Axelrod, that he thought he could have prevailed in an election over Trump. [ President Obama says he could have beaten Trump \u2014 Trump says \u2018NO WAY!\u2019 ] Those comments prompted two tweets in as many days from Trump contesting Obama\u2019s assessment. On Tuesday, Trump chided Obama for the failure of his campaign efforts on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to bear fruit. \u201cPresident Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states and lost,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cThe voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report. politics ",

A giant rooster figure with a Donald Trump hairstyle to welcome the upcoming Chinese Year of the Rooster is pictured in front of a shopping mall in Taiyuan city, north China\u2019s Shanxi province, Dec. 24, 2016. Yin ming - Imaginechina The company that owns the mall had commissioned the piece, said Cao Mingliang, deputy director of the planning department from the N1 ArtWalk Mall, CNN reported . And it will serve as the mall\u2019s mascot. At least four stores are even offering replicas of the giant rooster. They vary in price, starting as low as $57 and climbing as high as $1,739 for those seeking a 32-foot figure, according to CNN. Another bird bearing resemblance to the U.S. president elect drew attention in China just last month. A photo of \u201cLittle Red,\u201d a pheasant with golden feathers, went viral when a journalist from Hangzhou noted that the bird -- at a Chinese safari park -- looked similar to the incoming president, Reuters reported, citing People\u2019s Daily . \u201cAfter comparing it with the photos ... we\u2019ve found that not only are their hairstyles alike, their eyes\u2019 expressions are pretty similar,\u201d Gao Hongqiang, the head bird feeder at the Chinese park, told Reuters.

Seplak was stalking a woman when he shot and killed her date later that night. Christopher Covelli, a spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, said that investigators believe Kenneth S. Seplak was stalking a woman when he shot and killed her date later that night. Rick Kambic Contact Reporter Pioneer Press Bond was set at $3 million Wednesday for a man accused of shooting and killing the date of a woman authorities said he was likely stalking on Dec. 23 in Libertyville . Kenneth S. Seplak, 37, of the 1400 block of North Lake Shore Drive, Round Lake Beach, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday in connection with the death of David Gorski. The events that prosecutors say led up to the fatal shooting were detailed during Seplak's bond hearing Wednesday morning after a group of about 10 spectators in the courtroom gallery hugged and wiped away tears. After Assistant State's Attorney Lisa LeBoeuf read a brief summary of police findings, Judge George Strickland ordered a $3 million bond citing the appearance of a planned attack. Seplak walked briskly back to the detention area with a glance into the audience. \"Why did he have to look at us?\" a sobbing woman screamed as she left the courtroom. The group declined to speak with reporters as they embraced each other and rushed out of the building. Gorski, 30, was killed by a single shot that sent a bullet through his right arm and into his chest, according to the Lake County coroner's office. Libertyville police found Gorski in his car on the center median of Milwaukee Avenue near Hollister Drive at around 11:30 p.m. Friday, according to Christopher Covelli, a Lake County Major Crime Task Force spokesman. Kenneth S. Seplak Lake County Major Crime Kenneth S. Seplak, 37, of the 1400 block of North Lake Shore Drive, Round Lake Beach, was charged Dec. 27 with the first degree murder of David Gorski of Libertyville, according a statement issued by the Lake County Major Crime Task Force. Kenneth S. Seplak, 37, of the 1400 block of North Lake Shore Drive, Round Lake Beach, was charged Dec. 27 with the first degree murder of David Gorski of Libertyville, according a statement issued by the Lake County Major Crime Task Force. (Lake County Major Crime) Investigators learned that Gorski was supposed to see a movie at Hawthorn Mall in Vernon Hills with a 30-year-old woman from Wauconda, Covelli said. The woman later told police that she had problems with a stalker, whom Covelli identified as Seplak. Covelli said officers learned of at least one other incident in the recent past in which Seplak made an unwanted appearance at the woman's home. Officers found Seplak at his house on Saturday and GPS data taken from his phone showed he had traveled to the Vernon Hills theater and then to a house in the 41000 block of North Route 83 in an unincorporated area near Antioch, Covelli said. A man at the house gave police a bag that contained a handgun and ammunition and said he found it in his car around the same time Seplak made a social visit, Covelli said. Ballistic evidence connects the bullet taken from Gorski to the gun found at the house, according to Covelli, and gunpowder residue was found on Seplak. ",

Few officials dispute that the Russian operation was intended to harm the candidacy of Trump's rival Hillary Clinton by leaking embarrassing emails about Democrats. While no equivalent Republican leaks occurred during the campaign \u2014 and Trump and Putin have both spoken of each other warmly \u2014 the wind from the East has never been more chilly. On Oct. 15, Russia's longstanding U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Washington-Kremlin tensions the \"worst since 1973.\" Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 the architect of glasnost or \"openness\" reform policies that hastened the end the Communist U.S.S.R. \u2014 has warned that U.S.-Russia ties were at \"a dangerous point.\" Related: Putin Congratulates Trump by Telegram After Win Russia tore up a pact to get rid of plutonium that could be used in nuclear warheads, and moved nuclear weapons into Eastern Europe \u2014 which unnerved Western governments, including the U.S. It is also venturing into regions it had neglected for decades, for example helping bomb Syria's Aleppo and holding military exercises with longtime U.S. ally Egypt. Profound Distrust It seems like Putin's Russia seems determined to challenge American leadership across the globe. Beneath the bold Russian moves, there is profound distrust between the two countries. Secretary of State John Kerry's personally warm relationship with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has ensured areas of cooperation, even agreement \u2014 but this could end. Putin won't be deterred from challenging the U.S. and with his economic woes growing at home he may be tempted to double down on risky military moves \u2014 nowhere more so than in the Middle East, where Syria is Putin's showcase for the Russian military. The most profound challenge to the White House's new occupant would be if Moscow made a move in one of the Baltic states, which are members of NATO but are also home to substantial ethnic Russian minorities. This is seen as an extremely unlikely occurrence by experts but it cannot be completely ruled out. Related: Three Years After U.S. Pulled Tanks From Europe, They're Back Any incursion would challenge Trump, as NATO's biggest funder, to make a full-scale response based on the alliance's fundamental principle \u2014 that an attack against one of its members is considered an attack on all 28. Another possible tripwire is the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, which lies between Lithuania and Poland and is home to the Russian Baltic fleet. Russia has now moved nuclear capable Iskander-M missile systems there. Russian President Vladimir Putin Mikhail Svetlov / Getty Images Their indefinite placement puts U.S. missile defense systems in Poland within range. Almost certainly, any Russian move to test America's new leader here would be small scale \u2014 the military tactic they call \"maskirovka,\" or deception, seen most clearly in 2014 when mysterious soldiers appeared in Ukraine's Crimea. These soldiers, which Putin later admitted had been sent there by the Kremlin, hastened the eventual Russian annexation of the peninsula. The World's Longest Border Putin's regime has insisted it is antagonizing the United States in self-defense against what it perceives to be Washington's aggressive policies. Russia, the country with the longest land border in the world, has historically been concerned about its neighbors' military activities. Related: Trump Hints at New Relationship With NATO Allies Russian leaders have for years watched with alarm as NATO expands eastward toward the country's borders. Especially alarming are plans for the U.S. missile defense elements in Eastern Europe. Trump's own plans may prove as damaging to NATO as Russia's. As a candidate, he sent waves of alarm through Europe when he said he might not come to the aid of NATO allies if they were attacked. So these are dangerous days. Related: Why Obama Didn't Do More About Russian Hack \"Russia is still the only country that can destroy the United States as a functioning society in 30 minutes ... both sides maintain their nuclear forces on hair-trigger alert,\" Russia experts Thomas Graham and Matthew Rojansky wrote in Foreign Policy magazine in October . There are few good options for the U.S. and all carry risks. Tillerson's 'Vast experience' Trump's nomination of oil giant ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state on Dec. 13 may signal the president-elect's strategy for dealing with Russia. While Tillerson has no government or diplomatic experience, he does have exceptionally close ties with Moscow and Putin. While these links have drawn fire from both Democrats and Republicans, it is likely that Trump actually sees the connections as positive. Play ",

    "text": "Political donations flow as Rick Caruso seeks approval for a 20-story tower near the Beverly Center Who is Rick Caruso? Caruso graduated from USC and Pepperdine School of Law, and started his career as a real estate lawyer. Caruso graduated from USC and Pepperdine School of Law, and started his career as a real estate lawyer. David Zahniser Real estate developer Rick Caruso has been a reliable benefactor at Los Angeles City Hall, giving donations big and small to the city\u2019s politicians and their pet causes. Caruso, known for the Grove and other shopping destinations, has donated to all but one of the city\u2019s 17 elected officials. His\u00a0charitable foundation provided $125,000 to a nonprofit set up by Mayor Eric Garcetti. And his companies recently gave $200,000 to the campaign for Measure M, the sales tax hike Garcetti championed in last month\u2019s election. Add in\u00a0money from his employees and his family members,\u00a0and Caruso-affiliated donors have provided more than $476,000\u00a0to the city\u2019s elected officials and their initiatives\u00a0over the past five years, according to contribution reports. Now, Caruso wants Garcetti and the council to approve a 20-story residential tower on La Cienega Boulevard, on a site where new buildings are currently limited to a height of 45 feet. Opponents of the project view Caruso\u2019s donations with alarm, saying the steady stream of contributions has\u00a0undermined their confidence in the city\u2019s planning process. \u201cI'm sorry, but that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Keith Nakata, a foe of the project\u00a0who lives roughly five blocks from the site. \u201cThat is obviously something that the community cannot compete against.\u201d Caruso\u2019s residential tower is one of several real estate projects \u2014 some already approved, others still under consideration \u2014 to be reviewed at City Hall as\u00a0six-figure contributions arrive from developers or donors with close ties to them. The Times reported in October\u00a0that campaign contributors with direct and indirect ties to real estate developer Samuel Leung provided more than $600,000 to L.A.-area politicians as his 352-unit apartment project was being reviewed.\u00a0Garcetti and the council approved Leung\u2019s Sea Breeze project, located north of the Port of Los Angeles, in 2015. In the San Fernando Valley, shopping mall company Westfield Corp.  unveiled plans in October for Westfield Promenade, a $1.5-billion project featuring two hotels and\u00a01,432\u00a0new homes. Westfield affiliates have contributed $950,000 to two Garcetti\u00a0initiatives \u2014\u00a0Measure M and\u00a0the effort to bring the 2024 Olympics to Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0over the past 14 months, contribution\u00a0records show.

(Gary Friedman / Los Angeles Times) Westfield representatives said they view the Olympics and the city\u2019s transportation investments as initiatives that will spur significant economic growth. In Century City, entertainment giant 20th\u00a0Century Fox Film  is pursuing a 1.1-million-square-foot expansion of its studio facilities. Fox\u2019s parent company has given $1 million to the Mayor\u2019s Fund for Los Angeles, a nonprofit set up by Garcetti in 2014 to advance his initiatives. A related company, Fox Entertainment Group, gave the Measure M campaign $250,000 in September. A Fox representative declined to comment on the donations. Six-figure donations from real estate interests,\u00a0while perfectly legal, erode public confidence in city planning decisions, said Michael Manville, an assistant professor of urban planning at UCLA. They are also the natural byproduct of a process\u00a0where developers routinely request \u2014 and receive \u2014 changes to city planning and\u00a0zoning rules for their projects,\u00a0he said. \u201cIf you have a system that relies so heavily\u00a0on [those changes]\u00a0to get things built, then you are going to get lots of campaign contributions,\u201d Manville\u00a0said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re shifting a lot of power away from the Planning Department and toward the elected officials.\u201d Garcetti, who supports Caruso\u2019s project, said in an interview that\u00a0development decisions at City Hall are\u00a0\u201cabsolutely separate\u201d from the contributions that are made to his campaigns and policy initiatives. \u201cProjects should be assessed on their merits and nothing else,\u201d he said. Caruso said in an interview that his political contributions are part of a much broader approach to charitable giving, with donations going\u00a0to churches, nonprofit groups, educational institutions\u00a0and other causes. Some of the most recent donations, he said,\u00a0were designed to help city leaders who are working to address homelessness and\u00a0build a new transit network. \u201cWe love Los Angeles, as corny\u00a0as it may sound, and making Los Angeles a more livable city,\u201d he said. Caruso also\u00a0defended the city\u2019s planning process, calling it\u00a0\u201cvery open and democratic,\u201d and dismissed the notion that donations influence policy makers.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never believed for one minute that any contribution I\u2019ve given has changed the opinion of any elected official,\u201d he said. Garcetti\u2019s appointees on the City Planning Commission unanimously endorsed Caruso\u2019s La Cienega\u00a0project last month, agreeing to provide a zone change, a height district change and an amendment to the general plan \u2014 the document that governs citywide real estate development \u2014 for his\u00a0project. Although two commissioners voiced concerns about the building\u2019s height, the majority said the city needs to embrace projects of that scale. \u201cThe city is transforming,\u201d said commissioner Caroline Choe. The La Cienega project is expected\u00a0to come up for a City Council vote in January. The council\u00a0approved a separate Caruso project, a new retail village in Pacific Palisades,\u00a0last summer. The La Cienega\u00a0residential tower has divided residents in Beverly Grove, a community bordered by West Hollywood on the north, Wilshire Boulevard on the south, Fairfax Avenue on the east and\u00a0Beverly Hills on the west. Foes of the project\u00a0view Caruso as one of many\u00a0well-connected developers who ask city leaders\u00a0to rewrite local\u00a0planning laws for a single project.

Fallon / For The Times) If approved without changes, the La Cienega project will stand roughly twice as tall as the Beverly Center, an eight-story shopping mall right next door. And it will be roughly eight times higher than the one- and two-story buildings that run along the east side of La Cienega. \u201cHe could build a building like this in Century City, where it\u2019s intended to be, or on parts of Wilshire Boulevard, like \u2018Condo Canyon\u2019 near UCLA,\u201d said Dick Platkin, a board member with\u00a0the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn., a group fighting the project.\u00a0\u201cBut this part of L.A. is not intended to have it.\u201d Backers of the project point out that the area already has a handful of tall buildings, including the Cedars-Sinai Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion, which is about 185 feet tall.\u00a0Caruso\u2019s project is expected to reach 240 feet. \u201cWe felt\u00a0this is a unique location where density makes sense,\u201d said Scott Epstein, chairman of\u00a0the Mid City West Community Council, the neighborhood council for the area, which endorsed the project.\u00a0\u201cIn\u00a0the middle of a housing crisis, if you\u2019re going to put housing somewhere, this is a good place to put it.\u201d Epstein said Caruso responded to the needs of the community by offering a grocery store, much-needed housing\u00a0and new outdoor spaces, including a 6,910-square-foot plaza with a fountain.\u00a0And he praised the developer for\u00a0ensuring that 14 of the building\u2019s 145 apartments will be rented at below-market rates. Those concessions, he said, show what can be accomplished when residents and developers \u201ccollaborate for mutual benefit,\u201d he said. Still, what some view as hard-fought concessions, others criticize as unsavory dealings. Last summer, the La Cienega project was sharply criticized by residents of Westbury Terrace, a condominium building across the street from the Caruso\u00a0site. Dozens of the building\u2019s condo owners turned in a petition to\u00a0their neighborhood council, saying Caruso\u2019s project\u00a0would obstruct their views and generate unwanted noise and traffic. Weeks later, many of those same petition signers switched sides, becoming ardent supporters of Caruso\u2019s project. The condominium board\u2019s president soon disclosed that\u00a0Caruso had agreed to make extensive repairs on the 11-story building, upgrading the entrances and replacing the windows with multipaned\u00a0glass. In\u00a0correspondence with the neighborhood council, Westbury Terrace\u00a0Homeowners Assn. President Philippe Cohanim said Caruso\u2019s contribution would help the building\u2019s occupants cope with increased noise and dust while Caruso\u2019s project was being built. Cohanim, when approached by The Times,\u00a0would not discuss the arrangement.\u00a0But a Caruso spokeswoman confirmed the developer agreed to spend $500,000 on repairs to the building. Foes of the project have called that  a\u00a0payoff. Caruso said he had an obligation to address the Westbury\u2019s concerns about noise and other construction issues. Caruso said he has\u00a0worked to meet the neighborhood\u2019s needs in other ways, offering to pay for street improvements and even redesigning the project. \u201cThe way I get the community to support the project,\u201d he said, \u201cis to give them what they want.\u201d Last month,\u00a0many Westbury condominium owners testified in favor of Caruso\u2019s project at a planning commission hearing. Others who spoke at that meeting also had financial dealings with Caruso. The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to the hearing\u00a0to speak on behalf of Caruso\u2019s project. The group\u2019s political action committee received $50,000 from the developer in 2014, according to campaign donation records. City Councilman Paul Koretz, whose district includes Beverly Grove, supported Rick Caruso's La Cienega project. He has received $2,200 in donations from Caruso since 2011.

He has received $2,200 in donations from Caruso since 2011. (Jabin Botsford / Los Angeles Times) Also speaking in favor of Caruso\u2019s project was planning aide Shawn Bayliss, who read a support letter from his boss, Councilman Paul Koretz. Caruso donated $5,200 to two campaign committees that supported Bayliss\u2019 unsuccessful bid for state Senate in June. Caruso\u2019s\u00a0lawyer on the La Cienega project also gave Bayliss $1,000. And that lawyer\u2019s colleagues \u2014\u00a0all registered as\u00a0lobbyists at City Hall \u2014\u00a0provided another $4,000, state campaign records show. Koretz, who represents Beverly Grove, said he \u2014\u00a0not Bayliss \u2014\u00a0made the decisions on the Caruso project. And he commended Caruso for working to secure the support of both Westbury Terrace and the neighborhood council. \u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0exactly what I asked the developer to do: Go work with the neighbors and make this work for everybody,\u201d said Koretz, who has received $2,200 in donations from Caruso since 2011. Koretz\u2019s\u00a0arguments have not reassured Peter David Harris, a\u00a0Beverly Grove resident\u00a0who lives about\u00a0five blocks from the Caruso site. Harris fears that if Caruso succeeds, other property owners on La Cienega and San Vicente boulevards will propose\u00a0luxury high-rises \u2014\u00a0the kind that cast\u00a0shadows on nearby single-family homes. \u201cIt becomes a domino effect,\u201d he said. An environmental review of Caruso\u2019s project concluded that the 20-story building would not cast a \u201csignificant\u201d\u00a0amount of shadow\u00a0on nearby residential properties.\u00a0Under the city\u2019s guidelines, shadow from a tall building is deemed significant if it covers certain areas for more\u00a0than three or four consecutive hours, depending on the time of year. Even if there had been a significant amount of shadow, it could not be used as the basis for a state\u00a0environmental challenge \u2014\u00a0thanks to\u00a0a law signed by\u00a0Gov. Jerry Brown three years ago. Senate Bill 743 established that shadow, glare and other aesthetic concerns would no longer be considered significant\u00a0impacts\u00a0under the state environmental review process for residential projects that sit within a half mile of a major transit stop \u2014\u00a0one where buses or trains arrive at least every 15 minutes during rush hour. Brown signed the bill in September 2013. Two months later, Caruso contributed $54,400 to the governor\u2019s reelection bid. :: Tracking developers\u2019 donations Individuals and companies\u00a0with real estate\u00a0projects that need approval from Los Angeles\u2019 elected officials\u00a0have made  six-figure contributions to those officials\u2019\u00a0campaigns and political causes in recent years.

    "text": "German Authorities Detain Tunisian Man Suspected of Helping Alleged Berlin Attacker By Morgan Winsor Dec 28, 2016, 12:55 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Berlin Terror Attack Suspect Shot Dead in Milan 0 Shares Email German authorities have detained a 40-year-old Tunisian man who \u201ccould have been involved in the attack\u201d on a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany\u2019s federal prosecutor said today in a statement. The Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office did not name the man but described him as a \u201ccontact person\u201d for the alleged attacker, Anis Amri , who was shot dead by police in Milan last week. Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian national, had the older man\u2019s phone number stored in his cellphone, according to the statement. Investigators are working to determine what role, if any, the unnamed Tunisian man played in the Dec. 19 attack on the Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz, a public square in the heart of Germany\u2019s capital. Authorities searched the man\u2019s offices today, according to the prosecutor\u2019s statement. Officials have identified Amri as the likely assailant in the deadly attack, citing evidence discovered at the crime scene, including fingerprints in the cab of the truck that was used to plow through the busy marketplace. At least 12 people were killed, and dozens more were injured, according to German authorities. Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel told ABC News on Saturday that Amri\u2019s mobile phone, wallet and ID were discovered in the cab of the truck. The truck was stolen in Poland from a building site, and its driver, a Polish citizen, was found dead with gunshot wounds in the back of the vehicle. The spokesman said authorities believe a violent struggle took place in the cab at some point around the time of the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for the assault, calling Amri \u201ca soldier of the Islamic State\u201d in a statement released by the terrorist group. In a video posted on social media that appears to have been recorded before the attack, Amri pledges allegiance to ISIS and says he is avenging the bombing of Muslims, urging others around the world to take up jihad. \u201cMy message to the crusaders who bombard Muslims every day: With God\u2019s will, I swear we\u2019re coming to slaughter you, you pigs,\u201d Amri says in the recording. \u201cI encourage all my Muslim brothers in every place to conduct jihad in the name of the religion.\u201d Ralf Jaeger, the interior minister of the German state of North Rhine\u2013Westphalia, told reporters last week that Amri had known ties to the local radical Islamic scene and had been deemed a threat by several security agencies. Italian Police Didn\u2019t Realize Man Was Berlin Terror Suspect Before Shootout Authorities are still trying to piece together Amri\u2019s movements after the attack. According to Italian police, he is believed to have traveled through France before arriving on a train at Milan\u2019s central railway station at approximately 1 a.m. local time last Friday. Approximately two hours later, near a train station in the Sesto San Giovanni area in suburban Milan, Amri was approached by two police officers who wished to conduct a routine identity check. The officers were unaware he was the man at the center of the Europe-wide manhunt. \u201cHe was a man from northern Africa, like there are many in the Milan area, and ours was a routine check that was carried out by two young and good police officers,\u201d Milan Police Chief Antonio de Iesu said at a press conference on Friday. Sesto San Giovanni Police Chief Roberto Guida told reporters that Amri initially appeared calm while emptying his pockets and satchel. Then he suddenly pulled out a loaded weapon fired once at the chief patrol officer, who was closer to him, before fleeing behind a nearby car. The other officer flanked Amri and shot him dead, Guida said. The wounded police officer was taken to a local hospital, where he is recovering, according to Italy \u2019s Interior Ministry. Italian authorities confirmed the man killed was Amri, using fingerprints provided by German authorities, according to German\u2019s Federal Prosecutor Peter Frank. Today, Italian police released an image that they say shows Amri at a train station in Turin on Dec. 22 at 10:14 p.m. local time.

Among those arrested was Amri\u2019s nephew, who admitted to using an encrypted chat application to communicate with his uncle, according to Tunisia\u2019s Interior Ministry. Amri allegedly encouraged his nephew \u2014 his sister\u2019s son \u2014 to adopt jihadist ideologies and urged him to pledge allegiance to ISIS. Amri even sent his nephew money so he could travel to Germany and join the group, according to Tunisia\u2019s Interior Ministry. \u201cAs he was interrogated, he confessed that he communicates with his uncle through the application Telegram to evade security surveillance using its encryption and secrecy,\u201d the ministry said in a statement on its website. Amri\u2019s nephew was not named in the statement, and the identities of the other two men arrested are unknown; the three men \u2014 whom the ministry said were a terrorist cell \u2014 are 18 to 27 years old.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry laid out his vision for peace between Israel and the Palestinians Wednesday. In the more than hourlong address, Kerry criticized Jewish settlements in the West Bank as an impediment to peace. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images With his tenure as secretary of state rapidly pulling to a close, John Kerry made an impassioned defense for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Wednesday. Kerry said he is concerned that some Israeli politicians are rejecting it. \"If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic; it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,\" said Kerry. Speaking at the State Department, Kerry sharply criticized the Israeli government's construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He said the policy was dimming the prospect of peace. In the more than hourlong address, Kerry also defended the U.S.'s refusal to block a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements. The resolution led to fierce accusations that the Obama administration had turned against Israel. \"Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect,\" Kerry said. Kerry also shut down accusations that the U.S. had engineered the U.N. resolution \u2014 a claim by Israel's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. Article continues after sponsorship In a speech shortly thereafter, the prime minister called Kerry's speech \"a great disappointment.\" He warned that Kerry's vision could cause \"big, big damage\" to his country and said that his speech was \"almost as unbalanced\" as the United Nations resolution. Kerry spearheaded talks to reach a peace between Israelis and Palestinians not long after taking the helm of the State Department in 2013. As The New York Times notes in its write-up of the speech: \"With his presidential hopes dashed after his loss to George W. Bush in the 2004 election, Mr. Kerry saw his time as secretary of state as a chance to make a true change in the Middle East. In three weeks, his near-constant travels around the world will end and his energetic diplomacy will suddenly terminate. He has one major accomplishment under his belt \u2014 the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 but he could not achieve his goals on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, or in the Syrian civil war.\" As we've previously reported , peace talks fell apart. Earlier, President-Elect Trump took to Twitter to offer his view. \"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......\" he tweeted Wednesday morning. \"Not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\" His choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, has called the two-state solution an \" illusion .\" ",

Choi is suing UIC claiming he has been discriminated against due to his Korean ethnicity. Seung-Whan Choi, a University of Illinois at Chicago professor, is photographed Dec. 28, 2016, in his Clarendon Hills home. Choi is suing UIC claiming he has been discriminated against due to his Korean ethnicity. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Corilyn Shropshire Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune An international relations professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago has filed a lawsuit against the school, alleging he was discriminated against because he is from Korea. Seung-Whan Choi's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, claims that after the Korean-born U.S. citizen was fired from his tenure-track position at UIC in 2011 and reinstated months later, he experienced years of discrimination and retaliation due to his race and national origin. Choi alleges that he was ostracized and denied raises comparable to his peers in the department of political science. Choi also said he was forced to teach courses in statistics for which he is not qualified because, one department official said, \"Asians, especially Koreans are very good at mathematics and statistics,\" according to court documents. Additionally, Choi claims in court documents that he was forced to teach a course in Korean politics, despite having no formal education in the field. In 2015, then-department head Dennis Judd changed an undergraduate student's grades without consultation with Choi, the suit says. When Choi asked Judd about it, the lawsuit alleges that Judd said Choi, \"as a foreigner, has to keep in mind who he is dealing with and what he is wishing for,\" and that Judd \"knows that many Koreans are stubborn and do not understand American culture of compromise when dealing with their boss.\" Among other complaints, Choi also alleges he was wrongfully accused of being lacking in academic contributions and not providing sufficient service to the department, and was denied a promotion to full professor, according to the lawsuit. UIC's website lists books published by Choi in 2005 and 2016, and a nine-page curriculum vitae with several citations. UIC campus Terrence Antonio James, Chicago Tribune UIC professor Seung-Whan Choi has filed a lawsuit against the school, alleging he was discriminated against because he is from Korea. UIC professor Seung-Whan Choi has filed a lawsuit against the school, alleging he was discriminated against because he is from Korea. (Terrence Antonio James, Chicago Tribune) \"They don't like Korean-Americans,\" Choi told the Tribune on Wednesday. \"I'm supposed to be very submissive to the department head, who is white-American.\" Choi claims he has no future with the department and that the situation has caused him anxiety and high blood pressure and has hurt his ability to be a good husband and father. \"It's frustrating and sometimes I just don't want to go to work, because of ... the bad and dirty politics within the department,\" he said. In October, the Clarendon Hills resident filed a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a few days later received a \"right to sue\" notice, according to the lawsuit. Choi's attorney, Uche Asonye, said the plaintiff has not determined how much in punitive damages, attorney and court fees he is seeking. Neither the university nor political science department head Evan McKenzie could immediately be reached for comment. ",

The Bethlehem Fire Department says about 30 residents had to leave their homes early Wednesday. A four-block area has been closed to traffic. Bethlehem is about 70 miles north of Philadelphia. Fire Chief Robert Novatnack says firefighters were called to the scene around 3:20 a.m. and detected a strong odor of natural gas , including inside some homes. The gas was shut off after several hours and utility crews were making repairs. Several evacuated residents are sheltering at a nearby school.

Roof (pictured in 2015) faces the death penalty. Chuck Burton/AP hide caption toggle caption Chuck Burton/AP Convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof told a federal judge Wednesday that he will not present evidence or witnesses in the penalty phase of his trial. Roof (pictured in 2015) faces the death penalty. Chuck Burton/AP The man convicted of the deadly shooting rampage at a Charleston, South Carolina church says he won't call witnesses or offer evidence that could spare his life in the penalty phase of his murder trial. Dylann Roof also reaffirmed his plan Wednesday to represent himself as he faces the death penalty in the final phase of his trial. Jury Finds Dylann Roof Guilty In S.C. Church Shooting U.S Judge Richard Gergel expressed misgivings over Roof's decision, Reuters reports: \"'I think it's a bad idea,' Gergel warned, encouraging Roof to discuss his decision with his family and lawyers. \"The judge said he would allow Roof to change his mind up until the penalty phase gets under way. \"Roof said he planned to make an opening statement to jurors but did not indicate whether he would testify on his own behalf. He said he would present no evidence or witnesses. \"He made clear he wanted no details about his mental health revealed, asking Gergel to refrain from unsealing video interviews about his competency or the transcript from a hearing on the topic in November.\" The Associated Press adds Roof's lawyers say they were dismissed because Roof believed they would present potentially embarrassing evidence to save his life. This is not the first time the 22-year-old has opted to defend himself. In earlier phases of the trial, Roof briefly acted as his own representation. As NPR's Rebecca Hersher reported at the time : \"For five days, Roof represented himself during the final jury selection, expressing few opinions about potential jurors as his attorneys sat next to him providing backup counsel. \"But late last week, Roof's attorneys asked the judge to reverse the decision, arguing that Roof was not equipped to adequately defend himself against a possible death sentence, and that 'allowing him to proceed would deprive him of protection against cruel and unusual punishment,' reported the Charleston Post and Courier . \"On Sunday, Roof sent a handwritten letter to the judge asking that his lawyers be allowed to represent him in the first phase of the trial, during which evidence is presented, but not during the sentencing phase, in which arguments will be presented for and against the death penalty.\" Article continues after sponsorship In Taped Confession, Charleston Church Shooter Says 'We All Know I Am Guilty' Jurors eventually found Roof guilty on 33 federal charge s, including hate crimes, for the 2015 attack that killed nine parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. For the sentencing phase, his defense lawyers wanted to call mental health experts to testify on his behalf, but according to the Associated Press, Roof rejected that plan: \"In his hate-filled, racist journal read to the jury during his trial, Roof said his doesn't believe in psychology. \"'It is a Jewish invention and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don't,' Roof wrote.\" Meanwhile, according to South Carolina Public Radio's Alexandra Olgin, prosecutors have a list of more than 30 witnesses who may testify during the sentencing phase. That phase of his trial begins next week. ",

Truth be told, I was happy to see that, despite mooching cabernet from another guest because I forgot to bring wine, someone thought I \u201cmade an impression.\u201d Still, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted a nice evening out to be followed by having to rate it. \u201cEatWith is kind of like Tinder for couples,\u201d Ms. Kim told me. But therein lay the problem: I had been too thin-skinned for Tinder as a single person! For a change of pace, I decided my next foray into social dining would be one in which someone else provides the funds for me to host people in my home, offering a modicum of social control (though also the responsibility of cleaning up). OneTable is an organization that encourages millennials \u2014 of all backgrounds and religions \u2014 to host Sabbath dinners. A nonprofit that has hosted over 3,000 dinners in its current hub cities of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Denver since last year, it provides what they call \u201ca nourishment credit\u201d of $15 per person for up to 10 people that can be used at vendors like Whole Foods, FreshDirect, Instacart, Etsy or Seamless. For young people, said Aliza Kline, the executive director of OneTable, \u201cIt\u2019s a little countercultural to have a home-based meal these days.\u201d OneTable encourages hosts to create a theme for their dinners, which have been organized to support down-ballot races or to give socks to the homeless. (There was even a Fashion Week Sabbath.) \u201cMillennials don\u2019t like to gamble with social experiences,\u201d said Ms. Kline, who is in her 40s. \u201cThe more they know what to expect, the more people will show up.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story After sifting through OneTable\u2019s inspirational Pinterest boards , I settled on a Mediterranean theme. My dinner was posted, and when it closed for sign-ups, no strangers had registered. (I couldn\u2019t help noticing a dumpling-making Sabbath dinner seemed to fill up quickly.) To ensure Andrew and I wouldn\u2019t be eating alone, I had invited two friends \u2014 a couple, Reid and Danielle \u2014 and they invited two friends, Aaron and Tamar, neither of whom we knew or knew each other. In other words, not unlike a traditional dinner party. Photo EatWith asks diners to rate one another after a meal. Susan Kim, the C.E.O., said she \u201cwanted an innocuous way to establish if people wanted to connect again.\u201d Credit Andrew White for The New York Times The day before the dinner, I took advantage of one of OneTable\u2019s 56 Sabbath coaches, a mix of Jewish professionals who can offer advice on rituals and hosting. I needed less of a tutorial about the Jewish customs and more about how to impose some structure to the meal and the conversation. After all, my friend Reid pointed out a pitfall to socializing lately: \u201cAll we do when we get together is talk about the election and our favorite TV shows.\u201d Sarah Krinsky, a fourth-year rabbinical school student at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan and a OneTable coach, suggested I ask all the guests to talk about a question they\u2019d been wrestling with over the last week or month. \u201cI think that can get at some of the things we don\u2019t usually talk about,\u201d Ms. Krinsky said. I also wanted to steer the conversation, as much as possible, away from the election, which, at that point, was less than a week before. I\u2019d reached my capacity for political conversations for the year, and was convinced after reading the entire internet that week that no one had anything new to say on the topic. (Little did I know.) Before our guests arrived, Andrew, who barely ever takes Advil, asked me if I had a Xanax. The combination of a trip to Moldova the next day and the stakes of Nov. 8 were about to put him over the edge. I briefly considered canceling the dinner. \u201cWho would want to be around such anxious downers?\u201d I thought. I looked at my glaring overhead light and wondered how long it would take someone to lodge a complaint. We would have just been better being miserable alone. But then the guests came. No one asked why I didn\u2019t make salmon, as promised, no one left early or criticized the lighting or talked incessantly about New York City preschool admissions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Instead, we lit the Sabbath candles. We talked about our work, the world, what we were grappling with both personally and professionally. I couldn\u2019t believe how much I was enjoying myself. It was \u2014 and I found this shocking because socializing is usually stressful for me \u2014 an exhale moment. Andrew forgot about wanting a Xanax. He said being with other people soothed him. I remembered why civilizations form bonds beyond their families and enjoy others\u2019 company. When a group of people connects, with just enough wine, there\u2019s a release. It\u2019s the feeling that you could sit at the table for hours and not want to check your iPhone. It sounds simple, but it felt like nothing short of a miracle. Now I just have to work up the courage to invite them back. Correction: December 22, 2016 An article last Thursday about apps for planning dinner parties misspelled the surname of the executive director of OneTable, an organization that encourages millennials to host Sabbath dinners. She is Aliza Kline, not Klein. Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love ), Twitter ( Styles , Fashion and Weddings ) and Instagram .

    "text": "Netanyahu slams Kerry's speech defending UN vote as 'unbalanced' Published               December 28, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Israel fired back at Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasting Kerry\u2019s lengthy televised rebuke of the Middle Eastern democracy. NEW CLASH WITH ISRAEL: KERRY RIPS 'SETTLER AGENDA' IN SPEECH DEFENDING UNITED NATIONS VOTE Netanyahu, speaking in Jerusalem just over an hour after Kerry\u2019s speech had ended, said Kerry's rhetoric was \"as unbalanced as the anti-Israel resolution passed [at the United Nations] last week.\" \"Secretary Kerry paid lip service to the unrelenting campaign of terror that has been waged by the Palestinians against the Jewish State,\" he said, later adding: \"Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders.\" WHITE HOUSE DENIES KERRY PLOTTED WITH PALESTINIANS BEFORE UNITED NATIONS VOTE Israeli officials have said since the Security Council resolution was passed on Friday that the U.S. played a covert role in developing the proposal -- charges the U.S. has denied.\u00a0Israel's government was enraged after the U.S. abstained from voting on the resolution, which called Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem a violation of international law.\u00a0 But Netanyahu on Wednesday made the firmest -- and most-high ranking -- accusation that America secretly worked toward advancing the resolution. \"We have it on absolutely incontestable evidence the U.S. organized, advanced and brought this resolution to the Security Council,\" said Netanyahu, who promised to share the \"sensitive\" intelligence with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump tweeted his support for Israel before Kerry even spoke, and Netanyahu quickly returned the goodwill on Twitter:\u00a0\"President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel!\" During his remarks, Netanyahu again looked past the Obama administration and addressed Trump. \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with the American Congress \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 to mitigate the damage this resolution has done and ultimately repeal it,\" he said. Netanyahu said that while he sought peace, his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, has walked away from peace offers \"time and time again.\" Earlier Wednesday, Kerry sparked the diplomatic showdown when he questioned Netanyahu's commitment to Palestinian statehood. Though Netanyahu has said he believes in the two-state solution, Kerry said Netanyahu\u2019s government is \u201cthe most right-wing in Israel's history.\u201d \u201cIf the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,\u201d Kerry said. Abbas in a statement \"reiterated his commitment to a just and lasting peace as a strategic option,\" saying Palestinians would resume negotiations\u00a0\"the minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities.\" Netanyahu\u2019s office, however, immediately slammed Kerry\u2019s speech as \"skewed against Israel\" and \"obsessively\" dealing with the issue of Israeli settlements. Netanyahu spoke shortly after the Israeli Attorney General\u2019s office approved a police probe of the prime minister in two separate cases, The Times of Israel reported, citing Channel 10. A Netanyahu spokesman had previously told Haaeretz the case was \"nonsense.\" Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also panned Kerry's speech. \"To coordinate anti-Israeli initiatives with the Palestinians at the U.N. and to advance a one-sided resolution against Israel in the Security Council is the opposite of supporting Israel,\" Danon said. \"The Obama Administration acted against Israel at the U.N. and any claim to the contrary is a distortion of reality.\" Almost immediately after Kerry\u2019s speech, Netanyahu posted to his Facebook page a 2008 image of Obama\u2019s visit to Israel alongside two captions: \u201c2008: Presidential candidate Barack Obama at the Western Wall; 2016: UN calls the Western Wall \u2018occupied Palestinian territory.\u2019\u201d \u201cSeriously?\u201d Netanyahu wrote.

    "text": "Remote Nevada Quakes Could Have Been a Disaster By scott sonner, associated press RENO, Nev. \u0097 Dec 28, 2016, 6:44 PM ET 0 Shares Email A trio of significant earthquakes that struck a remote part of western Nevada early Wednesday were big enough to cause as much as $1 billion in damage if they had been centered beneath a big city, a leading expert said Wednesday. The first of two magnitude-5.7 quakes that began shortly after midnight and a third that registered 5.5 resulted in no injuries or reports of significant damage. The epicenter was east of the Sierra range and the Nevada-California line near rural Hawthorne about 100 miles southeast of Lake Tahoe and 90 miles south of Reno. \"Thankfully, it's not underneath a big city because a sequence of 5.7s could certainly do a lot of damage,\" said Graham Kent, director of the University of Nevada's Seismological Laboratory. \"If you put this underneath Reno, we are probably looking at a $1 billion event, probably with some fatalities and many casualties,\" he told The Associated Press. \"It's much better to be beneath a ranch 20 miles outside of Hawthorne.\" In addition to Reno and Carson City, Wednesday's biggest temblor was felt in Las Vegas and more than 200 miles away in San Francisco, according to the university's Seismological Lab in Reno. The first magnitude-5.7 event struck at 12:18 a.m., followed by another 5.7 four minutes later 18 miles southwest of Hawthorne. A magnitude-5.5 quake hit the same area at 1:13 a.m., the U.S. Geological Survey said. The biggest quakes were followed by a series of smaller aftershocks, including two in the magnitude-4 range and at least a dozen larger than magnitude 3. The Mineral County sheriff's office in Hawthorne said staffers felt the quakes, but they had no reports of injury or damage. The quakes apparently triggered burglar alarms at two businesses, and they caused a rock slide but didn't affect travel on a nearby highway, the office said. Kent said it should serve as a reminder that Nevadans live in the third-most seismically active state in the nation behind California and Alaska. \"It's another wake-up call,\" said Kent, who said they have been studying the seismically active region around Hawthorne since a swarm of thousands of smaller earthquakes were recorded there over a two-month period in 2011. \"Obviously we don't have a crystal ball,\" he said Wednesday. \"If there is a fourth or fifth event, I wouldn't be surprised. But if there wasn't, I wouldn't be surprised.\" Earthquake magnitudes are calculated according to ground motion recorded on seismographs. An increase in one full number \u2014 from 6.5 to 7.5, for example \u2014 means the quake's magnitude is 10 times as great. A quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage. The magnitude 6.7 quake that struck Los Angeles in January 1994 caused an estimated $40 billion in damage and killed 72 people. Glenn Pomeroy, CEO of the California Earthquake Authority, said Wednesday that they don't expect the most recent Nevada temblors to generate claims from any holders of earthquake insurance policies. \"We were very fortunate that this recent shaking was not more severe and that it was centered in sparsely populated areas,\" Pomeroy said. \"But as with the earthquake that occurred along the Northern California coast earlier this month, and the Southern California earthquake swarm this fall, these events remind us that we live in earthquake country and that we all should take steps to be prepared.\" 0 Shares ",

Pasadena Police Chief Phillip Sanchez, flanked by Special Agent in Charge Rob Savage of the U.S. Secret Service, left, and Pasadena Fire Chief Bertral Washington, speaks Wednesday at Pasadena City Hall ahead of the Rose Parade. (Maya Lau / Los Angeles Times) Maya Lau Contact Reporter Police plan to use\u00a0parked patrol cars and heavy, water-filled barricades at key crossings along the\u00a05.5-mile Tournament of Roses parade route in response to recent terrorist attacks that used\u00a0trucks as weapons. In announcing the new security measures on Wednesday,\u00a0Pasadena Police Chief Phillip L. Sanchez stressed there was no known threat to the parade, the Rose Bowl Game\u00a0or the city of Pasadena. But he said the changes were made in an abundance of caution, adding that parade security is frequently tweaked as terrorism tactics and threats evolve. The barriers will\u00a0be placed at more than 50 intersections along the route. \u201cWhen [attackers]\u00a0use vehicles as a ramming tool, typically it\u2019s because they\u2019re able to generate a lot of speed. So we\u2019re trying to take the speed out of that equation,\u201d Sanchez said. Twelve people died and dozens\u00a0more were hurt when a truck plowed into a Berlin market last week. A similar truck attack occurred in Nice, France, earlier in the year, killing 86\u00a0and injuring hundreds. Police and counterterrorism officials have been discussing ways to guard against truck attacks since the Nice attack. Officials have said the incident exposed vulnerabilities when large crowds gather in one area. The new measures in Pasadena were announced as police outlined the more typical security rules for the Jan. 1 parade: No drones. No selfie sticks. No umbrellas. The list of \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d has grown longer for those who plan to enter secure areas of the Rose Parade\u00a0and Rose Bowl this year, but officials say the security measures are crucial for an event that draws 700,000 people or more to the streets of Pasadena. (Gale Holland) Sanchez said the barricade plan already was in place before the Berlin attack earlier this month. Drivers should be aware of the barricades, and all visitors should allow extra time navigating to the events, Sanchez said. Since the Nice massacre, security officials have been discussing ways of preventing truck attacks. The Rose Parade, given its geographic size and the number of visitors, could pose greater challenges than protecting smaller venues or specific buildings. At high-level government facilities and even the Academy Awards in Hollywood, approaching vehicles must zigzag through series of barriers that prevent any vehicle from building up speed by driving directly down the road. Since Timothy McVeigh used a Ryder rental truck packed with ammonium\u00a0nitrate to attack\u00a0the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people, counterterrorism officials have run scenarios with trucks entering\u00a0downtown L.A. and\u00a0Los Angeles International Airport and being detonated. The heightened security measures in Pasadena, which also will include security checkpoints for ticketed parade patrons and walk-through metal detectors for those going to the game, underscore a \u201cnew normal\u201d for the public holiday celebration, Sanchez said. He urged people to be \u201cminimalists\u201d and leave their pets, firearms \u2014 even if licensed \u2014\u00a0and anything extraneous at home, even for those not entering protected zones. \u201cYou can see how serious we are about this event. We are well-prepared. Our efforts are well-refined. This is not new ground for us,\u201d he added. Sanchez said about 1,500 officers \u2014 including local police as well as Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies and agents from several federal law enforcement organizations \u2014 will be patrolling the area in uniform and in plainclothes. He added that many security measures \u201cwill be visible and obvious to the public, but many will not be.\u201d Officials are urging residents to use the public-safety mobile app Nixle and to text \u201cROSEPARADE\u201d to 888 777 to receive updates about events. Text-message technology can be helpful because it uses a different data channel than Web browsing on mobile devices, in case of an outage, Pasadena spokesman William H. Boyer said. A full list of security recommendations for the events can be found at the Tournament of Roses website .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An old rule may save the Rose Parade from rain , a woman trekked 26 miles through the snow after her family got stranded in the Grand Canyon, developers like Rick Caruso make huge donations \u00a0to city officials, and Carrie Fisher remembered .\u00a0 Caption Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caught on video: man breaks into Palmdale home, steals Christmas presents from under tree Caption Hypodermic needles and syringes washing up in Newport Beach Hypodermic needles and syringes\u00a0have been washing ashore in Newport Beach at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, an area that see a high degree of flotsam and jetsam following storms.

    "text": "Fentanyl Outpaces Heroin as the Deadliest Drug on Long Island By KEVIN DEUTSCH Continue reading the main story Photo Kristin Clarino, a toxicologist in the Suffolk County medical examiner\u2019s office in Hauppauge, handling recently tested samples of fentanyl. The drug has killed at least 220 people on Long Island in 2016. Credit Johnny Milano for The New York Times An anesthetic commonly used for surgery has surpassed heroin to become the deadliest drug on Long Island, killing at least 220 people there in 2016, according to medical examiners\u2019 records. The drug, fentanyl, is a synthetic opioid, which can be 100 times more potent than morphine. The numbers from Long Island are part of a national pattern, as fentanyl fatalities have already surpassed those from heroin in other parts of the country, including New England , as its use has skyrocketed. Part of the reason for the increase is economic \u2014 because fentanyl can be manufactured in the lab, it is much cheaper and easier than cultivating heroin. In New York City, more than 1,000 people are expected to die from drug overdoses this year \u2014 the first recorded four-digit death total in city history, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . Nearly half of all unintentional drug overdose deaths in the city since July have involved fentanyl, the health department said. The medical examiners of Long Island\u2019s two counties, Nassau and Suffolk , compiled the new numbers. \u201cFentanyl has surpassed heroin as the most commonly detected drug in fatal opioid overdoses,\u201d Dr. Michael J. Caplan, the Suffolk County medical examiner, said in a written statement about the statistics , which were obtained by The New York Times ahead of their release. \u201cThe influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl from overseas is a nationwide issue that requires a multidisciplinary intervention from all levels of government.\u201d Continue reading the main story Nationwide, recorded deaths from opioids surpassed 30,000 in 2015 , according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And overdoses caused by synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased by 72.2 percent in 2015 over 2014 \u2014 one of the deadliest year-over-year surges for any drug in United States history, the same data shows. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As recently as three years ago, few people outside the medical profession or law enforcement had even heard of fentanyl, which is legally prescribed in the form of transdermal patches or lozenges. But drug dealers have been lacing heroin with fentanyl for years, just to fill out the packets and save on the heroin \u2014 with or without the user\u2019s knowledge. At the same time, many drug users seek out fentanyl because it gives them a higher high and the thrill of using something so risky, although often they do not know exactly what they are shooting up. In a statement responding to the overdose data, James J. Hunt, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s New York Division, said that seizures of fentanyl had increased drastically in the last five years. \u201cNot only are drug traffickers mixing it with heroin for street distribution,\u201d he said, \u201cbut drug suppliers are sending it in bulk form for resellers to sell in pill form or in bulk powder.\u201d Prescription fentanyl is used to treat cancer pain and as an anesthetic for surgery. Even small amounts of it can be deadly. The drug is so powerful that law enforcement officers have to wear gloves when searching for it, as just a tiny bit can get into the skin and, depending on the amount, can be fatal. Document: Suffolk County Opioid Deaths \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen as much of a drug this strong on the black market before,\u201d said Jeffrey Sheridan, an Oyster Bay, N.Y., resident and addiction counselor whose 34-year-old nephew died from a fentanyl overdose on Staten Island in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially the serial killer of drugs. It\u2019s not something you can use for any kind of duration and survive.\u201d Fentanyl was the drug that killed Prince in April. On Long Island, America\u2019s most densely populated suburban region, opioids of all kinds killed at least 464 people in 2016, the medical examiners\u2019 records show. Hundreds of additional drug overdose analyses are pending. \u201cToo many young people have fallen victim,\u201d the Nassau County executive, Edward Mangano, said of the new data in a written statement. The Nassau County medical examiner, Dr. Tamara Bloom, did not comment on the new numbers. In New York City, as of June, there were 184 fentanyl-related overdose deaths recorded \u2014 more than in all of 2015, health department records show. Since then, the number of fatal 2016 overdoses involving fentanyl has surged to about 500, according to the department data. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Fentanyl is increasingly being manufactured by Mexican drug cartels , according to the D.E.A., or is cooked up in labs in the United States . It is being sold by dealers in New York City and on Long Island, according to Mr. Hunt, the D.E.A. special agent. Some users who purchase it believe they are actually buying prescription pain pills like oxycodone or hydrocodone, or heroin alone \u2014 drugs far less potent than fentanyl. A user can fatally overdose within moments of snorting, injecting or swallowing the drug, authorities said. One recovering addict said the drug is so powerful, he can no longer get high from heroin alone. \u201cWithout the fentanyl, shooting heroin\u2019s like shooting water \u2014 you build up a tolerance,\u201d said Andrew Giordano, 26, of Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, who overdosed on a fentanyl-heroin mixture in February and is now in a treatment program. Paramedics used a double dose of the lifesaving opioid antidote naloxone to revive him, he said. Because the drug is so strong, they need to use about twice as much naloxone to save you, Mr. Giordano said. \u201cSometimes, it doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d Mr. Sheridan, the Long Island addiction counselor who lost his nephew to fentanyl, said the number of addicts using the drug in the city and suburbs was \u201castonishing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the scariest thing any of us who work in addiction recovery has seen,\u201d he said. Correction: December 28, 2016 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the proportion of drug overdose deaths in New York City that could be attributed to fentanyl. It is nearly half since July, not over half the number this year. Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook JonBenet Ramsey's brother is suing CBS for $750 million for ruining his reputation. (Photo: AP) DENVER (AP) \u2014 The older brother of JonBenet Ramsey is suing CBS and others for $750 million, saying his reputation was ruined after a television series that concluded he killed his 6-year-old sister two decades ago. In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Burke Ramsey claims that the network, its production company and the experts interviewed in the six-part series on the unsolved murder conspired to defame him for publicity and profit. The six-part television docuseries The Case of JonBenet Ramsey\u00a0aired in September ahead of the 20th anniversary of JonBenet's death. The beauty pageant star was found dead in the basement of her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, the day after Christmas in 1996. A prosecutor cleared her parents and brother in 2008 based on DNA evidence. But the district attorney currently overseeing the case has said it was premature to exonerate the Ramseys and ordered additional tests using new DNA testing technology that authorities hope will further the investigation. JonBenet's 'socially awkward' brother breaks his silence Police have collected and studied thousands of pieces of evidence and say the case remains open. CBS spokesman Dustin Smith declined to comment on the lawsuit, which is the second Burke Ramsey has filed over the television series. In October, Ramsey, 29, sued a forensic pathologist featured on the show who said he bludgeoned his sister to death. The pathologist is also named in the latest lawsuit, which was filed in Michigan, where Burke Ramsey lives. 'The Case Of: JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey' pins her death on her brother Burke The new lawsuit says CBS and its featured experts set out to conduct a \"sham reinvestigation\" of the murder with \"the preconceived the story line\" that Ramsey killed his sister and conspired with his parents to cover it up. \"The accusation that Burke Ramsey killed his sister was based on a compilation of lies, half-truths, manufactured information, and the intentional omission and avoidance of truthful information about the murder of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey,\" the lawsuit says. 4987 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 34 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iFVSmL NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

In dry years, frequently less than 2 0 percent of the rivers complete the trip toward the Bay estuary, straining fish populations including the storied chinook salmon runs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The State Water Resources Control Board wants to raise the flow of the San Joaquin and the tributary Merced, Stanislaus and Tuolumne Rivers to 40 percent of their natural flow during the critical spring months. But that target seems only to have angered both sides in the debate. Environmental groups say it\u2019s too low ; farmers and leaders in the valley say it would cripple their economies. \u201cYou are the grim reaper,\u201d Assemblyman Adam Gray, whose district includes Merced, told members of the board at one of a series of public hearings in the San Joaquin Valley this month. \u201cWater is life in this region, and you appear to have no other purpose than to take that life away.\u201d No matter the final shape of the plan, state officials acknowledge it will have major consequences for wildlife, businesses and jobs. (The state has estimated a $64 million hit to the farming economy; agricultural leaders say it would be much higher.) \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with this very complex puzzle,\u201d said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the water resources board. \u201cThere\u2019s no sweet spot here.\u201d Photo Tractors lined a street in Merced after farmers held a rally in protest of the Bay-Delta plan this month. Credit Merced County Farm Bureau At the public hearing in Merced this month, a standing-room-only crowd showed up to hear from the board and voice their concerns. Outside, about 30 tractors paraded through the streets in protest with signs that read: \u201cFarmers Fed-Up.\u201d Louie Bandoni, an almond farmer, was among them. Speaking by phone outside the hearing, he said it felt as if state leaders were trying to put farmers out of business over a few fish. Advertisement ",

Jones , USA TODAY 4:40 p.m. EST December 28, 2016 91k Shares x Share Ariana Grande felt objectified after an encounter with one of Mac Miller's fans. She took to Twitter to explain her feelings on the matter. Keri Lumm (@thekerilumm) reports. Buzz60 Ariana Grande has a Problem with our culture's reductive view of women, and she\u2019s not going to be silent about it anymore. In a message posted to Twitter Tuesday night, Grande shared that she and her beau, The Way collaborator\u00a0Mac Miller, were picking up food when they had a run-in with one of Miller\u2019s fans. \"He was loud and excited and by the time M was seated in the driver\u2019s seat, he was literally almost in the car with us,\" Grande explained . \"I thought all of this was cute and exciting until he said, 'Ariana is sexy as hell, man. I see you. I see you hitting that!\" For Grande, being discussed as if she were not present \u2014 and being reduced to a \"piece of meat\" in the process \u2014 left her feeling \"sick and objectified.\" But the singer, who admits that she\u2019s been \" really quiet and hurt since that moment ,\" says she refuses to recoil from the broader issue the incident reflects: The pervasive dehumanization of women. \"Things like (this) happen all the time and are the kinds of moments that contribute to women's sense of fear and inadequacy,\" she wrote . \"We need to talk about these moments openly because they are harmful and they live on inside of us as shame,\" she continued. \"We need to share and be vocal when something makes us feel uncomfortable because if we don\u2019t, it will just continue.\" In response to a fan who argued that Grande objectified herself in her music, Grande outlined the difference between women practicing agency over their bodies and their sexuality and men viewing them as parts and encroaching on their autonomy. \"Women expressing sexuality is often mistaken for 'hi come disrespect me,' and that\u2019s just not the case,\" Grande wrote . \"Women (and men) can express themselves however they\u2019d like!!! Even loving sex!! This is not an invitation to be disrespected.\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hti31G Most Popular ",

Pruitt's outspoken criticism of climate change and his close ties to the energy industry have raised concerns about his ability to lead the agency. Sue Ogrocki/AP Democratic senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee say Donald Trump's choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency should reveal his connections with energy insiders before his confirmation hearings get underway. In the letter dated Tuesday, the senators told Scott Pruitt, currently Oklahoma's attorney general, they were concerned about his close ties to energy lobbyists and wanted him to disclose lists of donors who contributed to a nonprofit organization that took funds from a network connected to the Koch brothers. Pruitt is an outspoken critic of climate change and has sued the Obama administration over the EPA's Clean Power Plan. The letter was signed by five Democrats plus independent Bernie Sanders. \"We have been troubled that as Attorney General of Oklahoma you used, nearly verbatim, industry talking points in official correspondence your office sent to EPA concerning EPA's estimation of methane pollution in your state,\" said the letter, signed by Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Cory Booker, Ben Cardin and Sanders. \"What that conduct says about your ability to lead EPA in a manner that is not beholden to special or secret interests is a subject we expect will receive a full airing during your confirmation hearing,\" the letter continued.

Roof told U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel at a hearing Wednesday he still plans to act as his own lawyer when the penalty phase of his federal death penalty trial begins next Tuesday. Dylann Roof found guilty in Charleston church massacre Gergel told Roof to talk to his grandfather, who is a lawyer, and other family members one last time. He said Roof can change his mind and bring back his attorneys up until opening statements next week. There also was argument from Roof about mystery evidence, like a photograph prosecutors want to show and video from jailhouse visits. Specifics were not given in court. Gergel scheduled a hearing Wednesday in federal court to hear motions before the penalty phase in Roof\u2019s trial starts next week. Roof is now acting as his own lawyer after letting go of his defense attorneys after a jury convicted him of 33 counts of hate crimes and obstruction of justice earlier this month. Roof\u2019s lawyers said they think he got rid of them because they wanted to present what Roof thought was embarrassing evidence seeking to get the same jury to spare his life. Courtroom sketch of Dylann Roof\u2019s trial in Charleston, South Carolina. Close Robert Maniscalco In a closing argument during the guilt phase of Roof\u2019s trial, defense attorney David Bruck conceded that Roof killed the victims and even praised the FBI investigation, but he also argued Roof was a suicidal, impressionable loner who never grasped the gravity of what he did. He\u00a0 asked jurors to consider \u00a0what was going on in his head as he\u00a0 planned the killings . The defense put up no witnesses. They tried to present evidence about his mental state, but the judge ruled it didn\u2019t have anything to do with his guilt or innocence.\u00a0 A prosecutor said that Roof was full of hate and \u201cimmense racial ignorance\u201d when he carried out the attack. In his closing argument, assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams mocked Roof for calling himself brave in his racist-filled journal and his\u00a0 confession to the FBI , saying the real bravery came from the victims who tried to stop him as he fired 77 bullets. 17 Photos South Carolina church shooting victims \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Speaking briefly with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump said that phone carrier Sprint will bring 5,000 jobs back from overseas. \u201cThey have taken them from other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are bringing them back to the United States.\u201d Sprint confirmed the announcement on its website, saying the jobs would be added by the end of fiscal 2017 and it would \u201c begin discussions immediately with its business partners, states and cities to determine the right locations in the U.S. to create these jobs.\u201d Details on what types of jobs would be added were not immediately available. See who President-elect Donald Trump wants in his inner circle at the White House \u201cWe are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his Administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,\u201d said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure in the press release. Mr. Trump said that another company, OneWeb, will hire 3,000 people in the U.S., which he called \u201cvery exciting.\u201d OneWeb is a satellite network aimed at providing affordable internet access. Mr. Trump said the deal \u201cwas done through\u201d SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a Japanese billionaire. The pair met in New York earlier this month, and announced together that SoftBank -- which is Sprint\u2019s largest shareholder and has invested in OneWeb -- would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and planned to create 50,000 jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear whether the 8,000 jobs announced Wednesday are included in that 50,000 figure. The 5,000 jobs at Sprint are part of that commitment but will be funded by the carrier, not Son, Bloomberg reported. OneWeb founder and executive chairman Greg Wyler said that a recent infusion of cash from Son allowed the company to accelerate its production process, resulting in 3,000 jobs added across its supply chain. OneWeb\u2019s own staff would rise from 200 to about 1,000, he said. Wyler credited Mr. Trump with persuading Son to increase SoftBank\u2019s investment in OneWeb, thereby speeding up the production process. He added that he was optimistic about an improved business climate in the U.S. under the new administration, including lower corporate tax rates and a simpler tax code. ",

Jay Josker/Canisius High School Email BUFFALO, N.Y. -- It took more than 70 years to happen, but a World War II veteran\u2019s photograph has finally joined those of his high school classmates. Ladislaus \u201cWalter\u201d Kostrzewski had accumulated enough credits to graduate early from Canisius High School in Buffalo in January 1944. But by the time his classmates received their diplomas in June, the 18-year-old had already been drafted and was serving in the Army Air Forces. When the frame containing Class of 1944\u2019s senior portraits was hung in a hallway at the all-boys Catholic school, Kostrzewski\u2019s photo wasn\u2019t among the images of graduates in tuxedos. That changed Tuesday, when school officials held a ceremony to unveil a new class photo that includes the 90-year-old veteran\u2019s portrait in uniform, taken from his World War II military identification. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Kristopher Radder, AP) A powerful winter storm will unleash heavy, wet snow and howling winds across portions of New England from late Thursday through midday Friday, with blizzard conditions possible in some areas. Much of New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine should see a foot of snow, with nearly two feet expected in some spots, the National Weather Service said. \"This looks to be a high-impact storm with power outages and significant drifting issues likely,\" the weather service warned. The storm will cause \"extensive travel disruptions\"\u00a0Thursday and Friday, AccuWeather said. A snowstorm is classified as a blizzard when it contains\u00a035-mph winds and blowing or drifting snow that\u00a0reduces visibility\u00a0to a quarter-mile or less, with both conditions persisting for\u00a0at least three hours.

This is mainly a snow\u00a0event for interior New England. The Boston and\u00a0Providence areas won't see much accumulation, but winds could gust up to 50 mph. Most of the heavily populated Interstate-95 Northeast corridor south of Boston will likely see rain, according to the Weather Channel, which named the storm Fortis. Elsewhere, cold winds blowing across the relatively mild Great Lakes will also dump snow in the snow belts of Ohio, New York State and Pennsylvania over the next couple of days.\u00a0Many of these areas could tally 6 inches or more of snow by Friday night. In the West, heavy snowfall will hit the higher elevations of the Washington Cascades, along with the mountains of northern Idaho and western Wyoming, the weather service said.

    "text": "Spare a Dime? Cities Install Meters to Combat Panhandling By pat eaton-robb, associated press NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u0097 Dec 28, 2016, 10:44 AM ET 0 Shares Email In cities across the country, parking-style meters collect loose change from donors in an attempt to cut down on panhandling \u2014 a strategy critics argue is wrongheaded and in vain. New Haven is among the latest to install the meters, which sit curbside and collect donations in the form of cash or credit cards for programs that benefit the homeless. The city has four brightly colored meters in areas where panhandling has been a problem and plans to install six more to support local, nonprofit organizations that help the homeless. \"It's meant to generate supplemental funds for homeless services and steer well-meaning, generously donated cash away from the business of panhandling,\" Mayor Toni Harp said. The first meters went up in 2007 in Denver, and other cities have followed suit. They were recently installed in Pasadena, California ; Indianapolis; and Corpus Christi, Texas. \"We get at least one call a month from cities who are looking to replicate the program,\" said Julie Smith, a spokeswoman for Denver's Road Home, which runs the meter program in that city. But some advocates for the homeless say the meters do little to stop the needy from requesting handouts and question whether it's worth the cost to install and maintain them. Panhandling is not illegal, and people who need money will still ask for it, meters or no, said Mark Horvath, a national advocate for the homeless and founder of the advocacy group Invisible People. The meters, he said, reinforce the stereotype that all panhandlers are bums who want money for drugs or booze. \"It's a false stereotype. A huge percentage of people who are panhandling are in housing, but they can't afford to make ends meet,\" he said. \"There are so many better solutions than putting up meters, like the permanent support of affordable housing and a living wage.\" Smith and others acknowledge they have no data or studies to show the meters have reduced panhandling, but say they are still worth installing as part of larger efforts to stem homelessness. Joe Drury, 57, begged for change on a late December morning in Annapolis, Maryland , which has several downtown meters raising money to help defray transportation costs for people residing at a shelter. \"These meters just sit here all day, but nobody gives me nothing,\" Drury said. \"I can sometimes go a whole day without eating.\" In Dade County, Florida , a food and beverage tax provides about $24 million a year as part of a $61 million budget for programs to help the homeless. Meters, by comparison, bring in about $50,000 a year, said Ron Book, the chairman of the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust. The program began a decade ago, and there are now more than 700 meters, many paid for by local businesses and supplemented by larger donation boxes inside many buildings. All of them, he said, help reinforce the message that there is a better way to address the problem of homelessness than throwing money into a panhandler's cup. \"Half the people, in my opinion, who panhandle in Miami and Dade County are not homeless; they have a place to go at night,\" Book said. Some of the homeless, he said, \"I assure you, are not using that spare change to buy services, beds or food.\" Orlando, Florida, has collected just $2,450.07 in donations since putting up a dozen meters in 2011. That includes just over $181 this year. Thomas Chatmon Jr., executive director of Orlando's downtown redevelopment board and community redevelopment agency, said officials anticipated the program would not result in a financial windfall. There was very little cost to install the meters, which were donated and are emptied by the city's parking services on normal rounds, he said. \"It's just a very small part of a comprehensive and robust approach to ending homelessness,\" he said. \"It's offering people an option for giving who may not be comfortable dealing physically with people who they don't know.\" Denver has supplemented the meters with collection boxes near security checkpoints at the airport and recently began a program that allows people to text donations. Those programs combined bring in more than $100,000 annually. Cities can increase the money raised by the meters by making them visible and recognizable, Book said. In Miami, an artist volunteered to design its colorful meters to make them visible. \"And I can tell you that panhandlers don't like my meters because it gives people an alternative to dumping money into their buckets, cups and hats,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Natalia Kolesnikova, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is preparing to penalize Russia over the hacking of Democratic officials during this year's presidential election\u00a0and could take action very soon, officials said Wednesday. Anticipating an imminent announcement,\u00a0Russia continued to deny the hacking allegations and condemned reports of new sanctions as \"provocation directed by the White House.\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters : \"To be honest, we are tired of lie about the 'Russian hackers,'\u00a0which is being poured down in the United States from the very top.\" President Obama told reporters earlier this month he would retaliate against the Russians\u00a0but noted that his actions may or may not be made public. \"Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you,\" the president said. The Obama administration and\u00a0U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of getting involved in the election in an effort to help Donald Trump win. Read more: Obama: 'We handled it the way it should have been handled\u2019 Trump has questioned whether Russia\u00a0was\u00a0behind\u00a0the hacking\u00a0of Democratic officials' email acounts, and he said Democrats are pushing the story in order to explain away Hillary Clinton's loss. Two Republican senators \u2014\u00a0Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and\u00a0John McCain of Arizona \u2014\u00a0said they support new sanctions on Russia, but they should be imposed by the next Congress and the incoming Trump administration. \u201cThe bottom line is you need to hit Russia in a sustained fashion,\" Graham told Fox News, \"so if Obama tries to do something going out the door that\u2019s not sustained, then you send the wrong signal.\" Graham\u00a0called for sanctions on Russia's energy sector\u00a0and said that Russia President Vladimir Putin should be singled out. McCain, also on Fox News, said: \u201cMake sure that Vladimir Putin knows that this kind of action in the future will be responded to, so far he\u2019s gotten away with whatever he has wanted to do. We need a firm policy.\" In a White House news conference earlier this month, Obama said the response to Russia should be done \"in a thoughtful, methodical way,\" predicting \"an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future, but does not create problems for us.\" Posted!

Monroe County Sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Becky Herrin says Zack Sowder and Brent Shishido, both 18, and Jacob Sowder, 16 - all of Orange County, California - were perched on the overturned hull, their life jackets trapped under the 22-foot vessel, when help arrived Tuesday. Marine Deputy James Hagar spotted the teens in waters about 2 \u00bd miles off the coast and brought them safely ashore in his patrol boat. A photo released by the sheriff\u2019s office showed the teens seated on a small section of the hull that still jutted above the waters. \u201cFortunately they knew their rough location. They were lucky they had a cell signal,\u201d sheriff\u2019s officials wrote on their Facebook page. Hagar had just taken his boat out of the water around 3:15 p.m. Tuesday when he got the call about the stranded teenagers. \u201cHe quickly put the boat back in the water,\u201d Herrin said in a statement. Teens saved from capsized vessel  Marine Deputy James Hager found and rescued three Orange County, California teens... Posted by MCSO - Florida Keys on\u00a0 Tuesday, December 27, 2016 Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission investigator David Bingham joined Hagar in the search for the boys. \u201cThey spent some time looking, but they found the three boys and loaded them on board the patrol boat, bringing them safely back to shore,\u201d Herrin said. The teens had anchored the 22-foot rented boat on the Atlantic side of Little Torch Key, which is some 30 miles north of Key West. Later Tuesday, Zack Sowder showed his sense of humor on social media. \u201cMake sure your bilge works before you run five miles offshore and realize it\u2019s too late,\u201d Zack Sowder tweeted Tuesday night, along with two photos from the scene. \u201cOther than that great day on the water.\u201d Make sure your bilge works before you run 5 miles offshore and realize its to late... other than that great day on the water\uf3a3 pic.twitter.com/glcde68S6z \u2014 Zack Sowder (@Sowdaaaa) December 28, 2016 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., on Wednesday. Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump and @realDonaldTrump are contradicting each other. Wednesday afternoon, Trump emerged from his Mar-a-Lago resort to tell reporters that he and President Obama had spoken on the phone and had \"a very nice conversation.\" \"I appreciate that he called me,\" Trump said. The comment came hours after Trump blasted Obama on Twitter. Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 But asked by reporters Wednesday afternoon how that transition was going, Trump said, \"I think very, very smoothly. Very good. You don't think so?\" (A \"not\" was not forthcoming in real life.) President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences The Obama tiff \u2014 or non-tiff, depending on which Trump you listen to \u2014 is the latest sign of a disparity between Trump's public statements and his social media statements. There's long been a serious personal rift between the two, but with Trump set to take the oath of office in less than a month, the stakes are higher . Presidents' words move markets and can create global tension. Take Trump's recent tweet about nuclear weapons , which quickly ricocheted around the world despite Trump aides' efforts to minimize the importance of the statement. On Wednesday Trump also highlighted a Japanese tech mogul's plans to create 8,000 new jobs in the U.S. Article continues after sponsorship Is Trump's Deal With Carrier A Form Of Crony Capitalism? Trump had previously appeared with Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower, to announce Son's promise to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs. Wednesday, Trump offered what appeared to be more specifics as part of that plan: 5,000 jobs that Sprint will bring back into the U.S. from overseas. Son's company, SoftBank, owns about 80 percent of Sprint. \"They're taking them from other countries. They're bringing them back to the United States,\" Trump said. In a statement on its website, Sprint said it \"anticipates these jobs will support a variety of functions across the organization, including its customer care and sales teams.\" But the jobs aren't finalized yet \u2014 the company said it will \"begin discussions immediately with its business partners\" and aims to fill the positions by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. \"We are excited to work with President-Elect Trump and his Administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,\" Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement. \"We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans.\" The additional 3,000 jobs come from a $1 billion SoftBank investment in OneWeb, a Virginia company that will set up a factory in Florida to manufacture satellites to provide broadband Internet access. Trump said the jobs are being created \"because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope\" around his election. He had previously taken credit for the Carrier Corp.'s keeping hundreds of jobs in Indiana \u2014 which came with tax concessions from the state where Trump's incoming vice president, Mike Pence, currently serves as governor. Correction Dec. 28, 2016 An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the company named by Donald Trump as OneWorld. It is OneWeb. ",

Adrian Duane Johnson, 29, is facing first-degree murder and other charges in the death of 46-year-old Tricia McCauley, who was last heard from around 1 p.m. on Christmas, reports CBS affiliate WUSA .\u00a0 Tricia McCauley WUSA-TV Johnson, a Maryland resident, has an extensive criminal record and court records show he was ordered to undergo GPS monitoring last week. However, police spokeswoman Karimah Bilal said Wednesday that Johnson wasn\u2019t wearing a monitor when he was arrested. Johnson was charged with theft earlier this month, and online court records show he was released Dec. 20. The judge ordered him to appear the next day to enroll in GPS monitoring, but according to WUSA he did not show up to be fitted with the device. The attorney listed in the theft case didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment. Around 10:50 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect driving McCauley\u2019s car, a white Toyota Scion, from a Washington CVS drugstore, police say. Tuesday, police confirmed that her body was found in her car in front of that CVS.\u00a0 Police do not believe McCauley and the suspect knew each other.\u00a0 McCauley lived in Washington for nearly 30 years. Her friends and family describe her as a beloved yoga teacher, actor and herbalist. \u201cShe is one of the kindest and most gentle people that I know,\u201d said Kate Debelack, McCauley\u2019s friend. \u201cSo to think that someone could have harmed her is awful.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Carrie Fisher presents her mother, Debbie Reynolds, the Life Achievement Award at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Jan. 25, 2015. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) RELATED: See the full Obituary for Reynolds here. Her death was announced several hours after she was rushed to Cedar-Sinai Medical Center from her son\u2019s home in Beverly Hills. A law enforcement source said Reynolds complained of breathing problems. Reynolds was one of Hollywood\u2019s top actresses and singers in the 1950s and 1960s, and a celebrity whose sometimes rocky personal life was chronicled by the media. She continued to act regularly into the 1990s. When Reynolds was young, she moved to Burbank with her family and quickly started performing in school plays and even with the town symphony. She won the Miss Burbank beauty contest at 16 and captured the attention of Warner Bros. and MGM . Reynolds signed with Warner Bros. but only managed to make 1950\u2019s \u201cThe Daughter of Rosie O\u2019Grady.\u201d She had better luck at MGM after she signed with the studio in 1950, causing a sensation in her short but memorable scene as the boop-oop-a-doop singer Helen Kane in the 1950 musical biopic \u201cThree Little Words.\u201d That same year she and Carleton Carpenter hit the charts with the song \u201cAba Daba Honeymoon\u201d from their film \u201cTwo Weeks With Love.\u201d Her stock in Hollywood rose when Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen cast her as the female lead in their 1952 musical classic \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Reynolds made several other musicals at the studio, including 1953\u2019s \u201cI Love Melvin\u201d and \u201cGive a Girl a Break.\u201d She got a chance at more dramatic fare with 1956\u2019s \u201cThe Catered Affair\u201d with Bette Davis. Reynolds started to freelance in 1957 and found success at Universal with the comedy \u201cTammy and the Bachelor.\u201d She also had a No. 1 hit tune with \u201cTammy.\u201d She earned her only best actress Oscar nomination for 1964\u2019s \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown.\u201d She also starred in the 1967 hit comedy \u201cDivorce American Style.\u201d On TV, Reynolds headlined her first sitcom, \u201cThe Debbie Reynolds Show,\u201d in 1969, but it lasted only one season. Later, Reynolds turned to Broadway, where she starred in the 1973 revival of \u201cIrene,\u201d and began performing in nightclubs, which she still does today. She also guest-starred on countless TV series, including \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cThe Love Boat,\u201d and appeared in TV movies such as 1987\u2019s \u201cSadie and Son.\u201d In the 1990s, Reynolds returned to feature films, receiving rave reviews in Albert Brooks\u2019 1996 comedy \u201cMother\u201d and playing the mother of Kevin Kline \u2019s character in 1997\u2019s \u201cIn & Out.\u201d She also appeared as Grace\u2019s mother in several episodes of the NBC comedy \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d Reynolds' personal life has been rockier. She married and divorced singer Eddie Fisher (with whom she had two children, Carrie and Todd Fisher), after he fell for Elizabeth Taylor. In 1960, she married shoe magnate Harry Karl, and after divorcing Karl, wed real estate developer Richard Hamlett in 1985. Her second and third marriages were personal and financial disasters.

    "text": "Nereida Moreno Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Sixty Cook County sheriff's deputies from the court services division are being investigated for allegedly lying about the number of hours they worked, an official with Sheriff Tom Dart 's office said Wednesday. The attendance fraud investigation began \"several months ago\" and will be resolved within the next six weeks, said Cara Smith, chief policy officer for Dart. The deputies being investigated are all salaried employees who receive paid overtime for working in county courthouses, courtrooms and security stations. The group includes supervisors. \"We're continuing with the investigation and will take appropriate action once it's concluded,\" Smith said. There have been at least five investigations into attendance-related fraud or irregularities in the past four years, including a recent probe into the fugitive task force of the central warrants division, Smith said. In September, five deputies from the fugitive task force were suspended without pay and one of those employees, a sergeant, has since resigned. The sheriff's office is seeking termination of the other four employees involved, Smith said. That incident, however, is unrelated to the current investigation in the courthouse division. ",

Hu DNA double helix strand viewed with a phone Stanislaw Pytel / Getty Images Share advertisement Well before the family came in to the Batson Children's Specialty Clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, they knew something was wrong. Their child was born with multiple birth defects, and didn't look like any of its kin. A couple of tests for genetic syndromes came back negative, but Omar Abdul-Rahman, Chief of Medical Genetics at the University of Mississippi, had a strong hunch that the child had Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a rare disease associated with challenging life-long symptoms like speech impediments and seizures. So he pulled out one of his most prized physicians' tools: his cell phone. Using an app called Face2Gene, Abdul-Rahman snapped a quick photo of the child's face. Within a matter of seconds, the app generated a list of potential diagnoses \u2014 and corroborated his hunch. \"Sure enough, Mowat-Wilson syndrome came up on the list,\" Abdul-Rahman recalls. Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future Abdul-Rahman is a member of Face2Gene's scientific advisory board, and he's one of the many physicians and researchers working with its developers to identify syndromes and diseases using facial recognition software. Like many of the 7,000 known rare diseases out there, Mowat-Wilson syndrome has a specific facial signature: square face, pointed chin, widely set eyes. Face2Gene's algorithms map points on a patient's face, compare those points with a database containing points from thousands of other faces, and suggest potential diagnoses. Facial recognition app Face2Gene is being used by doctors to diagnose rare diseases. Courtesy FDNA Doing this all with a single photo is a neat trick, but the real power of the app lies in its long-term potential. Face2Gene's system uses a machine-learning algorithm, meaning it learns from every new face it scans. The more data it acquires through its use, scientists hope, the more accurate the diagnoses. This is the latest medical technology that leverages the power of big data to make better diagnoses and more accurate predictions; other artificial intelligence systems analyze patient symptoms or medical scans to predict cancers and crunch numbers to provide personalized treatments. Early diagnosis of rare diseases can help families seek specialized treatments, yet families often wait years for test results and referrals to specialists. That's because the facial signatures of some rare diseases can be subtle and difficult to diagnose, even for a trained professional. Related: Is Perfecting Artificial Intelligence This Generations Space Race? Most experienced physicians have only seen a handful of patients with a specific rare disease \u2014 hardly enough to notice distinct patterns. \"Only when you have hundreds or thousands of patients can you really say there's a pattern,\" FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman says. \"That's where the computer power comes in.\" Face2Gene is publicly available, but there's still a lot to learn, so its developers recommend only experts use it. When you download the app via the iTunes store, you're asked to certify your credentials as a healthcare professional before you complete signing up. The technology is meant to be a tool to help identify diseases and syndromes; as a result, Face2Gene isn't yet great at recognizing the faces of typically developing children. \"If you take a picture of a normal individual, it will still try to match them to the closest possible syndrome,\" Abdul-Rahman says. \"If you're inexperienced and you use it on a random individual, it will suggest a diagnosis anyway.\" Face2Gene's predictions could lead an inexperienced user to false positives; it takes an experienced professional to take the app's suggestions and interpret them in the context of other clinical symptoms, or to order genetic tests. Still, it could help a wider range of medical professionals make diagnoses. Pediatricians, nurse practioners, and physicians' assistants may all see patients with genetic disorders, and Face2Gene could help those professionals screen children, says Rich Dineen, genetic counselor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Dineen has not yet used the app himself, so he's skeptical it will replace years of medical experience \u2014 but he's hopeful it will help the field. \"Any sort of technology we can use to make our job easier is a great thing,\" he says. Related: How the Tech Industry is Tackling the Cancer Moonshot The technology certainly helped Abdul-Rahman and his patient. After getting Face2Gene's opinion, he sent in an order for a genetic test, which verified the child's diagnosis: Mowat-Wilson syndrome. That put an end to the family's long search for a formal diagnosis, he says. \"When the test came back, they were elated to finally have an answer.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg/Getty Images Amazon's personal assistant device Echo, powered by the voice recognition program Alexa, is one of the most popular gifts this holiday season. Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg/Getty Images Amazon's personal assistant device called Echo was one of the most popular gifts this Christmas. But this week, the device grabbed headlines for another reason: Police in Arkansas are trying to use its data in a murder investigation. What we know from court documents is that in November 2015, a man in Arkansas had some friends over at his house to watch a football game and in the morning, one of the friends was found dead in a hot tub in the backyard. Police later charged the man who lived in the house, James Bates, with murder. He has pleaded not guilty. As the police were investigating the crime, they found a number of digital devices in the suspect's house, including an Amazon Echo device that was in the kitchen. They have since seized the device and have apparently gotten some information from it, but what they want to check is what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the device may have recorded around the time of the murder. Article continues after sponsorship An Experiment Shows How Quickly The Internet Of Things Can Be Hacked Here's how the device works: Echo is always listening for the wake, or trigger, word, which is usually \"Alexa.\" But experts say the storage capacity on the actual device is pretty minimal, so only a tiny amount is written and then overwritten as the device listens for the wake word. When the wake word is said \u2014 and the blue light ring lights up \u2014 all the spoken queries get recorded and transmitted to Amazon servers. \"To be clear, Echo is only streaming audio to the cloud when the blue light is on,\" says Amazon spokeswoman Kinley Pearsall. But a number of Echo users have reported a creepy experience of the device turning on and starting to talk without being prompted by the wake word \"Alexa\" \u2014 perhaps mis-hearing or misinterpreting conversations in the room. A Year After San Bernardino And Apple-FBI, Where Are We On Encryption? So in the Arkansas murder case, which was first reported by tech industry news site The Information, the police may be counting on such an accidental recording or something more. They served a search warrant to Amazon for data covering two days around the time of the murder. Amazon has satisfied a portion of the request. According to court documents, the company has provided \"account holder information for James Bates and purchase history.\" However, Amazon declined to share information from its servers. The company has not commented on the specific case, but issued a statement: \"Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us. Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.\" All this may remind you of the Apple-FBI standoff over access to a locked iPhone in the San Bernardino shooting investigation. This isn't exactly the same kind of case, but it's another example of law enforcement turning to a tech company for access to personal data. The Apple-FBI Debate Over Encryption Privacy advocates have long predicted a wave of these kinds of cases \u2014 as we connect more and more things to the Internet and swarm our homes with digital devices, they will become involved in more crime investigations. Interestingly, even in the Arkansas case, investigators are also using information from a smart water meter, alleging that an increase in water use in the middle of the night suggests a possible cleanup around the crime scene. And that's going to be a more common occurrence \u2014 when the data, otherwise seemingly innocuous, could be used to draw inferences or guesses about habits and activities, says Nuala O'Connor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology. \"It's not just one device, it's putting together a whole bunch of different devices to make a case that is, some would argue possibly circumstantial, some would argue is incredibly compelling. And so the question is going to be, how much data is going to be enough to make a foolproof case?\" she says. This has prompted calls for new policies and reviews of legal standards for how tech companies should comply with law enforcement and other government requests. Amazon Wants To Put A Listening Speaker In Your Home Particularly, privacy experts say new focus will fall on how much and how long private data is kept by the companies that create so-called Internet-of-things devices as they become targets of not just investigators, but also hackers and spy agencies. \"We live in the world where we really haven't settled the law or the standard of care for companies that provide in-home devices like that,\" O'Connor says. \"The standards of care \u2014 as companies have more and more really specific information about what goes on inside the home \u2014 has got to be higher and higher.\" And the law, guidelines and standards are far from settled. Besides, there's also a big difference between data ending up in the hands of the company you know you're doing business with and ending up in the hands of the government, she says. Plus \u2014 at least this case is actually following proper court procedure. \"A much larger concern I think for the country is ... how much is the government asking for this behind closed doors\" \u2014 including for investigations into people who haven't been charged with any crimes.

Email FORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 A police dashcam video appears to show a Texas officer shoot a black man as he\u2019s walking away from the officer and not posing any immediate threat. A lawyer for David Collie released a copy of the video showing the July encounter with a Fort Worth officer and a Tarrant County sheriff\u2019s deputy. The officer and deputy were off-duty at the time and working a security detail together at an apartment complex, attorney Nate Washington said Wednesday. He said Collie was shot in the back, leaving him paralyzed. Warning: The following video contains violent imagery. on YouTube Police at the time were searching for two shirtless black men who they believed had committed a robbery near a gas station, Washington said. Authorities said in a news release they issued at the time that Collie pulled a box cutter from his pocket and pointed it at the officers. Collie was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant but a grand jury declined to indict him. Fort Worth police did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment on the incident. Collie, 33, was walking from work to a friend\u2019s apartment when the officers approached him in the patrol vehicle, Washington said. It was the Fort Worth officer who shot Collie, Washington said, and the video appears to show the officer firing his weapon about 10 seconds after exiting the vehicle and as Collie walked away. The video was obtained about three weeks ago from the Tarrant County district attorney\u2019s office through an open-records request, Washington said. The attorney said he released the video Tuesday at a news conference at Collie\u2019s insistence because Collie was tired of comments made to his mother by people assuming he must have done something wrong. Washington said Collie wanted to make clear he \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything to threaten an officer.\u201d Release of the shooting video came just days after the Fort Worth police were in the spotlight over another incident. A cellphone video captured a white Fort Worth officer last week wrestling a black woman to the ground and then arresting her and her two daughters. The officer appeared to be argumentative and escalate the encounter with the woman, who had called police following an encounter between her son and a neighbor. The video has been viewed millions of times. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Secretary of State John Kerry's speech was a \"deep disappointment.\u201d embed Mr. Kerry usually speaks in the careful words of diplomacy, being careful not to publicly name names, or put choices in the harshest terms. He dropped most of those niceties on Wednesday, especially about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government. \u201cThe Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that policies of this government \u2014 which the prime minister himself just described as \u2018more committed to settlements than any in Israel\u2019s history\u2019 \u2014 are leading in the opposite direction, towards one state.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a remarkable moment in the American-Israeli relationship, and it was a remarkable moment for Mr. Kerry. With his presidential hopes dashed after his loss to George W. Bush in the 2004 election, Mr. Kerry saw his time as secretary of state as a chance to make a true change in the Middle East. In three weeks, his near-constant travels around the world will end and his energetic diplomacy will suddenly terminate. He has one major accomplishment under his belt \u2014 the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 but he could not achieve his goals on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, or in the Syrian civil war. Mr. Kerry cast himself as one of Israel\u2019s greatest friends, and cited a lifelong commitment to the country. But he said he had to \u201csave the two-state solution while there was still time.\u201d \u201cWe did not take this decision lightly,\u201d he said of the United Nations vote. For Mr. Kerry, the speech was also a rueful valedictory. As soon as he took over from Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in 2013, he plunged into the tar pit of Middle East peace negotiations with an enthusiasm neither his predecessor nor President Obama shared. The goal was a nine-month negotiation leading to a \u201cfinal status\u201d of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by the summer of 2014.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Here in Pennsylvania, where the health law has brightened the financial outlook of hospitals statewide, many are scrambling to assess how repeal would affect their bottom line and the patients they serve. The stakes are particularly high for safety-net hospitals like Temple, but even more prosperous hospitals face uncertainty after investing in new ways to deliver care under the law. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Temple executives estimate their system could lose as much as $45 million a year if the law were entirely repealed, which would return it to the losses it posted for years before the health law took effect. \u201cWe are the de facto community hospital in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country,\u201d said Robert Lux, the senior vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Temple University Health System, which includes two general hospitals and a cancer center. \u201cAny kind of change like this would not only push Temple University Hospital into financial extremis, it would do the same thing for our entire system.\u201d Not far from Temple, Main Line Health, a nonprofit hospital system in the affluent Philadelphia suburbs, is far better positioned to weather the financial impact of repeal. While Temple has one of the poorest patient populations in the state \u2014 about half of its patients are on Medicaid \u2014 Main Line, which has an outpatient clinic in an upscale mall and another with a fitness center outfitted with filtered saltwater pools, has few Medicaid patients. Still, even hospitals serving affluent populations have reason to be nervous about a future without the health law. Main Line has invested substantially in response to the law\u2019s push to base hospital pay on patient outcomes instead of the amount of medical services provided. Repealing the law would create uncertainty about the future of this new paradigm, which has forced hospitals to rethink how they deliver care. Photo Jason Colston Sr., 36, had no health insurance when he developed MRSA, a drug-resistant infection that got into his bloodstream. He had to be hospitalized at Temple and was able to get Medicaid because of the expansion under Obamacare. Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m dreading the unpredictability,\u201d said John J. Lynch III, Main Line\u2019s president and chief executive. Over all, the health law has improved the financial outlook of Pennsylvania hospitals significantly, even though the state was a year late in expanding Medicaid. The former governor, Tom Corbett, a Republican, initially balked, and the program did not expand here until 2015. Still, hospital operating margins statewide increased to about 5.5 percent on average in 2015, from 4.25 percent in 2014, according to the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. The amount of care provided to patients who cannot pay dropped by 8.6 percent on average. North Philadelphia, where Temple is based, is among the poorest neighborhoods in the nation. Many of its residents live in deep poverty, a census designation that means their income is less than half the federal poverty level of $24,300 for a family of four. That helps explain why Temple is so dependent on Medicaid revenue, and the high stakes of repeal here. Under the health law, hospitals that served a large number of poor and uninsured patients agreed to a series of funding cuts in exchange for getting far more patients with insurance coverage. Temple has lost about $11 million so far in these federal funds, known as disproportionate share payments, Mr. Lux said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But like other hospitals in the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the law, it has made up that revenue in part through the Medicaid expansion. It recorded about 13,000 more visits from patients with Medicaid coverage in 2015, the first year Pennsylvania expanded Medicaid eligibility, and at least as many this year. Still, Temple is barely turning a profit: It had operating income of $3.6 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, despite revenue of $1.7 billion. \u201cYou still have a pretty fragile enterprise,\u201d Mr. Lux said, noting that Medicaid pays hospitals and doctors far less than Medicare and private insurance. \u201cOur current state of stability could be broken pretty quickly.\u201d So, too, could Temple\u2019s efforts to connect its newly insured patients with preventive care instead of waiting until they show up in the emergency room with advanced, expensive illnesses. Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of emergency medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, said he had seen more than a few uninsured people arrive in the emergency room with kidney failure , needing costly dialysis for the rest of their lives because they had lived with high blood pressure for so long. Main Line Health\u2019s financial picture is much stronger, and will most likely remain so even if the health law is repealed and replaced with a program that leaves far fewer people insured. Main Line ended the 2016 fiscal year with $106.8 million in operating income and a 6.5 percent operating margin, compared with Temple\u2019s margin of 0.2 percent. Still, Main Line has invested substantially in efforts to improve the care it provides its patients while lowering the cost, as the Affordable Care Act encourages. As with many hospitals across the country, these efforts \u2014 like preventing readmissions and focusing more heavily on primary care, especially for patients with chronic diseases \u2014 have caused the system\u2019s inpatient population to drop. Photo Robert McNamara with a patient in the emergency department at Temple University Hospital. He said he had seen more than a few uninsured people arrive in the emergency room in kidney failure, needing costly dialysis for the rest of their lives because they had lived with high blood pressure for so long. Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times \u201cAs we decrease our volume, looking at providing care differently, that\u2019s financially impacting us,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. He added that over time, the law\u2019s slowing of Medicare payment increases added up to \u201creal money.\u201d The study commissioned by the hospital associations found that unless the annual increase in Medicare reimbursements is restored to what it was before the health law passed, hospitals will face additional losses of about $290 billion by 2026. In the end, though, Main Line\u2019s far more robust revenue, because of its large number of commercially insured patients, all but guarantee it will not have to worry \u2014 for now \u2014 about cutting programs or plans. It is installing a new electronic records system and has spent $700 million renovating its hospitals over the last few years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a strong payer mix or a healthy bottom line,\u201d Mr. Lynch said, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to do those things.\u201d One major question for Temple and other safety-net hospitals is whether states would restore supplemental funds or programs that defrayed the cost of caring for the uninsured before the health law took effect. Pennsylvania, for example, paid for emergency medical care for certain low-income people who did not qualify for Medicaid. This allowed Temple to be paid for their inpatient care, but often not for the care they needed after being discharged. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that that program would come back,\u201d Mr. Lux said, adding that the program used to pay for about $23 million a year worth of care provided at Temple University Hospital. Mr. Colston, who was still returning daily to Temple for intravenous antibiotics a month after his discharge, would have qualified to have most of his inpatient costs met under the old state-financed program. Paul Fabian, who received a double lung transplant at Temple last year after getting a subsidized private insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act marketplace, would not have qualified at all. Mr. Fabian, who suffered from emphysema and chronic lung failure, said he sold his truck to afford his $262 monthly premiums. \u201cIf you walk into the E.R. they have to help you,\u201d Mr. Fabian, 61, said. \u201cBut if you have a condition like I had, what\u2019s the hospital\u2019s obligation?\u201d Temple officials said that without insurance, Mr. Fabian would have had to endure a two-year waiting period to qualify for Medicare coverage for his disability. \u201cWe were finally in a situation where for most of our patients there was a coverage option,\u201d said Anita Colon, Temple\u2019s director of patient financial services, already speaking about the health law in the past tense. \u201cNow there\u2019s just a total unknown about what will be left.\u201d ",

U.S.-Russian talks on their separate fights against the Islamic State group are improving and becoming more frequent, American officials said. In the discussions, Russia has made clear its counterterrorism priority in Syria is retaking the ancient city of Palmyra, officials said. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File) 0 Shares Email Turkey and Russia are discussing a broader Syrian cease-fire after brokering the deal that evacuated rebel-held eastern Aleppo, Syrian opposition factions said Wednesday, but a number of rebel groups say they won't agree to anything until they get more details. All previous attempts at enforcing a nationwide cease-fire in Syria have failed. The recent warming of ties between Russia and Turkey, who provide crucial support to opposing sides of the war, may prove to be a game changer, but the challenges are immense. The foreign ministers of Turkey, Russia and Iran met in Moscow last week for talks on Syria that pointedly included no Syrians, indicating they prefer to pursue a grand bargain among great powers with stakes in the conflict rather than a domestic settlement between the government and the opposition. An official with one of the factions confirmed to The Associated Press that Russian and Turkish officials were debating a cease-fire proposal that would encompass the whole of Syria. He spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing. Rebels have opposed previous proposals that would allow the government to continue its offensives around the outskirts of the capital, Damascus. Russia's Foreign Ministry said later Wednesday that its embassy in the Syrian capital was hit by mortar fire, blaming the attack on \"extremists\" opposed to a peaceful settlement. It said a mortar round landed in the embassy courtyard without exploding, and another fell in the vicinity. Turkey's Anadolu Agency said Wednesday morning that Ankara and Moscow had reached an agreement, and Turkish media reports quoted Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu as saying that a lasting cease-fire and political solution in Syria are \"close.\" But no details were announced, and there was no confirmation from state officials. Yasin Aktay, the spokesman for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, said the government is pushing for a cease-fire to be in place \"as we enter 2017.\" The Syrian opposition official said factions were holding vigorous discussions over the possibilities, while an official with a different group said the proposal has not been formally presented to the opposition. \"It is difficult to accept or refuse the matter before we look at the details, of course,\" said the official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to prejudge intra-opposition talks. The Anadolu report quoted unnamed officials as saying a plan for a cease-fire \"in all regions\" would be presented to the warring parties. The cease-fire would exclude terrorist organizations, it said, without elaborating on which groups would be left out. It said peace talks in Kazakhstan would proceed under Russia and Turkey's leadership if the cease-fire holds, with the two acting as \"guarantors\" of any deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman confirmed Russia and Turkey were in \"constant contact\" to prepare for planned Syria peace talks in Kazakhstan, but did not comment about the possibility of a cease-fire. Mosayyeb Naimi, a Tehran-based political analyst, said it was unclear whether Turkey could corral Syria's fractured opposition. \"Turkey's ability to convince armed groups to accept the cease-fire is unknown, particularly because Turkey is involved in conflict with some of those groups,\" he said. Naimi added that although the Russians have made initial agreements with Ankara, they may be waiting for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to take office to discuss the U.S. role in the cease-fire process. A top Russian diplomat meanwhile said a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would impose sanctions on Syria for chemical weapons use is unacceptable to Moscow, which has veto power on the council. A resolution drafted by Britain and France, which was obtained by The Associated Press, would impose sanctions on an array of Syrian individuals, organizations and companies allegedly involved in chemical weapons attacks. It would also ban sales of helicopters to Syria. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the state news agency Tass on Wednesday as saying the resolution \"is categorically unacceptable to us. We warn them against attempts to fan tensions in the U.N. Security Council.\" In Syria, activists said at least 20 civilians have been killed in an airstrike on an Islamic State-held village in Deir el-Zour province in eastern Syria. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Wednesday that several unknown warplanes bombed the village of Hajna the night before, killing 12 people from one family and 10 from another. It said at least 10 children were killed. The activist group Deir Ezzor 24 said no one in the two families survived. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana. \u201cIt is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\u201d Heard said. \u201cNow we are seeing it quite frequently.\u201d Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don\u2019t know about CHS, and partly because patients don\u2019t want to admit to using a substance that\u2019s illegal. Recreational marijuana measures pass in four states CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use. That\u2019s what happened with Crowder, who has been off all forms of marijuana for seven months. \u201cNow all kinds of ambition has come back. I desire so much more in life and, at 37 years old, it\u2019s a little late to do it, but better now than never,\u201dhe said. CHS has only been recognized for about the past decade, and nobody knows exactly how many people suffer from it. But as more states move towards the legalization of marijuana, emergency room physicians like Dr. Heard are eager to make sure both doctors and patients have CHS on their radar. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)!

Not true, Kerry reiterated Wednesday. \"The United States did not draft this resolution,\" he said. \"Nor did we put it forward.\" Kerry's remarks echoed earlier statements in which he defended the U.S. decision to abstain saying it could not \"stand in the way of a resolution at the United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now to preserve the possibility of peace.\" The outgoing Secretary of State also reminded the Israelis that they have never had a better friend than the Obama administration.

In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Burke Ramsey claims that the network, its production company and the experts interviewed in the six-part series on the unsolved murder conspired to defame him for publicity and profit. The six-part television docuseries \"The Case of JonBenet Ramsey\" aired in September ahead of the 20th anniversary of JonBenet's death. Related: New DNA Testing Planned in the 20-Year-Old Murder Case of JonBenet Ramsey The beauty pageant star was found dead in the basement of her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, the day after Christmas in 1996. A prosecutor cleared her parents and brother in 2008 based on DNA evidence. But the district attorney currently overseeing the case has said it was premature to exonerate the Ramseys and ordered additional tests using new DNA testing technology that authorities hope will further the investigation.

CBS spokesman Dustin Smith declined to comment on the lawsuit, which is the second Burke Ramsey has filed over the television series. In this June 29, 2006, file photo, John Ramsey hugs his son, Burke, facing the camera, at the graves of his wife, Patsy, and daughter JonBenet, during services for his wife at the St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Ga. Burke Ramsey is suing CBS and others for $750 million over a series that aired in September 2016 that Ramsey alleges concluded he killed his sister. Ric Feld / AP In October, Ramsey, 29, sued a forensic pathologist featured on the show who said he bludgeoned his sister to death. The pathologist is also named in the latest lawsuit, which was filed in Michigan, where Burke Ramsey lives. The new lawsuit says CBS and its featured experts set out to conduct a \"sham reinvestigation\" of the murder with \"the preconceived the story line\" that Ramsey killed his sister and conspired with his parents to cover it up. \"The accusation that Burke Ramsey killed his sister was based on a compilation of lies, half-truths, manufactured information, and the intentional omission and avoidance of truthful information about the murder of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey,\" the lawsuit says.

    "text": "By Philip Bump December 28 at 10:01 AM Follow @pbump Since Gallup began asking Americans the people\u00a0they admired the most, there's been a consistent pattern: Whoever was president or president-elect was almost always the man the country admired the most. The most admired woman? Usually someone who had been married to a president. Only five times has the most admired man in the country not been a president \u2014 past, current or elected. And in 2016, the trend continued , with President Obama retaining the title he's held since 2008. For each of the past 15 years, the most admired woman has been a very particular former first lady: Hillary Clinton. Clinton has been named America's most admired woman 21 times, the most of any winner of the title. It's often been a squeaker, such as when she narrowly edged out Sarah Palin in 2009. But in 2016, as in years past, no woman has been identified as the most admired more than Clinton. (Where two women were tied, only the woman listed first in Gallup's write-ups is shown.) Her opponent in this year's presidential contest, though, didn't fare quite as well. Donald Trump had the most support of any second-place finisher over the past decade, but it wasn't enough to catch Obama. The percentage of the population that identifies him as the man they admire the most has consistently outpaced the field since he earned the top spot. This news, coming at this moment, will probably be somewhat galling to Trump. Over the weekend, Obama told his former adviser David Axelrod that he believed he could have won in 2016, a claim at which Trump chafed . To lose an admiration contest in the wake of that seems as though it would be particularly frustrating to the president-elect. It's probably a function of the popularity of each man. In 2008, Obama won the most-admired title easily, thanks to his historic election and George W. Bush's low approval ratings. In 2000, Bill Clinton topped George W. Bush, albeit barely. By 2001, Bush set a record in the polling, with 39 percent identifying him as most admired \u2014 thanks in no small part to his response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The big question is what happens next year. Past presidents have often won the crown of most admired, as noted above. Bill Clinton, for example, has been in the top 10 for 25 years. (Trump has made the top 10\u00a0six times, including 1988 through 1990, 2011 and last year.) Will Obama continue to be viewed as more admirable to Americans even once Trump has taken office? One bet that's probably safe to make: Hillary Clinton will win again in 2017. The Washington Post explores Donald Trump's transformation from a reality TV star to president-elect of the United States. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Shefte,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) politics ",

Here are three things to keep in mind to ensure safety in an earthquake. Earthquakes occur all over the world, mostly around plate edges, on faults. Here are three things to keep in mind to ensure safety in an earthquake. Brian De Los Santos A series of moderate earthquakes rocked the California-Nevada border Wednesday, shaking residents in both states but producing no reports of major damage or injury. The first temblor,\u00a0with a magnitude of 5.7, occurred at 12:22 a.m. near Hawthorne, Nev. It was followed by a second 5.7 quake and then more than 100 aftershocks. Light shaking was felt as far away as South Lake Tahoe, Fresno, Visalia and Merced. The U.S. Geological Survey said most of the responses to its \u201cDid You Feel It?\u201d website came from the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada. But residents reported they felt the quakes as far west as San Francisco and as far south as Bakersfield. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Los Angeles Times) On social media, those near the first quake reported a sharp jolt. The epicenter was in a fairly remote, scarcely populated area of Nevada away from larger population centers in Reno and Lake Tahoe. Hawthorne has a population of about 3,300. Hours later, temblors continued near Hawthorne, with four\u00a0quakes between magnitude 2.8\u00a0and 4 occurring after 4 a.m. A magnitude 3.5 quake was reported at 6:45 a.m. As the morning progressed, the smaller and less frequent aftershocks continued. The California Office of Emergency Services said it was assessing the situation, but there were no reports of serious injuries or damage. According to the USGS, the 5.7 quake's epicenter was 56 miles from Gardnerville Ranchos, Nev., 69 miles from South Lake Tahoe, Calif., 70 miles from Carson City, Nev., and 84 miles from Fernley, Nev. Seismologist Lucy Jones said on Twitter that multiple\u00a0quakes like Wednesday morning\u2019s\u00a0are not uncommon in the\u00a0region. She noted that in 1980, Mammoth Lakes experienced several quakes in the magnitude 6 range in one day. That swarm of quakes, which lasted several days, became the subject of much research. Jones said a bigger quake was possible but increasingly unlikely. \u201cThey could be foreshocks but [it\u2019s] much more likely that we've already seen the largest. Sequence decaying normally,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. In the last 10 days, there have been eight earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater centered nearby. Another\u00a0significant earthquake shook northwest California earlier this month. On Dec. 6, a magnitude 6.5 quake occurred off the coast of Eureka. That quake caused no damage. Later Wednesday morning, a 4.1 quake occurred in the Morongo Valley in the Inland Empire. Read more about Southern California earthquakes .

Roof, who appeared in a striped prison uniform, with his hands and feet shackled, confirmed today he still intends to represent himself, although U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel has said he does not support Roof's decision. Roof told Gergel he will make an opening statement. The government plans to call more than 30 witnesses \u2014 mostly survivors and victims' family members \u2014 to testify in the sentencing phase. Survivors Polly Sheppard and Felicia Sanders, who testified during the guilt phase, are expected to testify again. Opening statements are set to begin Jan. 3. The same jury that found him guilty will return to decide if he'll be sentenced to death. Charleston Church Shooting Survivor Recounts Watching Her Son Die at Dylann Roof Trial Roof, who is white, was convicted earlier this month of shooting and killing the parishioners at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. The 33 federal counts against Roof included hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death. Roof entered the church armed and \"with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,\" according to the federal indictment against him. The parishioners welcomed Roof into their Bible study group, according to the indictment, after which Roof drew his pistol and opened fire. In the defense's opening statements during the guilt phase of the trial, attorney David Bruck told the court, \"He did it ... You're probably wondering, so what we are doing here? Why does there need to be a trial? ... The practical reason is that the government has asked for the death penalty after conviction, and because of that, we have a procedure to go through. \"Our society does not order the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life,\" Bruck added. \"You're going to want to understand who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.\" Roof also faces a state trial, set for early next year, in which he may also face the death penalty. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) After bashing President Obama over Israel and transition issues \u2014 but then saying they had a nice phone conversation\u00a0\u2014 Donald Trump and aides on Wednesday floated the idea of creating\u00a0a new \"public-private\" system for veterans health care. Amid a series of job interviews,\u00a0Trump met with a group of health care professionals in a discussion that included talk of a system that would allow veterans to use the traditional VA system or opt for private medical facilities. \"Definitely an option on the table to have a system where potentially vets can choose either/or, or all private,\" said one senior transition official, speaking on condition of anonymity because nothing has\u00a0been formalized. Trump has not yet named his choice to head the VA, an agency that has been rocked by scandal since it was revealed in 2014 that veterans were dying while waiting for long-delayed medical appointments. The VA secretary was replaced and the agency has made a major emphasis on improving care, but USA TODAY earlier this month published documents showing that effort is achieving mixed results. The\u00a0group that met with Trump Wednesday included Cleveland Clinic CEO Delos \"Toby\" Cosgrove, rumored to be under consideration to be Trump's pick for VA secretary. The official said it is possible the group could become a standing advisory committee on veterans health care, though that also has not been decided. Trumpo The new VA concept emerged hours after the president-elect criticized Obama over Israel and transition issues, but said later that he had a \"nice\" and \"general\" conversation with his predecessor, though he did not provide details. \"He phoned me \u2014 we had a very nice conversation,\" Trump told reporters after also announcing\u00a0that two companies,\u00a0Sprint and OneWeb,\u00a0have pledged to create a total of 8,000 new domestic jobs. The jobs are returning into the United States, \"which is a nice change,\"\u00a0said Trump, who during the presidential campaign claimed the U.S. was losing jobs because of bad trade deals with other countries. Neither Trump nor the companies provided any detail about the jobs. Trump began his day by\u00a0Twitter-trolling\u00a0Obama over Israel, the United Nations, and the transition in general. \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks,\" Trump tweeted. \"Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!\" Read more: Trump did not cite specifics, but he followed up with tweets criticizing the Obama administration for refusing to veto a United Nations resolution criticizing Israel over settlements on land disputed with the Palestinians. \"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,\" Trump said. He added:\u00a0\"They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but\u00a0not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\" Later in the day, Trump appeared to walk back his criticism of the transition, telling reporters it is going \"very, very smoothly, very good. You don't think so?\" The White House confirmed the Obama-Trump conversation on Wednesday.\u00a0\"Today's call, like the others since the election, was positive and focused on continuing a smooth and effective transition,\" said spokesman Eric Schultz. The Trump tweets on Israel preceded a speech by Secretary of State John Kerry laying out the outgoing Obama administration's vision for Middle East peace\u00a0and pushing back at the administration's critics. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a tense relationship with Obama, responded to Trump on Twitter, saying: \"President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel.\" Members of the Obama administration, meanwhile, have questioned Trump's involvement in the Israel dispute. \"There's\u00a0one President at a time,\" said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes last week. \"President Obama is the President of the United States until January 20th.\" Trump declined to critique Kerry's speech, telling reporters \"it\u00a0speaks for itself.\" Posted!

    "text": "Site Mobile Navigation \u2018A Bullet Could Hit Me and My Kids Anytime\u2019 For thousands of children in Chicago, walking to school can be treacherous. One father, Victor Bloomingberg, explains why. DEC. 28, 2016 America\u2019s third-largest city is dangerous enough that more than a fifth of Chicago\u2019s 652 public schools have Safe Passage routes to help children travel safely. The routes were chosen in areas with some of the highest concentrations of violent crime, particularly on the West and South Sides. Safe Passage route Shooting or homicide in 2016 Lake south side About 1,300 workers dressed in neon-green vests stand within eyeshot of one another on 142 designated routes . According to the city, no child has ever been a victim of a serious incident while Safe Passage workers have been on duty. \u201cWe\u2019re those kids\u2019 parents from the time they\u2019re leaving home to the time they\u2019re getting to school, because those are our babies,\u201d said Lakita Pearson, a Safe Passage supervisor on the West Side. Workers are often hired from within the community so they can build relationships \u2014 even with the \u201cindividuals who pull triggers,\u201d said Autry Phillips, executive director of Target Area Development Corporation, which helps the city manage nine Safe Passage routes. \u201cThey understand that when they see those vests out there, they\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey, look, this is the time kids are walking past here now; let\u2019s get it right,\u2019\u201d Mr. Phillips said. The Safe Passage program began in 2009 after a 16-year-old student, Derrion Albert, was beaten to death after leaving his high school on the South Side. The city expanded the program in 2013, increasing the number of the routes, but the program still has its limitations. There are vast sections of the city not covered by Safe Passage, and some parents say the workers are merely \u201ceyes and ears\u201d and can\u2019t really protect children from levels of violence that have become extraordinary. With more than 750 homicides in 2016 so far, the city has had its deadliest year since 1997.

By Robert Costa December 28 at 4:33 PM Follow @costareports President Ronald Reagan gives a thumbs-up sign to the crowd as his wife, first lady Nancy Reagan, waves from a limousine during the inaugural parade in D.C. on Jan. 20, 1981. (AP) President-elect Donald Trump privately told several visitors to his winter retreat in Florida on Wednesday that he is writing the first draft of his inaugural speech and is looking to presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy for inspiration, according to three people familiar with the conversation. Trump told them that Reagan\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d and Kennedy\u2019s articulation of grand national ambitions are central to how he thinks through his own speech, which will be given\u00a0Jan. 20,\u00a0the people said. And while Trump is working closely with Stephen Miller, his aide and speechwriter, on the text, he confided that in recent days he has become more personally involved in the writing process, the people said. The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversation. A Trump transition spokesperson was not available for comment. [ At Trump\u2019s inauguration, Franklin Graham, Cardinal Dolan and four more clergy members will pray ] Trump made his private\u00a0remarks during lunchtime at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., to presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, Bloomberg columnist Margaret Carlson, Democratic lobbyist Thomas Quinn and Newsmax Media chief executive Christopher Ruddy, who is a longtime friend of the president-elect. While the media and political personalities were dining together as Ruddy\u2019s guests, Trump \u2014 who has been at the property for most of late December \u2014 ventured over at various points during a two-hour period to speak with them, the people said. A\u00a0person familiar with Trump\u2019s comments said he is \u201cenamored with Reagan\u2019s confident style and how he connected with the country.\u201d \u201cHe went on and on about Reagan and how much he admires him. But it wasn\u2019t all about Reagan. He spoke about Kennedy and how he was able to get the country motivated, to go to the moon. He\u2019s thinking about both men as he starts to write the speech, which is something he\u2019s now taking the lead on,\u201d the person said. The person added that part of the draw to\u00a0Kennedy is that Trump knows that \u201cwhat\u00a0would have been Kennedy\u2019s 100th birthday will come only a few months after his inauguration next year.\u201d When reached Wednesday by phone, Brinkley, who is a professor at Rice University in Houston, declined to discuss Trump\u2019s framework for the inaugural address. But he confirmed that Trump spoke at length about history and asked questions about past inaugurations. \u201cWe talked about JFK and Reagan and about how William Henry Harrison caught pneumonia after giving too long of an inaugural speech,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cI was there as a presidential historian, telling stories and listening to his view of the presidency.\u201d Brinkley said he found Trump to be \u201crelaxed and utterly gracious\u201d and \u201cas happy to talk about NBA basketball as he was about history.\u201d \u201cIt reminded me a little of Nixon, who loved football,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I raised the fact that I was writing a book about Kennedy and the moon shot and NASA, he did talk about how he admires Kennedy in addition to Reagan. There was admiration for Reagan\u2019s style and for Kennedy,\u201d\u00a0Brinkley said. \u201cHe recognizes that he\u2019s entering a club,\u201d he continued. \u201cEven if he didn\u2019t spend a lifetime reading presidential biographies, he appreciates that he is\u00a0joining the\u00a0club and is learning more about its traditions.\u201d According to the people familiar with the conversation,\u00a0Trump also told the group that he was nearing decisions on the remaining slots in his cabinet \u2014 secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs\u00a0\u2014 but he did not disclose his list of finalists. A lighter moment came when Trump asked Brinkley about how presidents gave inaugural addresses before the invention of the microphone. Brinkley told Trump that presidents would have supporters whisper the speech through the crowd so that people in the back could know what was being said. Trump found the anecdote amusing. President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office during the 58th inauguration on Jan. 20. Here's a look at what we know about the planned inaugural activities and a look back at how the tradition has evolved. (Claritza Jimenez,Danielle Kunitz,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) \u00a0 ",

    "text": "advertisement 8-year-old Joe Maldonado of New Jersey NBC New York The family of an 8-year-old New Jersey boy says he was kicked out of Cub Scouts because he is transgender, a move that could open a new front in the debate over discrimination in Scouting. Joe Maldonado joined Pack 87 in Secaucus in October and was asked to leave about a month later, according to The Record . \"I'm way more angry than sad,\" Joe said in a story published Tuesday. \"My identity is a boy. If I was them, I would let every person in the world go in. It's right to do.\" Joe was assigned female at birth but has identified as male for more than a year. His mother, Kristie Maldonado, said Joe is accepted as a boy at school and that it was complaints from parents \u2014 not Joe's fellow Scouts \u2014 that led to his ouster. \"Not one of the kids said, 'You don't belong here,'\" Maldonado said. The Boy Scouts of America endured years of controversy before ultimately lifting bans on gay Scouts and leaders in recent years. But spokeswoman Effie Delimarkos said in a statement the organization considers transgender children as a separate issue. \"No youth may be removed from any of our programs on the basis of his or her sexual orientation,\" she said, but added: \"Gender identity isn't related to sexual orientation.\" She declined to directly address Joe's situation or say if there's a written policy on transgender participants. The statement said Cub Scout programs are for those identified as boys on their birth certificates. RELATED: 8-Year-Old Joe Maldonado Talks to NBC New York (VIDEO) The Boy Scouts of America is not known to have rejected any Scouts over gender identity before the Secaucus case, said Justin Wilson, the executive director of Scouts for Equality. Wilson said he knows of at least two transgender boys who are Cub Scouts, one in a southern state that he did not name and the other in New York. He does not know of any instances where Scouts asked for a birth certificate as a condition of membership. Maldonado said she was not aware that anyone had a problem with her son being a member of the pack, which is hosted by Immaculate Conception Church, until she received a phone call from the Northern New Jersey Council of Boy Scouts. A spokesman for the Newark Roman Catholic Archdiocese said it had nothing to do with the Boy Scouts' decision. He declined further comment. Council executive Eric Chamberlin acknowledged calling Kristie Maldonado last month but declined further comment. He referred questions to the Scouts' national office and said the issue involved \"our membership standards.\" Earlier this year, the Boy Scouts told The Associated Press that it would admit transgender children to its coeducational programs, but not to programs that are for boys only, like the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. The national Girl Scouts organization, which is not affiliated with the Boy Scouts, has accepted transgender members for years. The Boy Scouts did not respond to questions about whether the group would accept a transgender girl whose birth certificate indicates she is male. Follow NBC Out on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .

    "text": "Should Mr. Trump make good on such promises, he would take aim at not only his own brand, but his daughter\u2019s as well. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t stand to lose much. While his goods are largely manufactured overseas, most of his retail ventures have gone the way of Trump vodka and steaks. And what products can be found \u2014 at his hotels and golf courses and on Amazon sold by independent sellers \u2014 are the vestiges of a mostly defunct clothing line or sporadic shipments of Trump sweatshirts and hats. Ivanka Trump\u2019s company , by contrast, is the type of operation that Mr. Trump is squarely aiming for. Her shoes and dresses largely retail for less than $150. Coats cost as much as $400. Factored into those prices is the cost of materials and production, as well as shipping, tariffs, marketing and advertising expenses. Cheap production overseas means more coin in the coffers of Ms. Trump and the shoe, accessory and clothing makers that are her partners, among them Marc Fisher footwear, the G-III Apparel Group and Mondani. (Ms. Trump\u2019s company, which is privately held, does not disclose its financials.) Almost all of her goods are made overseas, according to a New York Times review of shipments compiled separately by Panjiva and ImportGenius , two trade databases. ImportGenius tallied 193 shipments for imported goods associated with Ms. Trump for the year through Dec. 5, mostly Chinese-made shoes and handbags. Her dresses and blouses are made in China, Indonesia and Vietnam, according to a review of hundreds of clothing tags and financial documents filed by G-III. It is the harsh reality of the clothing business. Before Ms. Trump started her shoe and clothing lines in the early 2010s, she did what any well-connected New Yorker would, consulting corporate chieftains, fashion designers and department store executives. She ultimately decided to license her name. Photo The Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry store in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan. Ms. Trump, whose public persona is at the heart of her brand, is already facing some blowback for her father\u2019s inflammatory comments about minorities and potential conflicts of interest. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times Since then, Ms. Trump, 35, has pondered making some items in-house. Investors were consulted, and a business plan was drawn up \u2014 but the project was scrapped, said one person briefed on the discussions. It was costly and impractical, so suppliers continued to make her clothes overseas. \u201cWhen I started my business, I recognized where my strengths were and knew that I didn\u2019t have any experience in production and manufacturing,\u201d Ms. Trump said in a rare interview.\u201cI am not a designer. I am an entrepreneur.\u201d In retail, where margins are slim, overseas manufacturers are crucial to profits. Most of the clothing Americans buy at Walmart, Macy\u2019s and Target are made abroad, including 97 percent of apparel and 98 percent of shoes, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is part of a long history of American garment manufacturers chasing cheap labor. They moved to China in the 1980s, then elsewhere in Asia. Now, Chinese shoemakers are building factories in Africa, where wages are about $40 a month, compared with $400 in China. Even then, an overseas strategy does not portend survival, as Mr. Trump\u2019s experience shows. At Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, the Trump Store is downstairs from the lobby, sandwiched between a restaurant and an ice cream parlor. While a $65 white polo golf shirt from Lesotho in southern Africa was available, there was no sign of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s other items, like the dress shirt made in Vietnam on display upstairs. Last year, Macy\u2019s dropped Mr. Trump\u2019s clothing line over inflammatory comments he made about Mexican immigrants. Now about the best place to find his ties, dress shirts and accessories is on Amazon.com \u2014 and even that stock is just a hodgepodge. The company that made Trump-branded comforters and sheets, Downlite, said it had ended its relationship with him last year. His beds, designed by Dorya, aren\u2019t in stores, either. They are made to order overseas, according to the company. Mr. Trump said in campaign interviews that he would like to make his apparel in the United States, but that it was hard to find companies that did. When George Stephanopoulos of ABC pressed him to explain, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThey don\u2019t even make the stuff here.\u201d That is not exactly true. B J Nickol, president of the All American Clothing Company, based in Arcanum, Ohio, said he employed 15 people, as well as subcontractors in about 20 states who cut, sew and ship shirts, jeans and sweaters. He estimated it cost All American $10 to $15 to manufacture a polo shirt, including fabric and labor. He sells them for about $28 to $38, or about half of what a polo shirt costs at Trump Tower. While the company mostly sells shirts to individuals, Mr. Nickol said he would welcome a big-time customer like Mr. Trump. Mr. Nickol said he had witnessed the impact on his community when apparel manufacturers moved away. \u201cAnd the only way we could think of to fix that was to keep jobs here,\u201d he said. Photo Ivanka Trump shoes largely retail for less than $150. Credit Danny Ghitis for The New York Times While large-scale clothing manufacturing is unlikely to return to the United States, specialty items or high-end apparel has promise. Todd Shelton, a fashion designer who makes sleek separates and sells them online, sews his clothes at a factory in East Rutherford, N.J. Advertisement But there are trade-offs, namely price. A pair of women\u2019s jeans made by Todd Shelton costs $200; an Oxford shirt is $180. And cost is only one factor. Fashion is another. Recently, Ms. Trump tried to make a flip-flop in the United States. She and one of her main partners, Marc Fisher, shopped a design to retailers, according to a person with knowledge of the venture. Buyers, though, didn\u2019t like the design \u2014 and it never got made. With the Ivanka Trump brand, another variable now comes into play: politics. Ms. Trump served as a more polished emissary of her father\u2019s messages during the campaign, and she is under pressure to bring jobs home. And in a postelection era, her carefully crafted public persona, which is at the heart of the brand, is at risk. Ms. Trump has found a way to commercialize female empowerment, selling petal pink sheaths and trendy shoes to young professionals on the go. Her brand\u2019s hashtag #womenwhowork often accompanies pitches to buy her satchels and clothes. \u201cShe wants to make sure her reputation is unblemished,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, a consumer behavior and retail analyst at the NPD Group, a research firm. Ms. Trump is already facing some blowback. She was criticized for meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan while completing a licensing deal with a company whose largest shareholder is wholly owned by the Japanese government. Consumers offended by her father\u2019s inflammatory comments about minorities continue to boycott her line. Ms. Trump acknowledged the potential appearance of conflicts as her father prepared to move into the White House. She said she would step down as the head of her namesake brand if asked to become an adviser to her father and the Trump administration. \u201cI would completely separate myself from my businesses,\u201d said Ms. Trump, who is also considering a leave of absence from the Trump Organization, where she serves as an executive vice president for development and acquisitions. Representatives for Mr. Trump declined to comment. But it will not drastically change her company\u2019s strategy. She and her team do not plan to move manufacturing back just to quell critics. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s great to say we want to do all of this, but we want to make responsible business decisions, too,\u201d said Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand. \u201cFrom a business perspective, we have to have longevity.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 28, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: For the Trumps, \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 May Be a Tricky Label to Stitch.

    "text": "Video Appears to Show Texas Police Shooting Man Walking Away By david warren DALLAS \u0097 Dec 28, 2016, 8:38 PM ET 0 Shares Email A police dashcam video released five months after a Texas officer shot a black man appears to show the man walking away as the officer fired, and the man's lawyer says he was not a threat. David Collie was shot in the back, leaving him paralyzed, lawyer Nate Washington said Wednesday. Police said at the time of the July encounter that a Fort Worth officer fired twice, striking Collie \"once in the lower torso.\" The officer and a Tarrant County sheriff's deputy with him were off-duty at the time and working a security detail at an apartment complex, Washington said. Police were searching for two shirtless black men who they believed had committed a robbery near a gas station, Washington said. Authorities said in a news release they issued at the time that Collie pulled a box cutter from his pocket and pointed it at the officers. Collie was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant but a grand jury declined to indict him. Fort Worth police on Wednesday defended the actions of the officers, who they have not named. Sgt. Marc Povero said in a statement that Collie failed to comply with commands to stop and that he appeared to point a silver object at the deputy, consistent with earlier reports by the robbery victim that a suspect flashed a silver handgun. Washington said Collie was not involved in the robbery. A box cutter found nearby didn't belong to Collie, Washington said. The shooting occurred late at night and darkness obscures Collie's actions, but the video seems to show him pointing in another direction as he walks away and it is not clear if there is anything in his hand. Povero said a department review of the incident had been completed but declined to discuss the outcome. The officer who shot Washington has since returned to duty, he said. Povero declined to comment on the race of the officer. Samantha Jordan , a spokeswoman for the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, said all police-involved shootings are submitted directly and without recommendation to the grand jury, where Collie's case is currently pending. \"We've reviewed the evidence,\" Jordan said. \"Since it is pending, we can't comment.\" The 33-year-old Collie was walking from work to a friend's apartment when the officers approached him in their patrol vehicle, Washington said. The video appears to show the Fort Worth officer firing his weapon about 10 seconds after exiting the vehicle and as Collie walked away. The video was obtained about three weeks ago from the Tarrant County district attorney's office through an open-records request, Washington said. The attorney said he released the video Tuesday at a news conference at Collie's insistence because Collie was tired of comments made to his mother by people assuming he must have done something wrong. Washington said Collie wanted to make clear he \"didn't do anything to threaten an officer.\" The two officers argued over the decision to fire on Collie, Washington said, and the deputy prayed with him as he was on the ground. \"I don't believe most people are racist but there are indeed racial biases that persist, and they don't go away when you go to the police academy,\" Washington said. \"Having racial biases doesn't necessarily make you a bad person but we need to find a way to remove them when it comes to police work.\" The release of the video came just days after the Fort Worth police were in the spotlight over another incident. A cellphone video captured a white Fort Worth officer last week wrestling a black woman to the ground and then arresting her and her two daughters. The officer appeared to be argumentative and escalate the encounter with the woman, who had called police following an encounter between her son and a neighbor. The video has been viewed millions of times. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Jamie Stengle contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Vince Bucci/Invision/AP) Tributes for Carrie Fisher continued to mount a day after her shocking death \u2014\u00a0including from ex-husband Paul Simon \u2014\u00a0as attention turned from her careers as an iconic movie star and best-selling author to her courage in acknowledging her mental illness. Funeral arrangements for Fisher, who was 60 when she died Tuesday at UCLA Medical Center four days after she suffered a medical emergency on a flight from London to LAX on Friday, are still pending. Also pending is the exact cause of her death, whether it was a heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest, and whether it may have been related to her history of substance abuse. 'Star Wars' fan Arielle Hazel places flowers for Carrie Fisher at the movie's hand and footprint cement block in Hollywood on Dec. 27, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: EUGENE GARCIA, EPA) By tragic coincidence, British pop icon George Michael\u00a0was found dead Sunday in his country home outside London, the victim of \"heart failure\" according to his manager. He was only 53 and also had a long history of substance abuse. Meanwhile, because Fisher did not have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, fans\u00a0have taken it upon themselves to give her an unofficial star. In front of Hollywood Boulevard's historic Chinese Theatre, they've taken over a blank sidewalk star, placing candles and flowers and paste-on letters spelling her name and the phrase, \"May the force be with you always.\" The scene at Carrie Fisher's improvised Walk of Fame star. pic.twitter.com/K865wZG2ft \u2014 Ryan Parker (@TheRyanParker) December 28, 2016 The latest: Simon breaks silence: The equally iconic singer/songwriter tweeted early Wednesday, capturing the sense of the widespread reaction to Fisher's death: She was too young to die. \"Yesterday was a horrible day. Carrie was a special, wonderful girl. It's too soon,\" Simon tweeted. \"Yesterday was a horrible day. Carrie was a special, wonderful girl. It's too soon.\" -Paul Simon \u2014 Paul Simon (@PaulSimonMusic) December 28, 2016 Simon, 75, was Fisher's only husband and they were married for just a short period, 1983-84. But they remained close friends, and she kept in touch with his son from an earlier marriage, Harper. Carrie Fisher and singer Paul Simon stand together at their apartment in New York during their wedding reception in August 1983. \u00a0(Photo: Mario Suriani, AP) Cause of death:\u00a0Why did she die? Was it  a \"massive heart attack\" that felled her on that plane, as TMZ put it? And will there be an autopsy? These questions are still open but it's worth remembering that sometimes what looks like a \"heart attack\" isn't. Alan Thicke, 69, who died Dec. 13 after a game of hockey, was initially said to have suffered a heart attack. A later autopsy established he died of a \"ruptured aorta,\" which is not the same thing. And only on Tuesday, nine months after comedian Garry Shandling died , supposedly of a \"massive heart attack,\" as TMZ put it, the Los Angeles County coroner's office issued its report showing that Shandling actually died from a blood clot that moved from his leg to his heart. Another question is the role substance abuse may play in the death of someone who is still relatively young. Fisher was open about how she used drugs to \"self-medicate\" her problems with bipolar disorder. But even recovering addicts can suffer medical consequences years later, says Ben Levenson,\u00a0founder of Origins Behavioral Health Care treatment centers for addiction. \"The human body was not designed to handle years of chronic addiction,\" Levenson says. \"Every time a person uses cocaine, an addict or even just the recreational user, their heart is likely damaged.\" Mental-health hero: After Fisher discovered she suffered from bipolar disorder, she spoke out openly about mental illness, writing about it and\u00a0joking about it, trying to help reduce the stigma and secrecy around such illnesses. That earned her kudos from mental health organizations, and after her death, impassioned tributes to her courage emerged on Twitter\u00a0from others with similar illnesses. Some people even admitted publicly for the first time that they, too, are bipolar. I\u2019m pretty open about being in recovery; I\u2019ve been more circumspect about mental illness. In honor of Carrie Fisher: I\u2019m bipolar, too. \u2014 Ana Marie Cox (@anamariecox) December 27, 2016 @anamariecox Carrie Fisher's openness about her #bipolar was one of the greatest gifts she left our world https://t.co/pUPXvBrs9A #LiveBrave \u2014 Jennifer Marshall (@BipolarMomLife) December 28, 2016 The National Alliance on Mental Illness, the largest grassroots support organization for people living with mental illnesses, posted a tribute to Fisher on Twitter and on its Facebook page, highlighting one of her quotes about how living with bipolar disorder requires \"stamina and courage\" and that functioning is \"something to be proud of, not ashamed of.\" The organization honored Fisher in 2001 for \"making a significant, national contribution to end discrimination\" against people with mental illness. NAMI is sad about Carrie Fisher, an inspiring mental health advocate, who spoke openly to end stigma #stigmafree https://t.co/PP4JVvSXPf pic.twitter.com/Af6MurVzwl \u2014 NAMI (@NAMICommunicate) December 28, 2016 Ken Duckworth, medical director of NAMI, said Fisher approached dealing with mental illness the same way she approached playing feisty Princess Leia in Star Wars: Pro-active, honest and fearless. \"She is one of my heroes,\" he said. \"She said, 'My liabilities are my strengths,' and that was a beautiful thing to say about living with a condition like bipolar disorder. It does not define you and it does not stop you, and she\u2019s emblematic of that.\" He said her box-office legacy was considerable but \"pales in comparison to what she did for millions of Americans who live with a treatable illness. Her contribution is quite meaningful...For that she is\u00a0an American treasure.\" Her books are selling: There's been a run on Fisher's most popular books, reports The Associated Press. The Princess Diarist, about the diaries she kept while making Star Wars as a 19-year-old, was on top of Amazon's list of best-selling books on Wednesday. Wishful Drinking, her funny/sad memoir of her life with substance abuse,\u00a0and Postcards From the Edge, her semi-autobiographical novel about her relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds,\u00a0were also in Amazon's top 10, with the follow up to Wishful,\u00a0Shockaholic,\u00a0ranked as No. 57. Five of the top 10 books on Amazon's \"Movers and Shakers\" list, which measures titles that show the greatest upward movement in sales over a 24-hour period, were by Fisher. That list also included Courtney Carbone's book, I Am a Princess,\u00a0about Fisher's Princess Leia character, at No. 11. What about Gary Fisher: In her later years, Fisher never went anywhere without her therapy dog, a 4-year-old French bulldog with a lolling tongue she named Gary Fisher. As the multitude of pictures of him over the years showed, he was a ham for any camera, a star on any red carpet. Saddest tweets to tweet. Mommy is gone. I love you @carrieffisher \u2014 Carrie Fisher's Dog (@Gary_TheDog) December 27, 2016 He was with her on the United flight carrying her home from promoting her new book in London on Friday, and later was spotted with her daughter, Billie Lourd, 24, at the hospital. After her death, fans were worried about his fate. But TMZ \u00a0reported Lourd is the likely next \"Mommy\" for Gary; she already has a Frenchie named Tina who is friendly with Gary. But who will post the funny-touching tweets on the Carrie Fisher's Dog Twitter account? . \u2014 Carrie Fisher's Dog (@Gary_TheDog) December 24, 2016 Contributing: The Associated Press 2842 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iFcgUo NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

Tweeting from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he's spending the holidays with his family, Trump wrote, \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!\" Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016 Trump's tweet followed an interview in which Obama claimed that he would have won with his message of hope if he had faced off against Trump in the 2016 election. \"I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\" Obama said. Asked on a morning conference call to clarify the roadblocks to which Trump referred, his pick for White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said he would let Trump's tweets \"speak for themselves.\" Trump briefly emerged from Mar-a-Lago this afternoon and fielded a question from ABC News about whether the transition of power was going smoothly. \"I think very, very smoothly, very good,\" Trump said. \"You don't think so?\" The White House earlier this month notably defended a decision by the Energy Department not to comply with a request from the Trump transition team to provide names of employees who worked on the Obama administration's climate policy efforts. Obama has repeatedly committed to a peaceful and smooth transition of power, keeping with centuries of American tradition, and said that he will, despite his disagreements with Trump during the campaign, escort him to the Capitol and attend his inauguration on Jan. 20.

    "text": "Blackhawks and Artemi Panarin agree to contract extension Photos of the Blackhawks'\u00a0Artemi Panarin. The Blackhawks have answered one of the biggest questions about their future \u2014 whether it will include prolific winger Artemi Panarin, who was due to be a restricted free agent after this season. The answer is yes \u2014 through the 2018-19 season. The Hawks and Panarin have agreed to a contract extension worth $6 million per season for the next two years, Panarin's agent Tom Lynn confirmed to the Tribune on Wednesday. In a bit of give-and-take, Panarin, 25, did not push for a long-term deal for more money, which another team could have given him on the open market, but agreed to a bridge deal that should keep him in Chicago for a while. Then he may be in line for an even bigger payday \u2014 and the Hawks will not be able to trade his rights because he will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of his new deal. Blackhawks are 0-2-1 in their last three, their first three-game winless stretch this season. Corey Crawford will be in goal Thursday, just his third game back since missing 10 after his appendectomy, but coach Joel Quenneville hinted... TV/radio: 7 p.m. Thursday; CSN, WGN-AM 720. Storylines: The Blackhawks are 0-2-1 in their last three, their first three-game winless stretch this season. Corey Crawford will be in goal Thursday, just his third game back since missing 10 after his appendectomy, but coach Joel Quenneville hinted... Read the story But keeping Panarin was paramount for a team that has Stanley Cup aspirations through the decade. Panarin has thrived with the Hawks since coming over from the KHL before last season thanks in part to playing on a line with Artem Anisimov and Patrick Kane . Panarin has 15 goals and 22 assists this season and won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year last season with 30 goals and 47 assists. Lynn told the Tribune that Panarin was willing to take a discount to stay with the Hawks but did not want to take a discount on a long-term deal, especially when he is two years away from negotiating for no movement clauses in his deal at 27. \"We both, in a friendly way, recognized a long-term deal wasn't feasible (and) not only moneywise,\" Lynn said. \"He's two years away from getting no movement clauses. \u2026 that wasn't feasible to give up unrestricted years on a discounted deal. At the same time neither side was into a one-year deal, just putting off the same conversation (until next year).\" In two years, Lynn said the landscape in the NHL likely would be much different and the sides will re-visit whether they still are a good fit. \"In the end, this was the key that unlocked the door, to do a two-year deal and to get to a $6 million threshold,\" Lynn said. \"It was enough for Artemi to take a haircut and stay and enough for the Blackhawks to keep doing what they're doing.\" The negotiations on this deal had been ongoing since the summer. Lynn told Panarin that the winger could get more money if he went to arbitration or the open market. But Lynn added: \"He said I want to stay with the Blackhawks if we can make it work.\" The challenge in the immediate future for the Hawks is how they will fit below the salary cap next season and who might have to be traded to accommodate Panarin's new deal. Panarin, who is in the second year of his entry contract, is making a base salary of $812,500 this season, but he made $2.575 million in performance bonuses from last season, a number he could make again this time around. If Panarin does cash in on his performance bonuses, most of that money will count against the Hawks' cap for next season in addition to his new salary. The Hawks are right against the league's $73 million cap for this season. Panarin's extension, first reported by The Athletic, may mean the Hawks will have to trade one of their other high-salary players or make a series of other moves to get below the cap. Possibilities include moving center Marcus Kruger , who is owed approximately $3.1 million the next two years. But that alone may not be enough. The Hawks also are set to lose one player to the Vegas Golden Knights in the upcoming expansion draft, but all of their long-term, high salary players outside of Kruger will be protected in the draft, per NHL rules. Those players include Kane, Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith, Niklas Hjalmarsson , Brent Seabrook , Marian Hossa, Anisimov and Corey Crawford. As a second-year player, the Hawks do not have to protect Panarin in the expansion draft to keep him. ",
