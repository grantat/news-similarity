Dylann Storm Roof, center, with his lawyers, during jury selection Monday in U.S. District Court in Charleston, S.C. Robert Maniscalco The recording of Roof was played Friday for the jurors weighing the fate of the 22-year-old for the first time at his federal death penalty trial. In the video, FBI agents could be seen reading Roof his rights and making sure he understood that he was giving a statement without a lawyer present. Roof did not appear to be under the influence of anything when he made the statement following his arrest on June 18, 2015 in Shelby, North Carolina, FBI investigator Michael Stansbury testified. And Roof was not sure how many people he killed at the Emanuel AME Church. \"Five, not really sure, \" he said. \"Maybe four?\" When asked if he said anything to the victims, Roof answered, \"I didn't say anything to them before.\" \"It was very fast,\" he said on the video. In a matter-of-fact tone, Roof told the FBI he researched his target and went on the killing spree because blacks were raping white women. \"I do consider myself a white supremacist,\" he admitted on the footage. Roof also said he was \"in absolute awe\" that there were no police outside the church when he came out. He said he would have killed himself if there were. In the course of the recorded conversation, Roof spoke about seeing a 1980's TV movie about a racist skinhead called \"Made in Britain.\" And when asked if he regretted what he'd done, Roof said, \"Yeah, I'd say so.\" Told the death toll was actually nine people, Roof appeared to react with disbelief and then remorse. \"Well, it makes me feel bad,\" he said, when asked how he felt. \"Are you guilty?\" an FBI agent asked. \"Yes, I am guilty,\" Roof replied. \"We all know I'm guilty.\" Also entered into evidence was a journal found in the back of Roof's car. \"I was not raised in a racist home of environment,\" he wrote, referring to himself as Dylann Storm Roof. But in there, Roof wrote that Florida security guard George Zimmerman was in the right when he fatally shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin and he disparaged African-Americans as \"stupid and violent.\" The journal also contained Nazi swastikas and the white supremacist code numbers 14 and 88. Sitting at the defense table, Roof did not look at Stansbury. But the wrenching footage is likely to ratchet-up the anguish at the already emotionally fraught trial. On Wednesday, Roof's mother suffered a heart attack after prosecutors laid out for the court how her son plotted the murders of the black Bible study participants on June 17, 2015 in the fellowship hall of the Emanuel AME Church. Before Stansbury took the stand, Roof's lawyer told U.S. Judge Richard Gergel they intend to present more evidence about his state of mind at the time of the shooting. They have not contested that Roof was responsible for the killing, but they are trying to save him from the death penalty. So far Roof, who has admitted targeting the Charleston church, has barely uttered a word at his trial. While the proceedings have been punctuated at times by the sobs of the victims' loved ones, Roof has sat stone-faced and has rarely looked at the people whose lives were torn apart by the massacre. Until Wednesday, when Roof showed up in court wearing a gray sweater and slacks, the go-to getup for the admitted killer with the bowl haircut had been his striped jail jumpsuit. Corky Siemaszko ",

    "text": "Dec 10 2016, 9:49 am ET International College Students Leery of Trump Could Cost U.S. Billions by Safia Samee Ali advertisement Talal Al-Johani, a high school student in Saudi Arabia, couldn't imagine going to college anywhere else but the United States. For the last two years, the 17-year-old has been collecting university applications and making connections with admission counselors in an effort to land at a leading American institution. But after American voters elected Donald Trump as president, Al-Johani is having second thoughts. Talal Tawfeeq Al-Johani Talal Tawfeeq Al-Johani Leery of unclear policies and a potentially hostile social environment under a Trump presidency, international students may now be reconsidering higher education in the United States \u2014 and that potential \"brain drain\" could take a hefty financial toll on America's education economy, international education experts say. \"I am concerned about how I'm going to be treated and how people will see me as a Muslim from Saudi,\" said Al-Johani, a student at Dhahran High School in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. \"I feel Trump has affected people's social attitudes, especially towards someone like me.\" Last year, more than one million international students, a record number, came to America to pursue higher education \u2014 pumping $32.8 billion into the U.S. economy, according to the Association of International Educators (NAFSA). The largest contingents: China, India and Saudi Arabia, made up a whopping 53 percent of all international students \u2014 not to mention billions in revenue. \"Higher education is our biggest export\" That money is the lifeblood of many universities, said Neil Ruiz, executive director of the Center for Law, Economics, and Finance at The George Washington University Law School. \"Foreign students don't get financial aid, they pay out of pocket tuition as well as state and international fees, which is why a lot of universities have been marketing to international students,\" he said. That revenue also subsidizes tuition for native-born students, who would see an increase in education costs if there was a dip in foreign counterparts, Ruiz added. \"Higher education is our biggest export,\" he said. Peggy Blumenthal, senior counsel to the president at the Institute of International Education, said there are several financial incentives in bringing international students stateside. A large majority of tuition, housing and fees goes to colleges and universities, which then use revenue to expand programs and hire teachers, she said. But that could all be on the verge of changing. A survey of students in more than 118 countries conducted in February by international student recruiting firms Intead and FPP EDU Media found that 60 percent said they were less likely to study in the U.S. under a Trump presidency. For some countries, like Mexico, that went up to an 80 percent less likelihood. While this only measures inclination and not actual cases, the number speaks volumes to how important the American political climate is for international students, said Intead CEO Benjamin Waxman. A pedestrian walks through the Georgia Tech campus aon March 11, 2016, in Atlanta. David Goldman / AP Manail Anis Ahmed, an expert on international higher education in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said the conversations she's been having with students in her office are increasingly about what could happen under Trump. \"The Trump phenomenon has freaked people out,\" she said. \"Students are actually asking if they might be rounded up because they are Muslim.\" If even 10 percent of Saudis choose not to study in America, a projected economic loss could be close to $200 million, according to Waxman's data and the Institute of International Education. For Indian students, a 10 percent decline would near a $520 million loss. And with Chinese students, the damage could be as steep as $1 billion. Related: The 141 Stances Donald Trump Took During His White House Bid Tonghui Shi, who graduated from China's Beijing Institute of Technology in July, said his plans to get a masters in the United States is currently on hold for at least a year. The 23-year-old wants to see how Trump does with job policies. \"I want to see if he is capable of creating more job opportunities\" before going to the United States, said Shi, who is already looking into programs in Germany and the U.K. \"If the general economic situation gets better in the U.S, the better for all students,\" but Trump is a bit of a wild card right now, he added. \"Plus we saw a lot of black swan events happen this year, and there is some chaos in parts of the U.S.,\" he said. \"So I'm going to wait.\" Although Trump's sole statement on foreign students was an August 2015 tweet saying \"they should not be thrown out,\" many of his public stances since then don't quite match up. When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2015 \"There is a business case in bringing in international students \u2014 and Trump is a businessman,\" Ruiz said. \"But he is also conflicted because he made promises to put American workers first.\" The president-elect also proposed a Muslim registry and \"extreme vetting\" for people from the Middle East \u2014 a booming market for international students, he said. It's unclear what he will do, which is making a lot of people nervous to take a risk, Ruiz explained. But not only are many students spooked by his rhetoric, they are also worried about the practical ramifications, such as not being able to gain the necessary visas, he said. Related: President-Elect Trump Names Picks For Education, UN Ambassador A similar trend happened post-9/11, when the U.S. tightened its visa vetting regulations. Between 2001 and 2003, there was a loss of almost 15,000 international students and millions of dollars, according to Institute of International Education. Hamza Ahmed Fuzail, an Indian national working in the Middle East said his \"lifelong dream\" was to get an MBA in the United States and eventually settle after landing a good job. \"I've always wanted to study in America, but I'm not sure now,\" said Fuzail, who is worried immigration restrictions will be an obstacle for his ambitions. \"The United States doesn't seem like an appealing place anymore.\" Hamza Ahmed Fuzail Courtesy of Hamza Ahmed Fuzail But Blumenthal said it's still too early to say whether a dramatic drop in international students is on the horizon without knowing Trump's visa policy. Al-Johani, who still harbors hopes for an American education, said he's lucky because he has a full year before graduating to see how things play out in a Trump presidency. But Plan B is already in the works. \"If something goes tremendously wrong in the upcoming months,\" he said, \"I'm already lining up schools in Europe.\" Safia Samee Ali ",

Ron Wyden Updated at 3:20 p.m. ET with comments from Sen. Angus King The CIA has concluded that Russia intervened in the 2016 election specifically to help Donald Trump win the presidency, a U.S. official has confirmed to NPR. \"Before, there was confidence about the fact that Russia interfered,\" the official says. \"But there was low confidence on what the direction and intentionality of the interference was. Now they [the CIA] have come to the conclusion that Russia was trying to tip the election to Trump.\" The official adds: \"The reason the assessment changed is that new information became available\" since Oct. 7, when the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement accusing Russia of interfering with the American election process. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections The Washington Post first reported the CIA's new assessment on Friday. In addition to hacking into Democratic organizations, Russians hacked the Republican National Committee's computer systems, according to a separate report from The New York Times \u2014 but they did not release any information that might have been retrieved from Republican networks. \"Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials,\" the Post reports. \"Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton's chances.\" Article continues after sponsorship Citing anonymous officials briefed on the issue, the Post says the CIA shared its findings with senators in a closed-door briefing last week, saying it was now \"quite clear\" that Russia's goal was to tip the presidency in Trump's favor: \" 'It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,' said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. 'That's the consensus view.' \" In a previous assessment, CIA officials had thought Russians intervened with the intention of undermining Americans' electoral system, Adam Entous, one of the Post story's reporters, tells NPR's Scott Simon . On Friday evening, the Trump transition team fired back with a statement dismissing the report of the agency's conclusion. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" the statement said. \"The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.' \" In fact, Trump's percentage of the electoral vote in the 2016 election ranks 46th among presidential election winners in U.S. history, according to factcheck.org. Trump's claim is a reference to the CIA's flawed intelligence on Iraq, in the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The CIA and other spy agencies judged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction \u2014 a judgment that proved to be false. While the leadership of the CIA has changed hands several times in the years since then, many intelligence officers and analysts who worked on the Iraq intelligence still serve at CIA and in other parts of the U.S. intelligence community. But whether or not Trump's top officials acknowledge the report as a possible threat, the Post's Adam Entous points out Trump will soon be in command of the intelligence agencies. \"I'm sure they're going to declassify some elements of the report and I'm sure there will be leaks,\" he adds, but the Obama administration can't disclose the full details of the case, because it would be \"compromising what's known as 'sources and methods,' which would then make it harder for the CIA and the NSA and other spy agencies to get more information in the future.\" Earlier Friday, President Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a \"full review\" of \"malicious cyber activity\" timed to U.S. elections, as we previously reported: \"In the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence officials charged that Russia had interfered. In early October, they released a strongly worded statement saying they were 'confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.' The statement went on to say 'these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.' \" The U.S. official says that \"there is a determination to do something\" before the Obama administration leaves power. \"It's still being discussed exactly what to do. And as we've said before, some of it you may see and some of it you will not.\" Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says the response from President-elect Donald Trump is \"very misguided.\" \"When you have strong evidence that a foreign power has interfered with the American election, with American institutions, then what you do is keep digging. You get all the facts out,\" Wyden says. \"You respond to the American people with the kind of information that they have a right to know.\" He also advocates releasing more information on the cyberattacks. \"I do believe there is important information that the American people have a right to know. It ought to be declassified promptly.\" \"It's very important that the American public knows what happened, not necessarily to re-litigate this election, but to look forward,\" says Sen. Angus King, an independent senator from Maine. \"What worries me is the extent to which this is an ongoing pattern \u2014 which, by the way, is the Russians' pattern in other parts of the world. \"And is that going to be the case in our elections? Four years from now, are we going to have the Democrats, the Republicans, the independents and the Russians?\" King asks. \"I mean, this is very serious stuff.\" ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story His connections to Russia are sure to come under scrutiny during a Senate confirmation hearing. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on Saturday that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s ties to Mr. Putin were \u201ca matter of concern to me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to examine it,\u201d he said on Fox News, adding that \u201cVladimir Putin is a thug, bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Tillerson\u2019s success in business gives him a major credential with Mr. Trump, who values that background, along with loyalty, above other traits. He would be one of several wealthy business executives in top administration jobs. Mr. Tillerson met with Mr. Trump for more than two hours on Saturday at Trump Tower in New York, and two of the president-elect\u2019s key advisers, his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have told Mr. Trump that Mr. Tillerson is in a \u201cdifferent league\u201d from his other options. But Mr. Trump is famously mercurial and could change his mind before making his final decision public. A transition spokesman, Jason Miller, declined to comment. Among the other contenders have been Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has discussed the possibility of appointing as deputy secretary John R. Bolton, a highly conservative and combative veteran of the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Trump has also spoken with Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a far more centrist figure. Graphic: Donald Trump Is Choosing His Cabinet. Here\u2019s the Latest List. Mr. Tillerson, 64, has spent the past 41 years at Exxon, where he began as a production engineer and went on to strike deals around the world for a company that explores, buys and sells oil and gas in some of the globe\u2019s most troubled corners. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Tillerson will deal with many of the world leaders he encountered at Exxon, but with a very different agenda. In addition to an increasingly aggressive Russia, he will have to manage a raging war in Syria that has consumed the last year of diplomatic efforts by Secretary of State John Kerry, a rising China that is staking claims in the South China Sea, and a North Korea that is growing closer to being able to launch a nuclear-armed missile at the United States. The kind of deal-making diplomacy that Mr. Tillerson has excelled at is far different from the alliance-building required of a secretary of state, often without the incentive of profits for negotiating partners. Mr. Tillerson assumed the role of chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil in January 2006, and during his tenure the company acknowledged, for the first time, the science underlying climate change . It has said it supports the creation of a carbon tax, which most Republicans have opposed, and it also supported the Paris climate agreement, a major focus of Mr. Kerry\u2019s time in office. Mr. Trump has vowed to abandon the climate pact. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In May, Mr. Tillerson told shareholders that \u201cwe believe that addressing the risk of climate change is a global issue,\u201d adding that it would require the cooperation of governments, businesses and individuals. Executives at Exxon describe Mr. Tillerson as a strong leader, accustomed to making decisions and giving orders. Some have expressed surprise that he would be interested in the job of secretary of state, because he would not be the final decision maker. A native of Wichita Falls, Tex., Mr. Tillerson speaks with a strong Texas twang and is known for quoting Boy Scout creeds. If he has faced a failure as a leader of Exxon, it was that he was slow to invest in the oil and gas shale fields around Texas and North Dakota. Preferring to invest in big, expensive projects around the world, he left the shale fields open to smaller, more nimble independent companies. When he finally bought TXU, a shale gas-producing company, in 2009 for over $30 billion, he did so when natural gas prices were at a peak. After paying a premium for the company, Exxon\u2019s earnings have suffered in recent years. Still, in total, Mr. Tillerson has excelled in the somewhat rigid atmosphere inside Exxon. Steve Coll, the author of \u201c Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power ,\u201d noted in 2012 that Mr. Tillerson presided over a company that had succeeded \u201cwhere the question is numbers, or engineering effectiveness, or worker safety performance.\u201d \u201cBut when the question involves the human factor, building trust with your communities where you\u2019re drilling, or convincing people that fracking is not going to ruin their water, or dealing with political environments in 150 different countries with lots of supply problems, or dealing with violence on the ground around your oil fields in Africa \u2014 in all of those areas, I think they have a habit of not really taking anybody\u2019s advice,\u201d Mr. Coll said.

By Karoun Demirjian December 10 at 6:59 PM Follow @karoun Senior Democratic lawmakers are calling for a full investigation of the CIA\u2019s claims that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Donald Trump, demanding that the intelligence community turn over all its evidence to Congress. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) released a strongly worded statement Saturday morning, saying CIA conclusions that Russia\u2019s hacking and other election interference had the goal of electing Trump \u2014 first reported Friday night in The Washington Post \u2014 are \u201cstunning and not surprising.\u201d \u201cThat any country could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core,\u201d Schumer stated. \u201cSenate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this.\u201d Schumer\u2019s demands were echoed by outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who charged that FBI Director James B. Comey was aware of the intelligence about Russia\u2019s aims before the election and deliberately kept it private. Reid called on Comey to resign. \u201cOf course. Yes,\u201d he said when asked whether the FBI director should go. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He has his term there. And I\u2019m sure the new administration, they should like him, he helped them get elected,\u201d Reid said on MSNBC. CIA briefers told senators in a closed-door briefing it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal, according to officials. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) Democrats immediately embraced the conclusions of the secret CIA report, which asserted that the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails \u2014 and their release to WikiLeaks \u2014 was the work of Russian operatives with ties to the government of President Vladi\u00admir Putin, all intended to help elect Trump. Key Republicans did not automatically accept that conclusion, despite many of them believing that Russia was behind the DNC hacks and other election interference. For Republicans, giving credence to the CIA assessment probably would cause them to anger Trump even before the president-elect has been inaugurated. Party leaders began deflecting that sort of intelligence well before the election. According to officials present during a September CIA briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed doubts about the intelligence tying the Russian hacks to Trump. McConnell did not comment after the news report surfaced, but his spokesman, David Popp, called the allegations \u201cdisturbing.\u201d \u201cI do not have any readout of what did or didn\u2019t happen in a classified briefing,\u201d Popp said. \u201cBut obviously any foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and the White House has just announced an investigation to see if that has occurred and will formulate a response.\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he could not be certain of the CIA\u2019s claims given its track record, echoing Trump\u2019s reaction to the report in which he said: \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to have a briefing before I could judge it and who\u2019s doing it,\u201d McCain said in an interview late Friday night, once The Post\u2019s report was published. \u201cBut the CIA has not always been exactly right, to say the least.\u201d The CIA\u2019s conclusions that Russia hacked the election to aid Trump has put Republicans in a political bind. On the one hand, the charges of election hacking are a perfect, galvanizing platform from which to go after Russia for what they see as a global pattern of dangerous meddling, not just in the American elections, but also in the wars in Ukraine and Syria. But on the other hand, they now risk unearthing more evidence giving credence to the charges that Trump\u2019s campaign benefited from the hacks. Such evidence could seriously undermine the president-elect before he takes office and beyond. Other Republican senators also expressed doubts about the CIA\u2019s charge. \u201cI\u2019d be very concerned if a foreign government were doing that \u2014 we don\u2019t have any evidence of that yet, and I haven\u2019t seen the CIA report, so I\u2019ll reserve judgment,\u201d Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said late Friday night. And still others are questioning why anyone is talking about Russian hacking at all. \u201cAll this \u2018news\u2019 of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) tweeted Saturday morning. \u201cSerious, but hardly news.\u201d Nonetheless, even before the latest report, McCain and other senior Republican senators were planning to launch a wide-ranging, coordinated probe into alleged Russian interference in the elections in the next Congress. Such an effort could run directly counter to Trump\u2019s foreign policy plans, including a repeatedly stated desire to warm relations with Putin\u2019s Russia. McCain\u2019s Senate Armed Services Committee intends to establish a dedicated subcommittee to probe cyberthreats that will hold hearings on the how the United States would respond to an attack as well as investigate allegations of election hacking. \u201cEverybody that I know, unclassified, has said that the Russians interfered in this election. They hacked into my campaign in 2008; is it a surprise to anyone?\u201d McCain said. \u201cEvery expert I respect said the Russians engaged in that campaign.\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) has said : \u201cI\u2019m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia. . . . I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want Putin personally to pay the price.\u201d He intends to spearhead legislation and hold a series of investigative hearings next year into \u201cRussia\u2019s misadventures throughout the world,\u201d including its intervention in the elections. \u201cClearly a lot of the information was selectively leaked,\u201d Graham said. \u201cRather than try to tank the election in terms of an outcome, I want to go after the country that dared to interfere.\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who had been a candidate for Trump\u2019s secretary of state before the transition team reportedly moved toward ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, said early Saturday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to do the work that we need to do to understand what\u2019s happened.\u201d [Trump expected to pick ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state] He noted that other senators, particularly those on the Senate\u2019s Select Committee on Intelligence, had approached him on the Senate floor during the last roll call votes of the session to \u201cshare their concerns\u201d about the issue of Russian hacking. \u201cThey can tell it\u2019s warranted and that I should, like other committees are doing, pay a lot of attention to the issue,\u201d Corker said. But the Tennessee Republican declined to comment directly about hacks potentially favoring Trump. Trump is relying on Republican doubts to avoid speculation that his win was directly aided by Moscow as he continues to assemble his Cabinet. In a recent interview for Time , Trump said he doesn\u2019t believe Russia interfered in the election, reasoning: \u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d He called the steady stream of allegations tying Russian hacking to his campaign \u201cnot a talking point, a laughing point.\u201d \u201cWhy not get along with Russia? And they can help us fight ISIS . . . and they\u2019re effective and smart,\u201d Trump also said during that interview. Such statements could cause Senate Republicans to take a second look at Trump\u2019s nominees. Senate Democrats cannot filibuster Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, but they are now likely to face more questioning about any ties to Russia. Tillerson, who has been decorated with Russia\u2019s Order of Friendship, is causing special concern. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then we\u2019re gonna have some talkin\u2019. We\u2019ll have some questions,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy, but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "sc Reached by phone Friday evening, Teresa Kaepernick said that the couple initially wanted to avoid the limelight associated with making a public statement about their son but were shocked by the overwhelmingly false narrative that she and her husband don't support their son. The Kaepernicks' support of Colin initially came into question after USA Today reported in early September that the family flew an American flag in front of their Modesto, California, home, an apparent statement of their displeasure with Colin. At the time, Teresa said, \"It's not in our best interest or Colin's best interest\" to make a comment. Colin later told reporters that his parents \"agree with what I'm standing for.\" Over three months later, his parents are finally ready to speak. \"Colin has chosen to kneel for the national anthem as a protest to the continuing racial inequality in this country,\" the statement read. \"He has explained his reasons for this in multiple interviews, yet it seems some people still do not understand his point. For whatever reason, there are some who want to view this as an anti-military protest or an un-American stance. These views could not be further from the truth, but we know that people will believe what they wish to believe. The recent remarks (attacks) by Admiral Harris supported by the Pentagon are over the top, and we feel the desire to make a public statement in support of our son.\" On Wednesday, Adm. Harry B. Harris, who heads the U.S. Pacific Command, made indirect comments against Kaepernick while addressing a crowd to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. \"You can bet that the men and women we honor today -- and those who died that fateful morning 75 years ago -- never took a knee and never failed to stand whenever they heard our national anthem being played,\" he said. \"Our military takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and many have fought and died to defend our constitutional rights. Indeed after such sacrifice it is a reasonable expectation that all of our citizens enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" the Kaepernicks' statement read. Rick and Teresa Kaepernick, who are white, adopted Colin when he was only five weeks old. The couple had lost two sons at birth to congenital heart failure and were not eligible to adopt a white baby from a private adoption agency. Then came along a tiny biracial baby boy who had recently been given away by his 19-year-old white mother. Teresa called Colin her \"perfect child.\" Four years later, the family (Rick and Teresa also have two other children) moved from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, to Turlock, California, with the daunting task of raising a biracial boy in an all-white household in America. From the beginning, the Kaepernicks reaffirmed their youngest son that his different skin color was perfectly OK, and they never tried to make him white. They even drove him an hour out of town to get him cornrows when he was a teenager. \"I never felt that I was supposed to be white. Or black, either. My parents just wanted to let me be who I needed to be,\" Colin told Mr.Porter.com in Septermber 2015. Teresa and Rick have had to stand up for their son for decades now, from strangers not realizing he was their child in his younger years, to a Sporting News columnist writing a racially charged story on Colin's abundance of tattoos within weeks of his first professional start during the 2012 season. \"It annoyed me,\" Teresa told USA Today after the column was posted. \"You are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos? Really? ... That's how you're going to define this kid? It's pretty irritating, but it is what it is.\" Added Rick: \"Instead of saying that Colin does all these great things and donates his time to children, this guy is going to make him out like a gangster.\" The 29-year-old quarterback has been under fire since late August, when football media noticed he wasn't standing for the national anthem during the 49ers' third preseason game against the Green Bay Packers . He initially told reporters he would not \"stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" and that \"There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" Over the past months, Colin has expanded on his mission, stating that he will donate $1 million of his salary this season to organizations whose mission is to help communities of color. He has donated at least $200,000 so far. While he has been criticized by members of the military like Adm. Harris, fellow NFL players and president-elect Donald Trump, Kaepernick also has received praise from high school and college athletes, a handful of WNBA teams, President Barack Obama , and a hashtag-full of other vets. Colin's birth mother, Heidi Russo, surprisingly scolded the quarterback on Twitter during the early days of his protest, tweeting, \"There's ways to make change w/o disrespecting and bringing shame to the very country and family who afforded you so many blessings.\" In a subsequent tweet, she added, \"The path less traveled doesn't need to be one of destruction. #beenthere #besmarter #berespectful.\" Despite the negative press over the past four months, the Kaepernick family firmly stands behind Colin. They acknowledge that the current political and racial climate in America is not helping their son's cause but are hopeful the protest will evoke some form of change. \"When Colin first 'took a knee', his family was as surprised as anyone. We did not understand why he was doing this and were overwhelmed with the public reaction and hate. Colin not only received terrible racist tweets, but also received letters directly to our home similar to that recently received by [ Denver Broncos linebacker] Brandon Marshall ,\" the family's statement read. \"We were truly shocked at the amount of racist hatred out there! Until this had occurred, we had naively believed that the racial atmosphere in this country was far better than it actually is. Prayer and talks with our son gave us a much better understanding of the reason for his protest and how we should view it.\" \"I just want to be on the record that we absolutely do support him,\" Teresa told The Undefeated by phone. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Ann Hornaday December 8 Follow @AnnHornaday Clockwise from top left, \"Moonlight,\" \"La La Land,\" \"Southside With You\" and \"Manchester by the Sea.\" (David Bornfriend/A24; Dale Robinette/Lionsgate; Matt Dinerstein/Miramax/Roadside Attractions; Amazon Studios/Roadside Attractions) Every year, my fellow movie reviewers and I bemoan the current state of cinema \u2014 Too many comic-book flicks! Not enough substance! Where are the musicals/love stories/chick flicks of yore? Wah, I\u2019m bored! \u2014 only to realize that, when it\u2019s time to compile our year-end 10-best lists, we\u2019re (once again) spoiled for choice. This year has been particularly gratifying, if only for its sheer diversity \u2014 not only in terms of gender and ethnic representation in front of and behind the camera (Oscars won\u2019t be nearly So White in 2017), but in terms of categories and platforms, with filmmakers reinvigorating classic genres with imagination, brio and unbridled love for a medium that felt vibrant and new, whether taking the form of big-screen spectacle or a streaming visual album. Enough throat-clearing! Here\u2019s a highly personal list of this year\u2019s best movies, with quite a few honorables worth mentioning. Set in Miami, \"Moonlight\" takes place over three periods of a young black man's life as he struggles to admit he's gay. (A24 Films) 1. \u201cMoonlight\u201d Barry Jenkins\u2019s adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s original story about a young man coming of age on the streets of Liberty City in Miami pulsed with life, observant drama and deep emotion. Jenkins\u2019s elegant visual approach provided a flawless frame for some of the most indelible performances of the year, including by Mahershala Ali as an improbably tender drug dealer and Andre Holland as a highly evolved diner cook. After the sudden death of Joe Chandler (Kyle Chandler), his younger brother Lee (Casey Affleck) is made legal guardian of Joe's son Patrick (Lucas Hedges). (Roadside Attractions) 2. \u201cManchester By the Sea\u201d In case you didn\u2019t cry enough during \u201cMoonlight,\u201d writer-director Kenneth Lonergan had you covered with this beautifully crafted drama about a man coming to terms with his tragic past. Written with Lonergan\u2019s distinctive mix of observant humor and melancholy, the film starred Casey Affleck in a performance all the more breathtaking for its subtlety and stillness. Chris Pine, left, and Ben Foster in \u201cHell or High Water.\u201d (Lorey Sebastian/CBS Films) 3. \u201cHell or High Water\u201d A contemporary western about a couple of bank robbers eluding a crafty sheriff on the rawboned plains of Texas. Just what the world needs, right? But just as I was preparing a snippy tweet invoking \u201cNo Country For Old Men,\u201d I saw the dang thing and it turned out to be terrific: Brilliantly written by Taylor Sheridan, perfectly executed by director David Mackenzie and featuring stunning performances from Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine, this alternately funny and sober-minded cat-and-mouse tale entertained and evoked present-day economic realities with sensitivity and smarts. 4. \u201cThe Confirmation\u201d This might be the best movie you didn\u2019t see in 2016, if only because it had a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss it theatrical run before being shown on Netflix. No matter, there\u2019s still time to enjoy this affecting funny-sad drama (are you detecting a theme?) about a flawed divorced dad spending a pivotal weekend with his son, who\u2019s about to be confirmed. Written and directed by Bob Nelson, this quiet gem has the scruffy, rough-edged charm of Nelson\u2019s previous script, for \u201cNebraska,\u201d made all the more lovable by a cast that includes Clive Owen, Maria Bello and Patton Oswalt. Never has irreverence been made so reverent. This ESPN documentary is broken into five parts and closely examines O.J. Simpson's childhood, NFL career, murder trial and his life now. (ESPN) 5. \u201cO.J.: Made in America\u201d Ezra Edelman\u2019s epic documentary about O.J. Simpson defied expectations that it would only rehash what we already knew about the idolized athlete-turned-notorious murder suspect. Instead, Edelman created a sprawling yet meticulous portrait not just of the man, but of Los Angeles, collegiate and professional sports, celebrity, race and American culture. 6. \u201cCameraperson\u201d Cinematographer Kirsten Johnson has filmed some of the most recognized nonfiction films of the past decade and a half, from \u201cFahrenheit 9/11\u201d to \u201cCitizenfour.\u201d In this deeply personal essay film, Johnson creates a collage of footage from those projects, as well as personal material with her family, to meditate on art, trauma, documentary ethics and the surpassing power of simply bearing witness to one another\u2019s pain. From the director of \"Whiplash,\" this movie-musical stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who fall in love while trying to make it in Los Angeles. In this trailer, Ryan Gosling sings the melancholy \"City of Stars.\" (Lionsgate) 7. \u201cLa La Land\u201d Damien Chazelle (\u201cWhiplash)\u201d single-handedly sets out to save cinema with this throwback of a song-and-dance musical that begins with an exhilaratingly staged production number set within a Los Angeles traffic jam. As a couple of kids looking to make it in showbiz, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling keep right in step with the tonal shifts of a movie that indulges our most romantic, sweet-toothed pleasure centers while paying attention to pathos as well. Yum. From the obvious theme of infidelity to the countless cameos, here's an annotated look at Beyonc\u00e9's new visual album, \"Lemonade.\" (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) 8. \u201cLemonade\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 proves to be a scholar of cinema history and a canny curator of present-day art in a \u201cvisual album\u201d that showed the influences not just of Stanley Kubrick and Julie Dash, but of installation artist Pipilotti Rist and the great emerging filmmaker Khalik Allah. Sensuous, confrontational and drenched with unapologetic rage and beauty, this was an example of visual language at its most fluent and expressive. Filmmaker Ava DuVernay\u2019s critically acclaimed documentary \u201c13th\u201d featured interviews with such figures as activist and scholar Angela Davis. (Netflix) 9. \u201c13th\u201d Ava DuVernay\u2019s documentary about the U.S. Constitution, criminal justice, racism and history qualifies as must-see viewing, touching on the animating political and philosophical issues of our era. On the heels of a comprehensive and enraging primer, DuVernay gifts the audience with what might be the most healing, heartening sequence of the year, simply by sharing joy, perseverance and the implacable insistence on survival despite all odds. \"Southside With You\" is the story of Barack and Michelle Obama's very first date in Chicago in 1989, starring Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter as the young couple. (Roadside Attractions) 10. \u201cSouthside With You\u201d The thought of a filmmaker making his writing-directing debut with a speculative romantic comedy-drama about Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s first date is fraught at best. But Richard Tanne stuck the landing with a movie that captured its characters and their time and place in late-\u201980s Chicago with insight and impressive authenticity. As the lead couple, Tika Sumpter and Parker Sawyers delivered performances that were impressions rather than impersonations; by going back to the beginning, the film made a fitting goodbye to the couple that has occupied the White House for the past eight years. Here are some movies that easily could have ended up on my top 10 list, had I not been constrained by numerical obstinacy: \u201cLoving,\u201d \u201cArrival,\u201d \u201cThe Fits,\u201d \u201cA Bigger Splash,\u201d \u201cLove & Friendship,\u201d \u201cSully,\u201d \u201cCaptain Fantastic,\u201d \u201cPaterson,\u201d \u201cEye in the Sky,\u201d \u201cHail, Caesar!,\u201d \u201cLast Days in the Desert,\u201d \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d \u201cTower,\u201d \u201cWeiner,\u201d \u201cThe Eagle Huntress\u201d and \u201cJackie.\u201d Check them out if you haven\u2019t already.

    "text": "Tensions erupt between Trump and the CIA over Russia's hacking during the 2016 campaign Donald Trump John Minchillo / Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump speaks to a crowd in Cincinnati on Dec. 1. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to a crowd in Cincinnati on Dec. 1. (John Minchillo / Associated Press) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Tensions between Donald Trump and U.S. intelligence officials boiled over Saturday\u00a0as Trump's transition team mockingly compared a\u00a0secret CIA assessment that Russia\u00a0tried to sway the U.S. election in Trump's favor to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgments on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction.\u00a0\u00a0 The widening public rift\u00a0between the incoming president and the\u00a0nation\u2019s powerful intelligence community\u00a0could pose high-risk problems both\u00a0for his administration and for national security. \u00a0 CIA leaders at agency headquarters in Langley, Va., are bracing for a potentially adversarial relationship with Trump\u2019s White House, especially over what the spy agency sees as Russia\u2019s malign role on multiple\u00a0fronts, according to two officials who  requested anonymity in speaking about internal discussions. \u201cIt sets up one of the great crises in the history of the executive branch,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a former senior CIA officer who spent more than two decades as a spy before retiring in 2007. \u201cAll the agency can do short of insurrection is to present the facts when allowed to the executive we serve.\u201d Trump has received only a handful of classified intelligence briefings since his upset victory last month,\u00a0and CIA officials now believe it is because Trump has rejected their assessments\u00a0on Moscow\u2019s\u00a0aggression in Ukraine, its pressure on\u00a0Eastern Europe and its computer hacks\u00a0to boost\u00a0Trump's chances against Hillary Clinton . Some compared the current tensions\u00a0to the distrust that marked relations with Vice President Dick Cheney before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, when he was widely seen as cherry-picking raw intelligence and pushing\u00a0agency analysts\u00a0to support his views. President Nixon had a famously frosty relationship with the CIA, which he considered too powerful and too\u00a0independent. President Clinton\u2019s\u00a0first CIA director, R. James Woolsey, was so disliked in the White House that he could barely get an appointment to see the president.\u00a0 Still, no other\u00a0incoming president has publicly\u00a0rejected\u00a0a major CIA\u00a0assessment about a\u00a0security threat, or declined regular classified briefings from officials representing\u00a0America\u2019s $70-billion-a-year global espionage and surveillance\u00a0apparatus.\u00a0 Nor has a transition team issued a statement\u00a0like the one it emailed\u00a0Saturday after the Washington Post reported that the CIA had concluded\u00a0that Russian President\u00a0 Vladimir Putin \u2019s government had authorized the hacking and leaking of Democratic Party emails this year in a deliberate effort to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances.\u00a0 \u00a0\"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said, referring to the\u00a0misjudgments and mistakes used to justify the  invasion of Iraq, a systemic intelligence failure that badly tarnished the\u00a0CIA\u2019s reputation. The Trump team\u2019s\u00a0statement went on to say that the Nov. 8 election \u201cended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history,\u201d a claim that is untrue.\u00a0 Eight of the 12 most recent presidential\u00a0elections\u00a0have been decided with a larger electoral college victory. And unlike most elections, Trump lost the popular vote.\u00a0 Inside the CIA, career analysts have been mystified by Trump\u2019s repeated dismissal of evidence that Russia hacked into Democratic National Committee emails and copied communications from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Trump\u2019s pick for national security advisor, retired three-star Army Gen.\u00a0 Michael Flynn , whom the Obama administration\u00a0fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\u00a0 Flynn\u2019s tenure there was rocky, in part because he ordered aides to chase pet theories that quickly became known as\u00a0\u201cFlynn facts,\u201d since they were not grounded in reality. Trump\u2019s choice to run the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), an aerospace entrepreneur and former Army officer, could get caught in the middle.\u00a0 Pompeo developed a rapport with CIA leaders as a member of\u00a0the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0panel that oversees the agency. Pompeo, who graduated first in his class at West Point,\u00a0has a reputation as a\u00a0quick study and an advocate for the CIA. Now he will take over an agency that\u00a0has been openly criticized by his\u00a0future boss, the president-elect. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be in an awkward spot when he is called to give a lay-down on Russia or some other topic,\u201d\u00a0a former senior national security official who has advised Trump\u2019s transition team said in an interview.\u00a0 CIA analysts will expect Pompeo to relay their unvarnished\u00a0view\u00a0but Trump may not want to hear it, the former official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u00a0 Trump has repeatedly said that he doesn\u2019t believe that\u00a0Russia tried to interfere in the election, has praised Putin and has called for closer relations with the Kremlin. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week. The hacking, he said, \u201ccould be Russia. It could be China. And it could be some guy in New Jersey.\u201d U.S. agencies believe they have identified\u00a0who in the Russian government was involved in ordering operations to disrupt the U.S. election\u00a0and how they were\u00a0orchestrated. They\u00a0are reluctant to make the information public because that\u00a0could compromise how the intelligence was gathered, a U.S. official said, speaking on\u00a0condition of anonymity.\u00a0 The FBI is still investigating the Russian\u00a0hacks\u00a0and have yet to find that\u00a0a U.S. citizen\u00a0assisted them, the official said. Rep. Adam B. Schiff \u00a0(D-Burbank), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump is not disregarding\u00a0the intelligence because he has examined the information and\u00a0disagrees with how\u00a0it was interpreted. Rather, he said, Trump\u00a0has rejected it because \u201cit doesn't fit with the political narrative he wants to tell.\u201d That doesn't bode well for how Trump will act as president. \"He is willing to disparage the intelligence community when it benefits him,\" Schiff said.\u00a0 On Friday, the White House said that\u00a0President Obama had\u00a0ordered the CIA and other intelligence agencies to conduct a full review of foreign-based digital attacks aimed at influencing the election. Obama ordered the review completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20, in what appeared to be an attempt to ensure the incoming administration doesn\u2019t kill the inquiry.

Hitrino Mayor Nuridin Ismail told reporters that children had been buried under the rubble of a house that collapsed. Two tanker cars carrying propane-butane and propylene derailed at the station in Hitrino, hit nearby electric lines and exploded, police officials said. The engine driver survived and has been questioned, police said. Officials earlier had described the cargo as liquefied natural gas. A damaged house is pictured after a cargo train derailed and exploded in the village of Hitrino, Bulgaria, Dec. 10, 2016. Close REUTERS The entire village was evacuated later Saturday as a precaution due to the risk of possible new explosions. Emergency teams started a high-risk operation to reload the hazardous substances. Prime Minister Boiko Borisov, who arrived at the site of the blast, urged citizens to donate blood to address shortages at nearby hospitals. \u201cThere will be more casualties,\u201d Borisov told reporters. He said several people suffered more than 90 percent burns and that damage from the explosion was extensive. The train had been traveling from the Bulgarian Black Sea port city of Burgas to the Danube city of Ruse. The government declared Monday a national day of mourning for the victims of the blast.

    "text": "Recounts Bring Stein Publicity That Eluded Her on the Trail By kathleen ronayne, associated press Dec 10, 2016, 2:44 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Green Party candidate Jill Stein holds a press conference at the federal courthouse in Philadelphia after a hearing on the Green Party's request for a statewide recount, Friday, Dec. 9, 2016. A federal judge allowed Wisconsin's presidential recount to move forward Friday as a another federal judge in Pennsylvania planned to take the weekend to decide on a Green Party-backed request to recount paper ballots and examine election computer systems for signs of hacking. Democrats and Republicans alike are criticizing her recount efforts as a ploy to raise her national profile for a future run. (Ed Hille/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP) 0 Shares Email Long before presidential recounts crossed her mind, trash dumping and mercury contamination pushed Jill Stein into politics. Stein, a physician, joined a 1990s movement to shut down or better regulate mercury-polluting incinerators in Massachusetts. She authored papers on child neurological damage and spoke at public gatherings. She testified at hearings as a medical expert. Massachusetts eventually enacted strict limits on mercury emissions, and a few incinerators closed. But Stein had begun to see the system as set up to block change, and when the Green Party recruited her to run for governor in 2002, she took the chance. \"I was part of a very frustrated public health initiative, and then the Green Party came to me and said, 'Why don't you run for office?'\" Stein said in an October interview with The Associated Press. \"I said, 'Everything else is failing, I might as well try electoral politics.'\" She's been trying ever since, running for president in 2012 and again this year, earning roughly 1.5 million votes. She lost the 2002 bid, as well as another run for governor in 2010, state representative in 2004 and Massachusetts secretary of state in 2006. Stein is now gaining arguably more attention than she ever did on the campaign trail by pushing for recounts of the presidential contest in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She has claimed, without concrete evidence, that the voting systems there are vulnerable to tampering and that a recount would reassure voters. A judge in Michigan ended the recount this week, ruling Stein lacked standing. A recount is underway in Wisconsin, and a judge is set to rule Monday on whether one can begin in Pennsylvania. Stein said efforts to stop the recounts will only increase voters' distrust in the system. Her critics, including President-elect Donald Trump, charge she is running a scam to raise her profile and rake in money for another presidential run. She has raised more than $7 million to help cover the costs of the recounts, double what she raised for her presidential campaign. Democrats have painted her as a spoiler stealing their votes. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton would have won all three states, and the presidency, if all of Stein's votes had gone to her instead. But Stein argues most of her voters would not have supported Clinton. Stein denies she's trying to boost her profile. Her website says donors will be surveyed to determine how to spend any leftover recount money. \"If I was thinking about me, I'm not sure I would be doing this now,\" Stein told the AP this week. \"Election integrity is a big Green value.\" Those who know Stein say she is sincerely passionate about her issues. But few believe being a perennial candidate is the best route, given her lack of electoral success and inability to form an organized campaign. \"She certainly would've been, in my mind, more effective staying in the arena of being an advocate for health issues,\" said Joan Kulash, an activist with Stein on the incinerator campaigns. When the Green Party recruited Stein for 2002, co-chairman Jonathan Leavitt thought he had found a winner. He believed Stein's medical background and articulation made her perfect to woo voters fed up with the status quo but wary of supporting a third party. Massachusetts had just passed a law that allowed candidates to qualify for public funds. But campaigns were required to show 6,000 small contributions in order to qualify, and Stein came up short. Leavitt, serving as a campaign manager, eventually left because he felt too many people were trying to direct the campaign. A Boston news poll showed Stein performed strongly in a televised debate against Republican Mitt Romney , Democrat Shannon O'Brien and two other third-party candidates. Ultimately, she captured just 3.5 percent of the vote; Romney won. \"If we had stayed focused on the mechanics of the campaign, then we would've had a third-party campaign with a big budget,\" Leavitt said. \"We would've won that campaign with Jill Stein in Massachusetts.\" Stein, 66, argues winning isn't the only mark of success. She describes Democrats and Republicans as driving America toward an existential crisis, and sees the Green Party's struggle against powerful interests as a battle designed for her to lose. She argues that the media deliberately locks third-party candidates out of coverage and debates and that the two major parties practice fearmongering to maintain allegiances. Her presidential platform centered on erasing student debt, reaching 100 percent clean energy by 2030 and cutting back U.S. involvement in international conflicts. Stein received nearly 1 million more votes in 2016 than she did in 2012, which she considers a sign of growing displeasure with the status quo. She said she's not sure whether she'll run again. \"This is a David and Goliath struggle,\" Stein told the AP this week. \"David doesn't get Goliath on the first shot.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Schumer calls for full congressional investigation of Russian interference Ellen Nakashima and Kristine GuerraThe Washington Post The CIA 's findings that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency are both \"stunning and not surprising,\" the next leader of Senate Democrats said, raising the need for Congress to conduct a full investigation. The statement from Sen. Charles E. Schumer , D-N.Y., issued Saturday morning, was in response to a Washington Post story that intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee to boost Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton's chances. The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now \"quite clear\" that electing Trump was Russia's goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. \"It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,\" said a senior U.S. official brief on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. \"That's the consensus view.\" CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals... The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals... (Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller) In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U.S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia's role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals. And they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as \"the threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process.\" In his statement, Schumer said the idea that any country \"could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core.\" He added that silence from WikiLeaks and others has been \"deafening.\" \"Senate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this,\" Schumer said. \"It's imperative that our intelligence community turns over any relevant information so that Congress can conduct a full investigation.\" Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the \"Russian government is not the source.\" Charles Schumer Molly Riley / AP Sen. Charles Schumer speaks to the media after on Capitol Hill on Nov. 29, 2016 in Washington. Sen. Charles Schumer speaks to the media after on Capitol Hill on Nov. 29, 2016 in Washington. (Molly Riley / AP) The Trump transition team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again,' \" the statement read. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community's findings about Russian hacking. \"I don't believe they interfered\" in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, \"could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" The White House and President Obama had ordered a \"full review\" of Russian hacking during the presidential campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process.

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was part of a group of coal state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of health benefits for coal miners in the stopgap spending bill. Alex Brandon/AP Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short-term-funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline. It's become a familiar year-end act for Congress: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed 63-36, runs out in April. Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners. The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months. Article continues after sponsorship Retired Coal Miners At Risk Of Losing Promised Health Coverage And Pensions \"Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.\" With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday \u2014 and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations \u2014 Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown. The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs. The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year. Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis. For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process. The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew. Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children. Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic. The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010. ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy He has promised hearings, saying the Russian activity was \u201ca call to action,\u201d as has Senator John McCain of Arizona, one of the few senators left from the Cold War era, when the Republican Party made opposition to the Soviet Union \u2014 and later deep suspicion of Russia \u2014 the centerpiece of its foreign policy. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said there was little doubt that the Russian government was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee. \u201cAll of the intelligence analysts who looked at it came to the conclusion that the tradecraft was very similar to the Russians,\u201d he said. Even one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, said on Friday that he had no doubt about Russia\u2019s culpability. His complaint was with the intelligence agencies, which he said had \u201crepeatedly\u201d failed \u201cto anticipate Putin\u2019s hostile actions,\u201d and with the Obama administration\u2019s lack of a punitive response. Mr. Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the intelligence agencies had \u201cignored pleas by numerous Intelligence Committee members to take more forceful action against the Kremlin\u2019s aggression.\u201d He added that the Obama administration had \u201csuddenly awoken to the threat.\u201d Like many Republicans, Mr. Nunes is threading a needle. His statement puts him in opposition to the position taken by Mr. Trump and his incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has traveled to Russia as a private citizen for RT, the state-controlled news operation, and attended a dinner with Mr. Putin. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Nunes\u2019s contention that Mr. Obama was captivated by a desire to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia is also notable, because Mr. Trump has said he is trying to do the same \u2014 though he is avoiding that term, which was made popular by Mrs. Clinton in her failed effort as secretary of state in 2009. There are splits both within the intelligence agencies and the congressional committees that oversee them. Officials say the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. have not always shared their findings with the F.B.I., which they often distrust. The question of how vigorously to investigate also has a political tinge: Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, for example, are pushing hard for a broad investigation, while some Republicans are resisting. Intelligence can also get politicized, of course, and one of the running debates about the disastrously mistaken assessments of Iraq that Mr. Trump often cites is whether the intelligence itself was tainted or whether the Bush White House read it selectively to support its march to war in 2003. But what is unfolding in the argument over the Russian hacking is more complex, because tracking the origin of cyberattacks is complicated. It is made all the harder by the fact that the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. do not want to reveal human sources or technical abilities, including American software implants in Russian computer networks. This much is known: In mid-2015, a hacking group long associated with the F.S.B. \u2014 the successor to the old Soviet K.G.B. \u2014 got inside the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer systems. The intelligence gathering appeared to be fairly routine, and it was unsurprising: The Chinese, for instance, penetrated Mr. Obama\u2019s and Mr. McCain\u2019s presidential campaign communications in 2008. In the spring of 2016, a second group of Russian hackers, long associated with the G.R.U., a military intelligence agency, attacked the D.N.C. again, along with the private email accounts of prominent Washington figures like John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Those emails were ultimately published \u2014 a step the Russians had never taken before in the United States, though the tactic has been used often in former Soviet states and elsewhere in Europe. That moved the issue from espionage to an \u201cinformation operation\u201d with a political motive. One person who attended a classified briefing on the intelligence said that the investigators had explained that the malware used in the cyberattack on the D.N.C. matched tools previously used by hackers with proven ties to the Russian government. That sort of \u201cpattern analysis\u201d is common in cyberinvestigations, though it is not conclusive. But the intelligence agencies had more: They had managed to identify the individuals from the G.R.U. who oversaw the hacking efforts. That may have come from intercepted conversations, spying efforts, or implants in computer systems that allow the tracking of emails and text messages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In briefings to Mr. Obama and on Capitol Hill, intelligence agencies have said they now believe that what began as an effort to undermine the credibility of American elections morphed over time into a much more targeted effort to harm Mrs. Clinton, whom Mr. Putin has long accused of interfering in Russian parliamentary elections in 2011. But to hedge their bets before the election, according to the briefings, the Russians also targeted the Republican National Committee, Republican operatives and prominent members of the Republican establishment, like former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. However, few of those emails have ever surfaced, save for Mr. Powell\u2019s, which were critical of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign for trying to draw him into a defense of her use of a private computer server. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Sean Spicer, disputed the report in The Times that the intelligence community had concluded that the R.N.C. had been hacked. \u201cThe RNC was not \u2018hacked,\u2019\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThe @nytimes was told and chose to ignore.\u201d On Friday night, before The Times published its report, the committee had refused to comment.

USA TODAY Sports NBA former player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar conducts a television interview before the start of the 2016 Democratic National Convention at Wells Fargo Arena. (Photo: Michael Chow-USA TODAY) Nearly 50 years later, the iconic black and white photograph still resonates.\u00a0In the 1967 photo, Muhammad Ali is flanked by Jim Brown, Bill Russell and Lew Alcindor, now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and other athletes. Brown, Russell and Alcindor traveled to Cleveland to support Ali, who had refused induction into the U.S. Army. \u201cThat photo represents an awakening among a strata of black Americans who believed they had a chance to win this fight,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIf we supported Muhammad Ali, maybe he could win his contest with the federal government.\u201d LeBron James donating $2.5M to Muhammad Ali exhibit at Smithsonian Abdul-Jabbar \u2013 political and social activist, author and Basketball Hall of Famer \u2013 talks in-depth about Ali on MSNBC\u2019s IconocList, which airs Saturday at 10 p.m ET.\u00a0The show features influential people talking about the people who inspired them. \u201cToo many don\u2019t understand what a rich heritage that we have and all of the examples that we have among the historical figures of our country who provide a lot of inspiration and ideas about solving problems,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cThe sheer volume of them and the different areas they came from \u2013 they are enough to inspire anybody from any background because Americans with diverse backgrounds have succeeded here.\u201d Abdul-Jabbar also talks about Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt and Louis Armstrong during the hour-long program. Small group protests against Trump before Army-Navy football game \u201cDr. King \u2013 what he did was incredible,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cFor me, it was especially so. I remember the Emmett Till murder in 1955. I didn\u2019t understand why it happened, but it had a profound effect on me. I couldn\u2019t get it. It really bothered me. It made me pay attention to the Civil Rights movement. I was only 8 years old when it happened, but it still got to me. \u201cTo have someone who could lead a whole movement of people and end with the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act and get the laws in our country to support 100% citizenship for black Americans, that was an incredible thing. He has to be on the list.\u201d It is an interesting time in Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s life. He was honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom on Nov. 22, and on Monday, he will receive Sports Illustrated\u2019s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, along with Brown and Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be recognized. I was recognized when I played professional basketball, and to gain more recognition later in life for others things, it\u2019s very rewarding for me,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cYou never know how people are going to accept you. I\u2019m glad for the positive because in addition to that, I\u2019ve received a good deal of hate mail. It works both ways.\u201d He also had advice for those who may be unhappy with the result of the presidential election. \u201cPeople have to organize and fight for what they believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople of a certain political outlook, things got dark for them with the election. They just have to learn to persevere through it, organize with the people who think like them and come back stronger the next time and win the election. That\u2019s the only thing I can do.

    "text": "Email Even as homicide rates have climbed in other American cities, New York City is again on pace to have a near-record low number of shootings, and police are partly crediting refined tactics that include collecting more data and forensic evidence than ever before to go after the worst offenders. \"It's no longer good enough to just make an arrest,\" said Deputy Commissioner Durmot Shea, a top New York Police Department crime-fighting strategist. The department is also trying to focus harder, he said, on the kind of arrests that make a difference by targeting a relatively small number of people responsible for making neighborhoods unsafe. Through Dec. 4, the city had recorded 942 shooting incidents, putting the city on course to have even fewer than the 1,103 in 2013 \u2014 the lowest number since the police department began counting shootings in 1993. A majority of people who have been shot survived. As of Dec. 4, the city had recorded 313 killings, close to the 333 set in 2014. Still, it's not clear whether the crime reductions in New York are due to refined police tactics or other factors, like a continuing influx of wealth into the city. Chicago , which has roughly a third of the population of New York, has adopted a similar philosophy of quality-over-quantity gun arrests, yet the number of shootings and homicides there has soared. Through the end of November, it had recorded more than 700 killings, the first time Chicago has eclipsed the 700 mark in a year since 1998. Chicago is on pace to have nearly 300 more homicides this year than last year. Alex Vitale, a sociologist at Brooklyn College, said targeted policing may make more sense in New York because, compared to Chicago, gun violence is concentrated in smaller pockets of poverty. The drop in the number of shootings also comes in an era when the department is making fewer arrests overall and has vastly curtailed a strategy nicknamed \"stop and frisk\" that involved halting and searching hundreds of thousands of young men on the street to make sure they weren't carrying weapons. New York City police made 54,000 fewer arrests in 2015 than they did in 2013. Much of the decline was due to arresting far fewer people for possessing small amounts of marijuana . As overall crime has dropped in New York, police have poured additional resources into investigating crimes that might have previously gotten a less intensive treatment. In one recent case, police who came across an abandoned, shot-up rental car took care to collect ballistic and DNA evidence that was saved until it was matched to a gun found in a Manhattan hotel. The link turned out to be a key break in an investigation of a Brooklyn gang best known for its affiliation with \"Hot Boy\" rapper Bobby Shmurda. Prosecutors parlayed that and other evidence into a string of convictions and long prison terms, said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan, whose office handled the case. After street gang members spread panic by drawing their guns for a shootout last year near a grade school in the Far Rockaway section of Queens, investigators studied forensic and video evidence from other shootings, tips from informants and logs of suspects who had themselves been wounded in past gunfights. The NYPD says the targeted policing approach resulted in 12 arrests. After that, shootings in the two police precincts that cover Far Rockaway dropped by 65 percent. Police cite the takedown of Shmurda's gang as a game-changer. In one precinct where it roamed, there have been 14 shootings so far this year, compared to 36 in 2014 over the same period. Amy Wilkerson, a social worker with Rock Safe Streets, a gun violence intervention program in Far Rockaway run by the nonprofit Sheltering Arms, said the neighborhood still has a long way to go. \"To say we locked up a few people and gun violence is down shows a disconnect,\" she said. \"There are people in this community who are afraid to send their children outside because of gun violence. It's a disease. Taking one person out doesn't work because other people are infected.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show the rapper's last name is spelled Shmurda, not Shurmda. 0 Shares ",

The extra troops will include special operations forces and are in addition to 300 U.S. troops already authorized for the effort to recruit, organize, train and advise local Syrian forces to combat ISIS, also known as Islamic State or ISIL.

He said President Barack Obama approved the troop additions last week. \"These uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL,\" Carter said in his address to the IISS Manama Dialogues in the Bahraini capital, Manama. \"By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we've been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum,\" he said. Related: A Real-Life Horror Story as ISIS Loses Control in Mosul The military push in Syria is complicated by the predominant role played by local Kurdish fighters, who are the most effective U.S. partner against IS in Syria but are viewed by Turkey \u2014 a key U.S. ally \u2014 as a terrorist threat. A senior defense official said the troop boost announced by Carter will give the U.S. extra capability to train Arab volunteers who are joining the Raqqa push but are not well trained or equipped. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of internal Pentagon planning. The Associated Press ",

Santa Clara County agreed to settle a wrongful death and civil rights violation claim brought by the family of 31-year-old Michael Tyree, who was found dead in his cell last year. The settlement will be paid to Tyree's two sisters and his 7-year-old daughter. \"The family would much rather have their brother than any amount of money. It's the most bittersweet money,\" attorney Paula Canny told the San Francisco Chronicle (http://bit.ly/2gKD30X). Three correctional officers were charged with murder in Tyree's death and will face trial in January. Tyree died from internal bleeding and suffered significant liver and spleen damage. An investigation determined he had been beaten hours before he was found in his cell. Tyree, who was serving time for misdemeanor theft and drug possession, had been housed by himself in a section of the jail reserved for inmates who are in protective custody or have special needs . Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith had said the three guards were the only people with access to Tyree's cell the night he died. Several inmates told police they could hear Tyree screaming for several minutes. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "ISIS militants re-enter Syria's historic Palmyra Published               December 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 BEIRUT \u2013 \u00a0ISIS militants re-entered the historic city of Palmyra in central Syria on Saturday for the first time since they were expelled by Syrian and Russian forces nine months ago. The activist-run Palmyra Coordination network said the militants had nearly encircled the city and entered its northern and northwestern neighborhoods. The group, which maintains contacts inside the city, said ISIS fighters were approaching the city's UNESCO heritage site as well. Osama al-Khatib said government soldiers were fleeing Palmyra. \"The army as an institution has dissolved,\" he said. Some soldiers and militiamen remain in the city, along with 120 families who have not been able to leave, Khatib said. He spoke to The Associated Press from Gaziantep, Turkey. \"There is strong fighting on all sides,\" he reported. \"There is no exit except through a corridor to the west.\" The dramatic reversal in Palmyra comes days after ISIS militants in the Iraqi city of Mosul launched a major counterattack that surprised Iraqi soldiers, killing at least 20 and halting their advance. Iraqi special forces units have entered the eastern outskirts of the largest remaining ISIS-held city, but their advance has been greatly slowed by both a desire to limit civilian casualties and the resilience of the ISIS fighters. On Saturday U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that an additional 200 U.S. soldiers would be dispatched to Syria to accelerate the push on the self-declared ISIS capital of Raqqa. The 200, to include special operations troops, are in addition to 300 already authorized for the effort to recruit, organize, train and advise local Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces to fight ISIS. \"These uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL,\" Carter said, using an alternative acronym for the extremist group. \"By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we've been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum.\" In Palmyra, Mohammad Hassan Homsi of the Palmyra News Network reported that a military division withdrew from the city earlier Saturday without leaving a way out for civilians. According to Homsi, only 350 families had returned to the city of its original 30,000 inhabitants after the government retook the city to great fanfare in March. ISIS militants were shelling the government's military airport to the east of the city, according to the Coordination group. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militants reached the city's Tadmor Hospital and its wheat silos. The militants advanced on Palmyra after seizing several government positions, oil fields, and strategic hilltops in the surrounding countryside in a lightning three-day campaign. Earlier Saturday, the militants' Aamaq News Agency claimed the group shot down a government warplane in the Jazal oil fields west of the city. The Observatory said the jet had crashed for reasons unknown. It reported the militants had taken the oil fields. During the 10 months that ISIS held Palmyra, from May 2015 to March 2016, the militants dynamited several of the city's famed ancient Roman monuments and executed its archaeological director. After the city was retaken, the Russian government staged a classical music concert in the city's soaring Roman amphitheater last May to celebrate the success. The Syrian and Russian government maintain they are defending the global community against Islamic terrorism in the country's devastating five-1/2-year war. After taking Palmyra, the two states turned their attention to wiping out the internal opposition in Damascus and Aleppo, leaving the historic city relatively unguarded. Syrian state media had no comment. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Trump team says 'move on,' after Obama calls for cyber-hacking probe Published               December 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition team late Friday criticized President Obama's order for a full-scale review of campaign-season cyber-attacks allegedly linked to Russia, saying it\u2019s \u201ctime to move on.\u201d Trump has been repeatedly dismissive of the intelligence community's determination that Russia sought through hacking to disrupt the U.S. election, which he won in a stunning upset over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and `Make America Great Again,\u2019 \u201d the transition team said. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d The investigation ordered by Obama will be a \"deep dive\" into a possible pattern of increased \"malicious cyber activity\" timed to the campaign season, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday. On Saturday, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, the next Senate minority leader, called for the Republican-led Congress to address the issue. \u201cReports of the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Russia actively sought to help elect Donald Trump are simultaneously stunning and not surprising, given Russia\u2019s disdain for democracy and admiration for autocracy,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cSenate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this.\u201d The administration probe will include looking into the email hacks that rattled the presidential campaign. It also will look at the tactics, targets, key actors and the U.S. government's response to the hacks, as well as incidents reported in past elections,. The president ordered the report earlier in the week and asked that it be completed before he leaves office next month, Schultz said. The Washington Post reported Friday that the CIA has concluded that Russia aimed specifically to help Trump, a Republican, win the presidency. The Kremlin has rejected the hacking accusations. In the months leading up to the election, email accounts of Democratic Party officials and a top Clinton campaign aide were breached, emails leaked and embarrassing and private emails posted online. Many Democrats believe the hackings benefited Trump's bid. Schultz said the president sought the probe as a way of improving U.S. defense against cyberattacks and was not intending to question the legitimacy of Trump's victory. Obama's move comes as Democratic lawmakers have been pushing Obama to declassify more information about Russia's role, fearing that Trump, who has promised a warmer relationship with Moscow, may not prioritize the issue. The White House said it would make parts of the report public and would brief lawmakers and relevant state officials on the findings. It emphasized the report would not focus solely on Russian operations or email hacks involving Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and Democratic National Committee accounts. The emails were made public by WikiLeaks. Schultz said intelligence officials would be reviewing incidents going back to the 2008 presidential campaign, when the campaigns of Sen. John McCain and Obama were breached by hackers. The intelligence community has already concluded that Russia-backed actors likely were involved in breaching and releasing the Democratic Party emails. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied the Russian government or any other \u201cstate parties\u201d were the source for the 50,000 emails, which fueled weeks of embarrassing coverage for the Clinton campaign detailing behind-the-scenes discussions and arguments among advisers and family members. Many Democrats believe the disclosures in emails stolen from Democratic Party officials and Podesta\u2019s account benefited Trump.\u00a0 Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Friday that Democrats \u201cwon\u2019t learn the lessons\u201d from the 2016 race. \"A little self-awareness would do for a team that is blaming everybody but themselves for this. It\u2019s Bernie Sanders\u2019 fault \u2026 It\u2019s the alt-right\u2019s fault,\" she said. \"It\u2019s \u2026 fake news\u2019 fault. It\u2019s Russian interference. It\u2019s James Comey. ... How about you had no message?\" Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson and Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

He also said there were other irregularities and problems in the electoral process. \"Our investigations reveal that in some cases, voters were told that the opposition has already won and there was no need for them to vote,\" Jammeh said. Last week, supporters of the opposition took to the streets to celebrate Barrow's win. Jammeh's allegations are now \"plunging Gambia into confusion and uncertainty,\" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports. President-elect Barrow responded, telling reporters, \"The outgoing president has no constitutional authority to reject the result of the election and order for fresh elections to be held,\" Reuters reports . \"I urge him to change his current position and accept the verdict of the people in good faith for the sake of the Gambia, our homeland, whose people deserve peace and freedom and prosperity,\" he added to The Associated Press.

The Economic Community of West African States, the U.N. and African Union echoed the sentiment in a joint statement : \"They call on the government of The Gambia to abide by its constitutional responsibilities and international obligations.

Gambians closed down shops and stayed home out of fear of violence. Human rights groups have criticized Jammeh for abuses during his 22-year rule. In its 2016 report , Human Rights Watch said his government \"frequently committed serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture against those who voiced opposition to the government,\" creating \"a climate of fear within Gambia.\" On Saturday, the organization retweeted a statement from deputy program director Babatunde Olugboji saying they were \"deeply concerned.\" \u2014 Juliana Nnoko-Mewanu (@NnokoMewanu) December 10, 2016 Diplomats told Reuters that it's unclear what international organizations plan to do, but there is a precedent for military intervention.

    "text": "There is some merit to both rationales, but I\u2019d also like to suggest a third possibility: Navy\u2019s gaming the system. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For instance, have you ever heard of the Naval Academy Preparatory School , or NAPS as it\u2019s called? In Newport, R.I., close to the Naval War College, NAPS was founded in 1915 as a place where enlisted men with officer potential could get up to speed academically before entering the Naval Academy. By the late 1960s, NAPS had opened its doors to civilians. This was partly a diversity effort, but it was also a way to get in the children of alumni or politicians who didn\u2019t have the grades or SAT scores to be admitted into the Naval Academy directly from high school. Once in NAPS, which is tuition-free, students were essentially guaranteed a spot in the Naval Academy the next year. According to a Naval Academy spokesman, Cmdr. David McKinney, the prep school costs taxpayers around $14 million a year. Photo Zach Abey, No. 9, Navy\u2019s quarterback, lunged for a touchdown against the Temple defensive back Sean Chandler, right, in the American Athletic Conference championship in Annapolis, Md., last Saturday. Credit Nick Wass/Associated Press In the 1980s, Navy noticed that the Air Force Academy, which was regularly trouncing it in football, was placing recruited athletes in its prep school. Indeed, in 2003, Fisher DeBerry, the longtime coach of the Falcons, told The Colorado Springs Gazette that the prep school \u201chas had a major impact on the success of our football team.\u201d Eager to turn the tide against its rival, Navy began to copy DeBerry\u2019s methods. Sure enough, NAPS is now a means by which Navy launders underqualified athletes into the Naval Academy. Jim Kenney, a retired Navy captain who was the commanding officer of the Navy prep school from 1978-82, recalled that in his era maybe four football players had been enrolled. \u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cit is dominated by athletes.\u201d McKinney says that recruited athletes made up only 35 percent of the current NAPS class. But their effect on Navy athletics is huge. Seventy-five percent of the current football team got into the Naval Academy through NAPS, according to the Midshipmen football media guide . More than half the men\u2019s basketball team went to NAPS, and 60 percent of the women\u2019s basketball team. There have been years when 80 percent of the lacrosse team\u2019s players were NAPS graduates. In addition to a free education, the Navy gives NAPS students $1,000 a month. Ordinarily, this would be a violation of N.C.A.A. rules. Because NAPS students are being paid for being in the military, the N.C.A.A. has granted a waiver allowing the stipend. (The same is true at the Air Force and Army prep schools.) What was NAPS like for the athletes? The athletics were intense, and the academics none too stressful, recalled Peter Banos, who played basketball there in 2008. \u201cThere was all sorts of tutoring,\u201d he said, \u201cbut really, it was like another year of high school.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Banos added: \u201cWe had cars, we could visit friends, and we were flush with cash. It was high school kids getting paid.\u201d And if, after a year at NAPS, a student decided not to go the academy, the Navy didn\u2019t ask for its money back. Banos left the Naval Academy after his freshman year. Photo Midshipmen who play Division I football are granted a waiver from the height and weight restrictions that might otherwise exclude them from the Naval Academy. Credit Matt Rourke/Associated Press The Naval Academy said that many NAPS athletes go on to succeed at the academy and in the Navy. Three former Navy football players from the class of 1998, all of whom went through NAPS, are in important command posts seeking terrorists. There is a second way that Navy lands athletes who would normally be rejected through the admissions process. The Naval Academy Foundation , an entity founded in 1944 to support Navy athletics, pays for scholarships to send athletes to a private prep school, usually one with a heavy emphasis on sports. In return, the athletes are expected to go to the Naval Academy the next year. The donors to the foundation are almost all Naval Academy alumni. Let\u2019s dwell on this for a second. Imagine if some Ohio State boosters paid to send recruited athletes to a private prep school for a year before they went to the university. It would be an out-and-out scandal \u2014 exactly the kind of booster bribery the N.C.A.A. wants to stamp out. Yet, once again, the military academies have been given a waiver by the association. Those height and weight restrictions I mentioned earlier? They are waived for athletes \u2014 at least until their eligibility is used up. At that point, those 280 pounds that made a Navy lineman so valuable to the team become a huge liability. They are suddenly under tremendous pressure to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds, depending on their height. And if they don\u2019t \u2014 or simply can\u2019t \u2014 their careers suffer, and sometimes end prematurely. As for that required five years of military service, there once was a time when even the best Navy athletes had to put in time after graduation before going on to a professional career. Roger Staubach, who won the Heisman Trophy as a junior in 1963, didn\u2019t join the Dallas Cowboys until 1969. His Navy tour included a year in Vietnam. Recently, athletes good enough to become professionals haven\u2019t had to put in five years of military service. In May, the secretary of the Navy granted waivers to four Navy athletes, allowing them to play while serving in the Reserve. They included Keenan Reynolds, last season\u2019s quarterback, who is now with the Baltimore Ravens, and Joe Cardona, who is the long snapper for the New England Patriots. The good news, I suppose, is that, aside from the cost of NAPS, Navy athletics doesn\u2019t cost the taxpayer very much money. The government allocates only $3.9 million to the Navy athletic department. The rest of Navy\u2019s athletic budget comes from an organization called the Naval Academy Athletic Association . Although the N.A.A.A. describes itself as a \u201cnongovernment agency,\u201d the majority of its board members are Naval Academy personnel, including Chet Gladchuk, the athletic director. Its offices are on campus. It uses the Naval Academy\u2019s email system. And so on.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper briefed senators on the latest intelligence in a closed-door meeting last week, and he described the latest findings on the intentions of the Russian government with regard to the hacks and other interference in the U.S. presidential election, according to the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence. A Washington Post report published online Friday night first described how the intelligence community has reached a \"consensus\" that Russia intervened in the presidential election to help Trump win \u2014 not just try to sow chaos and undermine the electoral process. The New York Times confirmed the story, as has NBC News. Related: U.S. Intel Agencies Preparing Dossier to Prove Russian Hacks The president-elect's transition team responded by impugning the CIA's integrity in a statement Friday, calling the spy agency \"the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" Trump has repeatedly said he does not accept the findings of the spy agencies he will soon lead. They say Russia was behind hacks of Democratic email accounts and other efforts that appeared to harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy. In October, the U.S. government said that all 17 intelligence agencies agreed Russia was behind the cyber-attacks just before the November election, and that the goal was \"to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" Now, the Congressional official told NBC News, new intelligence suggests that Russia's goal was to elect Trump, who broke from Republican orthodoxy during the campaign with several sympathetic statements about a Russian regime that has seized a neighbor's territory and is accused of killing political opponents. Senators were briefed last week on the secret CIA assessment, the source said, confirming reports in the Post and Times. In an interview Saturday with MSNBC's Joy Reid, outgoing Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who was among those briefed, accused FBI director James Comey of withholding information about the Russian campaign from the public. He said Comey should resign. Play ",

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump to Keep Role on 'Celebrity Apprentice' 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump declared in a tweet this morning that he will spend \"zero time\" working on the reality TV show \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" despite plans that he remain as an executive producer on the program while he is president. Trump said on the tweet that although he has a \"big stake\" in the show he won't commit time to it. I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016 He also this morning deleted a tweet pertaining to \"Celebrity Apprentice\" which contained a typing or spelling error. \"Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are rediculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!\" Trump tweeted early this morning, misspelling the word \"ridiculous.\" He later deleted that tweet and posted a new one with the correct spelling of the word. Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway on Friday defended Trump's decision to stay on as an executive producer for the show. She said on CNN that Trump is conferring with experts about \"what he is allowed to do and not do as president of the United States ... If [serving as executive producer on 'Celebrity Apprentice'] is one of the approved activities, then perhaps he\u2019ll consider staying on.\" \u201cWere we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course by the current president? I mean presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time. I mean nobody objects to that,\" Conway said. \u201cWhether it's President Obama or President Donald Trump, the idea that these men are going to be all work and nothing else all the time is just unrealistic because it's never happened in our lifetimes.\" Earlier this week, a representative for MGM, which holds a majority stake in Mark Burnett Productions, the company that owns \"The Apprentice,\" said Trump is set to remain as an executive producer of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" When asked about Trump's role on the show, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told ABC News, \"Mr. Trump has a big stake in the show and conceived of it with Mark Burnett. Additional details regarding his business interests will be shared Dec. 15.\" 0 Shares ",

Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times A Wrenching Decision Where Black History and Floods Intertwine Residents of Princeville, N.C., are considering the prospect of leaving their town after enduring a 100-year flood for the second time in 17 years. By JESS BIDGOOD DEC. 9, 2016 PRINCEVILLE, N.C. \u2014 Betty Cobb\u2019s house is a shell nearly two months after floodwaters went halfway up the walls of her one-story home. Volunteers have ripped out moldy wallboard. Two small chandeliers hung over the bones of the living and dining rooms, the furniture and the carpeting long gone. On the kitchen counter lay a patchwork of family photographs, their vibrant colors washed away, and a book \u2014 \u201cHurricane Floyd and the Flood of the Century\u201d \u2014 saved from the water. Hurricane Floyd, which roared through here in 1999, was supposed to be just that: a once-in-a-lifetime event that caused flooding the likes of which this town\u2019s residents would never see again. But that perception was shattered in early October when Hurricane Matthew barreled inland and sent water pouring around a levee built along the Tar River and into the town, inundating hundreds of homes, including Ms. Cobb\u2019s. Video Rebuild or Leave? The first town chartered by African Americans has battled two 100-year storms in under 20 years. Some see the ruins of homes, many covered in mold, as a lost cause. Others vow to rebuild. By ERICA BERENSTEIN and JESS BIDGOOD on Publish Date December 9, 2016. Photo by Travis Dove for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Seventeen years ago, Ms. Cobb decided to rebuild, here in a town that has a special place in American history. Princeville, population 2,100, is believed to be the oldest town chartered by freed slaves, who founded a community that has survived numerous floods and the Jim Crow era. It remains 96 percent black. Continue reading the main story Ms. Cobb, 69, is now considering a question looming over many homeowners: After two devastating floods, does she want the option to sell her home to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, something that the town\u2019s leaders voted down in 1999, fearing it would lead to the end of their community? Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis is home, this is what I know,\u201d said Ms. Cobb, who was leaning toward staying but worried about taking out a loan to rebuild. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d A number of residents have expressed an interest in selling to FEMA, which would prevent anyone from building again on their flood-prone land and lead to a reduction in the town\u2019s tax base. The town\u2019s four commissioners will vote at some point on whether to make that available to residents (the mayor votes in case of a tie). They can also consider elevation of homes and reconstruction of damaged ones. North Carolina DEC. 9, 2016 By The New York Times Residents on the nation\u2019s coasts and along inland waterways have assessed storm damage and wondered if they should relocate \u2014 a painful and fairly uncommon form of hazard mitigation known as retreat . Here, the consideration has a wrenching historical dimension. This is where a freed slave, Turner Prince, established Freedom Hill in 1865, which became Princeville 20 years later, a town where extended families have proudly lived for generations. And many of them are determined to rebuild. This stretch along the Tar River is no stranger to flooding, and some say that it is probably the reason that African-Americans were able to settle the land in the first place. White landowners in the 19th century did not want it. \u201cTheir existence in this space was not a matter of chance or choice, but instead the discarded and unwanted space was what former slaveholders allowed them to occupy,\u201d Richard M. Mizelle, Jr., an associate professor of history at the University of Houston, wrote earlier this year, tying Princeville\u2019s location to environmental racism \u2014 the relegation of black people to flood-prone land and hazardous areas that expose them to greater levels of pollution. But many people are proud of what they have built here, and how it has endured. \u201cThe freed slaves made it what it is,\u201d said Mayor Bobbie Jones, 55, who wants the levee improved and opposes the buyouts and hopes residents who want to leave will first seek private buyers, perhaps like himself. Photo Angela Mallory-Pitt outside her gutted Princeville home. Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times \u201cIf we decide to allow individuals to participate in the buyout, it will have a devastating effect,\u201d Mr. Jones said, standing in front of more than 100 residents at a recent meeting. Advertisement Other black-founded towns like Eatonville, Fla. , which was incorporated in 1887, still exist today. Many others have faded, like Nicodemus, Kan., which has about 25 residents , or Blackdom, N.M., which was abandoned after a drought . Photo Outside Ms. Mallory-Pitt\u2019s home, a water-damaged photograph of her in-laws. Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m fighting so hard to make sure that Princeville is not one of the casualties,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cIt would be a devastating tragedy, not only for me, but for the world.\u201d Still, residents like Angela Mallory-Pitt, 46, want at least the option to move beyond this low-lying land. \u201cThat history will never be lost,\u201d said Ms. Mallory-Pitt, whose small white house filled with floodwater after Matthew. The town\u2019s founders, she said, would have settled safer land if they had the chance. \u201cI really believe that they would want better for us,\u201d Ms. Mallory-Pitt said. In 1967, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a levee that held off floods until Hurricane Floyd\u2019s sent water over its top, forcing harrowing rooftop rescues \u2014 including Mr. Jones\u2019s \u2014 and damaging or ruining nearly every home here. The town leadership rejected taking buyouts at that time and instead chose to rebuild the town and fix the levee. Last year, the Corps of Engineers completed another proposal to extend the levee, which officials with the corps say would have at least reduced the latest destruction, but it has not been funded. The flood inundated community pillars like the school and the fire station \u2014 which is currently operating out of a tent \u2014 and left residents displaced and streets still piled with debris. \u201cSo many people have lost so much, and we\u2019ll have to start all over again,\u201d Linda Worsley, 66, a retired telephone company analyst, said as she picked up the mail at her uninhabitable home even as it was being demolished.

Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times Ms. Worsley is determined to rebuild on land that has been in her family since her grandfather, a sharecropper, and his brother bought it in the 1920s. Ms. Worsley, who as a commissioner voted against buyouts in 1999, said residents should have the option this time, although she hopes few people will take them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI have always been proud to say that I was from Princeville,\u201d Ms. Worsley said, adding, \u201cTo just lose all of that, it would be like Princeville is another lost colony.\u201d It was her job to organize the town\u2019s Christmas parade, which was scheduled for last Saturday but had to be canceled. Instead, Ms. Worsley and her neighbors gathered at the Quality Inn in Tarboro, which is across the Tar River from Princeville, for a lunch of pulled pork, chicken and green beans. So many displaced residents are staying at the hotel while they await FEMA trailers that it has become a stop for the school bus, its lobby a town square for Princeville residents. Mary Alston, a volunteer from Cary, N.C., put the question to Ms. Worsley and two of her friends, \u201cAre y\u2019all going to stay or \u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to stay,\u201d Annette Waller, 60, said. \u201cOh yes,\u201d Brenda Hunter said, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in Princeville,\u201d and talk at the table turned to demolition, duct work and how long it would take to return home. Continue reading the main story Photo Books and papers drying in the Princeville Fire Department\u2019s former garage. Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times Others in the hotel have decided to leave. David Birth, 70, a retired machine operator, whose home on Main Street was destroyed, said he had already bought land in Tarboro and would live there, in a trailer. \u201cWhen the first flood came, it took the first house,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe second flood took this one. I\u2019m not going to let my grandchildren be in the same situation.\u201d For now, many families are waiting: waiting to see how far flood insurance goes, what FEMA will offer, and what the town decides. Back at Ms. Cobb\u2019s house, as volunteers carted away wheelbarrows filled with wallboard, Ms. Cobb\u2019s daughter, Regina, 48, looked across the street where trees hide the Tar River. If it were up to her, she said, she would leave, although she said she would support her mother\u2019s decision.

By Steven Mufson and Philip Rucker December 10 at 7:11 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @PhilipRucker President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, who has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday. Tillerson\u2019s nomination could face intense scrutiny in the Senate, considering his years of work in Russia and the Middle East on behalf of the multinational petroleum company. Already, two leading Republican hawks, Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), have voiced concerns about Tillerson\u2019s serving as the nation\u2019s top diplomat because of his ties to Putin. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday that there would be no official announcement about a secretary of state until this coming week \u201cat the earliest.\u201d But three officials briefed on Trump\u2019s deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the pick would be Tillerson, barring a late and unanticipated shift in Trump\u2019s thinking. NBC News first reported that Trump has settled on Tillerson. Trump is considering nominating for deputy secretary of state John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a combative hawk whose tenure in the George W. Bush administration was controversial, two of the officials said. View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Trump spent a month deliberating over the secretary of state position and interviewed an array of candidates, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who was opposed by some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers because he had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy. Other contenders included former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The search at times resembled Trump\u2019s reality television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d with the hopefuls parading before journalists \u2014 and, in the case of Giuliani, publicly campaigning for the job before announcing Friday that he had withdrawn himself from consideration. [ Trump\u2019s advisers clash over Mitt Romney as secretary of state ] Tillerson\u2019s stock rose late in the process, after he met with the president-elect on Tuesday and again on Saturday morning at Trump Tower in New York. Trump settled on Tillerson, 64, because he projects gravitas, is regarded as a skillful manager and personally knows many foreign leaders through his dealings on behalf of the energy giant, people close to Trump said. In an excerpt of an interview with Fox News , which will be aired in full Sunday, Trump praises Tillerson, although he does not reveal his decision. \u201cHe\u2019s much more than a business executive; he\u2019s a world-class player,\u201d Trump says. \u201cHe knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia \u2014 for the company, not for himself.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s nomination would fit the pattern of other Trump appointments \u2014 wealthy business leaders with little experience in policymaking. But Tillerson has spent years dealing with the complexities of one of the world\u2019s biggest enterprises, spanning six continents and about six dozen nations. 1 of 20 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Caption President-elect Donald Trump faces a challenge as he prepares for his move to the White House: selecting the men and women who will fill his administration. Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder Andrew Puzder, a fast-food executive who has been a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, is the nominee to lead the Labor Department, according to a Republican briefed on the decision. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The company\u2019s deep ties to Russia would potentially serve Tillerson well, given Trump\u2019s desire to repair relations with the Kremlin. But Tillerson\u2019s close relationship with Putin could also become a flash point during confirmation hearings, especially in light of a recent CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. [ Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House ] \u201cFew corporate titans are closer to Putin than Tillerson,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, founder of Columbia University\u2019s center for global energy. \u201cSo his pick, along with Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, would suggest a sharp shift in U.S. policy toward Russia.\u201d McCain told Fox News on Saturday that Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Putin \u201cis a matter of concern to me.\u201d \u201cYou want to give the president of the United States the benefit of the doubt because the people have spoken,\u201d McCain said. \u201cBut Vladi\u00admir Putin is a thug, a bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying.\u201d During the 1990s, Tillerson oversaw an Exxon project on Russia\u2019s Sakhalin island and developed a working relationship with Putin. In 2011, the company signed an agreement with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to work jointly on oil exploration and development in the Arctic and Siberia. After inking the deal in New York, Tillerson and Rosneft chairman and Putin confidant Igor Sechin dined on caviar at the luxury Manhattan restaurant Per Se, according to one account. The next day, they gave oil analysts black pens with the date of the agreement engraved in gold. Two years later, the Kremlin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, an honor reserved for foreigners. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man much at all, but let\u2019s put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, [an] Order of Friendship, then we\u2019re gonna have some talkin\u2019,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some questions. I don\u2019t want to prejudge the guy, but that\u2019s a bit unnerving.\u201d Exxon discovered oil in a well it drilled in the Kara Sea, but the joint partnership was put on ice after Russian intervention in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea led to international economic sanctions. As secretary of state, Tillerson, who has been critical of the sanctions, would be in a position to argue for easing them, which could allow Exxon to resume operations. And for a company the size of Exxon, few countries outside of Russia hold sufficient potential to bolster the oil giant\u2019s reserves. In addition to the Arctic, Exxon wants to drill in the deep waters of the Black Sea and search for shale oil in West Siberia. In each case, the company would be providing expertise and technology that Russia lacks. \u201cRussia is critical for Exxon,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. Robert McNally, president of the consulting firm Rapidan Group and a director for energy on President George W. Bush\u2019s national security council, said, \u201cThe closest thing we have to a secretary of state outside government is the CEO of Exxon.\u201d Tillerson has spent his entire working life at ExxonMobil, joining the company in 1975 with a degree in civil engineering. His career has taken him from Oklahoma and Texas to Yemen and Russia, and as ExxonMobil\u2019s top executive, he has cultivated relationships, meeting regularly with world leaders such as Putin, the Saudi oil minister, and the emir of Qatar. He will retire with a nest egg of about $300\u00a0million, including stock options and pension benefits. Yet Tillerson\u2019s track record \u2014 during a decade in which crude oil prices lurched from under $30 to nearly $150 a barrel \u2014 has been mixed. The company has managed some of the world\u2019s biggest infrastructure projects, often in forbidding locations, but it has spent heavily on share buybacks and has borrowed heavily to maintain both capital spending and dividend payments. Wall Street analysts say ExxonMobil overpaid for XTO Energy, a domestic shale gas company, and it has failed to meet the production targets Tillerson himself set. In April, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the company\u2019s gold-plated triple-A credit rating to double-A plus, the first time Exxon had lost its triple-A rating since the advent of color television. Tillerson\u2019s nomination is likely to draw strong opposition from environmentalists. The secretary of state takes the lead in international climate talks, meaning that Tillerson could play a role in unwinding U.S. commitments under the recent Paris accord. Environmental groups allege that ExxonMobil\u2019s scientists knew about the impact the use of fossil fuels was having on climate change, and that the company suppressed internal research instead of sharing it with investors and the public. The New York and Massachusetts attorneys general have issued broad subpoenas to ascertain whether ExxonMobil\u2019s failure to disclose that information violated Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. ExxonMobil has fought back in federal court in Texas. \u201cCovering up climate science and deceiving investors qualifies you for federal investigation, not federal office,\u201d May Boeve, executive director of the climate group 350.org, said in a statement. When Tillerson took the helm at ExxonMobil a decade ago, he was seen as moderating the company\u2019s position on climate change. Whereas his predecessor opposed any action on climate change, Tillerson said in 2009 that he favored a carbon tax and proposed an initial price \u201csomewhere north of $20\u201d a ton. And he reduced ExxonMobil\u2019s own emissions. Tillerson has acknowledged that climate change is caused by humans, and under his leadership, ExxonMobil curtailed funding for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose energy and climate expert Myron Ebell played down the extent of climate change. Ebell is the head of the Trump transition team on environmental issues. Yet Tillerson has insisted that oil use is essential. He chaired the American Petroleum Institute and once told Fortune magazine, \u201cTo say that you\u2019re addicted to oil and natural gas seems to me to say you\u2019re addicted to economic growth.\u201d ExxonMobil has important relationships throughout the Middle East. It relies on Saudi Arabia for oil supplies and is a partner in refinery projects. It has enormous projects in liquefied natural gas export in Qatar. It has also managed to carry out exploration and production ventures in the semiautonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq and in southern Iraq, transcending rivalries between Baghdad and the Kurds. But under Tillerson, ExxonMobil has walked away from other countries. It left Venezuela after contract disputes with the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and it ended its onshore operations in Nigeria, where local insurgents sabotaged infrastructure. Tillerson was born in Wichita Falls, Tex., the son of a Boy Scout administrator. He still lists the rank of Eagle Scout on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and he has remained active in the organization. In 2012, he was instrumental in pushing the Boy Scouts board to admit openly gay youths. The ExxonMobil chief also chaired the $50\u00a0million campaign to restore Washington\u2019s Ford\u2019s Theatre, where President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Tillerson has been a major donor to the Republican Party and its candidates, including to former Florida governor Jeb Bush during this year\u2019s presidential primaries, federal campaign finance filings show. There appears to be no record of Tillerson\u2019s giving to Trump\u2019s campaign. Within the oil industry, ExxonMobil has been regarded as the most button-downed company, conservative and sometimes arrogant. But even Tillerson\u2019s critics admire his leadership abilities. \u201cRex is a very, very, very honorable man,\u201d Gheit said. \u201cHe is smart, levelheaded. He has tremendous resolve and very strong character.\u201d Karoun Demirjian, Matea Gold and Carol Morello contributed to this report. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

But McKeel wasn\u2019t just coming for the food.\u00a0 \u201cI had to come today\u201d to support the restaurant, said McKeel, 39, of Alexandria, Virginia.\u00a0 The Facebook page urged people to support not only Comet Ping Pong but other nearby stores that have been subjected to harassing and threatening online comments and phone calls since the\u00a0 fake news stories began spreading. \u201cIf they run out of dough today, that\u2019d be a good thing,\u201d said Erick Sanchez, the event\u2019s organizer. So many came out Friday that people waited an hour and a half for a table and carry-out took 45 minutes. Other local restaurants spontaneously sent over wait staff to help. Others sent food for employees. The restaurant also is getting support online, where a GoFundMe page set up to help it pay for legal expenses and extra security had passed $15,000, with a goal of $28,000. Interim District of Columbia Police Chief Peter Newsham visited Friday, with a message for fake news peddlers. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s serious. It can have very, very serious consequences,\u201d he said, adding that police are following up on the harassment and threats local businesses have received. The man police arrested Sunday at Comet Ping Pong, Edgar Maddison Welch, has a court hearing next week. Police have said the 28-year-old from Salisbury, N.C., fired shots from an AR-15 assault weapon after coming to \u201cself-investigate\u201d the conspiracy theory known as \u201cpizzagate.\u201d\u00a0 Hillary Clinton warns of the dangers of fake news He surrendered peacefully \u201cwhen he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,\u201d police said. Joey Allen, the marketing and events manager for the District Restaurant Group, which owns the nearby Jake\u2019s American Grille, says its restaurant also was harassed with calls related to the conspiracy. At one point the calls were daily, Allen said. At Comet Ping Pong, the staff seemed to be in a good mood Friday, said Carrie Gillispie, 34, visiting with her husband. She wasn\u2019t bothered by the lines for tables. \u201cIt makes me happy that the wait is so long,\u201d she said. Her husband, Sean Gillispie, 34, said anyone who still thinks the restaurant is somehow connected to nefarious activities should come see for themselves that \u201cthis is just a normal business with normal people.\u201d Plus, he said: \u201cThe pizza is really good.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Jennifer Jolly for USA Today The Star Trek communicator is designed to look exactly like the original prop from the show, and it pairs via Bluetooth to his smartphone. (Photo: Think Geek) You know the old saying: Men are from Mars, women are from wherever has the best shoes \u2014 that\u2019s how it goes, right? Whenever you\u2019re shopping for the opposite sex, things can get confusing in a hurry, and throwing gadgets into the mix can make things even more complicated. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve rounded up some of the most-desired gadget gifts for men \u2014 for all kinds of guys and in every price range \u2014 to help you get it just right this year. For His Inner Geek: My good friend Mike recently told me, \u201cIf it seems like all men are secretly nerds, it\u2019s because they are.\u201d His words, not mine. There\u2019s no better way to show him you embrace his dorky nature than with this fantastic fully functional Star Trek communicator ( $129.99 ).

Flipping the cover answers calls, and it has a huge range of more than 100-feet, just in case he feels the urge to explore. Gamer Guy: If he\u2019s a gamer, he probably owns a PlayStation 4 . It\u2019s the most popular game console of the past few years, and the PlayStation VR headset ($399) is the ultimate add-on. The core bundle comes with everything he needs to dive into all the fast-paced, neck-twisting virtual reality games he craves. It works with every version of the PlayStation 4, including the all-new PlayStation 4 Pro , so you can buy one worry-free. You can also give your gamer guy a GameStop gift card so he can continue to add the latest releases to his gaming collection. The Ultimate Hipster: Give the guy on your list a taste of yesteryear with Sharper Image\u2019s hilarious \u201cMr. Hipster\u201d smartphone stand ($27.00). It\u2019s just like one of those old rotary phones, but instead of a circular dial there\u2019s a slot for his smartphone. Plug it in and he can even make phone calls with the old plastic banana handle. It\u2019s quirky but functional, which is a great combo for gift giving. For His Mancave: Gamers, graphic artists, movie-lovers \u2014 and anyone who appreciates stellar picture quality will love LG\u2019s gorgeous 38-inch UltraWide curved monitor ($1,499.99). Movies, games, and sports look amazing on it, and the curve pulls him into the action. The built-in Bluetooth speakers blast rich sound to all corners of his cave, and the extra-wide screen is perfect for multitasking, so he can watch his favorite team on one side and work on the other. The Rock Fan: He loves his music loud, and that\u2019s just what he\u2019ll get with the Megaboom\u00a0($299.99) or UE Boom2 ($199.99)\u00a0Bluetooth speakers from Ultimate Ears. It\u2019s only nine inches tall, but it blasts out some seriously impressive sound, no matter where he puts hit. The Megaboom will rock his socks for up to 20 hours on a single battery charge, and since it\u2019s also waterproof, it can go to the beach, the shop, the trail, and everywhere in between. Also, UE\u2019s Party Up app update lets him wirelessly connect two to fifty UE speakers within seconds so he can truly rock out in epic ways. UE Boom2 ($199.99) Bluetooth speakers from Ultimate Ears. \u00a0(Photo: UE Boom 2 bluetooth speaker) The Gear Guy: Samsung\u2019s trio of mobile gadgets are the perfect combo for the ultimate gear guy. It starts with the Galaxy S7 ( $694.99 ); one of the fastest, sleekest, and most powerful Android phones available. Then add the Galaxy 360 camera ( $349.99 ), an awesome little ball of tech which shoots 360-degree video of anywhere, and combine it with the Galaxy Gear VR headset ( $99.99 ). The Gear VR uses the S7 as its screen, just slide it into the place and dive into a world of VR, including the 360-degree videos from the Galaxy 360. Forget a fancy camera that takes snapshots, with this combo he can relive entire moments as though he\u2019s there. Retro Game Junkie: Nintendo\u2019s NES Classic Edition ( $59.99 ) is the ultimate gift for any old-school gaming fan \u2014 if you can still find one to buy. It\u2019s packed with 30 of the original Nintendo\u2019s most stellar titles, like all three Mario Bros. adventures, Tecmo Bowl, Mega Man 2, and many, many more. The bummer about this gadget is that\u2019s it\u2019s so popular, it\u2019s sold out virtually everywhere. If you run into a snag on your usual shopping trips try scoring one on Walmart.com and sign up for notifications on Amazon so you\u2019ll know as soon as they get a new shipment. I\u2019ve seen a few going for top-dollar ($170-$300+) on eBay lately too, so there is hope if you really, really want to get it for him. The Audiophile: If you type \u201cwireless speaker\u201d into Google you\u2019re going to see literally thousands of options, but if you want the absolute best boom money can buy, Devialet\u2019s Phantom speakers ( starting at $1,990 ) are in a league of their own. They\u2019re more expensive than my first car, and they\u2019re probably more powerful than it, too. With 4,500 watts of ear-tickling power, these speakers are packed with patented technology that give them a sound that is simply second to none. Devialet\u2019s Phantom speakers offer the best boom money can buy. \u00a0(Photo: Devialet) DIY Dude: He\u2019s Getting Hotter: If he\u2019s the kind of guy that has every tool you could possibly imagine, you can really surprise him with this. Thermal imaging tech is just finally creeping into the affordable range, and Seek\u2019s Compact thermal imager ( $249.00 ) plugs right into your smartphone. He just snaps it into place and boots up the Seek app to see the world in a whole new way. The Seek Compact only sees heat, which makes it great for hunting, wildlife spotting, or even pinpointing where that nasty draft in the living room is coming from. Seek\u2019s Compact thermal imager plugs right into your smartphone. \u00a0(Photo: Seek) The Live-It Live Guy: If he loves streaming live video of his latest culinary classics, unboxing antics, or epic adventures, smartphone cameras are alright at getting the job done, but they\u2019ve got nothing on Mevo.

About 25 million people are bracing for the storm system as it marches across the Midwest late Saturday into Sunday \u2014 ahead of plunging temperatures that will fall below zero in Chicago and bring a deep chill to the Northeast next week. \"This is certainly going to be the coldest air this year,\" said Weather Channel meteorologist Kelly Cass. Whiteout conditions have been reported in North Dakota and dangerous ice-slicked streets and trees in Portland, Oregon, where authorities were inundated with nearly 400 emergency requests through Friday night. In one incident, 75 to 100 people had to be rescued from inside a light rail train that stopped when a high-voltage power line fell on the tracks, Portland Fire & Rescue tweeted.

Other parts of the Great Lakes region could see up to a foot of snow by the time the storm dissipates this weekend, forecasters said. Parts of eastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York could get walloped with 4 to 6 inches, and even 8 to 10 inches in some areas.

(Photo: Jonas Ekstromer, AP) Sometimes a hard rain falls down even harder than expected. Singer-songwriter Patti Smith needed two attempts to get through Bob Dylan's 1963 classic\u00a0A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\u00a0at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm Sweden on Saturday. Smith faltered when she forgot the words in the second verse of one of Dylan's most famous songs filled with complicated lyrics. Smith\u00a0composed herself and asked the orchestra to start over. \"I apologize. I'm sorry, Could we start that?\u00a0I'm so nervous,\" Smith said quietly, as\u00a0the audience in Stockholm's Concert Hall clapped in support. The song is in the video below, at the 1 hour, 3\u00a0minute mark. After drawing a brief blank again in the third verse, Smith\u00a0finished the song with an emotional, soulful flourish. The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0reported it left some in the crowd misty-eyed. The television announcer pointed out \"even a superstar like Patti Smith can get a bit nervous in an occasion such as this.\" Patti Smith performs 'A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall' by absent Literature prize winner Bob Dylan during the awardings of the Nobel Prizes in medicine, economics, physics and chemistry on December 10, 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden. Nobel laureates are honoured every year on December 10 -- the anniversary of the death of prize's founder Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist, inventor and philanthropist. / AFP PHOTO / TT News Agency / JESSICA GOW / Sweden OUTJESSICA GOW/AFP/Getty Images ORIG FILE ID: AFP_IZ5LB \u00a0(Photo: JESSICA GOW, AFP/Getty Images) Dylan was not in attendance at the ceremony after becoming the\u00a0first musician to win the Nobel literature award in the academy's 115-year history. The 75-year-old won the prize\u00a0\"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,\" the\u00a0Swedish Academy said. ",

Obama has ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review on suspected election-season hacking by Russians. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Russian President President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 28, 2015, at United Nations headquarters. Obama has ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review on suspected election-season hacking by Russians. (Andrew Harnik / AP) Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, Greg MillerThe Washington Post The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton's chances. \"It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,\" said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. \"That's the consensus view.\" President Barack Obama 's administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton's campaign. In September, during a secret briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell \u00a0of Kentucky voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to officials present. The Trump transition team dismissed the findings in a short statement issued Friday evening. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again,' \" the statement read. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community's findings about Russian hacking. \"I don't believe they interfered\" in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, \"could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\" The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now \"quite clear\" that electing Trump was Russia's goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The CIA presentation to senators about Russia's intentions fell short of a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U.S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency's assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered. For example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin \"directing\" the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U.S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were \"one step\" removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability. Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the \"Russian government is not the source.\" The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. On Friday, the White House said President Obama had ordered a \"full review\" of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process. \"We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,\" Obama's counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office Jan. 20, Monaco said. During her remarks, Monaco didn't address the latest CIA assessment, which hasn't been previously disclosed. Julian Assange Markus Schreiber / AP WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange participates via video link at a news conference marking the 10th anniversary of the secrecy-spilling group in Berlin, Germany, on Oct. 4, 2016. Assange denied Nov. 3 that the Russian government or any other \"state parties\"\u009d were his group's source for more than 50,000 hacked emails from the files of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.

(Markus Schreiber / AP) Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation. Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIA's presentation. This week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House also sent a letter to Obama, asking for briefings on Russian interference in the election. U.S. intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russia's motivations, reflecting the United States' long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on Russian President Vladimir Putin and those closest to him. In previous assessments, the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscow's aim was to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect Trump. On Oct. 7, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of \"political organizations.\" Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the computers of the DNC and other Democratic groups and individuals. Some key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement. Lisa Monaco Jeff Chiu / AP Homeland security and counterterrorism presidential adviser Lisa Monaco speaks Feb. 13, 2015, at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection in Stanford, Calif. Monaco says President Obama has ordered a review of the email hacking that rattled the presidential campaign and says intelligence and national security officials will report their findings to the president before he leaves office on Jan. 20, 2017.

Monaco says President Obama has ordered a review of the email hacking that rattled the presidential campaign and says intelligence and national security officials will report their findings to the president before he leaves office on Jan. 20, 2017. (Jeff Chiu / AP) \"I'll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there's clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence \u2014\u00a0even now,\" said Rep. Devin Nunes , R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. \"There's a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that's it.\" Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U.S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Moscow has attempted through cyber-means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaign. Within the administration, top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond. White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia, with sophisticated cybercapabilities, might have less to lose than the United States, with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructure. The White House's reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more limited measures, including the \"naming and shaming\" approach of publicly blaming Moscow. By mid-September, White House officials had decided it was time to take that step, but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposes.

(Mindaugas Kulbis / AP) Instead, officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12 \u2014\u00a0a group that includes House and Senate leaders, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers' committees on intelligence and homeland security. Obama dispatched Monaco, FBI Director James Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a \"show of solidarity and bipartisan unity\" against Russian interference in the election, according to a senior administration official. Specifically, the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusions. Though U.S. intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way, the White House feared that Russia would attempt to do so, sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow. In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U.S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia's role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals. And they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as \"the threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process.\" The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests. According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics.

Donald Trump also plans to interview applicants at New York\u2019s Trump Tower on March 24, 2006.</p> Close GETTY IMAGES/Frazer Harrison President-elect Donald Trump will remain an executive producer of NBC\u2019s reality television show \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d during his tenure in the White House, CBS News confirms. \u00a0 Clare Anne Darragh, a spokesperson for MGM, the company that produces the show, confirmed that Mr. Trump will retain his EP credit on the show, which returns from a two-year hiatus with a new host, actor and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Variety first reported the news. Hope Hicks, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team, weighed in on the news to CBS, noting the president-elect\u2019s financial involvement and role in forming the show with Mark Burnett, an Emmy-winning producer. \u201cMr. Trump has a big stake in the show and conceived of it with Mark Burnett,\u201d Hicks said in a statement. MGM and the Trump transition team have not disclosed the president-elect\u2019s future participation in the production of the show, which starts airing its season on Jan. 2, just weeks weeks ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration to the White House. The production company also declined to discuss the financial details of the deal with CBS News. How can Trump avoid potential business conflicts? While it\u2019s not unheard of for a president to continue receiving royalties for past creative works (like President Obama\u2019s royalty payments from his published books), it will be yet another unusual mark of the Trump administration that a sitting president could be credited and paid for a reality TV show\u2019s ongoing season. Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump transition adviser, said Friday that she was \u201cdoubtful\u201d the president-elect will receive a salary from \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d and that Mr. Trump is currently consulting with ethics experts about the show. \u201cThe fact is that he\u2019s conferring with all types of experts to tell him what he\u2019s allowed to do and not to do as the president of the United States, and if this is one of the approved activities, perhaps he\u2019ll consider staying on,\u201d Conway told CNN. Asked whether a role for the show would take away from Mr. Trump\u2019s time on policy issues, Conway defended the president-elect by noting President Obama\u2019s golf trips. \u201cWere we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course of the current president?\u201d Conway said. \u201cI mean, presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time, I mean nobody objects to that.\u201d The \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d news comes amid\u00a0 questions about the president\u2019s conflicts of interest , including the sale of his stock holdings and the extent to which he intends to cede control over his business empire to his family members. Mr. Trump has said he would address these potential conflicts during a public appearance scheduled for Dec. 15, which is expected to be his first press conference since his election victory. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 19 To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs The 5 best ways to invest $10,000 Arielle O\u2019Shea, NerdWallet 2:42 p.m. EST December 3, 2016 Stacks of money wrapped in $10,000 bundles (Photo: Landon_S, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Your definition of windfall may vary, but there\u2019s little argument that $10,000 is a healthy chunk of cash \u2014 certainly enough to give you cold feet when deciding how to invest it. The good news is there are a lot of options: $10,000 is enough to more than meet most online broker minimums. We\u2019ve slimmed things down to five of the best ways to invest $10,000. Feel free to mix and match; there\u2019s no rule that says you have to throw it all into one pot. 1. Get your 401(k) match A guaranteed investment return is as rare as free money, and a 401(k) match gives you both: When you put dollars into the account, your employer puts dollars in, too. How many dollars depends on your plan\u2019s matching arrangement, but 50% to 100% of your contributions up to a limit of 3% to 6% of your salary is a pretty common range. (If you want to do the math to see how much your match could be worth, try our 401(k) calculator .) This $10,000 windfall may give your budget the room it needs to finally start meeting that match, if you\u2019re not already. The hitch: You typically can\u2019t just make a lump-sum deposit to a 401(k), so you have to get a little creative if you want to get this cash into your plan and capture matching dollars while you do it. Put the $10,000 into a savings account, then set your 401(k) contribution to the level your employer matches. When that contribution is swiped out of your paycheck, repay yourself from the money in savings. 2. Max out an IRA An IRA is like a 401(k) you open on your own, which means no match. But it has other benefits, including a wide investment selection, and if you don\u2019t have a 401(k) at work, an IRA is far and away the next best thing. That\u00a0$10,000 is more than enough to max out an IRA for the year. The annual contribution limit is $5,500 right now (with an extra $1,000 allowed for those 50 or older). Max out and then select one of these other options for the rest of your cash. \u00bb MORE: How to invest your IRA 3. Get guidance from a robo-adviser Robo-advisors are what they sound like: robots \u2014 or specifically, computer algorithms \u2014 that manage your money. A $10,000 investment is enough to open an account at the majority of these companies, including Wealthfront, which manages the first $10,000 for\u00a0free. \u00bb MORE: The best robo-advisers At other advisors, you\u2019ll pay a fee of around 0.25% to 0.35% (Wealthfront\u2019s fee on assets above $10,000 is 0.25%). That fee includes the cost of management, but it doesn\u2019t include investment expenses. Robo-advisors typically use exchange-traded funds and index funds, which are fairly low-cost passive investments that track sections of the market, like the S&P 500. 4. Invest in commission-free ETFs and low-cost mutual funds If you grimaced at the mention of that robo-adviser management fee, you might be the DIY type. You can pretty easily piece together a diversified portfolio of funds yourself with $10,000. Index funds, a type of mutual fund, typically have an investment minimum, but $10,000 is more than enough to buy into several. ETFs are a kind of index fund that trades like a stock. You buy them for a share price \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s the minimum investment \u2014\u00a0and it could be as low as $50. If you also have a 401(k), you might want to use these individual funds to fill holes in the investment choices offered by the plan \u2014 401(k)s have a scaled-down mutual fund selection, and the ones that make the list can be high-fee. 5. Try your hand at investing in stocks This is kind of DIY turned up a notch \u2014 index funds and ETFs are baskets full of stocks (or bonds, depending on the type of fund you\u2019ve selected). When you use them, you get exposure to stocks without actually having to pick individual stocks. But maybe you want to invest in stocks. Go for it, with one caveat: For a long-term goal like retirement, it\u2019s best to stick to the options above and limit stock trading to 10% of your portfolio or less. If $10,000 takes a bigger bite, maybe you trade stocks with the portion that overflows your IRA contribution limit or set aside just a small chunk of this money to play the market. \u00bb MORE: How to invest in stocks Stock buying requires researching stocks \u2014 if you\u2019re going to own a piece of a company, you want to know what you\u2019re getting into. So make sure you\u2019re up to the task and choose a broker that has low commissions, so trading fees don\u2019t eat into your investment.

The gowns, the gifts, and of course, the guests. Now imagine the entire country of Mexico at that party. Rubi Ibarra Garcia and her parents, Crescencio and Anaelda, recorded a modest video invitation for their prospective guests to attend Rubi's quincea\u00f1era (\"sweet 15th\") later this month. But it was posted online, and many people saw it \u2014 and said they were coming. Now, they find themselves possibly responsible for hosting the party of the year. If only they knew what the power of the Internet could unleash. The invitation, advertising performances by local bands and a horse race with a 10,000 peso prize, went viral when it was posted on social media, and resulted in 1.3 million guests who RSVP'd on Facebook. Only Rubi's family and friends who lived in the area were originally invited, but the event page was left public, meaning anyone could see it and join. Hopefully the party is a potluck as well. The video also spawned many fake, copycat Facebook events, as well as the inevitable memes that helped Rubi's XV take the internet by storm. \u2014 Michael Lee (@michaeltweets_) December 9, 2016 Just got to rubis xv pic.twitter.com/Tq3oszq0we ",

The 64-year-old veteran oil executive has no government or diplomatic experience, although he has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The pick would put to rest weeks-long speculation of who would earn the post as the U.S.'s top diplomat, and would place Tillerson fourth in line to the presidency. He will also be paired with former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton as his deputy secretary of state, one of the sources added, with Bolton handling day-to-day management of the department. Chairman and CEO of US oil and gas corporation ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, speaks during the 2015 Oil and Money conference in central London on Oct. 7, 2015. Ben Stansall / AFP/Getty Images The sources cautioned that nothing is final until the president-elect officially announces it, which could happen as early as next week. Tillerson, who was once dubbed \"T.Rex\" by Sarah Palin, met Saturday with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, the president-elect's spokesperson confirmed. In a pre-taped interview set to air Sunday on Fox News, Trump discussed why a businessman such as Tillerson would be a good fit as America's chief diplomat. \"Well, in his case, he's much more than a business executive, I mean he's a world-class player,\" Trump said, acknowledging Tillerson's relationship with Russia through his business dealings. \"To me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well,\" Trump added. \"He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company \u2014 not for himself, for the company.\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said no official announcement on the secretary of state pick is expected until \"next week at the earliest.\" Transition Update: No announcements on Secretary of State until next week at the earliest. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain \u2014 Jason Miller (@JasonMillerinDC) December 10, 2016 Tillerson, of Wichita Falls, Texas, has already notified his corporate board about taking on the new role, sources told NBC News. He is set to retire from ExxonMobil next year since the company has a mandatory retirement age of 65, Reuters reported. He has never previously worked in government, but reportedly holds conservative political views. Tillerson has made tens of thousands of dollars worth of political donations over the past two decades to Republican groups and candidates, including to President George W. Bush and former Texas Gov. Jeb Bush, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tillerson backed Jeb Bush during the GOP presidential primary and did not donate to Trump's campaign. Little is known about where he stands on foreign policy, and as secretary of state, he would have to hit the ground running on major issues. Among them: handling the nuclear agreement with Iran that the Obama administration made in 2015; the sanctions imposed on Russia; disputes with China and North Korea; the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria; and rebuilding Afghanistan and Iraq.

The best- and worst-run states Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Samuel Stebbins and Thomas C. Frohlich, 24/7 Wall St. 1:28 p.m. EST December 10, 2016 The Peace Garden State tops the list (again). (Photo: Thinkstock) Comparing the quality of governance between states can be challenging. The decisions state governors, legislators, city mayors and other elected officials make can have wide-reaching effects on state residents, and these decisions can sometimes take years to have an impact. Aware of these inherent challenges, 24/7 Wall St. has for seven straight years reviewed the outcomes and conditions of every state in the country, ranking each based on finances as well as social and economic indicators. This year, for the fifth year in a row, North Dakota ranks as the best run state in the country. For the second consecutive year, New Mexico ranks worst. These are the best- and worst-run states. BEST-RUN STATES > Debt per capita:\u00a0$2,493 (18th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a02.7% (the lowest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aa1/AA+ > Poverty:\u00a011.0% (9th lowest) North Dakota tops our list of best-run states for the fifth year in a row. While the plunge in oil prices in 2014 was bad news for North Dakota oil companies, rich oil resources continue to stimulate the state\u2019s economy. The unemployment rate remains lower than in any other state, and the median home value in North Dakota surged by 40.7% over the past five years, the largest increase of any state. The Best and Worst Run States in America: A Survey of All 50 Like most of the nation\u2019s best-run states, North Dakota has low debt levels. The state\u2019s total debt was equal to just 18.9% of its 2014 revenue, the fourth lowest percentage of all states. This helps explain the state\u2019s Aa1 rating from Moody\u2019s and its AA+ rating from S&P. Despite its relatively high rating, North Dakota is the only relatively well-run state on our list with a negative outlook from Moody\u2019s. The poor outlook is a reflection of a relatively large budget gap, as well as lack of confidence in future revenue streams. The state\u2019s economy shrank last year by 2.1%, the largest GDP contraction of any state. 2. Minnesota > Debt per capita:\u00a0$2,882 (19th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a03.7% (tied-7th lowest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aa1/AA+ > Poverty:\u00a010.2% (tied-3rd lowest) In addition to direct government policy, numerous factors outside of a government\u2019s control can affect a state\u2019s poverty level. Still, economic and social prosperity among a state\u2019s population is a good sign the state is being run relatively well. Minnesota is one such state. The state\u2019s poverty rate of 10.2% is tied for third lowest in the country, and the median household income of $63,488 annually is 12th highest of all states. Also, due in part to Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid in 2013, just 4.5% of Minnesotans do not have health insurance, the fourth lowest uninsured rate and less than half the national rate of 9.4%. The financial well-being of the residents of well-run states also helps increase tax revenue for the state. Minnesota\u2019s tax revenue in its fiscal 2014 totalled $4,213 per capita, higher than all but five other states. 3. Nebraska > Debt per capita:\u00a0$1,007 (2nd lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a03.0% (2nd lowest) > Credit rating:\u00a0No GO debt/AAA > Poverty:\u00a012.6% (19th lowest) One way to gauge how well a government runs a state is by looking at the state\u2019s finances. Without large revenue streams, a high debt-to-revenue ratio is a bad sign for a state\u2019s ability to fund projects and programs and meet its debt obligations. Nebraska\u2019s debt is equal to just 15.8% of annual revenue, the second lowest such percentage of all states. Nebraska\u2019s unemployment insurance system is not as friendly as other well-run states. The average weekly payout to claimants of $305 is below the national average. Partially as a result, the average percentage of income that is replaced by the system, at 37.9%, is also relatively low compared with other top states on this list. Despite the less than generous UI system, however, just 3.0% of the state\u2019s labor force was unemployed over the course of 2015, the second lowest jobless rate of all states. 4. Wyoming > Debt per capita:\u00a0$1,586 (7th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a04.2% (tied-13th lowest) > Credit rating:\u00a0No GO debt/AAA > Poverty:\u00a011.1% (10th lowest) With a large energy industry, Wyoming is heavily dependent on tax revenues from the sector. As a result, the state\u2019s tax revenue is especially vulnerable to market fluctuations, and its revenue fell with the decline in oil prices. Still, with the largest rainy day fund in the nation, Wyoming is in a relatively strong financial position. Wyoming\u2019s reserve coffers amount to 50% of total annual expenditures, the largest share of any state. While Wyoming is one of two states without a formal law dictating how to spend the fund, lawmakers have recently suggested the reserves be spent to cover the budget shortfalls resulting from lost oil revenues. The Wyoming government spends $15,797 per student on education, roughly $4,800 more than the national average. Heavy education spending may be one reason for Wyoming\u2019s high educational attainment. An estimated 92.2% of Wyoming adults have at least a high school diploma compared to 87.1% nationwide. 5. Utah > Debt per capita:\u00a0$2,446 (17th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a03.5% (5th lowest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aaa/AAA > Poverty:\u00a011.3% (12th lowest) Utah is the only state in which more than one in three residents is younger than 20 years old. With the highest child-to-adult ratio in the country, Utah\u2019s education system demands more resources than in many other states \u2014 and with fewer income earners comprising the tax base. However, while the state\u2019s education budget accounts for a nation-leading 41.2% of total spending, this expenditure is equal to just $6,500 per student, the least of any state. Utah also has a healthy economy and provides generous unemployment benefits. Just 3.5% of the state\u2019s labor force was out of work in 2015, the fifth lowest unemployment rate of all states. For those who are out of a job, unemployment insurance covers 45.2% of wages on average, one of the highest replacement rates of any state. WORST-RUN STATES > Debt per capita:\u00a0$3,303 (24th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a06.6% (3rd highest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aa1/AA > Poverty:\u00a020.4% (2nd highest) New Mexico ranks as the worst run state on our list for the second consecutive year. Following a large and unexpected tax shortfall in the state\u2019s fiscal 2016 and 2017 budgets, Moody\u2019s downgraded the state\u2019s credit rating and outlook. Despite the outlook, according to the credit agency, New Mexico has a strong history of balancing its budget, and the state\u2019s debt levels are manageable and on the decline. The Largest Private Company in Every State The likelihood of living in poverty is very high for individuals without a high school diploma. In New Mexico, fewer than 85% of adults have a high school diploma, nearly the lowest high school attainment rate, and more than 20% of state residents live in poverty, the second highest rate of all states. Like most poorly-run states, New Mexico\u2019s labor market is struggling. The state\u2019s labor force declined over the last five years, and 6.5% of workers were unemployed as of October, the highest October jobless rate of all states. 49. Illinois > Debt per capita:\u00a0$5,119 (11th highest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a05.9% (tied-12th highest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Baa2/BBB > Poverty:\u00a013.6% (23rd lowest) Due to ongoing political gridlock, Illinois lawmakers have not agreed on annual budget for its next fiscal year. With a growing tab of unpaid bills and debt, Illinois has the worst credit rating of all states. The state\u2019s outstanding bills totalled nearly $9 billion in October, up from less than $6 billion in October of last year and the highest since February 2013. In addition to fiscal management problems, the state\u2019s housing market and economy are struggling. Approximately 1 in every 80 housing units are in some stage of foreclosure in Illinois, nearly the worst foreclosure rate of all states. The state\u2019s labor force has also declined over the past five years, and the unemployment rate of 5.5% as of October was among the highest in the nation. 48. Rhode Island > Debt per capita:\u00a0$8,888 (3rd highest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a06.0% (tied-10th highest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aa2/AA > Poverty:\u00a013.9% (25th lowest) Rhode Island residents benefit from relatively safe communities, high health insurance coverage, and high incomes. The state\u2019s violent crime rate of 243 incidents per 100,000 residents is 11th lowest. The percentage of people without health insurance of 5.7% is sixth lowest. Also, the median household income of $58,073 a year is above the national median of $55,775. Despite these strengths, Rhode Island\u2019s economy is struggling, and measures of state finances suggest poor fiscal management. The state\u2019s economy grew by 1.1% in 2015, slower than most states and less than half the national GDP growth rate. Also, Rhode Island\u2019s outstanding debt is larger than its annual revenue, nearly the highest compared with other states and double the average debt-to-revenue ratio across all states. 47. Mississippi > Debt per capita:\u00a0$2,374 (16th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a06.5% (5th highest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aa2/AA > Poverty:\u00a022.0% (the highest) Last year, 6.5% of Mississippi\u2019s workers were unemployed, nearly the worst jobless rate of any state. For most of those in need of a job, social safety nets were not likely adequate. Only 15% of jobless Mississippians receive unemployment insurance benefits, and the average weekly unemployment insurance payout in the state is only $204, the lowest in the country. Financial hardship is common throughout the state \u2014 its 22% poverty rate is the highest in the country. Mississippi\u2019s job market has likely been hindered by slow growth. The state\u2019s total economic output increased by only 0.7% in 2015, far less than half the 2.4% growth rate nationwide. While the connection between school spending and educational outcomes is complex, educational spending is effectively an investment in the future. Though Mississippi currently only spends 27.5% of its budget on education, slightly less than is typical, its priorities may be shifting. Gov. Phil Bryant has stated his new budget will include spending cuts across state programs, but he has also indicated his intention to increase funding for K-12 education by $16.4 million. 46. Alabama > Debt per capita:\u00a0$1,833 (10th lowest) > 2015 Unemployment rate:\u00a06.1% (tied-8th highest) > Credit rating:\u00a0Aa1/AA > Poverty:\u00a018.5% (tied-5th highest) One of the poorest states in the country, 18.5% of Alabama residents live in poverty, a far larger share than the 14.7% national poverty rate. With a weak tax base, Alabama\u2019s government has relatively little to work with financially. The state is one of only nine with a per capita tax revenue of less than $2,000. Partially as a result, the state has faced year after year of budget shortfalls. Recently, the Alabama legislature created a budget reform tax force. The 14-member team has been tasked with designing and implementing a long-term plan to solve recurring budget problems. See how all of the states rank: The Best and Worst Run States in America: A Survey of All 50 More on the best- and worst-run states There is no comprehensive measure of how well or poorly a government runs a state. Our basis for this ranking consists of measures of financial health and fiscal responsibility, as well as socioeconomic outcomes such as unemployment, poverty, and crime \u2014 conditions state governments are tasked with managing and improving. Selecting appropriate criteria to compare 50 states is difficult because governing does not occur in a vacuum. Each state has different populations, obstacles, and means with which to work. Some states are more rural, while others are highly urbanized and densely populated. Some states depend disproportionately on one industry, while economies in other states are more diverse. Some states rely on high-skilled sectors, such as technology and business services, while others are rich in natural resources. These circumstances can have a meaningful impact on where they rank in our list. North Dakota\u2019s economy, for example, experienced a boom a few years back due to the explosive development of the Bakken shale oil formation. The consequent population and employment growth helped result in extremely low poverty and unemployment rates, and helped propel the state higher in the rankings. The very resources that help some states can become a burden to those that are overdependent on them. The massive decline in global oil prices from the second half of 2014 through 2015 has taken a serious toll on state oil revenues. Should prices persist at these low levels, the socioeconomic benefits from the oil boom in these states may soon evaporate. Ranking Gender Inequality in All 50 States While some states\u2019 economic fortunes are closely tied to the rise and fall of individual industries, which are often outside of the government\u2019s control, each state must make the best of its own situation. Governments, as stewards of their own economies, need to prepare for the worst, including the collapse of a vital industry. Good governance is about balancing tax collection and state expenditure in a way that provides essential services to residents without sacrificing a state\u2019s long-term fiscal health. Setting aside a rainy day fund and not incurring too much debt, for example, are ways to plan for the worst. For a majority of states, the bulk of government revenue comes from taxes. To ensure a healthy tax base, states can create grants, subsidies, and incentives to encourage the growth of businesses in the region. Some of the best run states on our list have a high share of workers in professional, scientific, and financial jobs, which tend to be higher-paying. The best run states also have growing populations, with many new residents likely attracted by educational and occupational opportunities. The best run states often attract the wealthiest, most educated residents, and, with the resulting tax revenue, can continue to promote smart economic development. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

(Photo: Sedat Suna, EPA) Two powerful\u00a0explosions\u00a0\u2014 including a\u00a0possible car\u00a0bomb \u2014 injured at least 20 police officers outside a soccer stadium in central Istanbul Saturday,\u00a0Turkey's authorities say. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement that \u201cunfortunately we have martyrs and wounded,\u201d but he did not specify the number. The private\u00a0 NTV \u00a0channel reported the target of the attack outside newly built Besiktas Stadium was a bus used by\u00a0riot police. NTV reported as many as 38 people treated for wounds at nearby hospitals. \u201cIt is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left,\" said Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, according to\u00a0Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency. \u201cWe have no information on the number of dead. God willing we hope there won\u2019t be any. The wounded are police.\u201d Police officers hug each other after an explosion around Vodafone Arena Stadium in Istanbul, Dec. 10, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Sedat Suna, EPA) Police cordoned off the area amid the sound of gunfire as\u00a0smoke rose from the scene. The blasts erupted\u00a0after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. The explosion has also been caught live on the cameras of BJK TV. One of the blasts was thought to be a car bomb and the second appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. Witnesses also heard gunfire after the explosions. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey tweeted Sunday:\u00a0\"Our hearts and prayers are with the people of #Istanbul tonight.\u00a0We condemn tonight's cowardly attack, and salute the courage of the Turkish people as we stand with them against terror.\" (2/2) We condemn tonight's cowardly attack, and salute the courage of the Turkish people as we stand with them against terror. \u2014 US Embassy Turkey (@USEmbassyTurkey) December 10, 2016 Istanbul has witnessed bombings this year attributed by authorities to the Islamic State group or claimed by Kurdish militants. \u0130stanbul'da patlama!

    "text": "A fire ripped through a warehouse in Oakland on Dec. 2, killing 36\u00a0people who were there for an electronic music concert. Here are the names of those who have been confirmed dead by the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office Coroner\u2019s Bureau or immediate family members. Did you know one of the victims... (Los Angeles Times Staff) The fact that the warehouse was not on the fire inspection system is puzzling because the city Fire Prevention Bureau is required to conduct annual inspections of all commercial buildings and multifamily residences, according to city ordinance. Some former residents described the warehouse as a cluttered \u201cdeath trap\u201d lacking fire sprinklers and filled with debris and exposed wires. Some said they made complaints to the city. People rented space in the building even though it was zoned only for warehouse use. The death toll from the fire was so high because the warehouse was hosting an unpermitted concert that night. Experts said Oakland has a variety of questions to answer about how it handled the warehouse. \u201cThere are legitimate issues here about why the city of Oakland didn\u2019t use more resources to go into this property,\u201d said Michael Colantuono, a municipal attorney and expert on code enforcement and planning. Others said that Oakland is far from alone in struggling with code enforcement, especially at a time of rising property values that have pushed lower-income residents into substandard housing like the Ghost Ship. Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said her department was still in the process of looking for records related to the warehouse. \u201cI can\u2019t answer how that warehouse slipped through the cracks and that it bypassed our system \u2014 or how it bypassed the city\u2019s system,\u201d Reed told CNN in an interview. \u201cBut everybody is at the table right now trying to figure out what happened.\u201d The city\u2019s Planning and Building Department investigated at least three of the complaints at the warehouse over the past three years. The complaints appear to assert that structures had been built inside without permits or that the property was being used as a residence. Most of the other complaints cited illegal parking and mounds of debris piled up on the sidewalk and in an adjoining vacant lot. A building code inspector visited the warehouse 15 days before the fire to investigate complaints of trash piled outside and an \u201cillegal interior building structure.\u201d But the inspector was unable to get inside, triggering questions about whether a more aggressive investigation would have identified the multiple building code violations inside the structure and possibly prevented the tragedy. Deadly Oakland warehouse fire Read more stories Questions about the competence of Oakland\u2019s building inspection agency arose five years ago. An Alameda County Grand Jury in 2011 released a scathing report accusing the city\u2019s building services division of mismanagement and having haphazard policies about conducting building inspections. The grand jury found that agency was riddled with \u201cpoor management, lack of leadership, and ambiguous policies and procedures.\u201d On Friday, investigators ruled out a faulty refrigerator as the cause of last week\u2019s fire. Earlier in the week, officials had said the refrigerator and other appliances were being examined as possible causes. But Jill Snyder, a federal agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\u00a0Firearms and Explosives, said\u00a0that electronics engineers had ruled out the refrigerator. The cause remains under investigation, but Snyder said it\u2019s possible a definitive cause might never be known. She also said there was no evidence the blaze was intentionally set. Questions over the inspection records of the warehouse sparked mixed reactions in Oakland. Some residents feared that the fire will lead to a crackdown on housing like the Ghost Ship, causing low-income residents to be evicted with nowhere to go. \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible lack of housing here,\" said Hannah da Cruz, 27, a fifth-generation Oakland resident. \u201cIt\u2019s really pushing out our true community members.\u201d Cruz, a student working on her doctorate in\u00a0clinical psychology who also works with traumatized children through art, said artists\u00a0are increasingly being priced out of traditional housing\u00a0and have little choice but to live in places like warehouses. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more expensive here,\u00a0and you get less and less. It leads to people living in a place like that,\u201d\u00a0she said.\u00a0 \u201cA huge culprit in this is the gentrification here. It's not just one inspector\u2019s fault.\u201d Nancy Lopez, 40, lives in an apartment building off International Boulevard just two streets away from the Ghost Ship. Lopez said she is concerned that the warehouse was not inspected more often. \u201cI know they\u2019re understaffed;\u00a0I know they\u2019re underbudgeted,\u201d\u00a0Lopez said. \u201cBut you have to have priorities.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Who\u2019s to blame for one of the worst fires in California history , Dakota Access pipeline opponents have claimed a big victory for now , Beyonce leads today\u2019s Grammy nominations with nine , Ben Carson is Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development , how will Hollywood speak to Trump\u2019s America , meet Wilbur Ross, the man Trump has tapped him to lead the U.S. Department of Commerce , and John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 .

By MICHAEL CORKERY and BEN PROTESS DEC. 10, 2016 As fans gathered on Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan, Al Roker pulled up in a big red delivery truck, ready to give America what it wanted: Twinkies. The snack cakes flew through the air into the crowd pressed against metal barriers. One man shoved cream-filled treats into his mouth. Another \u201cToday\u201d host tucked Twinkies into the neckline of her dress. Across the nation in the summer of 2013, there was a feeding frenzy for Twinkies. The iconic snack cake returned to shelves just months after Hostess had shuttered its bakeries and laid off thousands of workers. The return was billed on \u201cToday\u201d as \u201cthe sweetest comeback in the history of ever.\u201d Nowhere was it sweeter, perhaps, than at the investment firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, which spent $186 million in cash to buy some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake bakeries and brands in early 2013. Less than four years later, they sold the company in a deal that valued Hostess at $2.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos have now reaped a return totaling 13 times their original cash investment. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Behind the financial maneuvering at Hostess, an investigation by The New York Times found a blueprint for how private equity executives like those at Apollo have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era. Deals like Hostess have helped make the men running the six largest publicly traded private equity firms collectively the highest-earning executives of any major American industry, according to a joint study that The Times conducted with Equilar , a board and executive data provider. The study covered thousands of publicly traded companies; privately held corporations do not report such data. Continue reading the main story Meet These Very High-Earning Private Equity Executives A joint study by The New York Times and Equilar, a board and executive data provider, examined the annual take-home pay of the top-ranking executives at the six private equity firms that are publicly traded. The findings were compared with a number of other industries, including large technology firms and banks. On average, the heads of the private equity firms earned nearly 10 times as much as the heads of banks. 2015 earnings for each top executive from his private equity firm DIVIDENDS AND For the eight executives above $138,947,699 For six chief executives of top banks\u2020 $23,365,197 The median and average for the eight executives above 2015 earnings for each top executive from his private equity firm KKR SALARY, BONUS, STOCK AND PERKS Antony P.

Blankfein (Goldman Sachs); John G. Stumpf (Wells Fargo); James P. Gorman (Morgan Stanley); Michael L. Corbat (Citigroup); Brian T. Moynihan (Bank of America) Source: Equilar | By Karl Russell/The New York Times Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder of Blackstone, took home the largest haul last year: nearly $800 million. He and other private equity executives receive more annually than the leaders of Facebook and Apple, companies that revolutionized the way society communicates. The top executives at those six publicly traded private equity firms earned, on average, $211 million last year \u2014 which is about what Leon Black, a founder of Apollo, received. That amount was nearly 10 times what the average bank chief executive earned, though firms like Apollo face less public scrutiny on pay than banks do. Private equity firms note that much of their top executives\u2019 wealth stems from owning their own stock and that they have earned their fortunes bringing companies back to life by applying their operational and financial expertise. Hostess, a defunct snack brand that was quickly returned to profitability, is a textbook example of the success of this approach. Yet even as private equity\u2019s ability to generate huge profits is indisputable, the industry\u2019s value to the work force and the broader economy is still a matter of debate. Hostess, which has bounced between multiple private equity owners over the last decade, shows how murky the jobs issue can be. In 2012, the company filed for bankruptcy under the private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. Months later, with Ripplewood having lost control and the company\u2019s creditors in charge, Hostess was shut down and its workers sent home for good. Without investment from Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess brands and all those jobs might have vanished forever after the bankruptcy. The way these firms see it, they created a new company and new jobs with higher pay and generous bonuses. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the new Hostess employs only 1,200 people, a fraction of the roughly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs at Hostess\u2019s snack cake business during the 2012 bankruptcy. And some Hostess employees who got their jobs back lost them again. Under Apollo and Metropoulos, Hostess shut down one of the plants they reopened in Illinois, costing 415 jobs. The collapse and revival of Hostess illustrates how even in a business success, many workers don\u2019t share in the gains. The episode also provides a snapshot of the economic forces that helped propel Donald J. Trump to the White House. Since losing his job at Hostess in 2012, Mark Popovich has had three jobs, including one that paid about $10 an hour, half what he made at the Twinkie-maker. A lifelong Democrat and devoted \u201cunion man,\u201d Mr. Popovich said he supported Mr. Trump, the first time he ever voted Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s getting old, getting bounced around all the time,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, a 58-year-old Ohio resident. Photo Mark Popovich, 58, in front of the former Hostess Brands bakery in Northwood, Ohio. Mr. Popovich lost his job when Hostess closed the plant in 2012 and has had three jobs since. He was laid off again just before Thanksgiving. Credit Laura McDermott for The New York Times Such frustrations stem from broader shifts in the economy, as all types of companies turn to automation to cut costs and labor unions lose their influence. While these changes have helped keep companies profitable, private equity has used these shifts in the workplace to supercharge wealth far beyond that of the typical chief executive. And yet, Mr. Trump did not focus on private equity on the campaign trail, instead blaming the plight of the American working class on a shadowy cabal of elitist Democrats and Wall Street bankers who support trade deals that ship jobs overseas. \u201cPeople understand jobs going to China,\u201d said Michael Hillard, an economics professor at the University of Southern Maine. \u201cBut no one has ever heard of these private equity firms that come in and do all this financial engineering. It is much more complicated and less visible.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The industry\u2019s trade group, the American Investment Council, says it is sensitive to these issues as private equity\u2019s role in the economy expands. The industry now controls huge swaths of the American work force: 4.4 million employees at over 7,500 companies, according to PitchBook, a private financial data platform. By some measures, Blackstone is one of the nation\u2019s 10 largest employers and one of its biggest landlords. The firm\u2019s co-founder, Mr. Schwarzman, is advising Mr. Trump on job creation. \u201cAt a time when many Americans are concerned about the country\u2019s economic viability, private equity has proven itself in communities throughout the United States as an effective solution,\u201d said James Maloney, the American Investment Council\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSustainable growth strategies, adherence to responsible investments and a long-view approach are all a part of the present-day private equity model.\u201d The Times investigation of the Hostess deal shows that today\u2019s private equity also uses another set of tactics, like special dividends and tax arrangements, that maximize profits in creative, yet financially risky ways. Since the financial crisis, the private equity industry has become hugely influential. Here\u2019s how it plays out in your daily life. A year after the layoffs at the Hostess plant in Illinois, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for the company to borrow about $1.3 billion. Apollo and Metropoulos used most of that sum to pay themselves, and their investors, an early dividend on their investment. The firms also found a way to make money even after the company was sold. The firms, The Times investigation found, struck a deal to collect as much as $400 million over the next 15 years, based on what Hostess\u2019s future tax savings might be. These winnings do not come without risk to the private equity firms, which are often taking a gamble on troubled companies, and when they fail, the firms probably lose out. And this is not a simple story of powerful investors enriching themselves while some workers struggle. Teachers and firefighters also benefit from private equity. Pension funds that pay retirement benefits to public servants now depend on private equity to generate huge returns. Without it, taxpayers could bear more of the costs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHostess\u2019s comeback was a win-win-win-win,\u201d an Apollo spokesman said in a statement, adding that its investment benefited workers, communities, investors and consumers. \u201cAfter teaming up to take on the daunting financial and operational challenge of creating a new company around the Hostess brand, Apollo and Metropoulos & Co. completed a highly successful private equity investment.\u201d On a more basic level, Americans enjoy what private equity has owned: GNC vitamins, affordable jewelry at Zales, and birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s. Photo Hostess Brands marked the resurrection of Twinkies in July 2013, handing out the snacks free from a truck in New York. Credit Scott Eells/Bloomberg Hostess\u2019s new owners rode a wave of nostalgia for the company\u2019s snack cakes, a euphoria that even spread to a sprawling Long Island estate . At a wedding there in 2013, packaged cupcakes were offered to guests. It may seem an unusual choice, but this party had a special affinity for the snack cake. The bride\u2019s father is an executive at Apollo. The \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019 Leon Black grew up in a family that had a home in Westport, Conn., and an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He attended Dartmouth and Harvard Business School. But when Mr. Black traveled to Lubbock, Tex., to speak to a group of retired teachers, he emphasized a humbler side of his pedigree. \u201cYou should know,\u201d Mr. Black said, according to a video recording of the February 2012 meeting, \u201cmy mother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my brother-in-law is a teacher. We have a lot of teachers in our family.\u201d Mr. Black had good reason to flatter the retirees: Pension funds for teachers and other public workers are some of the biggest investors in Apollo\u2019s funds and have helped make Mr. Black a very rich man. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Black, or an affiliated limited liability company, owns homes in Beverly Hills, Miami Beach and several locations in New York, an analysis of real estate records shows. This year, he bought the $38 million house in Beverly Hills that had belonged to the actor Tom Cruise. Private equity\u2019s relationship with pension funds is mutually beneficial. As countless baby boomers reach retirement at a time of historically low interest rates, public pension funds need to achieve returns that match their liabilities \u2014 and private equity has delivered. Nearly half of private equity\u2019s invested assets now come from public and private pensions around the world. Private equity uses this pension fund money to place bets on companies like Hostess, and Texas teachers have shared in the profits from the deal. Photo Fran Plemmons is a former president of the retired teachers association in Texas. The state\u2019s teacher retirement system has invested in the fund that owns Hostess Brands and done very well, a boon to retirees at a time of rock-bottom interest rates. Credit Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times The Teacher Retirement System of Texas has invested in the fund that bought Hostess. And that fund has reaped 27 percent net during the three years it owned Hostess, significantly more than the stock market returned in that period. \u201cYou need to get people in whom you trust and who will keep up our fund,\u201d said Fran Plemmons, a former president of the Texas Retired Teachers Association who was a teacher and principal for 25 years. \u201cIf they do that, you need to get out of the way.\u201d Ms. Plemmons said her $31,200 yearly pension allows her to live modestly but comfortably. High returns from private equity investments, she said, help keep pension payments flowing to retired school workers across Texas, which trickles down into the local economy. For the teachers in Lubbock, Mr. Black described the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind its success: buying the debt of financially troubled companies or purchasing an entire company. The investments, he said, are \u201cvalue-oriented, if not contrarian.\u201d Hostess fit that formula. Not only were Americans turning to healthier snacks and eating less junk food, but Hostess had its own challenges. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2012, the baking company had gone through a bruising bankruptcy, its second in a decade. The company laid off most of its 18,500 unionized drivers, loaders and bakers, not long after the bakers\u2019 union voted for a companywide strike rather than accept another round of concessions. The Rich History of Twinkies Continue Reading \u00bb But what was disaster for previous owners looked like treasure to Apollo and Metropoulos. When Hostess lenders auctioned off the company in early 2013, Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s snack cake brands, which included Twinkies and Ding Dongs. Snack cakes still produced some of the highest profit margins in the food industry and Hostess cakes were particularly well-known. The bankruptcy also provided Apollo and Metropoulos a clean slate, liberating them from union contracts, labor rules and debt and pension payments. One group of workers who had no place at the new Hostess: the unionized drivers, who transported snack cakes and bread to grocery stores nationwide. Now, Hostess would send its baked goods to warehouses, where retailers like Walmart would ship to individual stores. Ronald Litland, 44, delivered Hostess products in Illinois for 10 years. After he was laid off in 2012, he enrolled in a for-profit college in hopes of finding a new career in information technology. When his unemployment benefits ran out, he delivered pizzas. He never finished school, but is still paying back student loans and taking care of his son. \u201cI have a hard time making ends meet,\u201d said Mr. Litland, who earns about $24,000 a year. Like the drivers, Hostess\u2019s baking operation was also cut back. Apollo and Metropoulos chose to buy only a handful of its roughly one dozen snack cake bakeries. Other parts of the former Hostess baking empire were scaled back as well. Food companies picked off some of Hostess\u2019s bread brands, but reopened only a small fraction of the bakeries. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Before being laid off from Hostess, Mr. Popovich made about $20 an hour. Every year, he went on vacation in the Bahamas or St. Martin. His health insurance covered the $385,000 cost when his wife needed major surgery. \u201cI lived a good life,\u201d said Mr. Popovich, whose most recent job driving a forklift at a solar panel plant paid about $16 an hour. Mr. Popovich is also entitled to a pension, which he was promised after working more than two decades at Hostess. But he recently received a letter at his home in Toledo, Ohio, warning that the pension fund was nearly insolvent. Apollo and Metropoulos are not obligated to contribute to the pension fund, which is managed by a labor union. Nor do they have to pay the severance that Hostess was obligated to pay Mr. Popovich when he was laid off. Those liabilities were wiped out in the bankruptcy. New Shoes and Dashed Hopes At a brick bakery in Schiller Park, Ill., Twinkies started rolling off the line nearly a century ago. And when Apollo and Metropoulos bought some of Hostess\u2019s cake plants and brands out of bankruptcy in 2013, Schiller Park\u2019s plant was one of the fortunate few to reopen. Photo C. Dean Metropoulos, in suit, celebrated the comeback of Twinkies with workers at the plant in Schiller Park, Ill., in July 2013. A Hostess spokeswoman said that Mr. Metropoulos oversaw the refurbishing of the plant. But it was closed the following year. Credit Scott Boehm/Associated Press \u201cSchiller Park, We \u2665 You,\u201d read a billboard that Hostess sponsored in the town, the heart carved into the image of a half-eaten Twinkie. The celebration was short-lived. Just over a year after the plant\u2019s grand reopening, Hostess shut it down. The fallout was swift. All 415 employees were fired, some for the second time in two years. Schiller Park lost one of its largest employers, creating a ripple effect through this tiny working-class suburb of Chicago. The plant itself, an institution so old that it predated nearby O\u2019Hare International Airport, was suddenly vacant. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe got our hopes up again,\u201d said the town\u2019s mayor, Barbara J. Piltaver. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, we had a big hit.\u201d The story behind the rise and fall \u2014 and fall again \u2014 of the Schiller Park plant encapsulates private equity\u2019s relationship with workers and labor unions. It\u2019s a complicated issue. A prominent study of investments across the country concluded that private equity has increased productivity while leading to a minor overall decline in jobs relative to the broader economy. Private equity\u2019s trade group says its o wn analysis of county demographics found that private equity investment increases jobs growth in local economies, though the data was limited. In Schiller Park, Janice Ryan worked at the Hostess plant for about 20 years before the 2012 bankruptcy. She walked to work from her nearby home. And she was relieved to return, after several months of unemployment, to be part of what many workers believed was the company\u2019s long-term comeback. Schiller Park was a starting point for getting Twinkies back on the shelves by summer 2013. As part of that push, many Schiller Park employees worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, and could volunteer for a seventh day. Photo Mayor Barbara J. Piltaver of Schiller Park, Ill., a working-class community of 12,000.

What the workers were never told, however, was that Apollo and Metropoulos had no plans to keep Schiller Park in operation over the long term. \u201cSchiller, in essence, was a contingency plan, opened only to ensure that initial demand could be met,\u201d Hannah Arnold, a Hostess spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added that the setup of the bakery \u2014 its low ceilings and lack of a loading dock \u2014 was not conducive to the company\u2019s future plans. The company says it could not tell workers of its plans because of labor rules. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The expendability of Schiller Park reflects Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s plans to run a more efficient operation than their predecessors did. And that model requires far fewer workers than the one that existed for decades. In 2012, Hostess had about 8,000 employees and eight bakeries dedicated exclusively to snack cakes. Six other plants produced at least some desserts. Today, the new Hostess has only three plants and 1,200 workers. At Schiller Park, some workers earned a dollar less per hour than what workers were paid under the previous owners. Others earned more, the company said. Still, they qualified for bonuses, owed no union dues and received health insurance and dental care. Instead of pensions, they were enrolled in 401(k) plans. Former employees recalled grueling shifts when temperatures inside the plant neared 110 degrees. The workers were given Gatorade to rehydrate.

Credit Amy Stroth \u201cBakeries are hot places,\u201d Mr. Spina said. \u201cBut Schiller Park could really be a hot son of a bitch.\u201d Veronica Pacheco, who lives in Schiller Park and joined the Hostess bakery when it reopened in 2013, described \u201cfreezing\u201d wintertime conditions that were equally arduous. She said she wore scarves and heavy gloves under her work garments. Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, noted that prospective employees answered a questionnaire about whether they were willing to work in \u201cextreme seasonal temperatures.\u201d The company said it spent about $100,000 upgrading the heating and air-conditioning system, but stopped short of a total overhaul. There were other hazards as well. In 2014, Todd Kemp was injured after heaps of Twinkie mix spilled on the factory floor, causing him to slip and injure his shoulder, back and knee. He has since had four operations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Arnold said Apollo and Metropoulos inherited old equipment, some of it in disrepair, adding that Schiller Park \u201cwas in the worst condition of the four bakeries by far.\u201d C. Dean Metropoulos, the billionaire Greek immigrant whose firm has invested in other well-known food brands like Vlasic pickles and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, personally oversaw the upgrading and cleaning of the facility, Ms. Arnold said. \u201cHe also focused on ensuring workers had new uniforms and better shoes, to make long days standing more comfortable,\u201d she said. Over the long term, Apollo and Metropoulos looked outside Schiller Park to generate profits. Hostess employed \u201cextended shelf-life technology\u201d to make the Twinkie, already jokingly thought to be capable of surviving nuclear war, even more everlasting. The company perfected its secret recipe until it contained the right amount of enzymes to better retain moisture. The enzymes extended shelf life of some products to 65 days from 26 days.

Bukaty/Associated Press The company also turned to automation. At a plant in Emporia, Kan., Hostess installed an automated baking system that churned out more cakes with fewer workers. William Toler, Hostess\u2019s chief executive, said the company spent more than $140 million \u201cto get the business up and running, and certainly our results suggest we made very good choices.\u201d The Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga., had another advantage: government subsidies. The state\u2019s economic development agency provided Hostess with tax credits to push along the deal. The Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs.

Hostess said it also received incentives from Emporia, the State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis. Employment totals at those plants have since increased. Hostess did not receive any incentives in Illinois. Three workers interviewed by The Times said they believed that the final straw for Schiller Park was when they voted to rejoin a union. Hostess fought the effort. The company plastered the plant with posters urging workers to vote \u201cno.\u201d The union prevailed, but not for long. Around the time union officials had planned to start contract negotiations in August 2014, Hostess announced it was shutting down the Schiller Park plant.

Credit Tannen Maury/European Pressphoto Agency Ms. Arnold, the Hostess spokeswoman, said the unionization vote did not factor into the decision to close Schiller Park. Employees, she said, were provided severance and an opportunity to apply for a Hostess job in another state. Union officials declined to comment. Since then, unions have made limited inroads at Hostess. Whereas 83 percent of the work force was unionized in 2012, Hostess recently said in a securities filing that about 30 percent of employees belonged to a union in Indianapolis and Columbus. Its flagship facility, Emporia, is not unionized. \u201cBoth Apollo and Metropoulos have owned and operated numerous companies that had union employees,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, adding that \u201cMetropoulos has always enjoyed good, working relations with unions and their members.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Money-Making Machine For all the profits Apollo and Metropoulos squeezed out of the Hostess factories, a deal hatched in a hotel room on Fifth Avenue in New York shows how private equity can have its snack cake and eat it, too. There, in the Versailles Room at the St. Regis, Apollo and Metropoulos began the process of extracting returns from the company, less than a year after shutting the Schiller Park plant. Most investors seeking profit have to wait for the right moment to sell a company or take it public. But private equity uses a different playbook. First, Apollo and Metropoulos arranged for Hostess to borrow money from the banking giant Credit Suisse. The two firms then pocketed about $900 million of that money for themselves and their investors. Hostess, meanwhile, is stuck repaying the debt. This type of deal is known as a dividend recapitalization, and it is a staple of private equity\u2019s money-making strategy. These deals provide private equity firms an opportunity to profit before they even sell a company, an added bonus to the firms and their investors, including public pensioners. Since 2012, private equity firms have arranged hundreds of such deals, totaling over $148 billion in debt, according to Thomson Reuters. Hostess\u2019s dividend deal was the third largest of 2015. This financial engineering is crucial to private equity\u2019s success \u2014 and to building the personal fortunes of the industry\u2019s executives. With each dividend recapitalization, more money pours into Apollo, which then flows to the firm\u2019s executives. Photo The demolition of the Schiller Park, Ill., Hostess plant in October. The bakery was closed for good in 2014. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times It comes with risks. Of all the companies that carried out dividend recapitalizations since 2012, about 10 percent have faced a credit rating downgrade within six months of the deal, according to LCD/S&P Global Market Intelligence and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings, which notes that many factors could lead to a downgrade, including excessive debt. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Although Hostess has not been downgraded, it now describes itself in public filings as \u201chighly leveraged.\u201d Mr. Toler, the Hostess chief, said that even after the dividend payout, the company \u201chad plenty of capital to work with.\u201d At the same time it was paying dividends to investors, Hostess earmarked $8 million to pay bonuses to workers, including those in the bakeries. A few months after the dividend deal, Apollo and Metropoulos entered into negotiations to sell the company. Instead of being sold outright, Hostess would be acquired by a shell company , created by another private equity firm, the Gores Group. And still, they arranged more ways to profit. Apollo and Metropoulos retained a combined 42 percent stake in the company, which is now publicly traded. After investing only $186 million in cash when they bought the company in 2013 (they took out debt to help finance the rest of the $410 million deal), Apollo and Metropoulos\u2019s investment is now worth 13 times that initial cash investment. Tracing how these enormous returns wind their way into Mr. Black\u2019s pocket is a byzantine task. Mr. Black collected a $100,000 salary and no bonus in 2015. How did Mr. Black, on such a relatively modest salary, come to acquire an art collection that is said to include one of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201c Scream\u201d series, which he bought in 2012 for about $120 million, then the highest price ever paid for a painting? Advertisement Continue reading the main story The answer is that Mr. Black and other private equity executives make their money in ways that set them apart from most other industries. Mr. Black\u2019s share of the Hostess profits, from the partial sale and the $900 million in cash they pulled out of the company, will be reflected in a series of distributions he collects from Apollo\u2019s publicly traded stock. The size of the distribution depends on the size of the profits from deals like Hostess. Last year, Mr. Black\u2019s distributions totaled $181 million. Photo Leon Black, chief of Apollo Global Management. Credit SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg Other shareholders in Apollo \u2014 which include money managers like Fidelity \u2014 also receive these distributions. But Mr. Black, as the largest shareholder of a company he co-founded in 1990, gets the largest payout. While Mr. Black receives the most money at Apollo, one of his partners and co-founders, Joshua Harris, took home $121 million last year. Mr. Harris is part owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils. Mr. Black has noted that if Apollo\u2019s investments fail to make money, then its executives also miss out. Like most private equity firms, Apollo collects a management fee from investors and earns 20 percent of profits from the firm\u2019s investments, once its investors recoup their original money and reap profits of their own. Private equity\u2019s advantages don\u2019t end there. Apollo\u2019s share of the profits on Hostess or any deal ultimately flows to Mr. Black and his fellow shareholders in the company in ways that lower their tax burden. The industry\u2019s 20 percent cut of profits \u2014 also known as carried interest \u2014 is taxed at a long-term capital gains rate that is roughly half the 40 percent ordinary income rate for the nation\u2019s highest earners. And since private equity executives receive much of their money from carried interest \u2014 or in the case of Mr. Black, distributions largely made up of carried interest \u2014 they enjoy a tax advantage over workers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This is what\u2019s known as the \u201ccarried-interest loophole\u201d \u2014 a tax treatment held up during the presidential campaign as evidence that the rich fail to pay their fair share. Private equity managers argue that this treatment is not a loophole or even unique to private equity. Its use originated from the cut of profits that ship captains reaped for \u201ccarrying\u201d goods. In the Hostess deal, Apollo and Metropoulos found even more ways to use the tax code to their advantage. Continue reading the main story Photo The Hostess plant in Columbus, Ga. The state\u2019s economic development agency provided Hostess with tax credits, and the Town of Columbus chipped in a $1 million grant to award Hostess for creating jobs. Credit Melissa Golden for The New York Times The firms are entitled to collect a large portion of tax benefits that Hostess could earn well into the future. The idea is that by selling a stake in Hostess before they could realize these benefits, Apollo and Metropoulos could leave money on the table. These arrangements, which are now commonplace in private deals, allow the firms to collect cash from a company they may no longer own. The Hostess \u201ctax-receivable\u201d benefits, according to previously unreported securities filings and estimates by the Apollo spokesman, could provide Apollo and Metropoulos up to $400 million for the next 15 years or more. Looking out over those next 15 years, nothing seems guaranteed to Mr. Popovich, the former Hostess worker from Toledo. Right before Thanksgiving, Mr. Popovich was laid off from his most recent job at the solar panel plant. The idea of searching for work at age 58 is daunting. He has been sending out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but has not received a call back. \u201cIt\u2019s been four jobs in four years,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d Leslie Picker, Kitty Bennett and Sara Olkon contributed reporting.

Tony Dejak/AP hide caption toggle caption Tony Dejak/AP Only 50 percent of kids born in the 1980s are earning more than their parents did at the same age, according to a new study that puts most of the blame on the narrow distribution of economic gains. Tony Dejak/AP The widening gap between rich and poor Americans has pushed the chances of children earning more money than their parents down to around 50 percent, economic researchers say. That's a sharp fall from 1940, when 90 percent of kids were destined to move up the income ladder. Describing an American dream that for many has faded into a less plentiful reality, Stanford economics professor Raj Chetty said in a news release , \"It's basically a coin flip as to whether you'll do better than your parents.\" The downward trend held true across the U.S. \u2014 and the steepest declines were seen among middle-class families, according to Chetty and his fellow researchers in the Equality of Opportunity Project . The proportion of U.S. children who go on to earn more than their parents has dropped sharply since 1940, when the rate topped 90 percent. Equality of Opportunity Project hide caption toggle caption Equality of Opportunity Project The proportion of U.S. children who go on to earn more than their parents has dropped sharply since 1940, when the rate topped 90 percent. Equality of Opportunity Project The study detailed \"absolute income mobility\" from one generation to the next by comparing the household income of 30-year-olds to what their parents made at the same age. The Stanford study used data from both the U.S. Census and anonymized Internal Revenue Service records to compile stats for people born between 1940 and 1984. Over that period, it became less likely that children born in every U.S. state would out-earn their parents, with the largest drops in upward mobility seen in Michigan, Illinois and other parts of the industrial Midwest. Article continues after sponsorship To unravel what caused the decline, the researchers tinkered with two variables \u2014 gross domestic product and the distribution of economic growth. In simulations, both stronger growth and more broadly distributed gains had positive effects \u2014 but the broader gains were far more influential. From the researchers' news release: \"When the economic growth rate was raised to the higher levels experienced in the 1940s and 1950s but the economic distribution mirrored today's highly uneven landscape, the estimated rate of absolute mobility rose to 62 percent. \"In contrast, when the economic growth rate was held at the low levels of 2 to 3 percent of recent decades, but the pieces of the economic pie were distributed more evenly as it was in the mid-20th century, then the fraction of children who ended up doing better than their parents climbed to 80 percent.\" \"The finding of this study implies that if we want to revive the American dream of increasing living standards across generations, then we'll need policies that foster more broadly shared growth,\" Chetty said. A map of the U.S. shows children's chances of moving from the bottom fifth of income levels to the top fifth. Equality of Opportunity Project hide caption toggle caption Equality of Opportunity Project A map of the U.S. shows children's chances of moving from the bottom fifth of income levels to the top fifth. Equality of Opportunity Project Results also vary depending on where children are raised. As their map of metro and rural areas in the U.S. shows, the researchers found large areas where kids had markedly better chances of moving from the bottom fifth of income levels to the top fifth. The study also found that children who are moved to a better environment get a sharp boost in their chance to reach economic success \u2014 and that the earlier such a move takes place, the greater the effect. Some cities have been able to buck the trend, with researchers citing Salt Lake City and Minneapolis as two places where children have a good chance to emerge from poverty. Such cities tend to share important qualities, the economists say: \"lower levels of residential segregation, a larger middle class, stronger families, greater social capital, and higher quality public schools.\" ",

Homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan are at right. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Obama has ordered the intelligence community to conduct a \"full review\" of \"malicious cyber activity\" timed to U.S. elections, the White House said Friday. The review will go all the way back to the 2008 campaign when China was found to have hacked both the Obama and McCain campaigns , White House spokesman Eric Schultz said at a Friday press briefing. Trump Faces A More Skeptical Public Than Any Incoming President Since 1989 In the 2016 election, U.S. intelligence officials charged that Russia had interfered. In early October, they released a strongly worded statement saying they were \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\" The statement went on to say \"these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" Shortly after that, WikiLeaks began posting emails hacked from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta's Gmail account. The slow drip of those emails, including transcripts of Clinton's remarks to Goldman Sachs, hung over the campaign in its closing weeks and proved embarrassing at times. Podesta said he spoke to the FBI about the hacking, and intelligence experts blamed Russia for that as well. Article continues after sponsorship Poll: Trump Needs To Choose Between Presidency And His Business \"We may be in, have crossed into a new threshold,\" said Lisa Monaco, the White House homeland security adviser, at a breakfast Friday morning hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, of the 2016 hacking. \"It is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after action, to understand what this means, what has happened and to impart those lessons learned, and that's what we're going to go about doing.\" Schultz said the review would look at \"all foreign actors and any attempt to interfere with our elections.\" He added, \"This isn't going to be a narrow dive; this is going to be a deep dive\" into this troubling pattern. He also noted the White House will aim to release as much of the review as it can appropriately to the public and will also brief Congress and other stakeholders. This news comes as Republican members of Congress are promising their own investigations into Russian hacking around the election. But all of that would be in direct conflict with the view of President-elect Donald Trump, who, in a debate earlier this year, questioned whether Russia was even behind it. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Moderate Democrats are not alone in their sense of urgency about honing a new economic message. After a stinging loss to Donald J. Trump, liberals in the party are also trying to figure out how to tap into the populist unrest that convulsed both parties in 2016. Only by making pocketbook issues the central focus, they say, can Democrats recover in the 2018 midterm elections and unseat Mr. Trump in 2020. \u201cWe need to double down and double down again on the importance of building an economy not just for those at the top, but for everyone,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a high-profile progressive who is seen as a leading potential opponent for Mr. Trump. This pocketbook-centered approach offers an added benefit in the minds of Democratic strategists: It papers over the party\u2019s differences on how much to focus on cultural issues. There is little appetite among most Democrats to substantively revise their stances on issues like abortion, gay rights, gun control and immigration, where trends on the national level continue to favor the party. By constructing a platform focused on an overarching theme of economic fairness, Democrats are hoping to avoid yoking their candidates to a more divisive agenda that could sink them in states like North Dakota and West Virginia, which are crucial to control of the Senate. This is markedly different from the approach that party leaders have taken over the last eight years, when President Obama defined the party from top to bottom with his personality and policies. Instead, Democrats intend to focus on a sparer agenda of bread-and-butter priorities that can win support from both liberal and moderate officeholders \u2014 and appeal to voters just as much in red states as along the two coasts. Photo Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic Senate leader, whose party is showing evidence of a more tightly focused agenda. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Beyond that, they expect wide variance in how officeholders handle Mr. Trump and his agenda, from moderates who seek out accommodation to blue-state leaders who pursue total war. Their emerging message is likely to focus on protecting Medicare and Social Security , attacking income inequality and political corruption, and blocking legislation that might restrict access to health care. The first salvo in the fight will be over Mr. Trump\u2019s pick of Representative Tom Price of Georgia, a vocal supporter of privatizing Medicare, as secretary of health and human services: The Democrats at Ms. Heitkamp\u2019s dinner discussed how to highlight and, potentially, block Mr. Price\u2019s appointment, according to an attendee. Many Democrats, especially those from the party\u2019s more liberal wing, see significant reasons for optimism about their political prospects in the medium and long terms. Though Mr. Trump prevailed in the Electoral College, he did so thanks to the slimmest of margins in three states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 and he lost the popular vote nationally by nearly three million votes . Advertisement Continue reading the main story With the country growing more urban and racially diverse, Democrats like their chances in the 2020 presidential race, when nonwhite voters are likely to make up more than 30 percent of the electorate for the first time in history. Even in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat, the country\u2019s changing hue helped her come closer than any Democrat in decades to flipping Arizona and Georgia, two traditional Republican bastions. But before the next presidential race, Democrats must navigate a treacherous landscape of midterm elections. They must defend 10 Senate seats in states Mr. Trump won, many of them in the Rust Belt and the West. And unless they break the Republican lock on state governments by winning governorships in a handful of big states, like Wisconsin and Ohio, they may be unable to prevent Republicans from continuing to draw congressional maps that favor their candidates. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a new member of the Democratic leadership team in the House, said he considered Mr. Trump an \u201cElectoral College president\u201d and cautioned Democrats not to overreact to his victory. But Mr. Jeffries agreed that Democrats must court \u201cblue-collar voters we lost, without abandoning our core constituencies and principles that made up the Obama coalition.\u201d\u2019 \u201cWe will not take back the majority,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said, \u201cunless we have a big-tent approach.\u201d At a meeting of House Democrats this past week, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the party did not have to move away from its liberal values or cease to be a party that \u201cwelcomes those who seem to have been left behind for a long time.\u201d But for Democrats to represent themselves as a \u201cparty of working people,\u201d Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan, who is weighing a bid for governor in 2018, said they would have to reorganize their message around issues that are \u201cfundamental to economic security,\u201d and await opportunities to exploit Mr. Trump\u2019s shortcomings. Evidence of a narrower, more tightly focused Democratic agenda was on display this past week at a Capitol Hill news conference, where a range of Democrats spoke beside scrubs-clad nurses and older voters holding up signs that read: \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to privatize.\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic Senate leader, warned gravely that Republicans were \u201cgearing up for a war on seniors.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, echoing the economic themes that propelled his White House bid and first drew Democratic attention to the potency of populism this year, vowed, \u201cWe are not going to allow the billionaire class or Trump or anybody else to cut the programs that the elderly, the disabled and disabled vets absolutely depend upon.\u201d Photo Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, both Democrats, on Capitol Hill this month. Ms. Warren is seen as a leading potential opponent for Mr. Trump. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times This effort to defend popular government programs appeals to all elements of the party and offers the promise of winning back some of the older white voters it has lost in recent elections. And it recalls the strategy Democrats turned to the last time they were trying to reclaim control of Congress when Republicans had full control of the government, and the left was united in opposition to President George W. Bush\u2019s attempted Social Security overhaul. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, the Democrats\u2019 fortunes may rest chiefly with Mr. Trump. If he shuns the lawmakers in his own party who want to overhaul entitlements such as Medicare and governs more as a populist than as a free-market conservative, it could complicate the Democratic comeback strategy. Outside Washington, some party leaders plan on taking the fight to Mr. Trump more immediately. Progressives in blue-state capitals appear primed to take a more combative approach, attacking Mr. Trump and obstructing him on issues important to liberal voters. These Democrats have already pledged to put up a front of resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, much as Republican governors and attorneys general did against Mr. Obama. Representative Xavier Becerra, who has been appointed the new attorney general of California, said leaders in the states would hold the line on policy where Democrats in Washington could not. \u201cOur role will principally be to defend the progress we have made in recent years,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. He pointed to a resolution the California State Legislature passed stating that \u201cCalifornia stands unified in rejecting the politics of hatred and exclusion\u201d and demanding that Mr. Trump \u201cnot pursue mass deportation strategies that needlessly tear families apart, or target immigrants for deportation based on vague and unjustified criteria.\u201d At a retreat for Democratic governors in New Orleans last weekend, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington argued forcefully that governors should send a message to the White House on health care, among other issues. \u201cThere is so much threatened in my state,\u201d Mr. Inslee said in an interview. \u201cWe will be engaged vigorously in making sure that the public understands what\u2019s going on and how damaging it can be.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But even liberals believe Democrats must work harder to compete for voters who lean to the right, if only to shave a few points off the Republican Party\u2019s margin of victory in rural America. In some cases, they said, that may mean embracing candidates who hold wildly different views from the national party on certain core priorities. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, said Democrats did not have to choose between supporting liberal policies and competing for conservative votes. But he seemed to imply that Democrats had made a mistake in 2016 by not working harder to win over skeptical voters. \u201cIn the presidential race, where there\u2019s just a much bigger playing field, there\u2019s a tendency to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m only going to get 35 percent, so I\u2019m not going to go there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cWell, the difference between 35 and 25 is big.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 11, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Centrists Place Economy First For Democrats.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 10, 2016 8:49 AM EST MANAMA, Bahrain -- U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Saturday that as many as 200 more American troops are being sent to Syria to help Kurdish and Arab fighters capture the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\u2019s key stronghold of Raqqa. Civilians risk it all to escape Aleppo The extra troops will include special operations forces and are in addition to 300 U.S. troops already authorized for the effort to recruit, organize, train and advise local Syrian forces to combat ISIS . Addressing a security conference in Bahrain, Carter said the aim is to create, along with America\u2019s Middle East allies, a tornado of pressure on ISIS\u2019 Raqqa headquarters, CBS Radio News\u2019 Larry Miller reports. \u201cThe United States has interests here that it cannot walk away from,\u201d Carter said.

Reuters/Rodi Said Carter also took gentle jabs at U.S. Middle East partners for failing to provide more military muscle in the broader campaign to defeat ISIS and counter extremism. Aleppo boy finally gets surgery, two weeks after he was hurt in airstrike Without mentioning any by name, Carter suggested the U.S. has been the target of disingenuous criticism from \u201cregional powers here in the Middle East\u201d for not doing more to help fight extremism. \u201cI would ask you to imagine what U.S. military and defense leaders think when they have to listen to complaints sometimes that we should do more, when it\u2019s plain to see that all too often, the ones complaining aren\u2019t doing enough themselves,\u201d he said. He said it is not unreasonable for Washington to expect regional powers who oppose extremism in the Middle East to do more to help fight it, \u201cparticularly in the political and economic aspects of the campaign.\u201d Carter noted that many Sunni-led Gulf countries have expressed concern about the spread of Iranian influence in the region. The Assad regime pushes to regain Aleppo heedless of trapped civilians \u201cThe fact is, if countries in the region are worried about Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities - a concern the United States shares - they need to get in the game. That means getting serious about starting to partner more with each other, and investing in the right capabilities for the threat.\u201d Carter said the 200 extra troops going to Syria will help local forces in their anticipated push to retake Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group\u2019s self-styled caliphate, and to deny sanctuary to ISIS after Raqqa is captured. He said President Obama approved the troop additions last week. \u201cThese uniquely skilled operators will join the 300 U.S. special operations forces already in Syria, to continue organizing, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces to take the fight to ISIL,\u201d Carter said in his address to the IISS Manama Dialogues in the Bahraini capital, using an alternative acronym for ISIS. Russian troops on the ground in Aleppo as civilians remain vulnerable \u201cBy combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we\u2019ve been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum,\u201d he said. The military push is complicated by the predominant role played by local Kurdish fighters, who are the most effective U.S. partner against ISIS in Syria but are viewed by Turkey -- a key U.S. ally -- as a terrorist threat. A senior defense official told The Associated Press the troop boost announced by Carter will give the U.S. extra capability to train Arab volunteers who are joining the Raqqa push but are not well trained or equipped. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of internal Pentagon planning. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Louisiana to Vote on Final US Senate Seat Today By MaryAlice Parks Dec 10, 2016, 5:29 AM ET 0 Shares Star Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump and Louisiana Treasurer and Republican Senate candidate John Kennedy wave at a get-out-the-vote rally, Dec. 9, 2016, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 0 Shares Email Voters in Louisiana will decide the final federal political contest of 2016 today, more than a month after Republicans secured control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Republicans currently hold 51 seats in the U.S. Senate and, should he win, Republican candidate John Kennedy would fill a crucial 52nd seat for close votes on controversial issues where every Republican member may not toe the party line. So far, Kennedy has enjoyed a double-digit lead in the polls. President-elect Donald Trump won the state handily in November and on Friday held a rally in the state backing Kennedy. Trump Takes Aim at China in Victory Tour Stop Louisiana votes in December because all contenders competed in a bipartisan primary first on Election Day and then the top two candidates advance to a separate runoff election. Kennedy received 25 percent of the vote to Campbell\u2019s 18 percent in the open primary on Election Day. Kennedy has been the state\u2019s treasurer since 2000 and has run twice unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate -- once in 2004 as a Democrat and again in 2008 as a Republican. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Foster Campbell is a longtime member of the Louisiana State Senate and the state\u2019s Public Service Commission. He lost a bid for governor in 2007. Campbell has enjoyed a boost in donations and support from volunteers phone-banking around the country, as Democrats look to his campaign as the last hope for narrowing Republicans\u2019 margin in the chamber. According to Campbell\u2019s federal campaign finance records, he raised significantly more money in the final stretch of the campaign than his competitor -- $2.5 million in the month. The exact makeup of the Senate may still be in flux after Saturday, however. Trump tapped Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as his first pick for attorney general and Trump is considering two moderate Democratic Senators -- Joe Manchin from West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota -- to fill other Cabinet positions. Two U.S. House seats are also up for grabs in Louisiana on Saturday, though Republicans already hold a tight grip on the lower chamber in Congress. 0 Shares ",

By Philip Bump December 10 at 2:58 PM Follow @pbump ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson is a potential nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) So far, President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives\u00a0or retired generals. In that context, it's probably less of a surprise that Trump may be close to selecting \u00a0ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state , elevating a dark-horse prospect who may surge past seasoned political actors like Mitt Romney and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) in the stretch. Tillerson's hardly an unknown character on the world stage, but he's probably not too familiar to Americans. As such, we've put together a brief profile of the man who may soon be in charge of the United States' international diplomacy. Tillerson has no experience in the public sector, a first in modern history for a potential secretary of state. Tillerson, 64, joined ExxonMobil in 1975 , after receiving a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas. He worked his way up through the ranks, beginning as a production engineer and becoming chairman and chief executive in 2006. Over his decades at the company, Tillerson's work took him all over the world, including to Yemen and Russia. That, along with his experience as CEO, apparently provides the basis of his familiarity with international diplomacy. On Twitter, a former ExxonMobil employee who is now at Brookings Institution defended Tillerson's experience. \u201cOil folks know stuff: anyone who manages multibillion dollar, multi-decade projects needs deep, nuanced understanding of political context,\u201d Suzanne Maloney wrote \u00a0on Twitter. \u201c\u2026 Tillerson rose to top of a company that prizes technical excellence, rock-solid financials, hard work and integrity. State could do a lot worse.\u201d Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. Tillerson's work with ExxonMobil included a stretch working for Exxon Neftegas Ltd., putting him in charge of the subsidiary's fields in Russia and the Caspian Sea. Two years before receiving the award, ExxonMobil won a contract to explore for oil in a Russia-controlled portion of the Arctic Ocean, which was made more economically viable for drilling in part thanks to the sea ice decline that's followed global warming. Putin himself announced the deal at a meeting in Sochi (where the Winter Olympics would be held the next year). Tillerson's stake in ExxonMobil will certainly raise questions at a confirmation hearing. Once Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the United States instituted sanctions against Russia that froze ExxonMobil's Arctic agreement. Were those sanctions to be lifted, the deal would probably move forward \u2014 making Tillerson's shares of ExxonMobil stock much more valuable. (The Wall Street Journal noted \u00a0that he'd probably have to divest from that stock if appointed to run the State Department.) Tillerson's position on climate change may be to the left of Trump's. ExxonMobil understood the connection between greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and the warming climate as early as 1977, according to recent reporting . It then proceeded to combat the idea, recognizing the risk posed to its industry by curtailing fossil fuel use. Only fairly recently did it acknowledge that link publicly, and the company is now on record in support of accepting the established science and identifying solutions to the problem of climate change. That shift happened under Tillerson's leadership. The issue of climate change will be a potent one for whoever takes over the State Department, given the long-standing international diplomacy efforts to address the issue. Shortly before this year's election, ExxonMobil issued a statement in support of the sweeping agreement reached in Paris at the end of last year aimed at cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions internationally. Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he opposed the Paris agreement and has regularly expressed his opposition to taking action to address climate change. Tillerson, as CEO, promoted positions contrary to that. His most recent personal comments echoed the sentiment of his company, calling the threat of climate change \u201creal\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d \u2014 though the extent to which he was speaking as a representative of ExxonMobil vs. his own views is worth asking. Tillerson is a lifelong Boy Scout. Tillerson was an Eagle Scout in his youth and eventually became president of the national organization. It was under his leadership \u2014 and through his advocacy \u2014 that the organization embraced the membership of young men who identified as gay. Tillerson's positions on a variety of other political issues are largely unknown. Climate change is central to what we know about Tillerson, thanks to the industry of his long-term employer. The Wall Street Journal noted \u00a0that Tillerson supports free trade \u2014 which, as a CEO of a major international corporation, is probably a\u00a0natural position. Beyond that, it's not clear where Tillerson's politics align with or differ from his possible boss's. His political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities. So it\u00a0probably isn't a surprise that... ... Tillerson originally supported Jeb Bush for president. He gave Bush the maximum allowable contribution in September 2015. politics ",

By Liz Sly December 10 at 3:08 PM Follow @LizSly BEIRUT \u2014 Islamic State militants fought their way back into the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra on Saturday nine months after they were driven out by Syrian government forces, in a reminder that the group is still a force to be reckoned with despite major losses of territory elsewhere. The advance into Palmyra seemed set to reverse a year of steady defeats for Islamic State fighters and came three days after a big offensive launched from three directions in the surrounding desert. Palmyra is the site of an ancient Roman complex of temples that is considered one of the world\u2019s archaeological treasures, and work had recently begun on restoring some of the many ruins that were blown up during the Islamic State\u2019s 10-month occupation of the city. It is also the one place where Russian military intervention had made a significant difference in the fight against the Islamic State. Russian airstrikes facilitated the Syrian government\u2019s recapture of Palmyra in March, and in May the Russian military escorted a planeload of journalists on a victory tour of the city, complete with a performance by a Russian orchestra. [ Russian delegation in Syria\u2019s ancient Palmyra marks liberation from Islamic State ] Syrian activists and human rights monitors said Islamic State fighters entered the city itself late afternoon Saturday after government defenses collapsed. A Syrian activist from Palmyra who uses the name Khaled al-Homsi said that by late evening, the militants controlled most of the city. Islamic State fighters were detaining young men and looting stores of weapons, he said. The offensive was aided by 200 Islamic State fighters who had made their way to the area from the Iraqi city of Mosul, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. With street fighting continuing, it remained unclear whether the militants would be able fully to recapture the city. Russia Today quoted a Syrian military official as saying the Syrian government still has forces inside Palmyra and has not fully lost control, despite what the official described as \u201cfierce clashes.\u201d The Islamic State has demonstrated a pattern in the past of launching spectacular attacks that catch its enemies unaware, only to be driven back once the defendants regroup. If the militants were to fully regain control of Palmyra, it would represent a startling reversal of 18 months of setbacks and suggest that the outright defeat of the group may still be a long way off. The Islamic State has not made any significant advances in either Syria or Iraq since it captured Palmyra and the Iraqi city of Ramadi in May 2015, and it has meanwhile lost vast swaths of territory in both countries, including Palmyra and Ramadi. The Palmyra advance coincides with a major U.S.-backed offensive by the Iraqi army for Mosul, where hopes for a swift victory are fading as the militants put up a stiff fight. They also still control large portions of Syria, including much of the vast eastern desert where Palmyra is located. The U.S. military announced Saturday that it was sending an additional 200 Special Operations troops to northern Syria to help the mostly Kurdish force that is battling the militants there. [ The splendors of Palmyra, the ancient Syrian city ravaged by the Islamic State ] The assault on Palmyra also comes as a further reminder that the Syrian army, despite substantial gains against rebel forces in recent weeks, is thinly spread, suffering from shortages of manpower and weary after more than five years of war. The rebel-held eastern portion of Aleppo seems poised to be recaptured soon by government troops, which are being aided by Iranian advisers, Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, and Russian airstrikes. The government has also been making less-publicized advances against anti-government rebels around the capital, Damascus. But in a pattern that has become typical throughout Syria\u2019s five-year war, gains on one front have meant drawing down troops on another, leaving government positions exposed. The militants had sliced through government lines in recent days, capturing some of Syria\u2019s most important gas fields and sending government soldiers running for their lives. One video posted Friday by the Islamic State showed about a dozen Syrian soldiers fleeing through the desert as militants fired on them with heavy machine guns. Another posted Saturday showed them overrunning Syrian government sniper positions in the desert outside the city, kicking at the dead bodies of Syrian soldiers and sifting through the tents they had been living in. Zakaria Zakaria in Istanbul and Louisa Loveluck in Beirut contributed to this report. Read more: ",

    "text": "Workers at Endangered Indiana Plant Feel Forgotten by Trump By tom davies, associated press HUNTINGTON, Ind. \u0097 Dec 10, 2016, 3:49 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Mike Harmon, of Huntington, Ind., poses outside his union's meeting hall in Huntington, Ind., Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. Harmon, whose wife also works at the factory, said it's his third factory closing. He's worried he won't find anything close to the $17 an hour United Technologies provides. The couple has two children in college and two in high school and is doing what he called \"major couponing\" and cutting back on non-necessities. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) 0 Shares Email A full parking lot and 50-hour workweeks belie the anxiety at the United Technologies-owned factory outside a small northeastern Indiana city, where Mike Harmon and co-workers wonder whether they aren't just stockpiling parts for when the company sends their 700 jobs to Mexico. Their situation has gained scant attention compared to the sister Carrier Corp. factory two hours away in Indianapolis, which became a rallying cause against plant closures during the presidential campaign and where President-elect Donald Trump intervened to stem some \u2014 not all \u2014 job losses. \"I don't think they look at us, being from a small town ...\" said Harmon, a 44-year-old Huntington native who's worked at the factory for seven years. \"The whole time during the campaign he talked Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indianapolis, never heard one word about Huntington.\" It's a perceived slight that stings in a county where 72 percent voted for Trump and manufacturing makes up about one-fifth of all jobs. On Dec. 1, Trump and Vice President-elect/Indiana Gov. Mike Pence touted Trump's role in Carrier deciding to reverse about 800 planned job cuts at the Indianapolis plant \u2014 a move that also provides United Technologies $7 million in state incentives. Neither they nor company CEO Greg Hayes mentioned the Huntington plant or discussed the some 500 Carrier jobs still being lost. Employees at the United Technologies Electronic Controls factory in Huntington say they've been working mostly seven days a week since late October, making control panels for the furnace, air conditioning and refrigeration industries. Leaders of their union believe the company is doing so ahead of the factory's layoffs expected to start in April and continue into 2018. But Connecticut-based United Technologies said in a statement that its plans haven't changed. It declined a request to interview a company executive. Hayes has cited a belief that the Trump administration will cut corporate taxes and stem business regulations. Nationwide, the U.S. Labor Department has issued over 1,600 approvals for layoffs or plant closings since 2015 as a result of shifting production overseas or competition from imports, according to the American Alliance of Manufacturing. Indiana has one of the nation's most manufacturing-dependent economies even though it has lost 144,000 such jobs, or 22 percent, since 2000. Trump has warned he'll impose a 35 percent tariff on goods imported by companies that outsource production, and a week ago on Twitter ripped plans by Milwaukee-based Rexnord to close a 300-worker Indianapolis bearings factory in another production shift to Mexico. But it isn't clear whether Trump intends to keep personally intervening in corporate decisions. Three days after the Carrier factory trip, Pence told ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump will \"make those decisions on a day-by-day basis in the course of the transition, in the course of the administration.\" Government leaders have long been involved in cutting deals with corporations, according to Scott Paul, president of the American Alliance for Manufacturing. \"It is a fact of life in the real world. Governors engage in economic development on a regular basis, usually they are trying to attract jobs,\" he said. \"Countries do the same thing every day.\" Some Huntington workers are upset over the tax incentives for a company that also owns Pratt & Whitney \u2014 a big supplier of fighter jet engines that relies in part on U.S. military contracts. Bob Breedlove, a 60-year-old who's worked at the plant for a decade, voted for Trump and still thinks he's the right person, even though he's \"not crazy about this deal.\" \"My tax dollars are going to save them, but they aren't going to help save my job,\" Breedlove said. \"I know how much money this company makes, they don't need our help to stay in business and make a profit.\" Manufacturing jobs are a valuable part of Huntington County's economy, with average annual pay topping $57,000 in 2015, according to the Indiana Business Research Center. That's nearly 50 percent more than the county's overall average earnings. The United Technologies factory, which draws employees from several nearby communities, is seen as stable employment. Tucked along a bypass of the 17,000-person city and surrounded by miles of farmland, it recently seemed to be the busiest of the 10 or so businesses in an industrial park. Rouie Hawkins met her husband, Ford, at the factory. They're both still there but have a Plan B: He's making plans to start a used-car business and she's weighing whether to take advantage of the union's severance agreement for reimbursement toward up to four years of college. \"I'll be 50 soon and I worry about even if I go back to school, then I'll be in my mid 50s when I finish a degree and who's going to want to hire me,\" Hawkins said. Harmon, whose wife also works at the factory, said it's his third factory closing. He's worried he won't find anything close to the $17 an hour United Technologies provides. The couple has two children in college and two in high school and is doing what he called \"major couponing\" and cutting back on non-necessities. \"I've told my family that 'You've got DirectTV right now.

In photographs on social media, smoke was seen rising from behind the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium, known as Besiktas Stadium, after the local team and neighborhood. At least 20 people wounded by an explosion outside a football stadium in #Istanbul - Turkish interior minister says https://t.co/qNoFuHdMw3 \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) December 10, 2016 The blasts struck hours after the end of a match between two of Turkey's top teams, Reuters reported, quoting Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The first and larger explosion took place about 10:30 p.m. after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Officials gave no immediate details on the nature of the second explosion, which sounded like it came from the same area. \"A terrorist attack has been carried out against our security forces and our citizens. It has been understood that the explosions after the Besiktas-Bursaspor football game aimed to maximise casualties. As a result of these attacks unfortunately we have martyrs and wounded,\" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying it was a \"cruel plot.\" Soylu also said he would give a statement about the death toll later. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Istanbul has been the site of attacks attributed to ISIS and also to Kurdish militants in the last year.\u00a0 \u201cIt is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left,\u201d the Associated Press quoted Soylu as informing Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency. \u201cWe have no information on the number of dead. God willing we hope there won't be any. The wounded are police.\u201d Turkish Transport Minister Ahmet Arslan called the attack an act of terrorism on Twitter, Reuters reported.\u00a0 Armed police sealed off streets around the Vodafone Arena, home to the Besiktas soccer team. Related Image Turkish police officers block roads leading to where Saturday night's bombing took place (AP) Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Bursaspor said none of the wounded were fans and issued a statement saying \"we wish a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\" Witnesses said police were deployed and had cordoned off the area as smoke rose from the newly built stadium. Related Image Turkish police officer blocks off roads leading to where Saturday night's bombing took place (AP) They said gunfire could be heard in what appeared to have been an armed attack on police. Images broadcast on television showed more than a dozen ambulances on a street hugging the stadium and a police helicopter flying overhead with its search lights on. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin had been notified, the agency said. The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Dec 10, 2016 12:10 PM EST CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Prosecutors are using Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof\u2019s own words to portray him as a cruel angry racist at his\u00a0 death penalty trial . Roof\u2019s two-hour confession \u00a0on video to killing nine people at a church Bible study, recorded the day after the shooting, was introduced as evidence Friday, along with a handwritten journal found in his car. \u201cHow could our faces, skin color and body structure be so different, but our brains exactly the same?\u201d Roof wrote in one of the less offensive passages.\u00a0 Prosecutors play confession tape in Charleston church shooting trial In the video, Roof laughed repeatedly and made exaggerated gun motions as he described the massacre. He wanted to leave at least one person alive to tell what happened, he explained, complaining that his victims \u201ccomplicated things\u201d by hiding under tables. He thought about shooting drug dealers, but they might shoot back, he said. Instead, Roof told the FBI, he picked the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015 because there likely wouldn\u2019t be white people there, and the people he chose to slaughter were more likely to be meek. \u201cI knew that would be a place to get a small amount of black people in one area,\u201d Roof said, later adding, \u201cThey\u2019re in church. They weren\u2019t criminals or anything.\u201d\u00a0 Surveillance video from the day of the attack in June 2015 showed people walking into the church. Then, in walks Roof, carrying a 45 Glock pistol and seven magazines. Once inside, he opened fire as the faithful rose and closed their eyes to pray. Malcolm Graham, whose 54-year-old sister Cynthia Hurd was murdered, spoke to CBS News . \u201cThis was an attack on a race of people and an attack on the Christian church and an attack on humanity,\u201d Graham said. In Roof\u2019s confession video, an FBI agent asked Roof, \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d \u201cI had to do it because somebody had to,\u201d Roof said. \u201cBlacks are raping and killing white people on the streets every day... What I did is still minuscule to what they\u2019re doing to white people every day.\u201d Roof\u2019s lawyers have conceded that he carried out the attack, and are focused on persuading jurors to spare his life in the penalty phase of the trial. They said in opening statements they will call few or no witnesses. Testimony continues next week, and prosecutors said they may rest their case Wednesday.\u00a0 Along with the overt racism, Roof\u2019s confession and notes show the then-21-year-old as naive and immature. He wrote a note apologizing to his mother and saying \u201cas childish as it sounds, I wish I was in your arms.\u201d But Roof meticulously prepared for the shootings. He carried eight magazines that could each hold 13 rounds, but loaded only 11 each so that he could shoot 88 times. That\u2019s a revered number among white supremacists, standing for \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet. At one point, an agent asked if Roof had thought about killing more blacks. \u201cOh, no. I was worn out,\u201d Roof said. Roof said he left bullets in a magazine so that he could kill himself after the slayings, but changed his mind when he didn\u2019t immediately see any police. He apparently hadn\u2019t heard the news during his 17 hours on the run. About 45 minutes into his interview with the FBI, an agent decided to tell him that nine people were dead. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even that many people in there,\u201d Roof said incredulously. \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d The video is blurry, making it hard to see Roof\u2019s facial expressions. After being told the details, an agent asked how he felt. \u201cWell, it makes me feel bad,\u201d said Roof, who earlier in the confession estimated he might have killed five. Agents asked Roof why he chose Emanuel AME. He said it\u2019s because he saw it described online as the oldest black church in the South. Survivor Felicia Sanders testified that said Roof sat through the Bible study beside pastor Clementa Pinckney, and opened fire as the rest of the group of 12 closed their eyes for a final prayer. \u201cI was sitting there thinking about whether I should do it or not. That\u2019s why I sat there for 15 minutes. I could have walked out,\u201d Roof said. Church surveillance videos indicate Roof was actually inside for about 45 minutes. Roof also said the killing of Trayvon Martin was a turning point in his life. Martin, a young unarmed black man, was killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting. Roof said he started researching black crime against whites on the internet. He told the agents he didn\u2019t talk about his racist beliefs with his friends or family: \u201cThey probably won\u2019t agree with me - you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Roof hardly looked up as his confession played, mostly shuffling papers in front of him, as he has through much of the trial. In the recording, he told FBI agents he could never look at the families of his victims. And throughout the trial , he has not looked at the dozens of relatives in the courtroom. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Holloway will be crowned UFC interim featherweight champion if he wins, while Pettis is ineligible for that distinction because he failed to make weight. Get updates on that fight as well as the entire undercard here. Dec. 10, 2016, 4:47 p.m. Mitch Gagnon vs. Matthew Lopez live round-by-round coverage Todd Martin Mitch Gagnon is a solid Canadian veteran who has won four of his last five with his only setback to former champion Renan Barao. He is a ground specialist. Lopez was undefeated headed into his UFC debut but is now 8-1 and looking to rebound in his second UFC contest. Dec. 10, 2016, 4:34 p.m. John Makdessi vs. Lando Vannata live round-by-round coverage Todd Martin With a distinct striking style, the Canadian Makdessi\u00a0was once thought to be a potential future star. However, his Octagon performances have been up and down and he's now in the position of veteran gatekeeper for new rising stars. Lando Vannata\u00a0made his UFC debut on short notice against elite lightweight Tony Ferguson and gave Ferguson all he could handle before succumbing to a D'Arce choke. Now there's much curiosity as to how Vannata will do with full camps and not thrown in against the best of the best. Round 1. Vannata starts out with a series of kicks from different angles. Makdessi, also very comfortable with kicks, is concentrating more on his boxing. Vannata knocks Makdessi out with a beautiful wheel kick. Winner: Lando Vannata, KO, round 1. Vannata's remarkable introduction to the UFC continues. After a tremendous war with Tony Ferguson, one of the top lightweights in the world, he scored a spectacular highlight reel knockout that they'll be playing before his fights for years. The question is now what level of opposition to match him with, whether he will be given time to compete against softer opposition or if he'll be deemed worthy of more top 10 opposition sooner rather than later. Dec. 10, 2016, 4:07 p.m. Rustam Khabilov vs. Jason Saggo live round-by-round coverage Todd Martin Rustam Khabilov is another in a stream of Dagestani MMA fighters who are having great success abroad. He is 6-2 in the UFC including wins over Norman Parke and Jorge Masvidal. He missed weight for this fight. Jason Saggo is a Canadian fighter who gets to fight in his home country tonight. He is 3-1 thus far in the UFC but Khabilov is a significant step up in competition for him. Khabilov is a sizeable betting favorite in this bout. Round 1. Khabilov comes out putting a lot of power into his punches while Saggo is more measured with his strikes. Saggo mixes in some low kicks. Khabilov\u00a0connects with a couple of power punches and then capitalizes on that advantage by slamming Saggo\u00a0down with two minutes left in the round. Khabilov isn't landing much of anything from the top. Saggo meanwhile mostly just holds on from the bottom. Khabilov lands a few punches from the bottom. The announcers praise Saggo for using the rubber guard to neutralize Khabilov\u00a0at the end, but without threatening any submissions or doing any damage himself, lying for two minutes on one's back isn't likely to win over the judges. 10-9 Khabilov. Round 2. Saggo is walking down Khabilov in the second. He connects with a nice straight punch. The pace is measured. Khabilov gets a takedown right around the same point he did in the first round, with two minutes left. Saggo looks for an omoplata or triangle but can't get it. As Khabilov gets out, Saggo stands back up. As Saggo stands up, Khabilov\u00a0attacks aggressively and lands a series of big punches that appear to hurt Saggo. It's easily the biggest offense of the fight. Khabilov gets another takedown at the close of the round. 10-9 Khabilov. Round 3. The third round begins like the first two with a slow pace. Saggo is doing a terrible job of capitalizing on these moments of opportunity before Khabilov makes his big offensive pushes. After very little action in the first half, Khabilov explodes again with a takedown and puts Saggo on his back. Khabilov drops some elbows from the top. Saggo gets up late but Khabilov takes him right back down. 10-9 Khabilov, 30-27 Khabilov. Winner: Rustam Khabilov, unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27). That was Khabilov's UFC career in a nutshell. He demonstrated he is a force to be reckoned with, but not a fighter that provides the sort of entertainment that fans want to see. As such, he's stuck in mostly low profile positions despite his considerable skill. Dec. 10, 2016, 3:27 p.m. Zach Makovsky vs. Dustin Ortiz live round-by-round coverage Todd Martin UFC 206 will kick off with a flyweight bout between Zach Makovsky and Dustin Ortiz. Makovsky is the former Bellator bantamweight champion. He is 3-3 in the UFC but his losses have been to elite opposition: Jussier Formiga, John Dodson and Joseph Benavidez. Ortiz fits a similar mold. He is 4-4 in the UFC and like Makovsky has fallen short against the best in the division: Formiga, Benavidez, John Moraga and Wilson Reis.\u00a0 Round 1. After some feeling out in the standup, Ortiz clinches and looks for a takedown. They grapple up against the cage. Neither man can get an advantage and they separate. Ortiz gets a takedown and takes control of Makovsky's back. Makovsky scrambles out and takes top position. Ortiz works his way back up to his feet and lands some punches and knees to the body in the clinch. Makovsky gets a takedown with 30 seconds left and looks for an armbar. He can't get it and Ortiz takes top position. Ortiz lands a few punches from the top as the round ends. 10-9 Ortiz. Round 2. They clinch again by the cage. Ortiz like in the first is pushing the action more. Ortiz takes Makovsky down momentarily but Makovsky gets right back up. Ortiz gets another takedown and appears to have Makovsky secured better but Makovsky threatens with a heel hook. Ortiz gets out of that and locks Makovsky in a body triangle to control Makovsky's back. It's the most advantageous position for either fighter yet in the fight. Makovsky is able to work his way out and return to the feet. Makovsky then takes Ortiz down. Ortiz won't settle for that position and works to take the top. Makovsky prevents that and they end up back on their feet. 10-9 Ortiz. Round 3. Makovsky shoots in for a single leg and gets Ortiz down. Ortiz grabs a guillotine choke in the process but can't do much with it. Makovsky ends up in Ortiz's butterfly guard. Ortiz elevates with the butterfly hooks and stands back up. Once again they battle for a takedown. Makovsky gets it briefly. Ortiz threatens with a kimura and works his way back up. Ortiz gets a takedown and attempts to move into full mount. He can't do so and Makovsky\u00a0gets back up. Ortiz goes for a high kick and Makovsky takes the opportunity to slam Ortiz down. Ortiz deftly transitions into top position at the close. 10-9 Ortiz, 30-27 Ortiz. Winner: Dustin Ortiz, split decision (29-28, 28-29, 29-28). Makovsky was probably fortunate that the scorecards were that close. It was a competitive fight throughout but Ortiz generally was getting the better of the scrambles and controlling the action. It wasn't a thrilling contest but a quality win for Ortiz against a game opponent. Dec. 10, 2016, 3:11 p.m. ",

Email Who is Rex Tillerson, the CEO, president and chairman of Exxon Mobil Corp. that has emerged as the distinct front-runner in the race to be President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state? The 64-year-old executive is the head of the largest oil company in the world. It operates in dozens of countries -- including Russia, which has sparked controversy recently for the Kremlin\u2019s alleged involvement in the U.S. elections -- and has oil and natural gas interests on six continents. Tillerson began his career at Exxon in 1975 as an engineer. (He graduated with a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas in Austin). Eventually, he worked his way up through the ranks to become president and join the Board of Directors in 2004. He was made CEO two years later.\u00a0 Rex Tillerson, chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, testifies about the company\u2019s acquisition of XTO Energy before the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington January 20, 2010.\u00a0 REUTERS The Texas native, a multi-millionaire, has experience entirely in the private sector, with no past work in government. But Tillerson, as the chief of one of the most valuable publicly traded energy corporations, certainly knows his way around international deal-making. His money, Texas swagger and board room moxie (in 2008 he defeated an attempt to separate the chairman and CEO titles he held) are all qualities that Mr. Trump admires and respects. Earlier this week on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Mr. Trump called Tillerson a \u201cgreat, great gentleman\u201d who had built a \u201ctremendous company...with great style.\u201d In a clip from an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that was released Saturday, Mr. Trump also called Tillerson a \u201cworld-class player.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of a - an oil company that\u2019s pretty much double the size of its next nearest competitor. It\u2019s been a company that\u2019s been unbelievably managed,\u201d the president-elect said.\u00a0 Tillerson, however, could face significant pushback during a Senate confirmation hearing for his significant business connections to Russia and for his potential conflicts of interest. Here are the key things to know about Tillerson:\u00a0 Business ties to Russia If Tillerson is nominated, the oil executive may face further scrutiny before the Senate because of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 Tillerson and Putin met in the 1990s when Tillerson worked for Exxon in Russia during Boris Yeltsin\u2019s presidency and Putin worked for Yeltsin\u2019s KGB with an eye toward Russian economic revitalization. Tillerson, in the \u201890s, was president of Exxon Neftegas Limited, which operated the Sakhalin-1 project, located in far eastern Russia. In 2011, Tillerson negotiated Exxon access to drilling rights in the Arctic. As part of the deal, Russia\u2019s state-owned oil company, Rosneft, became an investor in Exxon global operations, specifically concessions. In 2014, U.S. sanctions against Russia put the brakes on the deal. Tillerson has spoken out repeatedly in general terms against economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and European Union after the incursion and subsequent seizure of Crimea in Ukraine. At Putin\u2019s behest, the Kremlin conferred on Tillerson Russia\u2019s\u00a0 Order of Friendship in 2013 . The state decoration rewards foreign nationals whose work has been aimed at bettering relations with Moscow. John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where Tillerson is a board member, noted to the Wall Street Journal recently that the Exxon chief has had significant contact with the Russian president.\u00a0 \u201cHe has had more interactive time with Vladimir Putin than probably any other American with the exception of Henry Kissinger,\u201d Hamre, who was also a former deputy defense secretary under President Clinton, told the Journal. Mr. Trump acknowledged Tillerson\u2019s connections to Russia in his interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d noting them as positive qualifications.\u00a0 \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players. And he knows them well,\u201d the president-elect said in the clip released Saturday. \u201cHe does massive deals in Russia, he does massive deals for the company. Not for himself. For the company.\u201d Conflicts of interest Tillerson, whose career at Exxon spans over four decades, also holds 2.5 million shares of the oil company\u2019s stock. About 1.8 million of these shares are not vested and cannot be sold now, leading to questions over what the oil executive can do to avoid conflicts of interest as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Climate change stance Tillerson himself is not a climate change skeptic, publicly calling the threat \u201creal\u201d and \u201cserious.\u201d But Exxon is being probed by several state attorneys general for allegedly misleading the public on climate change. Exxon has denied the charges.\u00a0 In the case of the New York attorney general\u2019s office, the company is also under investigation for its accounting practices, particularly on the issue of not writing down the value of its assets. \u201cOur results are in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards of the SEC\u201d and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an Exxon spokesman told the Reuters news agency. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

President-elect Donald Trump attends the 117th Army-Navy football game with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in Baltimore on Dec. 10, 2016. (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Tensions between Donald Trump and U.S. intelligence officials boiled over Saturday\u00a0as Trump's transition team mockingly compared a\u00a0secret CIA assessment that Russia\u00a0tried to sway the U.S. election in Trump's favor to\u00a0the agency\u2019s historic\u00a0misjudgments on Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction.\u00a0\u00a0 The widening public rift\u00a0between the incoming president and the\u00a0nation\u2019s powerful intelligence community\u00a0could pose high-risk problems both\u00a0for his administration and for national security. \u00a0 CIA leaders at agency headquarters in Langley, Va., are bracing for a potentially adversarial relationship with Trump\u2019s White House, especially over what the spy agency sees as Russia\u2019s malign role on multiple\u00a0fronts, according to two officials who requested anonymity in speaking about internal discussions. \u201cIt sets up one of the great crises in the history of the executive branch,\u201d said Glenn Carle, a former senior CIA officer who spent more than two decades as a spy before retiring in 2007. \u201cAll the agency can do short of insurrection is to present the facts when allowed to the executive we serve.\u201d Trump has received only a handful of classified intelligence briefings since his upset victory last month,\u00a0and CIA officials now believe it is because Trump has rejected their assessments\u00a0on Moscow\u2019s\u00a0aggression in Ukraine, its pressure on\u00a0Eastern Europe and its computer hacks\u00a0to boost\u00a0Trump's chances against Hillary Clinton . CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals... The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals... (Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller) Some compared the current tensions\u00a0to the distrust that marked relations with Vice President Dick Cheney before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, when he was widely seen as cherry-picking raw intelligence and pushing\u00a0agency analysts\u00a0to support his views. President Nixon had a famously frosty relationship with the CIA, which he considered too powerful and too\u00a0independent. President Clinton\u2019s\u00a0first CIA director, R. James Woolsey, was so disliked in the White House that he could barely get an appointment to see the president.\u00a0 Still, no other\u00a0incoming president has publicly\u00a0rejected\u00a0a major CIA\u00a0assessment about a\u00a0security threat, or declined regular classified briefings from officials representing\u00a0America\u2019s $70-billion-a-year global espionage and surveillance\u00a0apparatus.\u00a0 Nor has a transition team issued a statement\u00a0like the one it emailed\u00a0Saturday after the Washington Post reported that the CIA had concluded\u00a0that Russian President\u00a0 Vladimir Putin \u2019s government had authorized the hacking and leaking of Democratic Party emails this year in a deliberate effort to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Trump\u2019s chances.\u00a0 \u00a0\"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said, referring to the\u00a0misjudgments and mistakes used to justify the invasion of Iraq, a systemic intelligence failure that badly tarnished the\u00a0CIA\u2019s reputation. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. \u2014 Trump transition team on reports of Russian interference to help them win the 2016 election The Trump team\u2019s\u00a0statement went on to say that the Nov. 8 election \u201cended a long time ago in one of the biggest electoral college victories in history,\u201d a claim that is untrue.\u00a0 Eight of the 12 most recent presidential\u00a0elections\u00a0have been decided with a larger electoral college victory. And unlike most elections, Trump lost the popular vote.\u00a0 Inside the CIA, career analysts have been mystified by Trump\u2019s repeated dismissal of evidence that Russia hacked into Democratic National Committee emails and copied communications from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\u00a0 There are also\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Trump\u2019s pick for national security advisor, retired three-star Army Gen.\u00a0 Michael Flynn , whom the Obama administration\u00a0fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\u00a0 Flynn\u2019s tenure there was rocky, in part because he ordered aides to chase pet theories that quickly became known as\u00a0\u201cFlynn facts,\u201d since they were not grounded in reality. Trump\u2019s choice to run the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), an aerospace entrepreneur and former Army officer, could get caught in the middle.\u00a0 ",

ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, shown here on March 27, 2015. (Evan Vucci/AP) Steven Mufson, Philip Rucker, Carol MorelloThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil who has worked extensively around the globe and built relationships with such leaders as Russian President Vladimir Putin, as his secretary of state, three people close to the transition team confirmed Saturday. Tillerson's nomination could face intense scrutiny in the Senate considering his years of work in Russia on behalf of the multinational petroleum company and his close ties to Putin. Already, two leading Republican hawks, Sens. John McCain (Arizona) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina), have voiced concerns about Tillerson serving as the nation's top diplomat. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday that there would be no official announcement until this coming week \"at the earliest.\" But three officials briefed on Trump's deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that the pick would be Tillerson barring a late shift in Trump's thinking. NBC News first reported that Trump has settled on Tillerson. Trump spent a month deliberating over the secretary of state position and interviewed an array of candidates, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and onetime critic who was the face of the Republican resistance to Trump's candidacy. Donald Trump Patrick Semansky / AP President-elect Donald Trump greets Army Cadets and Navy Midshipmen before the Army-Navy NCAA college football game in Baltimore, Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016. President-elect Donald Trump greets Army Cadets and Navy Midshipmen before the Army-Navy NCAA college football game in Baltimore, Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016. (Patrick Semansky / AP) The president-elect settled on Tillerson because he projects gravitas, is regarded as a skillful manager and personally knows many foreign heads of state through his dealings on behalf of the energy giant, people close to Trump said. In an excerpt of an interview with Fox News, which will be aired in full Sunday, Trump praised Tillerson, though did not reveal his decision. \"He's much more than a business executive; he's a world-class player,\" Trump said. \"He knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia - for the company, not for himself.\" Tillerson's nomination would fit the pattern of other Trump appointments, installing a wealthy business leader with little experience in policymaking. But Tillerson, 64, has spent much of his career dealing with the complexities of one of the world's biggest enterprises, spanning six continents and about six dozen nations. The company's deep ties to Russia would potentially serve Tillerson well given Trump's desire to repair relations with the Kremlin. But Tillerson's close relationship with Vladimir Putin could also become a flashpoint during confirmation hearings, especially in light of a recent CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. \"Few corporate titans are closer to Putin than Tillerson,\" said Jason Bordoff, founder of Columbia University's center for global energy. So far, President-elect Donald Trump 's Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives or retired generals. In that context, it's probably less of a surprise that Trump is expected to select Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, elevating... So far, President-elect Donald Trump 's Cabinet picks have mostly been either multimillionaire and billionaire executives or retired generals. In that context, it's probably less of a surprise that Trump is expected to select Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, elevating... (Philip Bump) During the 1990s, Tillerson oversaw an Exxon project on Russia's Sakhalin island and developed a working relationship with Putin. In 2011, the company signed an agreement with the state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, to work jointly on oil exploration and development in the Arctic and Siberia. After inking the deal in New York, Tillerson and Rosneft chairman and Putin confidante Igor Sechin dined on caviar at the luxury Manhattan restaurant Per Se, according to one account. The next day they gave oil analysts black pens with the date of the agreement engraved in gold. Two years later, the Kremlin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, honoring foreigners. \"I don't know the man much at all, but let's put it this way: If you received an award from the Kremlin, [an] order of friendship, then we're gonna have some talkin',\" Graham said. \"We'll have some questions. I don't want to prejudge the guy but that's a bit unnerving.\" Exxon discovered oil in a well it drilled in the Kara Sea, but the joint partnership was put on ice after Russian intervention in Ukraine and annexation of the Crimea led to international economic sanctions. As secretary of state, Tillerson, who has been critical of the sanctions, would be in a position to argue for an easing them, which could allow Exxon to resume operations. \"Russia is critical for Exxon,\" said Fadel Gheit, oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. \"Not only for how much production it has there, but the potential growth is huge.\" He said once sanctions are lifted, \"Exxon will go back to develop the Arctic business at a rapid pace.\" Tillerson and former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney were two of the finalists, along with former New... ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson has emerged as the top candidate for secretary of state, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. Tillerson and former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney were two of the finalists, along with former New... (Abby Phillip) As Secretary of State, which takes the lead in international climate talks, the oil industry veteran could also play a role in unwinding U.S. commitments under the recent Paris accord. \"The closest thing we have to a secretary of State outside government is the CEO of Exxon,\" Robert McNally, president of the consulting firm Rapidan Group and a director for energy at President George W. Bush's national security council. Because ExxonMobil invests in huge, long-term projects, it is concerned \"by nature with enduring interests, vulnerabilities, and opportunities,\" McNally said. His selection ends one of the most high-profile contests for a top cabinet post, whose losing candidates included former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, Romney and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. Tillerson has spent his entire working life at ExxonMobil after earning a civil engineering degree and joining the company in 1975. His career has taken him from Oklahoma and Texas to Yemen and Russia, and as ExxonMobil's top executive he has cultivated relationships, meeting regularly with world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Saudi oil minister, and the emir of Qatar. He will retire with a nest egg of about $300 million including stock options and pension benefits. Yet Tillerson's track record - during a decade in which crude oil prices lurched from under $30 to nearly $150 a barrel - has been mixed. The company has managed some of the world's biggest infrastructure projects often in forbidding locations, but it has spent heavily on share buybacks and has borrowed heavily to maintain both capital spending and dividend payments. Wall Street analysts say it overpaid for XTO, a domestic shale gas company, and it has failed to meet the production targets Tillerson himself set. In April, Standard & Poor's downgraded the company's gold-plated triple A credit rating to double A plus, the first time Exxon had lost its triple A rating since the advent of color television and the communists took over China. Moreover, Tillerson's career with ExxonMobil isn't seen as an asset by environmentalists. The company has become a target of environmental groups that allege the company's scientists knew about the impact the use of fossil fuels was having on climate change, and that the company suppressed internal research rather than sharing it with investors and the public. The New York and Massachusetts attorneys general have issued broad subpoenas to ascertain whether ExxonMobil's failure to disclose that information violated Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. ExxonMobil has fought back, persuading a Texas federal court to order that ExxonMobil could do discovery, depose the Massachusetts attorney general and search her internal emails and documents for any signs that she acted out of \"bad faith.\" \"Covering up climate science and deceiving investors qualifies you for federal investigation, not federal office,\" May Boeve, executive director of the climate group 350.org said in a statement. \"An oil baron as Secretary of State would do enormous damage.\" When Tillerson took the helm at ExxonMobil a decade ago, he was seen as moderating the company's position on climate change. Whereas his predecessor opposed any action on climate change, Tillerson said in 2009 that he favored a carbon tax and proposed an initial price \"somewhere north of $20\" a ton. And he reduced ExxonMobil's own emissions. Under Tillerson, ExxonMobil also curtailed funding for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, whose energy and climate expert Myron Ebell played down the extent of climate change and said that no action was needed. Ebell has been the head of the Trump transition team on environmental issues. Yet Tillerson still insisted that oil use was essential. He chaired the American Petroleum Institute, which hammered on the idea that jobs were at stake. \"To say that you're addicted to oil and natural gas seems to me to say you're addicted to economic growth,\" he once told Fortune magazine. Exxon has important relationships with countries other than Russia, most notably the Middle East. It relies on Saudi Arabia for oil supplies and is a partner in refinery projects. It has enormous liquefied natural gas export projects in Qatar. It has also managed to carry out exploration and production ventures in both Kurdistan and southern Iraq, transcending rivalries between Baghdad and the Kurds. But under Tillerson, Exxon has also walked away from some countries. It left Venezuela after contract disputes with the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and it ended its onshore operations in Nigeria, where local insurgents sabotaged infrastructure. Tillerson said later that \"you have to be willing to say 'no, we aren't going to do it that way...if we can't do it this way, we won't be here.'\" Within the oil industry, ExxonMobil has been regarded as the most button-downed company, conservative and sometimes arrogant. \"Rex is a very, very, very honorable man,\" said Gheit, who is also one of his critics. \"He is smart, level headed. He has tremendous resolve and very strong character.\" Tillerson was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, the son of a Boy Scout administrator. He still lists the rank of Eagle Scout on his resume, and he has remained active in the organization throughout his life. In 2012, he was instrumental in pushing the Boy Scouts board to admit openly gay youths. The Exxon chief also chaired the $50 million campaign to restore Washington's Fords Theatre, where President Lincoln was assassinated. ExxonMobil and Qatar were major donors. In confirmation hearings, Tillerson can also expect to face tough questions about his views on international pipelines such as the Keystone XL, which require State Department approval. He'll also be quizzed on climate change. \"I'd expect the State Department's climate change envoy- a key role under [Hillary] Clinton and [John] Kerry-to have a lot of free time on his or her hands, and that State Department permits to build oil pipelines to Canada will be quite a bit easier to get,\" Bordoff said. Tillerson has acknowledged that climate change is caused by humans, but questioned the costs of weaning the world from fossil fuels. \"What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers,\" he said at a 2013 stockholders meeting, citing the outsized impact on poor people if environmental activists succeeded in establishing company goals to reduce emissions.

    "text": "7 Drugs Found in System of Hot Air Balloon Pilot in Deadliest US Crash, NTSB Says By Becky Perlow Dec 9, 2016, 6:09 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH ARCHIVE VIDEO: Deadliest Hot Air Balloon Crash in US History 0 Shares Email The pilot of the deadliest hot air balloon crash in U.S. history had seven different drugs in his system at the time of the accident, according to documents released today by the National Transportation Safety Board. In the early hours of July 30, Alfred \u201cSkip\u201d Nichols was piloting a hot air balloon near Lockhart, Texas, with 15 passengers on board, when the balloon ultimately crashed into a field after striking high-voltage power lines. All those on board, including Nichols, were killed in the accident and the balloon was substantially damaged after hitting the power lines and catching fire. Nichols had a history of medical and psychiatric conditions, according to NTSB records, including diabetes and depression, and was being treated with several different medicines for with chronic back pain, attention deficit disorder and fibromyalgia, among his other medical ailments. 16 Dead in Texas After Hot Air Balloon Hits Power Line, Catches Fire Three of those medicines that were found in his system -- diazepam (i.e. Valium), oxycodone (i.e. Oxycontin) and methylphenidate (i.e. Ritalin) -- are drugs that legally prevent a pilot from obtaining a medical certificate. Other medicines that were found -- cyclobenzaprine (a muscle relaxant) and diphenhydramine (i.e. Benadryl) -- are medicines that pilots are told not to fly while taking, as those drugs could impair the pilot and prevent the pilot from flying safely, according to NTSB documents. Nichols also suffered from \"major depressive disorder,\" according to Nichols' medical records obtained by the NTSB. And while Nichols was taking medication to treat this condition, one expert suggested that may not have been enough. \"Someone taking anti-depressants does not necessarily guarantee the anti-depressants are effective,\" Federal Aviation Administration Chief Psychiatrist Charles Chesanow testified today in Washington, D.C. Currently, the FAA does not require hot air balloon pilots to hold a medical certificate, even though both fixed-wing and helicopter pilots do need this certificate. And though Nichols may not have legally needed a medical certificate to fly, depression is a disqualifying condition for pilot medical certification. The FAA may issue a \u201cspecial issuance of a medical certificate,\u201d which would allow those pilots suffering from depression to fly, but only if the pilot proved that after six months of treatment, the pilot was clinically stable on one of four FAA-approved medications. In Nichols' case, bupropion (an anti-depressant) was found in his body at the time of the accident, and is not one of the four FAA-approved medications. But would Nichols\u2019 passengers have noticed anything wrong with their pilot? One expert suggested not. \u201cThe drug levels are an important piece of the puzzle, but they aren\u2019t the entire puzzle,\u201d Chesanow said. Nichols also had multiple arrests, convictions and incarcerations, which included five alcohol-related incidents, possession of drugs, and driving with a suspended driving license, according to FBI National Crime Information Center records and Missouri driving records, obtained by the NTSB. Nichols never reported any of his drug convictions or motor vehicle violations, according to testimony presented to the NTSB today, despite the fact that it was mandatory to report any of these incidents to the FAA within 60 days of them occurring. Even after discovering that Nichols failed to report alcohol-related motor incidents, the FAA ultimately dismissed legal enforcement action against the pilot, according to a July 29, 2013, letter sent by the federal agency to Nichols. In an NTSB testimony today, the FAA said it decided not to pursue legal action against Nichols because of its \u201cStale Complaint Rule\u201d and its inability to show \u201cappropriate diligence.\u201d The \"Stale Complaint Rule\u201d is an FAA rule that says any complaint may generally be dismissed if the alleged offenses occurred more than six months before the time of the complaint, unless the FAA can show it took \"appropriate diligence\" in the case, according to testimony presented today at the NTSB hearing. Additionally, the FAA's 2013 letter encouraged Nichols to document his alcohol incidents when applying for a future Airman Medical Certificate, despite the fact that the FAA does not require hot air balloon pilots to hold medical certificates. FAA Federal Air Surgeon Dr. James Fraser explained at the NTSB hearing, though, that even if a pilot does not legally need a medical certificate, the pilot is still responsible from abstaining from flight if he is not fit to fly. \u201cCertainly if he could read the English language, he would know these medications would not be allowed,\u201d Fraser testified before the NTSB. When asked whether the FAA should require a medical certificate for balloon operators, Fraser suggested it may be time for a change in policy. \u201cI feel a medical evaluation is a part of the holistic plan to keep the national air space safe,\u201d Fraser said. Following the hearing, NTSB Board Member Robert Sumwalt admitted that while the balloon industry and the FAA may have resisted change in the past, there may also be a renewed interest in cooperation with safety regulations. \"Unfortunately, sometimes it takes blood to get change,\" Sumwalt said. \"And we want to make sure there are changes made before there's more bloodshed.\" 0 Shares ",

The Stanford band performs during halftime in a game against USC in Palo Alto in 2004. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Rong-Gong Lin II Contact Reporter The notoriously irreverent Stanford band will be suspended through next spring after administrators found \u201c a systemic cultural problem \u201d in the student group that has \u201cnot been taken seriously by the band or its leadership.\u201d The punishment requires the band to stop all activities, both on and off campus. Students who flout the order could be disciplined individually. \u201cNothing more will be accomplished without extreme consequences,\u201d a Stanford Organization Conduct Board panel concluded, finding that the band has failed to reform even after a probation period of more than a year. \u201cWe do not feel that the current leadership or membership is capable of creating the necessary cultural change,\u201d the panel said. \u201cWe feel there is a total lack of accountability and responsibility in the current organization.\u201d The Stanford band has been\u00a0infamous since the 1960s\u00a0and has been suspended before \u2014 in 1986, for urinating on the field , and in 2006, after being accused of\u00a0 trashing the trailer that had been its home. Before Friday\u2019s letter, the band\u00a0already had been under scrutiny over its behavior since 2012. In the spring of 2015 , Stanford barred the band from performing at away athletic events after finding it had violated university rules on alcohol, controlled substances, hazing and sexual harassment. \u201cViolations included a tradition in which a band member was given an alcoholic concoction intended to make that individual vomit publicly; an annual trip in which some band members used illegal substances; and a band selection process in which individuals were asked a number of inappropriate questions on sexual matters,\u201d a university statement said at the time. But violations have continued, and administrators are steaming. \u201cWe are concerned about the risk and liability to the university community, and to Stanford\u2019s reputation, if Band\u2019s conduct and behaviors continue,\u201d the panel wrote. The panel had urged a more severe punishment \u2014 suspending the band through 2018 \u2014 but Stanford Vice Provost Greg Boardman said in a letter that such a sentence could permanently cripple the student group and make it unable to recover. Boardman said he wants to end the current student-managed band structure and introduce a professional music director who will have final control over the organization. He said such a model was used for more than 30 years without stifling the band\u2019s unique character. The band can appeal Boardman\u2019s decision on the punishment with the Stanford provost. An editorial posted on the Stanford Review website, a student political magazine, called Boardman\u2019s decision unfair\u00a0and quoted anonymous band members disputing the university\u2019s accusations and arguing it had worked to reform its ways. \u201cIf the administration continues to eviscerate our traditions, what campus culture will even remain?\u201d the editorial board wrote.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Dec 10, 2016 7:17 PM EST ISTANBUL --\u00a0Two explosions hit Saturday night outside a major soccer stadium in Istanbul, after fans had gone home. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement saying \u201cunfortunately we have martyrs and wounded\u201d but did not specify the number. A Turkish government source told CBS News that 15 were dead and 69 wounded. Report: At least 13 dead in Istanbul bombings The private NTV channel reported that the target of the first attack was a bus for riot police. One of the blasts was thought to be a car bomb, while the second appeared to be a suicide bomber.\u00a0 Police cordoned off the area as smoke rose from behind the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium, known colloquially as Besiktas Stadium after the local team and neighborhood. Witnesses also heard gunfire after the explosions. The first and larger explosion took place about 10:30 p.m. after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Officials gave no immediate details on the nature of the second explosion, which sounded like it came from the same area. A video posted on social media appeared to show the moment of the blast with a fireball rising from the ground in the distance. It was followed several seconds later by a series of violent booms. \u00a0 Patlama an\u0131 amat\u00f6r kameraya b\u00f6yle yans\u0131d\u0131. #patlama pic.twitter.com/YniRkDWuKX \u2014 Be\u015fikta\u015f \u00e7Ar\u015f\u0131 (@BesiktascArsi) December 10, 2016 The big question is who might be responsible if it is indeed what it looks like: a terror attack, CBS News\u2019 Holly Williams reported from Istanbul. Turkey over the last couple of years has suffered a spate of suicide and car\u00a0 bombings -- some attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) and others carried out by Kurdish militants. ISIS released an audio recording earlier this week calling on its followers to attack Turkish interests wherever possible, including security, military and the media, Williams reports. The U.S. Consul General in Istanbul, Jennifer L. Davis, issued a statement to CBS News calling the bombings acts of terrorism. \u201cThe United States condemns tonight\u2019s cowardly attack and stands with the people of Turkey in the fight against terrorism,\u201d the statement read.\u00a0 However, there was no immediate claim of responsibility either from ISIS or any other group or individual. In cases of terror attacks carried out by Kurdish militants over the last couple of years, security forces and the police have been a frequent target. \u201cIt is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left,\u201d Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying by Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency. He said the explosion took place on a hill adjacent to and overlooking the stadium. Turkish policemen at the site of an explosion in central Istanbul, Turkey, Dec. 10, 2016. Close REUTERS Television images showed more than a dozen ambulances on a street hugging the stadium and a police helicopter flying overhead with its searchlights on. The window glass of nearby buildings was shattered by the blasts and coated the pavement. Investigators, including Istanbul Police Chief Mustafa Caliskan, were quickly on the scene. The Besiktas sports club \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d terrorism and the attack in a statement posted on its website. Bursaspor said none of the wounded were fans and issued a statement saying \u201cwe wish a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\u201d Turkey\u2019s radio and television board issued a temporary coverage ban citing national security concerns. It said \u201cto avoid broadcasts that can result in public fear, panic or chaos, or that will serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\u201d \u00a0 Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin were also notified about the attack, Anadolu said.\u00a0 Police arrive at the site of an explosion in central Istanbul, Turkey, Dec. 10, 2016.

Because a lot of people didn't show up, because they felt good about me.\" National exit polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton winning African-Americans of Trump 89 to 8 percent - but that marked a slight drop from 2012, when President Barack Obama led Mitt Romney among African-Americans 93 to 6 percent. Trump drew fire during the campaign for his outreach to African-American voters, which centered around the assertion that conditions were so poor in their communities that they should try something new in Trump. \"What do you have to lose?\" Trump would ask. The result Trump's outperforming Romney among black voters, even slightly, came as a surprise to many. Trump made the comments at the fourth stop on his \"Thank You\" tour, meant ostensibly to thank the millions of voters that delivered him a resounding White House win last month. Trump spent a significant chunk of the rally recounting his unexpected election-night success. Trump did also use the event, however, to make a surprise announcement about plans to bring new jobs to Michigan, and to pick Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris to lead an \"American manufacturing council \u2014 apparently referring to the Manufacturing Council, a private sector advisory council to the Secretary of Commerce.

Liveris told Trump that he's \"paving your way with your administration, with your policies, to make it easier to do business in this country,\" and that America would become \"not a red tape country, but a red carpet country for American businesses.\" The crowd cheered the Australian for promising \"to use American hard work and American brains and we're gonna fight for the Dow company out of the USA.\" It marked the latest development in Trump's efforts to make good on his campaign-trail promise to bring jobs and industry back to the U.S., following his announcement of a deal with Carrier executives to keep around 800 that were due to be moved to Mexico in Indianapolis.

But the CEO of Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, acknowledged that there was a cost to keeping the Indianapolis plant open, but the a Trump administration could bring a \"better\" regulatory environment and lower taxes that could help UTC in the long run.

The Reno teen had been showing signs of improvement from a critical gunshot wound to his chest, but suffered a \"major stroke\" Friday and underwent emergency surgery and his condition was unknown Friday night, Reno attorney David Houston said. Before the stroke, he said the boy was critical but stable. Houston, a prominent Reno attorney, said in an interview earlier Friday he was hired by the boy's father to defend the teen against any potential criminal charges stemming from Wednesday's shooting. A Reno police officer stands guard outside Hug High School on Dec. 7 after a Washoe County School District police officer shot a student following a disturbance at the school. Scott Sonner / AP He said he was still reviewing videos of the incident posted on social media but said several suggest none of the students felt threatened by the knife-wielding boy and many appeared shocked when the officer opened fire in a high school courtyard. \"Those kids were alerted there was going to be a beat-down at a specific time and a specific location. They had amassed with their cellphones for the purpose of filming it,\" Houston told the AP. He added: \"Half the student body is out there cheering them on. He'd been punched in the face and was running around screaming, 'Get away from me!' He was trying to extricate himself from a situation that had become like spectators in the Roman Colosseum.\" Related: Cop Didn't Need to Shoot Teen at Nevada High School, Family Insists One online video appears to show the teen wielding a large knife in a circle of dozens of onlookers. Another appears to capture the sound of a single gunshot and several students screaming before the camera shows the boy writhing in pain on the ground. A student's voice says, \"They shot the kid.\" \"The video tells the story,\" Houston said. \"No one anticipated the officer is going to shoot the kid.\" \"There was no attempt to calm the situation. There was not this genuine sense of panic or alarm by the students watching until the officer attempted to execute the 14-year-old who was screaming, 'Get away from me,'\" he said. No charges have been filed. The campus officer has been placed on paid administrative leave while Reno police lead an investigation into the officer-involved shooting. \"Any charging considerations are a part of that process,\" Washoe County District Attorney spokeswoman Michelle Bays said Friday, declining further comment until the investigation is complete.

    "text": "Photo Credit Alessandro Gottardo This is an article from Turning Points , a magazine that explores what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. Turning Point: Apple resists the F.B.I. in unlocking an iPhone in the San Bernardino terrorism case. I\u2019ve never been able to fit the concepts of privacy, history and encryption together in a satisfying way, though it continues to seem that I should. Each concept has to do with information; each can be considered to concern the public and the private; and each involves aspects of society, and perhaps particularly digital society. But experience has taught me that all I can hope to do with these three concepts is demonstrate the problems that considering them together causes. Privacy confuses me, beyond my simplest understanding, which is that individuals prefer, to different degrees, that information about them not be freely available to others. I desire privacy myself, and I understand why other individuals want it. But when the entity desiring privacy is a state, a corporation or some other human institution, my understanding of privacy becomes confused. While it\u2019s true that states and corporations often desire privacy, they just as often desire that I myself have less privacy. What does it mean, in an ostensible democracy, for the state to keep secrets from its citizens? The idea of the secret state seems antithetical to democracy, since its citizens, the voters, can\u2019t know what their government is doing. Thereby hang the countless conspiracy theories of our day, many of them supposing that we possess far less privacy than we actually do. Advocates of the secret state, wishing to comfort us, sometimes praise a rough and ready transparency: If you have nothing to hide and you trust your government, what can you possibly have to fear? Except that one can just as readily ask: If you have nothing to hide, what do you really have, aside from the panoptic attention of a state, which itself keeps secrets? Even this simple consideration of privacy confuses me. Is individual privacy and state privacy the same thing? Are they conceptually antithetical? Is it to a state\u2019s advantage to permit its citizens to keep secrets? States desirous of citizens\u2019 secrets have been known to torture their own people in the course of encouraging them to reveal what they know. We know this historically, and we know it still to be true, though whether we\u2019ve personally been affected by it largely depends on where we happen to live. Photo Credit Alessandro Gottardo I have ideas about history, more than I have about privacy, and it is here that my confusion deepens exponentially. I believe that our ability to create history, to transcend generations via our extraordinary prosthetic equivalents of memory, is the most remarkable thing about us. Unless we\u2019ve forgotten something, lost it to history, we\u2019ve yet to encounter another species capable of the same thing. Should the F.B.I. or other agencies be able to unlock the iPhones of terrorists? To be able to do so makes them able to unlock yours or mine. Should I be able to encrypt documents in such a way that the F.B.I. can\u2019t decrypt them? If I can, terrorists can as well. (Not that I necessarily accept terrorism as the ultimate fulcrum in such arguments, but it\u2019s become the one most often employed.) In the short term, the span of a lifetime, many of us would argue for privacy, and therefore against transparency. But history, the long term, is transparency; it is the absence of secrets. So we are quite merciless, as historians, when it comes to the secrets of the past, the secrets of the dead. We come to know them with an intimacy impossible in their day. It would be unthinkable for us to turn away from their secrets, to allow the Iceman his privacy or to not scan beneath the bitumen to recover an Egyptian priestess\u2019s tattoos. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And here, to complete my tangle of confusion, is encryption, no doubt aggravated by my inability to understand the concept mathematically. I assume (perhaps incorrectly) that the future is all too liable to have its way with today\u2019s most sophisticated encryption technology. I imagine that the world\u2019s best-kept secrets \u2014 those of both private citizens and state institutions \u2014 will one day sit in plain sight on whatever it is that our descendants display data on. Privy to that information while looking back at us, our ancestors will know us differently than we currently know ourselves, just as we now know the Victorians quite differently from how they knew themselves. The past, our own past, which our descendants will see us as having emerged from, will not be the past from which we now see ourselves emerging, but a reinterpretation of it, based on subsequently available information, greater transparency and fewer secrets. If our continually lengthening, ever more transparent history is the sum total of who we are as a species, then our species is the poorer for every secret faithfully kept. Any permanently unbreakable encryption seems counter to that. And yet I would prefer to keep certain secrets of my own, as I assume most of us would. So perhaps that desire is as much a part of us, as a species, as our need to build these memory palaces. William Gibson is a novelist and essayist.

    "text": "Dissecting the #PizzaGate Conspiracy Theories By GREGOR AISCH, JON HUANG and CECILIA KANG DEC. 10, 2016 In the span of a few weeks, a false rumor that Hillary Clinton and her top aides were involved in various crimes snowballed into a wild conspiracy theory that they were running a child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizza parlor. The fast evolution of the false theory revealed how a powerful mix of fake news and social media led an armed North Carolina man to investigate the rumors about the pizza place, Comet Ping Pong, last Sunday. John How the #PizzaGate conspiracy theory evolved 1 WikiLeaks began releasing emails hacked from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, a month before the election. 2 Social media users on a popular Reddit forum dedicated to Donald J. Trump and 4chan\u2019s far-right fringe message board searched the releases for evidence of wrongdoing. 3 Within the emails were discussions that include the word pizza, including dinner plans between Mr. Podesta and his lobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. 4 A participant on 4chan connected the phrase \u201ccheese pizza\u201d to pedophiles, who on chat boards use the initials \u201cc.p.\u201d to denote child pornography. 5 Following the use of \u201cpizza,\u201d theorists focused on the Washington pizza restaurant Comet Ping Pong. The WikiLeaks emails revealed that John Podesta corresponded with Comet\u2019s owner, James Alefantis, who had connections to Democratic operatives. 6 The theory started snowballing, taking on the meme #PizzaGate. Fake news articles emerged and were spread on Twitter and Facebook. 7 The false stories swept up neighboring businesses and bands that had played at Comet. Theories about kill rooms, underground tunnels, satanism and even cannibalism emerged in fabricated stories and on social media. 8 On Dec. 4, Edgar M. Welch, a 28-year-old from North Carolina, arrived at Comet with a military-style rifle and a handgun. The police said he fired the rifle inside the pizzeria, hurting no one, and surrendered after finding no evidence to support claims of child slaves being held there. 9 The shooting did not put the theory to rest. Purveyors of the theory and fake news pointed to the mainstream media as conspirators of a coverup to protect what they said was a crime ring. The conspiracy theory took the internet by storm. YouTube clips pushed the false story, racking up hundreds of thousands of views. Tens of thousands of individuals subscribed to message boards, feeding into theories with fake news reports and crowd-driven detective work. The police refuted the claims of an online pedophile ring running out of Comet Ping Pong, but the theories continued. Here are eight that gave #PizzaGate momentum. Claim: Podesta\u2019s leaked emails contained secret code language. Combing through John Podesta\u2019s leaked emails, members of a far-right fringe community on the social media site 4chan and Trump supporters on Reddit pulled out a number of emails unconnected to politics. Several of them mentioned pizza or other Italian food. Did you leave a handkerchief 09-02-2014 From: Susan Sandler To: John Podesta The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want.  I know you\u2019re busy, so feel free not to respond if it\u2019s not yours or you don\u2019t want it. RE: Did you leave a handkerchief 09-04-2014 ",

    "text": "Alene Tchekmedyian Contact Reporter The doctor\u2019s letter filed with the court had a simple message: His patient should avoid manual labor for her community service. Jiah \u201cRhea\u201d Chung, who had been ordered to pick\u00a0up trash for Caltrans as punishment for embezzling from the Los Angeles Trade Technical College Foundation, was \u201cundergoing a medical evaluation of her heart and lung condition and intolerance to physical labor,\u201d the doctor\u2019s note said. \u201cPlease restrict her exposure to physical labor and sun \u2014\u00a0CalTrans activities,\u201d continued the letter from Dr. Gregory L. Taylor II. At the bottom was the logo from Taylor\u2019s place of work, Keck Medicine of USC. There was just one problem: The doctor didn\u2019t write the letter. Chung did. At a court hearing last week, Chung, 46, told the judge that she wrote the note as a draft she intended to give her doctor to sign, but it wound up being filed in court, according to her attorney, Kenneth White. Deputy Dist. Atty. Dana Aratani dismissed her excuse as unbelievable, saying that Chung \u2014\u00a0an avid golfer \u2014 had been caught deliberately trying to deceive the judge so she wouldn\u2019t have to perform the arduous community service. Superior Court Judge Frederick Wapner agreed and concluded that Chung had been\u00a0trying to mislead him, the attorneys said. The judge sentenced her to 60 days in county jail, extended her probation by a year and doubled her community service to 120 days, though he ruled she did not have to serve them by cleaning  freeways. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable\u00a0to submit a false document to the court,\u201d Aratani said. \u201cIn this case it warranted jail time.\u201d The doctor's letter saying that Jiah \u201cRhea\ufffd? Chung shouldn't do court-ordered CalTrans work for community service Open link The dispute over the letter marked the latest twist in a public corruption\u00a0case that began with allegations that Chung, the college foundation\u2019s executive director,\u00a0was improperly accepting thousands of dollars in unauthorized bonuses and expenses. The payments, first reported by The Times , included a $5,000 initiation fee at the California Club, an\u00a0annual membership fee\u00a0of $2,300 for the L.A. Philharmonic and more than $9,000 on golf outings in two years. The foundation was established to help needy students at the downtown L.A. campus, which trains people in skills such as welding and fashion design, but was spending more on Chung\u2019s salary and expenses than on scholarships to students, records showed. The district attorney\u2019s office alleged that Chung embezzled nearly $140,000 from\u00a02009 to\u00a02011.\u00a0In 2013, prosecutors charged her with three counts each\u00a0of misappropriation of public funds, forgery and embezzlement. \u201cOur students, all of them are really very poor,\u201d said John McDowell, a foundation board member who attended the\u00a0hearing. \u201cAnybody who abuses their position to embezzle money or squander it is taking that money right out of the hands of students who really, really need it.\u201d As part of a deal reached with prosecutors , Chung pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement and avoided jail time. She was sentenced to 60 days of work for the\u00a0California Department of Transportation and three years of formal probation. She was also ordered to return $50,500, the amount she admitted taking, to the college\u2019s\u00a0foundation. The eight other charges were dropped. After almost two years, Chung still hadn\u2019t performed the Caltrans work, according to a probation report. When confronted by her probation officer, she said she had a medical condition and couldn\u2019t do the labor. The officer asked for a doctor\u2019s note, and Chung provided the letter, the\u00a0probation report said. That\u2019s unacceptable to submit a false document to the court. \u2014 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dana Aratani During a September hearing, she brought the letter to court as part of a request to modify her sentence so she could perform a different type of community service, according to a transcript of the hearing. Her lawyer at the time, a deputy public defender, provided the note to the court. When Aratani saw the letter, he said, he thought it looked suspicious. The doctor hadn\u2019t signed\u00a0the note or left\u00a0 a phone number, and the wording about Chung\u2019s medical problems\u00a0was vague. At a hearing on Dec. 2,\u00a0Aratani asked Chung whether she\u2019s exposed to the sun when she plays golf. \u201cI\u2019m in a cart with a roof,\u201d he recalled her saying, \u201cand I wear a hat.\u201d Taylor, the doctor, testified that Chung had explained her medical problems and asked him to write\u00a0a letter but that he told her to draft a note so he could see what she wanted him to write, according to White. Taylor never saw the letter Chung created, the lawyer said. The fiasco was the result of an honest miscommunication and Chung does suffer from medical problems that cause faintness\u00a0and dizziness, White said. \u201cShe did ultimately present two letters to the court from other doctors who indicated this was a legitimate cause for concern,\u201d White said. Taylor initially agreed to an interview with\u00a0The Times, but a spokeswoman for Keck Medicine of USC called to cancel, saying the center\u2019s policy was to\u00a0grant interviews that focused only on the clinical work of physicians. The foundation\u2019s McDowell called Chung\u2019s defense \u201crather lame.\u201d \u201cThat was obviously not true and the judge knew it,\u201d he said. The judge ordered Chung to surrender next month. Aratani and McDowell said the judge had one more instruction for Chung: not to show up with a doctor\u2019s note saying she was too sick to go to jail.

Will devote ZERO TIME! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016 He then criticized reports that he would be working on the show during his presidency as \u201cFAKE NEWS.\u201d Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016 But on Friday, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s own top transition adviser who had discussed on CNN the possibility of the president-elect working on the program during his Oval Office tenure. Kellyanne Conway appeared in an interview with the cable news network to suggest that the president-elect may still be open to helping with the MGM-produced \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe fact is that he\u2019s conferring with all types of experts to tell him what he\u2019s allowed to do and not to do as the president of the United States, and if this is one of the approved activities, perhaps he\u2019ll consider staying on,\u201d Conway told CNN. MGM, the production company, previously declined to discuss the financial details of Mr. Trump\u2019s contract with CBS News. The next season of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d back after a two-year hiatus with new host Arnold Schwarzenegger, will air Jan. 2 on NBC, just weeks before Mr. Trump is inaugurated. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By David Nakamura and Greg Miller December 10 at 9:01 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @gregpmiller The simmering distrust between Donald Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies escalated into open antagonism Saturday after the president-elect mocked a CIA report that Russian operatives had intervened in the U.S. presidential election to help him win. The growing tensions set up a potential showdown between Trump and the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials during what some of those officials describe as the most complex threat environment in decades. The Washington Post reported Friday that the Central Intelligence Agency had determined that Russia had intervened in the presidential election not just to make mischief but to boost Trump\u2019s chances. Trump\u2019s reaction will probably deepen an existing rift between Trump and the agencies and raised questions about how the government\u2019s 16 spying agencies will function in his administration on matters such as counterterrorism and cyberwarfare. On Friday, members of Trump\u2019s transition team dismissed the CIA\u2019s assessments about Iraq\u2019s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. \u201cGiven his proclivity for revenge combined with his notorious thin skin, this threatens to result in a lasting relationship of distrust and ill will between the president and the intelligence community,\u201d said Paul Pillar, former deputy director of the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. CIA briefers told senators in a closed-door briefing it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal, according to officials. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) U.S. intelligence officials described mounting concern and confusion about how to proceed in an administration so openly hostile to their function and role. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the end game is here,\u201d a senior U.S. intelligence official said. \u201cAfter Jan.\u00a020,\u201d the official said, referring to Inauguration Day, \u201cwe\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201d Pillar added: \u201cEverything Trump has indicated with regard to his character and tendencies for vindictiveness might be worse\u201d than former president Richard Nixon, who also had a dysfunctional relationship with the intelligence community. The tensions between Trump and spy agencies could escalate even further as dozens of analysts begin work on a project, ordered by President Obama, to deliver a comprehensive report on Russian intervention in the election before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. Led by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., the investigation is aimed at reaching a definitive judgment about the Russian role in the election. Obama aides have pledged to make as much of the report public as possible once it is completed. \u201cWe want to make sure we brief Congress and relevant stakeholders, like possibly state administrators who actually operationalize the elections,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters Friday. But such a report could also pose a more complicated challenge for Trump, potentially pitting the entire U.S. intelligence community against a newly sworn-in president who has repeatedly denigrated their work. The Post reported late Friday that the CIA had concluded that individuals with close ties to the Russian government delivered thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, to WikiLeaks a few weeks before the election. Intelligence officials have determined that Russia\u2019s goal was to help Trump win, rather than simply undermine confidence in the election. In a statement, Trump suggested that the CIA had discredited itself over faulty intelligence assessments about Iraq\u2019s weapons stockpile more than a dozen years ago. \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said. The belittling response alarmed people in the intelligence community, which already had questioned Trump\u2019s temperament and lack of national security experience. Despite mounting evidence over Moscow\u2019s involvement in a hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump has consistently refused to entertain any doubts about the Russians\u2019 role or about Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. The president-elect has spoken admiringly of Putin in the past, calling him a stronger leader than President Obama, and one of Trump\u2019s former campaign managers had business associations with Russian companies. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump told Time magazine of the Russians in a recent interview during which he suggested the accusations from the United States were politically driven. Instead, Trump took direct aim at the professional spies charged with assessing what Clapper in September called the \u201cmost complex and diverse array of global threats\u201d in his 53\u00a0years of service. Intelligence agencies are tracking Russia\u2019s military interventions in Syria and Ukraine, Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear deal, North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons testing and China\u2019s maritime challenges in Asia and theft of trade secrets. The CIA is operating a covert program to arm and train moderate rebels in Syria to overcome the brutal rule of President Bashar al-Assad, even as Trump has praised Russia\u2019s approach to backing Assad. Since his electoral triumph last month, Trump has attended only a limited number of intelligence briefings, and he appointed as his national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who was forced out of his job as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency by Obama administration officials. Trump also has created a climate of uncertainty over how his administration would approach counterterrorism and intelligence gathering after speaking approvingly of torture methods, including waterboarding terrorist suspects, which was banned by Obama. Trump has since appeared to moderate his position after meeting with retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis, whom he intends to nominate as defense secretary and has said such techniques don\u2019t work. Trump\u2019s transition aides have explained his unwillingness to make time for more intelligence briefings as a consequence of his busy schedule building an administration and selecting Cabinet members. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has reportedly attended such briefings most days. But Trump\u2019s approach has contrasted with his predecessors, including Obama and George W. Bush, who attended multiple briefings each week leading up to their inaugurations. In his statement, Trump emphasized that the election was over and vowed to \u201cmove on,\u201d and he did not, as is his habit, react to the CIA story on social media in the hours after it was published. Congressional Democrats have called for investigations into Russia\u2019s interference, but reaction among Republican leaders was divided. Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) vowed to pursue the matter, but Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) said Russia has been involved in cyberattacks for years and said the new allegations were \u201cserious, but hardly news.\u201d Trump\u2019s handling of questions regarding Russian intervention will put enormous strain on his nominee to lead the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who may find himself caught in the crossfire between the agency and his president. Pillar said he already has concerns about Pompeo\u2019s ability to deliver impartial views to the White House. Pompeo, along with Flynn and Mattis, has been a strident critic of the Iran nuclear deal, and Pillar wondered whether Pompeo would be a dispassionate actor if intelligence agencies conclude that Iran is abiding by the deal. \u201cI see the danger of a lasting dysfunctional relationship based on the president-elect\u2019s perception that he is being wronged by the intelligence community,\u201d Pillar said. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

One of the blasts was thought to be a suicide bomber. \"We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror which tramples on every value and decency,\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement. The official who gave the toll of 15 dead and dozens wounded spoke on condition anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly on the issue, The Associated Press reported. He cited health ministry figures. Reuters reported the number of injured was 69. Turkish security forces confirmed to NBC News that law enforcement were attacked as they left the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium after they had finished policing the soccer match. The first blast went off at approximately 10:30 p.m. Police arrive at the site of an explosion in central Istanbul on Dec. 10. Murad Sezer / Reuters One of the blasts was thought to be a car bomb and the second appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. This year Istanbul has witnessed bombings attributed by authorities to the ISIS terror group or claimed by Kurdish militants. \"It is thought to be a car bomb at a point where our special forces police were located, right after the match at the exit where Bursaspor fans exited, after the fans had left.\" Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was quoted as saying by Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency. Speaking later to reporters in Istanbul, he said the first explosion took place on a hill adjacent to and overlooking the stadium. The second explosion struck Macka Park and was believed to be a suicide bomb. Witnesses said additional police were deployed and had cordoned off the area and gunfire could be heard in what appeared to have been an armed attack on police. Rescue services work at the scene of explosions near the Besiktas football club stadium after attacks in Istanbul, late Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016. AP The private NTV channel said the target of the attack was a bus for riot police. Images broadcast on television showed more than a dozen ambulances on a street hugging the stadium and a police helicopter flying overhead with its search lights on. One witness reported hearing over 100 shots after the explosions. Turkey's radio and television board issued a temporary blackout on coverage of the explosion that occurred Saturday in Istanbul citing public order and national security reasons. The order asks media organizations to refrain from broadcasting and publishing anything that may cause \"fear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin had been notified, Anadolu said. The American embassy in Turkey stated its condolences and support for the country via Twitter. (1/2) Our hearts and prayers are with the people of #Istanbul tonight. \u2014 US Embassy Turkey (@USEmbassyTurkey) December 10, 2016 (2/2) We condemn tonight's cowardly attack, and salute the courage of the Turkish people as we stand with them against terror. \u2014 US Embassy Turkey (@USEmbassyTurkey) December 10, 2016 The stadium serves as the home of Besiktas soccer team, which was playing against Bursaspor \u2014 the local club from the Turkish city of Bursa \u2014 prior to the explosion. Besiktas won the match 2-1. The Bursaspor team communicated via Twitter that none of its fans had been injured. The team \"strongly condemned\" terrorism and the attack in a statement posted on its website and said \"we wish a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\" The Union of European Football Associations expressed its \"deepest condolences\" to victims of the bombings, and said it sends its support to the Turkish Football Federation and the Besiktas and Bursaspor clubs.

Democrats call for hearings Gregory Korte , USA TODAY 5:39 p.m. EST December 10, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump speaks in Grand Rapids, Mich. Friday. Trump's presidential transition team challenged the veracity of U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia was trying to tip the November election to the Republican. A top Senate Democrat demanded a full congressional investigation. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Intelligence officials have already made clear they believe the hacking of Democratic emails was directed by Russia in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections. The question now is: Were they actively trying to get Donald Trump elected president? That important distinction \u2014 between causing mayhem in order to sow doubt in the democratic process, versus actually putting a finger on the scale for the Republican candidate \u2014 has reignited the debate over the role foreign powers may have played in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats called for congressional investigations into the hacking on Saturday, the day after\u00a0President Obama ordered intelligence agencies to review the extent to which Russia and other foreign powers may have influenced presidential elections in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., alleged that FBI Director James Comey had secret evidence that Russia was supporting Trump but withheld it for partisan purposes. He offered no evidence. \"This is not fake news, OK?\u00a0Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government. There's no doubt about that,\" he told MSNBC . The man expected to take over for Reid, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called for congressional investigations, promising to \"get to the bottom of this.\" \u201cThat any country could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core,\"\u00a0he said. \"It\u2019s imperative that our intelligence community turns over any relevant information so that Congress can conduct a full investigation.\u201d But President-elect Trump's team continued to downplay claims of foreign interference, even seemingly attacking the intelligence community after the Washington Post reported , based on anonymous sources, that the CIA believed that Russia may have been supporting Trump. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" the Trump transition office said in a statement. \"The election ended a long time ago.\" Trump bashes CIA, dismisses Russian hacking report Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was besieged by a series of embarrassing revelations in the campaign from leaked emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and her campaign chairman, John Podesta. In October, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the leaked emails were \"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,\" and that it was \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions.\" Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer, a member of Trump's transition team, noted Saturday that allegations of Russian support have come from sources unwilling to speak on the record. And he said there's no evidence that Trump benefited from Russian actions. \"What proof does anyone have that they affected the outcome? Because I've heard zero,\" Spicer told CNN . 1723 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 117 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hyzg75 ",

Cohn, whose career at Goldman Sachs began in 1990, is the third Goldman executive to be named to a staff or cabinet post by Mr. Trump. Cohn is the highest-ranking of the three -- CEO Lloyd Blankfein is the only person above Cohn at Goldman. Cohn\u2019s fellow Goldman alumni tapped by Mr. Trump are Steve Mnuchin, who is\u00a0 slated to head the Treasury Department , and Steve Bannon, who is the White House\u2019s incoming chief strategist. Goldman Sachs shares have risen 33 percent since Election Day. And Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton, seems to be feeling bullish on Mr. Trump now -- he told the Wall Street Journal that the president-elect is \u201ca very smart guy\u201d who \u201cmay turn out to be a much better president than anyone else might have been in that place.\u201d Donald Trump's $14 billion Cabinet If he accepts, Cohn will be responsible for advising the president on domestic and international economic policy issues and monitoring the implementation of the White House\u2019s economic policy agenda. \u00a0The NEC director is one of the three main economic advisers to the president. The others are chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The CEA chair is almost always an academic, whose job it is to provide economic analysis. The OMB director is charged with developing the president\u2019s budget. \u00a0 Cohn is a registered Democrat and has in the past donated to both Republicans and Democrats -- including Hillary Clinton when she was running for the Senate. However, in the 2016 election cycle, he only gave to Republicans, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics .\u00a0 Mr. Trump campaigned in part against Wall Street, launching frequent salvos at Goldman Sachs on the trail and attacking rivals for their specific connections to the bank.\u00a0 Earlier this year, he blasted Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his Republican primary opponent, for being in \u201cin bed\u201d with Wall Street interests, following reports that the senator had taken previously undisclosed loans from Goldman Sachs.\u00a0 Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2016 Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016 Progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont immediately took to Twitter to slam Mr. Trump\u2019s pick, criticizing the Cohn nomination as more evidence of a \u201crigged economy.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s called a rigged economy and this is how it works. https://t.co/npoLcKQmfJ \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 9, 2016 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Trump's transition team cautioned that no announcement was expected over the weekend. USA TODAY Rex W. Tillerson (Photo: REX C. CURRY, EPA) NEW YORK \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is zeroing in on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of State nominee. Tillerson had his second interview with the president-elect Saturday at\u00a0Trump Tower and has emerged as the favorite in the long-running competition to lead the State Department, a person familiar with the transition deliberations\u00a0told USA TODAY on\u00a0condition of anonymity\u00a0because Trump has yet to announce his pick. \"In his case, he's much more than a business executive,\" Trump said in an interview to be broadcast on Fox News Sunday. \"I mean, he's a world-class player.\" In the excerpt released by Fox News on Saturday, Trump stopped short of confirming Tillerson as his pick, but praised the 64-year-old executive. \"He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It\u2019s been a company that's been unbelievably managed,\" he said. \"To me a big advantage is that he knows many the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals \u2014 not\u00a0for himself, but for the company.\" It's those deals in Russia that are likely to draw the most scrutiny, especially given his personal relationship with the president of Russia, who\u00a0awarded him the Order of Friendship, the top Russian honor for a foreign citizen,\u00a0in 2013. \u201cI have obviously concerns of reports of his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,\u00a0told CNN. \"We will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined.\u00a0That\u2019s the time to make up your mind as to whether to vote yes or no.\u201d News of Tillerson's emergence came as government officials accuse\u00a0the Russian government of seeking to intervene in the recent U.S. election, including hacks of Democratic officials' e-mails \u2014\u00a0all in an effort to boost Trump's chances. Trump bashes CIA, dismisses Russian hacking report Putin and Russia have denied the allegations, while Trump has questioned the idea of Russian interference. And with Trump promising to cancel the Paris climate agreement negotiated by President Obama, the nomination of an oil executive would send a powerful signal that the United States is prepared to buck the global consensus on greenhouse gas emissions. Trump's weeks-long search for secretary of State has included multiple interviews with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor and top adviser Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, and retired general and ex-CIA director David Petraeus. Giuliani, who said Friday he was withdrawing from the State Department competition, accompanied Trump to the Army-Navy game Saturday. Giuliani removes himself from Cabinet consideration After Trump aides said the list had been narrowed to those four, the president-elect decided to expand his list \u2014 a decision that brought his attention\u00a0to Tillerson. Trump transition adviser Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Tillerson is a \"very intriguing pick to many people. He's already active in Russia, and China and Yemen and the developing world, across our globe. He has the kind of business experience that Donald Trump values.\" Tillerson\u00a0has worked for Exxon since graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1975, climbing the ranks until he was named CEO in 2006. He\u00a0has no previous governmental or diplomatic experience. But as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has negotiated with countries all over the world for oil exploration rights, particularly in the Middle East and Russia. Exxon record in spotlight as Trump interviews CEO Of particular interest in his Senate confirmation hearings would\u00a0be the $2.2 billion Exxon investment in Russian oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean, which Tillerson negotiated in 2011. That agreement, which also allowed Russian investment in other Exxon ventures around the world, was eventually scuttled after U.S.-imposed sanctions following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. At Exxon, Tillerson has been critical of international sanctions, saying they\u2019re difficult to impose fairly. He has acknowledged that climate change has been caused by human activity, and has endorsed a carbon tax as \u201cthe most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions.\u201d Vladimir Putin: Russia seeking friends, not enemies But environmental groups are expected to oppose his Senate confirmation if he's nominated. The New York Attorney General is investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to investors and consumers about the risks of climate change from burning fossil fuels. \u201cIn this position, Tillerson will try his hardest to silence global initiatives and the right of state attorney generals to hold fossil fuel companies legally accountable for climate change,\" said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA. The secretary of State is also responsible for advancing U.S. policy on human rights. Tillerson, himself an Eagle Scout, was president of the Boy Scouts of America at the time when it began allowing gay scouts, and in 2015 ExxonMobil changed its anti-discrimination policy to include gays and lesbians. But the Human Rights Campaign remains skeptical of the company's policy, saying it was prompted by Obama's 2014 executive order targeting federal contractors, not a change in corporate values.

    "text": "Advocates Call Alabama Execution an 'Avoidable Disaster' By kim chandler and kate brumback, associated press ATMORE, Ala. \u0097 Dec 10, 2016, 6:19 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - This undated photo provided by the Alabama Department of Corrections shows Ronald Bert Smith Jr.. Smith Jr., an Alabama inmate coughed repeatedly and his upper body heaved for at least 13 minutes during an execution, Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016, using a drug that has previously been used in problematic lethal injections in at least three other states. (Alabama Department of Corrections via AP, File) 0 Shares Email Defenders of a condemned inmate in Alabama are calling his execution an \"avoidable disaster,\" but the state prison commissioner says there was no visible evidence that he suffered during a lethal injection. Death row inmate Ronald Bert Smith Jr. coughed, and his upper body heaved repeatedly, for the 13 minutes as he was being sedated, and his arms appeared to move slightly after two tests were administered to determine consciousness. Smith's attorneys, who watched the execution, said in a statement Friday that the movements show that he \"was not anesthetized at any point during the agonizingly long procedure.\" Alabama's Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn disputes the assessment that Smith was in pain, saying Alabama properly followed a lethal injection protocol that has been upheld by the courts. \"Early in the execution, Smith, with eyes closed, did cough but at no time during the execution was there observational evidence that he suffered,\" Dunn's statement said. Dunn said a required autopsy will determine if there were any irregularities. Smith was sentenced to die for shooting convenience store clerk Casey Wilson in the head during a 1994 robbery. A jury recommended a life sentence by a 7-5 vote, but a judge imposed the death penalty, likening the slaying of the pistol-whipped clerk to an execution-style killing. Smith's final movements during the lethal injection will likely be fiercely debated as Alabama resumes executions after years of litigation and a drug shortage. Inmate advocates argue that Alabama's process is too flawed and secretive, raising the risk of botched executions. \"No autopsy can measure the extent of Ron Smith's suffering as he died. We are profoundly disappointed that the state and courts failed to intervene at any stage and take steps to prevent this avoidable disaster. We will continue our own efforts to make sure this suffering does not occur again,\" said Smith's lawyers with the Alabama Federal Defenders Program. This was Alabama's second execution using midazolam to render an inmate unconscious before injections of rocuronium bromide and potassium chloride to stop the lungs and heart. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last year that Oklahoma inmates hadn't prove midazolam violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Inmates have continued to challenge its use, saying it is a sedative, not an anesthetic, and cannot reliably render a person unconscious. Soon after the execution began, Smith clenched his fists and raised his head early in the procedure. Smith then coughed and his chest heaved multiple times for 13 minutes of the execution process. Unlike Alabama's first midazolam execution, the state performed a second consciousness check on Smith as he continued to cough and heave. A corrections officer standing in the execution chamber gave Smith two consciousness checks, which involved stroking the area around his eyes, saying his name and pinching his left arm. If the inmate does not respond, the warden administers the final two drugs from the control room, Dunn said. The first check was done at about 10:37 p.m., and Smith's left arm moved slightly after the pinch. A second check was performed 10 minutes later. Smith did not immediately respond but shortly afterward his right hand and lower arm appeared to lift slightly. Smith's attorneys mentioned the movement to each other as they watched the execution. Dunn, who also watched the execution, said he did not see movement. Smith's lawyers believe the state gave him an additional dose of midazolam after he responded to the first consciousness test. However, Dunn declined to say if a second dose was used, saying the department won't discuss specifics of its protocol. States have turned to midazolam and other drug combinations as pharmaceutical companies have become reluctant to sell the drugs that were previously used in lethal injections. \"I think we saw last night what we, unfortunately, have seen so many times before, which is that midazolam, which was never intended to be used this way, is not effective and can't be used this way,\" said Cassandra Stubbs, who directs the Capital Punishment Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma and Florida also have used midazolam. Mississippi and Arkansas , which have not executed an inmate in several years, have also announced plans to use the sedative. Critics have pointed to problems with executions in other states that use midazolam. In Ohio, inmate Dennis McGuire repeatedly gasped and snorted for more than 26 minutes while being put to death. In Arizona, Joseph Rudolph Wood gasped and snorted for more than 90 minutes after his execution began. Alabama has been trying to resume executions after a lull caused by a shortage of execution drugs and litigation. The state executed Christopher Eugene Brooks in January for the 1993 rape and beating death of a woman. Brooks did not display the type of movements that Smith did, according to media witnesses. The state performed one consciousness check. Smith's execution \u2014 as measured from the time the curtains open from the viewing room to the time that he was pronounced dead \u2014 lasted about eight minutes longer than Brooks'. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show that Smith coughed and his torso heaved for 13 minutes as he was being sedated for a lethal injection. It has also been corrected to show it was a judge and not a prosecutor who likened the 1994 murder of a convenience store clerk to an execution-style slaying. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Northeast Ohio Gas Pipeline Opponents Vow to Delay Project By mark gillispie, associated press CLEVELAND \u0097 Dec 10, 2016, 2:37 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Jon Strong talks about the trees shown behind him that would be gone if a planned natural gas pipeline is built through his property, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in Guilford Township near Wadsworth, Ohio. Strong say property owners will continue to resist surveyors and land agents as the company planning to build a large, high-pressure natural gas pipeline across northern Ohio moves toward starting construction early next year. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak) 0 Shares Email Northeast Ohio residents who have tried to get a natural gas pipeline moved away from their communities are vowing to engage in delay tactics after a federal agency dismissed their suggested alternate routes. Opponents say they will not allow surveys or sell easements for the $2 billion NEXUS Gas Transmission project unless ordered to do so by a court. \"I will stand my ground, as everyone else is standing, until all of our resources and options are exhausted,\" said Medina County resident Jon Strong, who has helped lead the effort to reroute the pipeline the last 2 ? years. The 255-mile-long line would carry gas from Appalachia across northern Ohio and into Michigan and Canada. Most of the high-pressured line would be in Ohio. Construction is slated to begin by March. Federal law gives companies wide latitude to build interstate pipelines, and NEXUS Gas officials say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's environmental impact study was a milestone move forward on the plans. Company spokesman Adam Parker said the alternate routes would take the pipeline away from its market areas and \"does not accomplish the project's purpose and need.\" The company's last regulatory hurdle is winning a certificate of public convenience and necessity, which the company expects to get in early 2017. It also must complete surveys for the proposed route and pay land owners to bury the line on their properties. The most fervent opposition has been centered in Medina and Summit counties, where opponents say the pipeline will come too close to homes and businesses. Officials in Green in southern Summit County provided three alternative routes to the commission to move the pipeline away from their city. Green spokeswoman Valerie Wolford said the proposed route would be near schools and would cross backyards and a city park with sports fields. She added that residents are worried about the possibility of an explosion. \"It's something we have to think about,\" Wolford said. \"You have to prepare for the worst.\" Green hasn't allowed surveyors onto city property and won't sell easements until forced to do so, Wolford said. Parker said the company has completed 95 percent of its needed surveys and has been negotiating with property owners to acquire easements. \"We're continuing to work with land owners along the route,\" he said. Mike Stafford lives less than a mile from Strong in Guilford Township. He said he allowed a survey of his land but won't make it easy for NEXUS going forward. The property that's been staked for the pipeline that will leave a \"50-foot hole that I can never fix,\" Stafford said. \"It's not about the money, but if you're going to run a pipeline through my land without me wanting it here, I want all of the money I can get,\" Stafford said. Strong stood in the back of his 11 acres recently admiring the scrubby tract of trees and bushes that he let grow wild from the meadow that existed when he built his house 22 years ago. Strong has set up remote cameras that, to his delight, frequently capture images of wildlife traipsing by. The pipeline would cut a 450-foot-long swath along the edge of his land. \"I've spent hundreds of hours out here communicating with God,\" Strong said. \"It's where I pray. Over the years, you get to know every flower, every plant, every tree.\" Strong and others have argued that it makes sense for the pipeline to be rerouted to farmland where field crops can be grown after construction and fewer people would be affected. No trees can be planted or structures built over the pipeline once it's completed. And they wonder how they can be forced to provide land in the U.S. for a pipeline that will benefit Canadian companies and residents. The pipeline is a partnership between Houston-based Spectra Energy and Detroit's DTE Energy . The NEXUS pipeline was designed to carry gas to customers in Ohio and Michigan and to the Dawn Hub, a massive underground storage and gas trading facility Spectra owns in Ontario, Canada. A $28 billion merger between Spectra and Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge Energy is expected to be completed early next year with the combined companies headquartered in Calgary. Parker disputed the contention by opponents of the route that NEXUS has no customers for the pipeline. NEXUS has commitments for about 60 percent of the pipeline's capacity, he said. Strong said he'll not allow surveyors onto his property and won't sell NEXUS an easement without a fight. \"I'm just going to make my stand in principle and bring to light the issues that are so unjust,\" Strong said. \"At the end of the day, when I'm out of options, I'll have to make a deal like everyone else. Sooner or later, the man will crush me.\" 0 Shares ",

The Washington Post notes a recent history of clashes between Republican administrations and federal environmental scientists: \"In [Ronald] Reagan's first term, Anne Gorsuch was appointed to head the Environmental Protection Agency amid a major push for regulatory rollback. But after Gorsuch resigned amid controversy in 1983, Congress opened investigations into supposed \"hit lists\" at the agency used to track the views of members of scientific advisory boards, according to contemporary news reports. \"During the George W. Bush administration, there were complaints that scientific documents had been edited to raise doubts about the science of climate change and that researchers had been prevented from speaking openly to the media and sharing their expertise.\" NPR thanks our sponsors ",
