Jail 0 Shares Email An inmate who is considered dangerous is still on the run after he and five others escaped from a Tennessee jail by removing a leaky toilet, officials said. Six inmates from the Cocke County Jail Annex in Newport made the escape Christmas Day at around 1:30 a.m., the Cocke County Sheriff's Office said in a statement; five of them have since been apprehended. Still on the run is David Wayne Frazier, 54, who is considered dangerous, according to the sheriff's office. Frazier was in custody for alleged aggravated robbery and possession of a weapon by a felon. He had not entered a plea. He was arrested Dec. 20 and had not yet had a preliminary hearing, Cocke County Sheriff Armando Fontes told ABC News today. 1 Fugitive Still at Large After 6 Inmates Escaped Tennessee Jail by Removing Toilet The early-morning Christmas escape was prompted by a water leak behind a toilet, the sheriff's office said. \"The bolts holding the unit rusted out, and there was prior damage to the concrete due to plumbing repairs,\" the sheriff's office added. The inmates removed the toilet from the wall, the sheriff's office said, and \"gained access to a hole, which led outside of the facility.\" Fontes said that his office is working with the U.S. Marshals Service to look for Frazier and that authorities have gotten several tips. The sheriff's office said Monday, \"We will do everything possible to capture this individual\" and \"we will not let up until he is back in custody.\" Anyone with information is asked to contact the Cocke County Sheriff's Office at 423-623-3064 or the jail at 423-613-9128.

The investigation into the crash has not yet revealed why the plane's wings experienced a problem with the flaps, the moveable panels mounted on the edge of the wings that increase lift, a source familiar with the investigation told news agency Interfax. Another source aware of the details in the preliminary crash investigation told Interfax that although a mechanical error could be to blame, \"The crew's erroneous actions during takeoff shouldn't be ruled out either.\" The preliminary theory is that the pilots reacted incorrectly to the issue, and the plane crashed as a result, according to Interfax. The plane had two black boxes, only one of which has been recovered so far. The Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft crashed into the Black Sea on Sunday just two minutes after it departed in good weather from Sochi, killing 92 people aboard, including a famous choir, The Associated Press reported. The Red Army Choir was traveling to a New Year's concert at a Russian military base in Syria, according to The AP. Investigators Study Flight Recorder From Black Sea Jet Crash On Tuesday, thousands of rescue workers sped up efforts to recover bodies and wreckage from the crash site, ahead of forecasts of bad weather, The AP reported. Drones and submersibles are also being used in recovery efforts. The top Russian investigative agency, known as the Investigative Committee, said it found a witness who filmed the crash, according to The AP. Details on the alleged video were not offered. The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built airliner designed in the late 1960s. Russian airlines decommissioned the three-engine aircraft years ago, but the military and other government agencies continue to use it, The AP reported. The plane, although gas-guzzling and noisy, is loved by crews for its maneuverability and sturdiness, according to The AP. ABC News' Ben Gittleson and Anastasia Butler contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Cohen/Invision/AP Korean Airlines is loosening its restrictions on flight attendants' use of stun guns following a viral incident last week of a singer helping subdue an unruly passenger. The airline announced the changes Tuesday, saying that in addition to giving its crew more discretion in using the Tasers, flight attendants would be better trained in restraining passengers, and difficult passengers could face bans on booking with the airline. While Reuters notes unlawful acts aboard South Korean flights have tripled over the past five years, it's a Dec. 21 incident involving singer Richard Marx that's getting the most credit for the changes.

In a Facebook post , Marx derided a crew that was \"ill-prepared\" and \"untrained\" for the described \"four hours of a psycho passenger attacking crew members and other passengers.\" Marx's wife, Daisy Fuentes, a former MTV personality, said on Instagram that crew members \"didn't know how to use the taser\" or secure the rope they used in tying the passenger down. \"While U.S. carriers have taken stern action on violent on-board behavior following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 (2001), Asian carriers including us have not imposed tough standards because of Asian culture,\" Korean Air President Chi Chang-hoon told a news conference.

He documented intense real-life dramas in Chicago and around the world. On Tuesday, friends and family were mourning the death of beloved local filmmaker David Steiner, who was killed in a bus crash while working in eastern Africa. CBS 2's Susanna Song reports. Patrick M. O'Connell Chicago Tribune A Chicago filmmaker who made a documentary about an Englewood charter school was killed in a bus crash Monday in Uganda, according to the U.S. State Department and a Chicago school official. David J. Steiner was in the East African country working on his next project, about Sudanese refugees, and to attend a screening of his Chicago-based work at a film festival there. Steiner's documentary \"Saving Barbara Sizemore\" chronicled the successful struggle to keep open the Barbara A. Sizemore Academy charter school in Englewood. Chicago Public Schools administrators had targeted the school for closure. Two eighth-grade students who attended Sizemore also were on the minibus when it was hit head-on by another vehicle on a road outside Kampala, the Ugandan capital, said Carol Lee, chairman of the board of directors for the Betty Shabazz International Charter School Network, which operates the academy. A male student suffered minor injuries in the crash, Lee said, and a female student was not hurt. Steiner also was accompanied by a son, a videographer and another person, Lee said. Steiner was near the front of the bus when it crashed, she said. David J. Steiner LinkedIn David J. Steiner, whose\u00a0documentary, \"Saving Barbara Sizemore,\" chronicled the successful struggle to keep open the Barbara A. Sizemore Academy charter school in Englewood, died in a bus crash in Uganda on Dec. 26, 2016. David J. Steiner, whose\u00a0documentary, \"Saving Barbara Sizemore,\" chronicled the successful struggle to keep open the Barbara A. Sizemore Academy charter school in Englewood, died in a bus crash in Uganda on Dec. 26, 2016. (LinkedIn) William Cocks, a spokesman for the State Department 's Bureau of Consular Affairs, confirmed Steiner's death. Cocks did not provide specifics about the crash. \"We offer our condolences to friends and family and stand ready to provide appropriate consular services,\" Cocks said in an emailed statement. The Chicago students were on their way home to the United States on Tuesday with the help of the U.S. embassy in Uganda, Lee said. Steiner, who lived in Evanston, decided to make a film about Sizemore after hearing from a friend about its possible closure, Lee said. He wanted to chronicle the events \"from the children's perspective,\" she said. \"He was very committed to issues of social justice, and he had a broad perspective on trying to build communities,\" Lee said. \"He saw his filmmaking as an opportunity to engage communities to address issues of social justice and try to bring communities together.\" Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities with Chicago ties who died in 2016. \"Saving Barbara Sizemore,\" in which Steiner appears, screened Dec. 18 in Kampala as part of the Nile Diaspora International Film Festival. In the days after the screening, Steiner toured the country and gathered footage for his new project, a documentary on Sudanese refugees. Last year, the Gene Siskel Film Center included \"Saving Barbara Sizemore\" as part of its annual Black Harvest festival. \"My goal was to (talk about) the school and the teachers, the administrators and just show what rich culture they have there,\" Steiner told WTTW's \"Chicago Tonight\" earlier this year. \"And the students wanted to say, 'We're standing up for ourselves, we're not going to get pushed around.'\" Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2016. Steiner's documentary \"captured the tremendous family feeling at the school, and the unique rapport between the teachers and the children,\" Martin Rubin, Gene Siskel Film Center associate programming director, said Tuesday. The film festival's organizers posted a tribute Monday on Facebook to Steiner that reads in part: \"In the short time we spent with David, we appreciated his efforts toward humanity.\" Tribune critic Michael Phillips contributed.

On Feb. 11, we will have a penumbral lunar eclipse.\u00a0This is when the Moon enters the lighter shadow of the earth.\u00a0 The effect is nowhere near as cool as a total lunar eclipse.\u00a0In fact, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to even notice it. The largest planet in our solar system returns to the evening sky in the spring and is closest to the earth on April 7.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see it rising in the east after sunset and Jupiter will have close encounters with the moon on April 10, May 7\u00a0and June 3. Meteor showers are notoriously fickle events\u00a0so predicting them is not an exact science. However, I\u2019m hoping that the Orionid meteor shower peaking on Oct. 21 and the Leonid meteor shower on Nov. 17 will be good ones.\u00a0The moon will be out of the way for both so that the fainter meteors may shine. The Big One But the major astronomical event of 2017 \u2013 and I have been waiting decades for this \u2013 will be the total solar eclipse. On Aug.\u00a021,\u00a0the Moon will completely block the sun, and best of all, this can be witnessed in the United States, from sea to shining sea.\u00a0We have not had a total solar eclipse in the mainland U.S. since 1979. There is a catch: you have to be at the right place at the right time to see it.\u00a0To experience totality (when the sun is totally blocked by the moon), you will have to be on a narrow path about 75 miles wide between Oregon and South Carolina.\u00a0Or you could venture farther west to Missouri, Nebraska, Wyoming or Idaho.\u00a0You can view a detailed map of the eclipse here . Plan a trip to see this total solar eclipse.\u00a0Call in sick to work.\u00a0Play hooky from school. If you need an astronomer\u2019s note, I can provide one.\u00a0A total solar eclipse will be a sight you will never forget.

Police responded to several incidents and some malls were even evacuated. USA TODAY NETWORK More than 1,000 people were estimated to be on line for NJ Transit buses after the Jersey Gardens Mall was evacuated on one of the busiest days of the year after a fight broke out. (Photo: Kevin R. Wexler, NorthJersey.com-USA TODAY Sports) Police officials in several U.S. cities said Tuesday that they suspect\u00a0social media was used to organize some\u00a0of the string of brawls and disturbances that broke out at more than a dozen shopping malls across the country a day earlier, marring one of the busiest shopping days of the year. In Aurora, Colo., police said\u00a0a posting on social media announcing a fight at the Town Center of Aurora drew an unruly crowd that grew to about 500 people. Five suspects, all juveniles, were arrested in that fight, which brought\u00a050 officers to the scene and led to the mall being shut down. Manchester, Conn., police said\u00a0several fights broke out around the same time at the Shoppes at Buckland Hills Mall in that city on Monday evening. Capt. Christopher Davis said\u00a0police there believe it is \u201chighly probable\u201d that social media postings played a part in organizing the disturbances that ended with the arrests of seven people \u2014 including five teenagers \u2014 who were involved in the melees. Meanwhile, in Beachwood, Ohio, police said\u00a0about 500 young people who took part in a large-scale disturbance at the mall on Monday had been \u201cloosely organized on social media.\u201d Reports of mall disturbances light up social media Police in the Cleveland suburb evacuated the mall after teens had been running through the shopping center amid\u00a0incorrect reports that shots had been fired. The mall\u2019s operators eventually reopened it to shoppers after the situation was calmed. One juvenile who struck a police officer was charged with disorderly conduct. Other major mall disturbances \u2014 including some that led to shopping centers being evacuated \u2014 occurred in Tempe, Ariz.; Aurora, Ill.; Louisville;\u00a0Fayetteville, N.C.; East Garden City, N.Y.;\u00a0Memphis;\u00a0Fort Worth and elsewhere. Images and videos of the brawls and chaotic scenes also were posted on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms. x Share Several fights in the Fox Valley Mall in Aurora, Illinois broke out just one day after the Christmas holiday sending people running for exits. (Dec. 27) AP \u201cThere\u2019s a definite connection with social media,\u201d said Chris McGoey , who heads the Los Angeles-based McGoey Security Consulting firm. \u00a0\u201cThis is not a coincidence that on this day you have all of these similar events happening across the country involving a certain age demographic. If you look at where many of these incidents occurred, they are in cold climates. Added to that, it happened the day after Christmas, most of these individuals were school-age\u00a0children and they have nothing to do. And this is the YouTube generation, they record everything, and they want to stimulate things through their social media.\u201d Law enforcement officials have not uncovered any evidence that the incidents \u2014 which occurred at malls in at least 12\u00a0states within hours of each other \u2014 were nationally coordinated. Officer Tamara Valle, a Fort Worth Police Department spokeswoman, said officers there were investigating to see whether an incident at Hulen Mall, in which 100 to 150 teenagers brawled at the food court, was part of \u201csome kind of premeditated thing across the nation.\u201d Like the incident in Beachwood, police were called to the scene after incorrect reports that shots had been fired. Capt. Gary Haba, a spokesman for the Beachwood Police Department, said\u00a0police and mall officials there regularly monitor social media and beef up security when they spot postings from teenagers suggesting that a fight may occur at the mall. Haba said\u00a0while police spotted postings on social media suggesting that something was brewing on Monday, the messages did not appear to be spread very far. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any massive traffic that suggested that it was going to be a big thing,\u201d Haba said. \u201cSometimes, we\u2019ll see about as much (social media traffic) as we did yesterday, and we\u2019ll show up and nothing happens.\u201d 100-150 involved in Hulen Mall fight In the incident at the Fox Valley Mall in Aurora, Ill., west of Chicago, police said eight juveniles, ages 13 to 17, face various misdemeanor charges for their parts in several melees that broke out there on Monday and may have been spurred by social media. Mall security called police after they saw a large crowd of teenagers gather in the food court area. Police arrived and called on the teens to disperse. Shortly after officers ordered the teens to disperse, police said a large fight broke out in the mall as well as several smaller skirmishes. The situation escalated further as some in the crowd threw drinks and other items at\u00a0police and mall security, police said. Two officers were battered trying to break up the fights, and 75 officers were dispatched to the mall to restore order. No one was seriously injured, police said. \u201cAurora Police continue to investigate what role social media may have played in organizing the disturbance and what connection the disturbance may have to other similar incidents that were reported in several cities across the nation,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cThe motive behind the disturbance is not yet known.\u201d McGoey, the Los Angeles-based security consultant, said mall operators' best effective deterrence to these social-media driven incidents is to be tough on less serious misconduct, such as loitering and harassment of shoppers. \u201cThese incidents aren\u2019t going to get better, they\u2019re probably only going to become more common,\u201d McGoey said. \u201cThe malls that enforce rules of conduct and drive the knuckleheads away and won\u2019t allow them to hang out in clusters and make catcalls (at women), they are going to reduce the chances of being targeted. They\u2019re going to pick on the mall that allows them to gather in clusters and where mall security allows things to escalate before they do anything.\u201d Contributing: USA TODAY's Susan Miller and WFAA-TV Follow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent\u00a0Aamer Madhani on Twitter:\u00a0 @AamerISmad ",

The NYPD gave the all clear after investigating the suspicious backpack that was left in the lobby, which they determined contained children's toys. NYPD and FDNY officials were called to the scene in midtown. The evacuation was protocol for a suspicious package and does not necessarily indicate how serious the situation is. Footage from outside the tower shows the stream of people leaving the building. President-elect Donald Trump is currently in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago estate with members of his family. This is a developing story. Please check back in for updates. 0 Shares ",

The Nasdaq closed at a record 5,487 points while the Dow inched closer to a 20,000 high. Mark Lennihan/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP On an otherwise slow trading day, both the Nasdaq and Dow Jones indexes made notable gains. The Nasdaq closed at a record 5,487 points while the Dow inched closer to a 20,000 high. Mark Lennihan/AP Boosted by technology stocks and housing, major U.S. Stock indexes closed higher despite slow post-holiday trading. The Nasdaq ended the day breaking a record. By the market's close, it had reached 5,487 points, a gain of 0.45 percent. The Dow moved closer to a record 20,000 high reaching 19,945 by the time of the bell. The Associated Press notes that despite these gains, it was an otherwise slow day for the markets. In fact, the news service says it was the lightest trading day since October 2015. At the same time, signs point to an altogether healthy year for U.S. markets. \"Markets are moving toward 20,000 and bond yields are up; there's a little bit of buoyancy in oil prices,\" chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank, Erik Davidson, told the news service. Reuters adds that consumer and housing data, along with technology gains, pushed markets higher: \"Tuesday data showed American consumers' confidence shot to its highest in more than 15 years in December as they saw more strength ahead in business conditions, stock prices and the job market, while house prices continued their steady recovery in October. \"U.S. equities have been riding a post-presidential election rally, feeding on optimism that Donald Trump's plans for deregulation and infrastructure spending could bolster the economy. With the market priced for positive outcomes in various scenarios, some see the end-year rally as an opportunity to cash-in gains. ... \"About 4.13 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.27 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Volume this week last year averaged 5 billion stocks daily. \"The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 was Nvidia Corp, which rose 6.9 percent and boosted the chipmakers. \"Amazon rose 1.4 percent to $771.40. The online retailer said it shipped over 1 billion items to Prime members during the holiday season.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

High winds and drifting snow continued to make travel hazardous in the Dakotas, even as vast stretches of highways that had been closed reopened to traffic. The no-travel warnings issued Christmas Day for much of North Dakota had largely expired by Tuesday, although the National Weather Service warned that drifting snow still blocked some roads. Interstate 94, which had been closed for days in North Dakota, reopened Tuesday, as did Interstate 90 in South Dakota . The Minot International Airport, which was closed Monday due to whiteout conditions, reopened Tuesday and was expecting its first flights \u2014 incoming and outgoing \u2014 late morning. Winds gusting 40 mph to 50 mph also led to delays and cancellations at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Monday, but the airport returned to full operations the next day, reporting just a handful of delays. The South Dakota Rural Electric Association said roughly 13,700 of its customers were without power early Tuesday, and it could take several days to restore service. In Michigan, Consumers Energy and DTE Energy said 17,300 customers still had no electricity Tuesday morning. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "AP December 27, 2016, 3:26 PM More Americans are retiring outside the U.S. Email Newly widowed, Kay McCowen quit her job, sold her house, applied for Social Security and retired to Mexico. It was a move she and her husband, Mel, had discussed before he passed away in 2012. \u201cI wanted to find a place where I could afford to live off my Social Security,\u201d she said. \u201cThe weather here is so perfect, and it\u2019s a beautiful place.\u201d She is among a growing number of Americans who are retiring outside the United States. The number grew 17 percent between 2010 and 2015 and is expected to increase over the next 10 years as more baby boomers retire. Just under 400,000 American retirees are now living abroad, according to the Social Security Administration. The countries they have chosen most often: Canada, Japan, Mexico, Germany and the United Kingdom. 25 cheapest places to retire Retirees most often cite the cost of living as the reason for moving elsewhere said Olivia S. Mitchell, director of the Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cI think that many people retire when they are in good health and they are interested in stretching their dollars and seeing the world,\u201d Mitchell said. McCowen\u2019s rent in Ajijic, a community outside Guadalajara near Mexico\u2019s Lake Chapala, is half of what she was paying in Texas. And since the weather is moderate, utility bills are inexpensive. In some countries, Mitchell said, retirees also may find it less expensive to hire someone to do their laundry, clean, cook and even provide long-term care than in the United States. McCowen has a community of other American retirees nearby and has adjusted well. But for others there are hurdles to overcome to adjust to life in a different country. Viviana Rojas, an associate professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, says the biggest obstacle is not speaking the language or knowing the culture. \u201cMany of the people we interviewed said they spoke Spanish, but they actually spoke very little Spanish,\u201d said Rojas, who is writing a book about retirees in Mexico. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the capacity of speaking enough Spanish to meet their basic needs like going to the doctor or to the store.\u201d A growing number of Americans are moving overseas when they retire, looking to live out their golden years for less money. Access to health care also can be a challenge. While retirees still can receive Social Security benefits, Medicare is not available to those living abroad, Mitchell said. Joseph Roginski, 71, says that while the cost of living is higher in Japan, access to health care is not.\u00a0 \u201cThings are very expensive here. It is impossible to live off Social Security alone,\u201d said Roginski, who was stationed in Japan in 1968. \u201cBut health insurance is a major factor in staying here.\u201d The former military language and intelligence specialist said he pays $350 annually to be part of Japan\u2019s national health insurance. His policy covers 70 percent of his costs. The rest is covered by a secondary insurance program for retired military personnel. Japan experienced biggest growth, 42 percent, of American retirees than any other country between 2010 and 2014, according to data from the Social Security Administration. The large U.S. military presence in the country may be a factor. There are more than 50,000 U.S. military servicemen and -women stationed in Japan. The presence is so large that in the island of Okinawa, the U.S. military occupies about 19 percent of the area, according to Ellis S. Krauss, professor emeritus of Japanese politics and policy-making at the University of California, San Diego. Roginski, who volunteers for the Misawa Air Base Retiree Activities Office, said he helps connect more than 450 retirees and their families living in Northern Japan with resources. He said he would never move back to the United States. \u201cWe have a real strong sense of security here,\u201d he said. \u201cI can leave my door unlocked and no one will take anything. When I go to another country I feel nervous, but when I come back I feel like I\u2019m home.\u201d Mexico has become home for retired firefighter, Dan Williams, 72, and his wife, Donna, 68. The couple has been living near the same retirement community in Lake Chapala for 14 years. \u201cThe climate and the medical services are very good,\u201d Williams said. Williams teaches painting to adults and children and puts together a monthly magazine for the local American Legion. He is also a member of the Lake Chapala Society, which offers daily activities for American retirees. It was those same services that attracted McCowen to the region. \u201cBefore moving, I found out how many widowed and divorced women lived here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is comfort in numbers.\u201d She says she loves being in a lively community. \u201cI see older people walking year round. I see them all over the place even in their wheelchairs. If they were in the U.S., they would probably be in a nursing home,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could move back.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Noonan, USA TODAY 11:15 p.m. EST December 27, 2016 Men and women are not equal...when it comes to heart attacks, at least. Wochit-All Heart disease is a top killer of women, but it can be prevented. (Photo: Miranda Pelligrino) Actress Carrie Fisher became a victim Tuesday of a threat to women that's bigger than cancer: Heart disease. Cancer does kill a lot of women. Four of every 10 women who die between ages 45 and 64 die of cancer. But more than 1 in 3 women \u2014 43 million \u2014 are living with cardiovascular disease, many without knowing it. \"Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women and is more deadly than all forms of cancer combined,\" said Dr. Jennifer Mieres, professor of cardiology and population health at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in Hempstead, N.Y. About once every minute a woman dies from a stroke,\u00a0heart attack or a lesser-known problem called a sudden cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association . Sudden cardiac arrest\u00a0differs from a heart attack. It's not caused by a blockage that stops blood flow to the heart; instead the heart's electrical system stops working properly and can't pump blood the way it should. 'Star Wars' icon Carrie Fisher dies at 60 Almost two-thirds of women who die suddenly from heart disease had no previous symptoms, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . And heart attacks seem to increase among women about 10 years after menopause \u2014 for reasons not entirely known. \u201cWomen tend to have more atypical symptoms,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Jay Stone, a cardiologist at Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. \u201cA burning pain, shortness of breath or weakness, fluctuating in the chest or palpitations \u2014 it\u2019s not the classic textbook that men tend to have.\u201d Posted!

That means not smoking, exercising regularly, eating healthy foods, drinking little alcohol and\u00a0maintaining proper\u00a0weight. \u201cWith most women, our focus is on our family, not ourselves,\u201d said Loretta Impastato, 59, of Freehold Township, N.J. \u201cWith the last of my children getting married, I decided, \u2018I\u2019m overweight, my cholesterol is creeping up and I\u2019m not feeling well. I have to do something.\u2019 \u201d Alarm raised on women's heart disease A stress test, echocardiogram and lab work determined that she was pre-diabetic and at a high risk for cardiovascular disease. \u201cIt was the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Impastato said. She could start doing something about the problem. One way for women to stay on top of heart health is to know the target numbers: \u2022 Blood pressure. High blood pressure can damage your heart as well as make you susceptible to stroke. Keep the systolic, top number, below 120 millimeters of mercury and the diastolic, the bottom number, at less than 80 mm Hg. \u2022\u00a0Blood sugar. Diabetes \u2014 which\u00a0results when the body doesn't make enough insulin or cells in muscles, liver and fat do not use insulin properly \u2014 can damage blood vessels over time, leading to heart disease.\u00a0A glycated hemoglobin test indicates average blood sugar levels for the past two to three months. Less than 5.7% on the A1C test is normal. Another test measures\u00a0blood sugar levels after an overnight fast. Less than 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood is considered normal. \u2022 Cholesterol. One type, low-density lipoprotein, is considered bad because it transports cholesterol particles throughout the body to build up on the walls of arteries. LDL levels should be 129 milligrams per deciliter of blood or lower.\u00a0High-density lipoprotein is the good cholesterol, transporting excess cholesterol particles back to the liver; HDL levels should be 60 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Triglycerides.\u00a0This type of fat circulates in your blood along with cholesterol, storing unused calories to provide your body with energy, but too much may contribute to hardening of the arteries. Normal is less than\u00a0150 mg/dL. \"A study found that high triglycerides were a dangerous risk factor for stroke in women (but) not necessarily in men,\" said\u00a0Charlotte Libov, author of books\u00a0including\u00a0A Woman's Guide to Heart Attack Recovery. New research into gender differences in heart disease has had a positive effect on prevention and treatment strategies for women, Hofstra Northwell's Mieres said. Carrie Fisher's frequent companion: French bulldog Gary \"We have seen a decline in deaths from heart disease,\" she said. In the decade\u00a0since the heart association's Go Red For Women campaign began raising women's awareness, a third fewer women have died from heart disease. Smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle, high blood pressure and obesity are risk factors for both sexes. But diabetes, lack of exercise and obesity are more potent risks in women, Mieres said. \u201cWith the last of my children getting married, I decided, \u2018I\u2019m overweight, my cholesterol is creeping up and I\u2019m not feeling well. I have to do something.'\u201d Loretta Impastato, Freehold Township, N.J. Now researchers know that some risk factors \u2014\u00a0such as menopause before age 50, inflammatory diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy complications and pre-term births \u2014 are unique risks\u00a0to women, she said. Pregnancy can be a stress test\u00a0on the body's vascular system that gives doctors \"a window into what may happen in the future,\" said Dr. Claire Boccia Liang, director of women's heart programs at Gagnon Cardiovascular Institute in Morristown, N.J. During pregnancy, high blood sugar, called gestational diabetes;\u00a0high blood pressure; or preeclampsia, characterized by high protein in urine and high blood pressure,\u00a0raise red flags for heart disease. Women who live with chronic stress and those who sleep fewer\u00a0than six hours a night have higher heart disease risk. Depression doubles the risk of heart attack, death or need for an artery-opening procedure in women age 55 and younger. Family history also accounts for about 20% of heart disease risk, Boccia Liang said. If a family member had a heart attack, stroke, bypass, stent or other major heart problem or procedure, the risk may be higher. The risk may increase at a younger age if the event happened to a parent or sibling\u00a0before age 55 in men or 65 in women. Both sexes can experience the classic heart-attack symptom of chest pain, but women instead can\u00a0feel discomfort or pain in the neck, jaw, shoulder or right arm. They may feel unusually tired, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded or nauseated and may vomit or sweat heavily. Women's symptoms may mimic other conditions. For example, unusual fatigue could be the flu. Profuse sweating could be a hot flash. A sore jaw could be temporomandibular joint disorder, better known as TMJ. If symptoms become worse when your heart works harder \u2014 you're running or walking fast, dancing or exerting in other ways \u2014 that's a tipoff to suspect heart disease, Boccia Liang said. \"Jaw pain that only relents with rest but gets worse with exercise is definitely a red flag,\" she said. Barbra Streisand calls for action on women's heart health Heart disease may seem unpredictable, but knowing the symptoms can help a woman\u00a0stay alert, Libov said. Studies show that people whose heart attacks \"seem to come out of the blue\" were actually having symptoms up to a month before the attack. And be aware that symptoms can sneak up. When a woman who always played two sets of tennis finds herself suddenly struggling to finish a game, \"that's not normal,\" she said. Don't blame aging or assume that a gradual decline happened because of lack of exercise, overwork, menopause, the blues or the blahs. It might be your heart's way of calling for help. \"We can't regenerate the muscle that's been damaged,\" after a heart attack occurs, Boccia Liang said. Seven biggest health problems Americans face Six months after Impastato's screening and subsequent exercise and diet regimen, she returned for a checkup and the results were impressive. Her total cholesterol level, once near 300 mg/dL, fell 65 points; 200 mg/dL or less is considered best. She lost 30 pounds and is no longer considered pre-diabetic. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re not feeling well until you start to feel well again, and now I feel fabulous,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone woman needs to have some kind of (cardiovascular) screening. With education, women are starting to understand more about this.\u201d 8473 CONNECT TWEET 38 LINKEDIN 35 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iBOEjr NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Bush, will serve as President-elect Trump's homeland security adviser. USA TODAY Donald Trump (Photo: Darron Cummings, AP) Starting the post-Christmas phase of his transition, President-elect Donald Trump made appointments Tuesday devoted to national security \u2014 particularly cyber defense \u2014 and to international trade and diplomacy. Former George W. Bush administration\u00a0official Thomas Bossert will be the White House homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser, while Trump Organization official\u00a0Jason D. Greenblatt will be \"Special Representative for International Negotiations,\" Trump \u00a0announced. Bossert\u00a0\u201cbrings enormous depth and breadth of knowledge and experience to protecting the homeland to our\u00a0senior White House team,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counter-terrorism, and cyber-security challenges.\" Bossert, a deputy homeland security adviser during the Bush administration, said he\u00a0looks forward to \"maintaining a strong, deeply respectful relationship with the governors, mayors, police and fire fighters, emergency managers, EMS professionals, and public health officials that constitute the backbone of our homeland security and our national preparedness.\" Trump said he was elevating Bossert's position to an independent post alongside the national security adviser, instead of a deputy reporting to the adviser. Focusing on cyber-security in particular,\u00a0Bossert said that \"we\u00a0must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law, honoring the rights of personal property, the benefits of free and fair trade, and the fundamental principles\u00a0of liberty.\" Cyber-security became an issue in Trump's election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Intelligence agencies accused Russia of hacking into Democratic officials' e-mails in a bid to help Trump's campaign. Trump has questioned whether the Russians intervened in the election, but has called for beefing up U.S. cyber defensive and offensive capability. Greenblatt, currently executive vice president and chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, has often represented the New York businessman, and has become \"one of my closest and most trusted advisers,\" Trump said. Trump said Greenblatt's \"talents lend themselves perfectly to the role I have asked him to play, assisting on international negotiations of all types, and trade deals around the world.\u201d In addition to trade \u2014\u00a0Trump says some current agreements are unfair to U.S. workers \u2014 Greenblatt could also get involved in Middle East peace negotiations. \"Mr. Greenblatt served as one of the President-elect\u2019s principal advisors on the U.S.-Israel relationship during the campaign,\" the Trump transition team said in announcing the appointment. In thanking Trump for the offer, Greenblatt said that \"my philosophy, in both business and in life, is that bringing people together and working to unite, rather than to divide, is the strongest\u00a0path to success. I truly believe that this approach is one that can yield results for the United States in matters all over the world.\" Trump continues to spend the year-end holidays at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Palm Beach, Fla. In the coming days, he is expected to conduct job interviews for positions that remain open, including secretary of Agriculture and director of National Intelligence. The new appointments come\u00a0a day after Trump engaged in a long-distance battle with President Obama. In a podcast interview with former political adviser David Axelrod, Obama said he could have won a third term had the Constitution permitted him to run again. Trump replied via tweet that there was \"NO WAY\" Obama would have beat him. President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 Trump returned to the issue Tuesday afternoon, tweeting: \"President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost. The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" 92 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 97 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iA7Qho NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

The 'Star Wars' actress suffered a heart attack on a flight Friday. She was taken to  a hospital in L.A. where she died four days later. USA TODAY Carrie Fisher signed copies of her latest book, 'The Princess Diarist,' at a Los Angeles event in November. (Photo: Paul Archuleta, FilmMagic) Carrie Fisher is most widely\u00a0known for her turn as Princess Leia in the hugely popular Star Wars films, but the daughter of two entertainers \u2014 actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher \u2014 was also an acclaimed author\u00a0renowned for her trenchant wit. The following is a sampling of memorable lines attributed to Fisher, who died Tuesday after suffering\u00a0a heart attack during a Dec. 23\u00a0flight from London to Los Angeles. From Twitter:\u00a0 \"If my life wasn't funny, it would just be true, and that is unacceptable.\" (2011) \"There's no room for demons when you're self-possessed.\" (2014) From Fisher's\u00a01987 semi-autobiographical novel, Postcards From the Edge: \"Instant gratification takes too long.\" \u201cI shot through my twenties like a luminous thread through a dark needle, blazing toward my destination: Nowhere.\u201d \u201cActually, I am a failed anorexic. I have anorexic thinking, but I can't seem to muster the behavior.\u201d \u201cLife is a cruel, horrible joke and I am the punch line.\u201d \u201cYou know how I always seem to be struggling, even when the situation doesn't call for it?\u201d Appreciation: Carrie Fisher will forever be 'Star Wars' royalty \u201cSometimes I feel like I've got my nose pressed up against the window of a bakery, only I'm the bread.\u201d \u201cMy inner world seems largely to consist of three rotating emotions: embarrassment, rage, and tension. Sometimes I feel excited, but I think that's just positive tension.\u201d From her 2008 memoir, Wishful Drinking:\u00a0 \u201cSometimes you can only find Heaven by slowly backing away from Hell.\u201d \u201cI feel I'm very sane about how crazy I am.\u201d \u201cNo motive is pure. No one is good or bad \u2014 but a hearty mix of both. And sometimes life actually gives to you by taking away.\u201d Stars, family share memories of Carrie Fisher \u201cI quote fictional characters, because I'm a fictional character myself!\u201d \u201cHaving waited my entire life to get an award for something, anything \u2026\u00a0I now get awards all the time for being mentally ill. It\u2019s better than being bad at being insane, right? How tragic would it be to be runner-up for Bipolar Woman of the Year?\u201d From her new memoir, The Princess Diarist: \u201cVultures are difficult to charm unless you\u2019re off somewhere rotting in the noonday sun. Casually rotting \u2026 a glib cadaver.\u201d \u201cSomeone has to stand still for you to love them. My choices are always on the run.\u201d \u201cI act like someone in a bomb shelter trying to raise everyone\u2019s spirits.\u201d Carrie Fisher's second life as a writer \u201cMovies were meant to stay on the screen, flat and large and colorful, gathering you up into their sweep of story, carrying you rollicking along to the end, then releasing you back into your unchanged life. But this movie (Star Wars) misbehaved. It leaked out of the theater, poured off the screen, affected a lot of people so deeply that they required endless talismans and artifacts to stay connected to it.\u201d Sources: Goodreads.com, USA TODAY research Posted!

The 'Star Wars' actress suffered a heart attack on a flight Friday. She was taken to  a hospital in L.A. where she died four days later. USA TODAY Carrie Fisher poses for USA TODAY in New York City while promoting 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) The nerds never got the cheerleader or the homecoming queen. No matter. We had a princess. Carrie Fisher, who died Tuesday\u00a0at age 60 after suffering a heart attack Dec. 23 on a flight,\u00a0had a long career in Hollywood, appearing on TV shows and movies and even fostering a side gig as a best-selling author. But ever since she blasted into sci-fi fans\u2019 hearts as one of the young stars in George Lucas\u2019 original\u00a0Star Wars, she was Princess Leia, the spunky and sassy girl in hair buns who stared down Darth Vader and became a cinematic icon for decades to come. And as much as she was loath to admit it at times in those\u00a0nearly 40 years, Fisher loved Star Wars. She wrote as much in her The Princess Diarist memoir this year and said so a year ago to USA TODAY, when she was out promoting her role in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and deciding to do her interview happily sprawled on a hotel bed with her ever-present French bulldog\u00a0Gary. 'Star Wars' icon Carrie Fisher dies at 60 She was, by definition of the word, a hoot. In interviews, Fisher didn't just talk, she held court. \"She\u2019s me and I'm her and it\u2019s kind of a M\u00f6bius strip,\" Fisher said of\u00a0Leia, now a general in the Resistance in The Force Awakens\u00a0and upcoming Episode VIII. \"I carry her around and I know her better than anybody else and we wear the same clothes a lot of times. She's mine.\" Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in George Lucas' original 1977 'Star Wars.' \u00a0(Photo: Lucasfilm) Fisher made her film debut with a small role in Warren Beatty's 1975 movie\u00a0Shampoo, but just as Star Wars went intergalactic in 1977, so did the actress. She bantered with both Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who we'd all learn was her long-lost twin brother \u2014 though we didn't know that when they smooched in 1980's The Empire Strike Back \u2014 as well as with smuggling pilot Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford. (Fisher came clean in The Princess Diarist\u00a0that she and Ford\u00a0engaged in\u00a0a\u00a0three-month tryst in London while filming the first\u00a0Star Wars.) Stars, family share memories of Carrie Fisher But Leia was a fighter, and that's what Fisher gave to her. She didn't back down from the Empire. When Han and Luke rescue her, she's the one nonchalantly picking up a blaster and going to town on Stormtroopers. When Jabba the Hutt puts her in a metal slave bikini when she's trying save her man Han in Return of the Jedi? Well, Leia choked him\u00a0out good. Fisher gave Leia her all, whether it was being feisty or simply fearless. Carrie Fisher had a gift for memorable lines Fisher battled alcoholism, drug addiction, depression and bipolar disorder, yet was always honest and even self-deprecating about it in interviews and her semi-autobiographical novel\u00a0Postcards From the Edge and memoir\u00a0Wishful Drinking. The fanbase, the boys and girls and later men and women who would buy Leia action figures and Leia Pez dispensers and Leia shampoo bottles, always cheered her on. Carrie Fisher's second life as a writer \"People bring me their kids like I\u2019m going to bless them but they\u2019re like 2 months old and they\u2019re already in a\u00a0Princess Leia outfit,\" Fisher said. \"I always think they swallowed the outfit and gave birth to the kid wearing the hairy earphones.\" We love\u00a0you, Carrie.

By Ellen Nakashima December 27 at 1:32 PM Follow @nakashimae The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U.S. officials. The administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week. The sanctions part of the package culminates weeks of debate in the White House about how to revise an executive order from last year meant to give the president authority to respond to cyberattacks from overseas, but which did not originally cover efforts to influence the electoral system. The Obama administration last year rolled the order out to great fanfare as a way to punish and deter foreign hackers who harm the United States\u2019 economic or national security. The threat to use it last year helped wring a pledge out of China\u2019s president that his country would cease hacking U.S. companies\u2019 secrets to benefit Chinese firms. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) But officials this fall concluded that it could not, as written, be used to punish the most significant cyber-provocation in recent memory against the United States \u2014 Russia\u2019s hacking of Democratic organizations, targeting of state election systems and meddling in the presidential election . With the clock ticking, the White House is working on adapting the authority to punish the Russians, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. President Obama last week pledged there would be a response to Moscow\u2019s interference in the U.S. elections. Russia had denied involvement in the hacking. One clear way to use the order against the Russian suspects would be to declare the electoral systems part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d of the United States. Or it could be amended to clearly apply to the new threat \u2014 interfering in elections. Administration officials would also like to make it difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to roll back any action they take. \u201cPart of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,\u201d said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Obama issued the executive order in April 2015, creating the sanctions tool as a way to hold accountable people who harm computer systems related to critical functions such as electricity generation or transportation or who gain a competitive advantage through cybertheft of commercial secrets. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a news conference in November 2014 in Beijing. (Feng Li/Getty Images) The order allows the government to freeze the assets in the United States of people overseas who have engaged in cyber acts that have threatened U.S. national security or financial stability. The sanctions would also block commercial transactions with the designated individuals and bar their entry into the country. But just a year later, a Russian military spy agency would hack into the Democratic National Committee and steal a trove of emails that were released a few months later on WikiLeaks, U.S. officials said. Other releases followed, including the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. \u201cFundamentally, it was a low-tech, high-impact event,\u201d said Zachary Goldman, a sanctions and national security expert at New York University School of Law. And the 2015 executive order was not crafted to target hackers who steal emails and dump them on WikiLeaks or seek to disrupt an election. \u201cIt was an authority published at a particular time to address a particular set of problems,\u201d he said. So officials \u201cneed to engage in some legal acrobatics to fit the DNC hack into an existing authority, or they need to write a new authority,\u201d Goldman said. Administration officials would like Obama to use the power before leaving office to demonstrate its utility. \u201cWhen the president came into office, he didn\u2019t have that many tools out there to use as a response\u201d to malicious cyber-acts, said Ari Schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council. \u201cHaving the sanctions tool is really a big one. It can make a very strong statement in a way that is less drastic than bombing a country and more impactful than sending out a cable from the State Department.\u201d The National Security Council concluded that it would not be able to use the authority against Russian hackers because their malicious activity did not clearly fit under its terms, which require harm to critical infrastructure or the theft of commercial secrets. \u201cYou would (a) have to be able to say that the actual electoral infrastructure, such as state databases, was critical infrastructure, and (b) that what the Russians did actually harmed it,\u201d said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThose are two high bars.\u201d Though Russian government hackers are believed to have penetrated at least one state voter-registration database, they did not tamper with the data, officials said. Some analysts believe that state election systems would fit under \u201cgovernment facilities,\u201d which is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security. Another option is to use the executive order against other Russian targets \u2014 say, hackers who stole commercial secrets \u2014 and then, in either a public message or a private one, make clear that the United States considers its electoral systems to be critical infrastructure. The idea is to not only punish but also deter. \u201cAs much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,\u201d a second official said. \u201cI am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, \u2018That worked pretty well in 2016, so let\u2019s keep going.\u2019 We have elections every two years in this country.\u201d Even the threat of sanctions can have deterrent value. Officials and experts point to the agreement Chinese President Xi Jinping reached with Obama last year that his country would stop commercial cyberspying. Xi came to the table following news reports last summer that the administration was preparing to sanction Chinese companies. Complicating matters, the Trump transition team has not yet had extensive briefings with the White House on cyber issues, including the potential use of the cyber-sanctions order. The slow pace has caused consternation among officials, who fear that the administration\u2019s accomplishments in cybersecurity could languish if the next administration fails to understand their value. [ Trump turning away intelligence briefers since election win ] Sanctions are not a silver bullet. Obama noted that \u201cwe already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians\u201d for their activities in Ukraine. So it is questionable, some experts say, whether adding new ones would have a meaningful effect in changing the Kremlin\u2019s behavior. But in combination with other measures, they could be effective. Criminal indictments of Russians might become an option, officials said, but the FBI has so far not gathered enough evidence that could be introduced in a criminal case. At one point, federal prosecutors and FBI agents in San Francisco considered indicting Guccifer 2.0, a nickname for a person or people believed to be affiliated with the Russian influence operation and whose true identity was unknown. Before the election, the administration used diplomatic channels to warn Russia. Obama spoke to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin at a Group of 20 summit in China in September. About a week before the election, the United States sent a \u201chotline\u201d-style message to Moscow using a special channel for crisis communication created in 2013 as part of the State Department\u2019s Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. As part of that message, the officials said, the administration asked Russia to stop targeting state voter registration and election systems. It was the first use of that system. The Russians, officials said, appeared to comply. Read more: ",

The reaction to Lauren Duca, a writer for Teen Vogue magazine, is the latest example of how ugliness in political discourse didn\u2019t end with the election. Duca has been sharing several of the responses to her television appearance on social media. She was a guest on Carlson\u2019s show Friday to discuss an incident where Donald Trump\u2019s daughter was verbally accosted while traveling on an airplane with her family. Duca had tweeted that Ivanka Trump\u2019s role in the incoming administration was fair game for discussion.\u00a0 Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world. Don't let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good. \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 23, 2016 The segment was knocked off-kilter, however, when Duca agreed with Carlson that it was wrong for Ivanka Trump to be confronted on an airplane. Carlson had been prepared to question Duca about her tweet and other things she had written that had been critical of Donald Trump. The two went toe-to-toe in what became gripping television, with Duca at one point calling Carlson a \u201cpartisan hack\u201d intent on not allowing her to speak. Carlson, making reference to pop culture stories Duca had also written, ended the segment by saying Duca should \u201cstick to the thigh-high boots. You\u2019re better at that.\u201d Duca said she was \u201cshell-shocked\u201d after the interview but also proud. She found it frustrating to be involved in just the sort of discussion she found infuriating during the presidential campaign, with people who seemed to be talking past each other. Then the online attacks began, many too lewd to repeat. She saw an online discussion board created to encourage people \u201cto harass me until I have a mental breakdown or go into porn.\u201d\u00a0 Duca shared some of them on Twitter. Messages like this -- positioning sexual assault as a means of keeping women in line -- make me want to fight even harder. pic.twitter.com/gtvMGQ9cpx \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 27, 2016 She said she responded to one person, asking whether it felt odd to attack a stranger on Christmas Day. \u201cHe wrote back saying \u2018get raped,\u2019 so that didn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. Her phone appeared to have a life of its own on Christmas. \u201cIt was like it was having a seizure in the corner and I would go look at it every couple of hours,\u201d she said. Duca said she found it discouraging that many people accused her of defending the person who accosted Ivanka Trump, when she clearly did not. The headline on a story about the incident in The Daily Caller, a website co-founded by Carlson in 2010, said \u201cTucker Carlson embarrasses feminist who defended harassing Ivanka.\u201d There was no immediate comment from Fox. Duca has also been re-tweeting several of the messages she\u2019s received, even with a twist of humor: correcting the grammar, for instance, of someone who wrote \u201cyour a scumbag whore.\u201d As a woman online, she said she\u2019s experienced sexist attacks before, but never on this level. \u201cIt feels Victorian,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very bizarre to experience this firsthand.\u201d She also said she\u2019s been encouraged by positive responses from people like Larry Wilmore and writers she admires. One person wrote to say that her teenage daughter called her a \u201chero\u201d for how she responded in the interview. She intends to write back to a person who identified herself as a Trump supporter but liked what she did in the interview.\u00a0 The rape threats are truly challenging my faith in humanity, but this makes it all feel worth it. Love trumps hate. pic.twitter.com/DiIZAcFNOQ \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 25, 2016 Her Twitter following had doubled to more than 104,000 by Tuesday afternoon. She had a similar burst of attention earlier this month after a Teen Vogue article that accused Trump of lying. \u201cI feel like I have to weather this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal is to silence me, and I can\u2019t let them silence me.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Michael Cavna December 27 at 2:30 PM Follow @comicriffs Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford in their iconic \u201cStar Wars\u201d roles. (20th Century Fox/AP) FROM THE very beginning, George Lucas knew he had a life force of a young actress on his hands. When first casting his \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, creator-director Lucas seriously considered such other budding teenage talents as Jodie Foster and Terri Nunn. Yet Carrie Fisher, still barely an adult at the time, had a silly, fun-loving presence that melded well with future co-stars Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford during auditions. She also had a precocious sense of self \u2014 a quick mind and a feisty steeliness of spine. In short, Fisher reminded Lucas of his own younger sister. The combination would prove to be perfect for her role as Princess Leia, the iconic character for which she would become most known. \u201cFisher had a wicked sense of humor and a foul mouth \u2014 fueled at times by a drug habit she managed to keep mostly hidden \u2014 and she had no trouble at all playing a tough-talking princess,\u201d Brian Jay Jones wrote in his new biography, \u201cGeorge Lucas: A Life.\u201d Everything about Fisher, in fact, seemed irrepressible on set, from her blunt honesty to her physical vitality. \u201cLucas didn\u2019t want her looking too aggressively feminine, using gaffer\u2019s tape to hold down her breasts,\u201d wrote Jones, who quoted Fisher\u2019s memories of that time: \u201cNo breasts bounce in space, no jiggling in the Empire,\u201d Fisher snickered, as quoted in Jones\u2019s book. \u201c[Producer] Gary Kurtz had to tell me that. George didn\u2019t have the nerve.\u201d (Later in the original trilogy, of course, Lucas would pivot on that sexuality, costuming Fisher in the infamous chain-mail bikini as a slave of Jabba the Hutt. Fisher would recount personal anecdotes from those scenes in her wonderful one-woman show \u201cWishful Drinking.\u201d) Yet as much joy and swagger as Fisher embodied during filming, she was still a green actress who had only recently had a bit role in \u201cShampoo\u201d (in which her character memorably flirts and sleeps with the considerably older hairdresser played by Warren Beatty). At 19, insecurities plagued her. \u201cShe never felt she was pretty enough, disliked her earmuff hairstyle, couldn\u2019t decide what accent she should be using, and fretted about dropping her prop gun during her swing over a chasm with Hamill \u2014 but also worried that if she expressed any displeasure or discomfort, she would be replaced by Jodie Foster or any of the countless other actresses had rejected for the role,\u201d Jones wrote of Fisher, who, though already quite lithe, was told to lose 10 pounds for the role. Look back at the life and accomplishments of the best-selling author and \"Star Wars\" actress. (Gillian Brockell,Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) As Fisher recently revealed in her memoir \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d she found comfort and reassurance in beginning a steamy affair with the then-married Ford (who portrayed Han Solo), who was in his early 30s. Last year, Fisher and\u00a0Ford reunited on screen, as\u00a0estranged parents of a son who has gone to the dark side in the blockbuster smash \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d Portraying Gen. Leia Organa, Fisher was again subjected to the double standard of harsher body scrutiny for women, both in Hollywood and on social media. Yet Fisher owned the occasion, marrying her characteristic winning honesty and beautifully blunt wit with the gravitas of lived-in wisdom. On press tours for the film, she quipped. She championed. And as always, she charmed. We, in other words, got to fall in love with Carrie Fisher\u2019s crucial attachment to Star Wars all over again. She long had a love/hate relationship with the Leia role, yet she spoke often of accepting all the good that the role brought her. Carrie Fisher died Tuesday in Los Angeles, shortly after a massive heart attack. She was 60. And she was beloved, by co-stars and fans alike the globe over. \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 27, 2016 I thought I had got what I wanted under the tree. I didn't. In spite of so many thoughts and prayers from so many. I am very, very sad. \u2014 Anthony Daniels (@ADaniels3PO) December 27, 2016 I'm deeply saddened at the news of Carrie's passing.

When [director George Lucas] showed me the outfit, I thought he was kidding and it made me very nervous. I had to sit very straight because I couldn\u2019t have lines on my sides, like little creases. No creases were allowed, so I had to sit very, very rigid straight \u2026 What redeems it is I get to kill him, which was so enjoyable. ... I sawed his neck off with that chain that I killed him with. I really relished that because I hated wearing that outfit and sitting there rigid straight, and I couldn\u2019t wait to kill him.\u201d After \u201cThe Return of the Jedi\u201d in 1983, Fisher struggled with alcoholism, drug use and mental illness. She wrote in her memoir \u00a0\u201cThe Princess Diarist\u201d that she was first introduced to drugs at age 13. Fisher started dating singer Paul Simon while filming \u201cStar Wars\u201d in 1977, and they married in 1983 at their apartment in New York City. They divorced after just one year, but they continued to date on and off for a decade afterward.\u00a0 View Gallery Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford as Luke Skywaker, Princess Leia and Han Solo in scene from \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\u201d In 1987, she published her first book, \u201cPostcards from the Edge\u201d -- a thinly-veiled fictionalized telling of her drug use, time in rehab and her relationship with her mother. The book was turned into a film with the same name, starring Shirley MacLaine as Debbie and Meryl Streep as Fisher in 1990. She told CBS News in 2004 that writing had become her passion. \u00a0On her website, Fisher is credited as \u201cone of the top script doctors in Hollywood\u201d for polishing screenplays from 1991 to 2005.\u00a0 \u201cEverything worked out very well in books,\u201d Fisher told \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201c[It\u2019s] much more organized and ordered than everything out here.\u201d Fisher wrote six more books \u2013 \u201cDelusions of Grandma,\u201d \u201cSurrender the Pink,\u201d \u201cThe Best Awful,\u201d \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d which she adapted from her one-woman show, \u201cShockaholic,\u201d and the \u201cThe Princess Diarist.\u201d Fisher and Hollywood power agent Bryan Lourd were in a relationship in the 1990s and had a daughter, but Lourd eventually left her for a man. She described the situation as \u201chumiliating,\u201d although she said they kept a civil relationship for the sake of their daughter, Billie. \u201cI wanted Billie to see we could be friends, because I never had that with my own parents. I\u2019m glad I got Billie a good dad; he\u2019s everything my father wasn\u2019t \u2013 including gay!\u201d Fisher said in \u00a02011 . Billie, now 24, is also an actress, currently starring in the Fox series \u201cScream Queens.\u201d Actresses Carrie Fisher (L) and Billie Lourd embrace as they arrive at the premiere of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d in Hollywood, California, Dec. 14, 2015. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters Fisher has long been open about living with bipolar disorder. In 2005, she told CBS \u2019 \u201cThe Early Show\u201d she was diagnosed early in her life. \u201cI had a shrink say to me \u2026 \u2018Did you forget to tell me that you were hyperactive as a child?\u2019 Slipped my mind after four years. But Billie does not have any signs of having this thing. My father was one of four children and the only one that, you know, was lucky enough to have won the sweepstakes.\u201d\u00a0 Fisher remained on the stage throughout the years. She performed \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d as a one-woman show from 2006-07, and it later became an HBO special in 2010. \u00a0Fisher appeared in several films since \u201cStar Wars,\u201d including roles in \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and a cameo in \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery.\u201d In 2015, she and the other original stars of \u201cStar Wars\u201d reprised their roles in \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d \u00a0 Fisher told CBS in 2004 that the way she told her life story \u201cbetter be funny.\u201d \u201cIf my life wasn\u2019t funny,\u201d she said, \u201cit would just be true and that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Amy Adams communicates with aliens in 'Arrival.' (Photo: Jan Thijs) USA TODAY film critic\u00a0Brian Truitt tackled a year full of unnecessary sequels, talking animals\u00a0and countless mediocre projects with A-list actors\u00a0to put together his top 10. Let\u2019s start with 2016\u2019s best movie, which happens to be a thought-provoking work that involves talking to aliens. MOVIE OF THE YEAR Arrival If giant flying orbs suddenly scooted into our atmosphere and randomly hovered over a dozen cities, most likely we\u2019d freak out first, ask them questions later. In Arrival, though, a linguistics expert (Amy Adams) and a theoretical physicist (Jeremy Renner) are quickly tapped to determine why aliens are here and, oh, also figure out their entire language. There\u2019s a lot of beauty to be had in director Denis Villeneuve\u2019s sci-fi film: the gorgeous landscape of a world made wondrous with these spacecraft; the inky circular splotches given meaning like alien text messages; and the lyrical flashbacks that paint a loving picture of the linguist and the daughter she loses\u00a0too early. Extraterrestrials aside, Arrival explores how miscommunication is a part of human nature to be\u00a0overcome while at the same time being\u00a0a cinematic poem about choosing life and love when despair and loss are inevitable. It's a work that doesn\u2019t just invite multiple viewings but requires them. Review: 'Arrival' and Amy Adams are out-of-this-world amazing THE REST OF THE TOP 10\u00a0(in alphabetical order) Captain America (Chris Evans) and Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) are two guys who go way back in 'Captain America: Civil War.' \u00a0(Photo: Marvel) Captain America: Civil War. Marvel is again the class act of the comic-book ranks, with the superhero battle to end all superhero battles involving an airport, a Spider-Man, a Giant-Man and a Star Wars\u00a0reference. But the movie at its core is a powerful narrative about personal freedoms and one man having the back of his best pal. ",

Honolulu\u2019s Caf\u00e9 8 \u00bd gets rave reviews on Yelp for its \u201cRadiatore Verde\u201d and \u201cItalian stir fry,\u201d among other popular dishes at the eclectic mom-and-pop restaurant \u2013 but the response to its new 'policy' barring pro-Trump patrons has been decidedly more mixed. A bright yellow, handmade sign posted on the restaurant's front glass door declares: \u201cIf you voted for Trump you cannot eat here! No Nazis.\u201d A photo of the sign was shared with FoxNews.com. One also is proudly posted on the caf\u00e9\u2019s Facebook page, and was \u201cliked\u201d by some 40 people.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026The next time you're in Honolulu, eat lunch here, not only are they on the right side of things, the food is delicious and reasonable,\u201d one Facebook user wrote next to the photo. Others aren\u2019t so charmed. Honolulu resident and Donald Trump voter Susan Roberts\u00a0told FoxNews.com she found the sign in \u201cextreme poor taste.\u201d \u201cIt's childish and very unprofessional,\u201d she said in an email. \u201c\u2026 The restaurant owner doesn't have to worry ... I will not be stepping foot in that establishment.\u201d Willes Lee, former chairman of the Hawaii Republican Party and now president of National Federation of Republican Assemblies, told\u00a0FoxNews.com the sign is discriminatory, and harkens back to \u201cracist and hate-filled\u201d days\u00a0before statehood. \u201cRemember when\u00a0Filipinos couldn't go in certain places, or Japanese\u00a0wouldn't be\u00a0allowed [in] many\u00a0homes? And,\u00a0it didn't matter who they voted for,\u201d said Lee, who is of Japanese\u00a0descent.\u00a0 \u201cPeople should be able to get food without hearing a political message,\u201d one apparent former customer\u00a0 wrote on Yelp . \u201cI will never go back.\u201d\u00a0 According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, the caf\u00e9 was founded by Robert Warner, a former hair stylist for Vidal Sassoon in San Francisco and former restaurateur in Seattle, along with his wife Jali. Reached for comment Tuesday, Jali downplayed the sign's supposed ban. She told FoxNews.com the restaurant is not actually asking customers whether they voted for President-elect Trump, and said even if they see a customer with a Trump shirt,\u00a0\u201cwe don\u2019t put anything different [in] your food.\u201d \u201cRobert just wants to express how much he doesn\u2019t like Trump,\u201d Jali said. \u201cIf people take it personally or it hurts them, we cannot help. That\u2019s why we say they have [a] choice if they want to come or not come. We don\u2019t force them.\u201d She said three people called to complain about the sign when it first went up, \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create trouble,\u201d Jali said. \u201cThere is enough trouble in the world.\u201d\u00a0 While Jali is soft-spoken, Warner, some customers note, is known to channel the \u201csoup Nazi\u201d persona of New York City and \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fame -- \u201cthrowing pots and pans,\u201d \u201ctelling off customers,\u201d and \u201changing not-so-friendly reminders on butcher paper for his customers to read.\u201d\u00a0 But another Yelp reviewer took issue with the attitude and the sign, writing:\u00a0\u201cIt was funny on Seinfeld, but this place can rot away. Stay away. Hawaii ain't like this. There's a lot of better places on the island than to have deal with extra crap like this.\u201d\u00a0 Hawaii overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton during the Nov. 8 election, and historically has supported Democrats in local and national races.\u00a0In fact, just six Republicans are in the 51-member House, and the 25-member\u00a0Senate is GOP-free. Now that the election is over, however, Lee said most residents want to just get on with their lives. \u201cThe [restaurant] owners might want to make a better sign,\u201d he said, \u201csince Trump will undoubtedly be in office for eight years.\u201d Advertisement ",

China says in a white paper released Tuesday that it is determined to speed up the development of its space industry. While Russia and the United States have more experience in space travel, China's military-backed program has already made steady progress in a comparatively short time. Since China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, it has staged a spacewalk, landed a rover on the moon, and launched two experimental space stations. The white paper reiterated plans to launch China's first Mars probe to explore and bring back samples of the red planet by 2020. 0 Shares ",

A red light camera keeps watch over the intersection at Western Avenue and Van Buren Street Tuesday, March 10, 2015 in Chicago. (Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune) Bill Ruthhart Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Federal prosecutors have reached a deal with the original company behind Chicago's scandal-plagued red-light camera program two months after the firm's former chief executive officer was sentenced to prison time for her role in a kickback scheme. Under the terms of the deal secured by the U.S. Justice Department and announced Tuesday, prosecutors in Chicago and Columbus, Ohio, will not prosecute Redflex Traffic Systems if the company continues to cooperate with the two federal probes. In announcing the agreement, the Chicago U.S. attorney's office cited Redflex's \"extensive and thorough cooperation over recent years.\" The scandal, first reported by the Chicago Tribune, centered on then-city transportation official John Bills steering $100 million in contracts to Redflex in exchange for $2 million in bribes. As part of the nonprosecution agreement, Redflex will have to pay restitution to the city that will be determined as part of pending civil lawsuit City Hall brought against the company. The scheme helped grow the city's camera program to the largest in the nation. At its peak, 384 cameras were operating across the city, raking in more than $600 million in automated traffic fines. ",

    "text": "Trump Says UN Just a Club for People to 'Have a Good Time' By vivian salama, associated press WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u0097 Dec 26, 2016, 10:29 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump, President Obama Square Off 0 Shares Email Days after the United Nations voted to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, Donald Trump questioned its effectiveness Monday, saying it's just a club for people to \"have a good time.\" The president-elect wrote on Twitter that the U.N. has \"such great potential,\" but it has become \"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!\" On Friday, Trump warned, \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" referring to the day he takes office. The decision by the Obama administration to abstain from Friday's U.N. vote brushed aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership. Trump told The Associated Press last December that he wanted to be \"very neutral\" on Israel-Palestinian issues. But his tone became decidedly more pro-Israel as the presidential campaign progressed. He has spoken disparagingly of Palestinians, saying they have been \"taken over\" by or are condoning militant groups. Trump's tweet Monday about the U.N. ignores much of the work that goes on in the 193-member global organization. This year the U.N. Security Council has approved over 70 legally binding resolutions, including new sanctions on North Korea and measures tackling conflicts and authorizing the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping operations around the world. The General Assembly has also approved dozens of resolutions on issues, like the role of diamonds in fueling conflicts; condemned human rights abuses in Iran and North Korea; and authorized an investigation of alleged war crimes in Syria. Trump's criticism of the U.N. is by no means unique. While the organization does engage in large-scale humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, its massive bureaucracy has long been a source of controversy. The organization has been accused by some Western governments of being inefficient and frivolous, while developing nations have said it is overly influenced by wealthier nations. Trump tweeted later Monday, \"The world was gloomy before I won \u2014 there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10 percent and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!\" Markets are up since Trump won the general election, although not quite by that much. The Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 6 percent since Election Day, while the Dow has risen more than 8 percent. As for holiday spending, auditing and accounting firm Deloitte projected in September that total 2016 holiday sales were expected to exceed $1 trillion, representing a 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent increase in holiday sales from November through January. Finally, Trump took to Twitter again late Monday to complain about media coverage of his charitable foundation. He wrote that of the \"millions of dollars\" he has contributed to or raised for the Donald J. Trump Foundation, all of it \"is given to charity, and media won't report.\" Trump said Saturday he will dissolve his charitable foundation before taking office to avoid conflicts of interest. The New York attorney general's office has been investigating the foundation following media reports that foundation spending went to benefit Trump's campaign. The president-elect is spending the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He had no public schedule Monday. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Edith Lederer in New York contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

The gestures range from random acts of kindness, such as tipping a barmaid \u00a35,000 ($6121), because she was a student nurse struggling with debt, to even personally secretly volunteering at a homeless shelter. The 53-year-old pop star died on Christmas Day, but it appears his kindness will be remembered by the many people who he quietly helped, as well as his more public philanthropy to causes such as the Terrence Higgins Trust \u2014 a HIV charity. For instance in 2006 he held a free concert for the medical workers who had cared for his mother who died of cancer. At the concert he told the nurses \"Society calls what you do a vocation, and that means you don't get paid properly,\" he said, according to the BBC . \"I salute you.\" The pursuit began in 1984, his official online biography notes , when he performed with Band Aid, the musical charity that included everyone from Bono to Boy George. The proceeds of Band Aid's chart-topping single, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" went to Ethiopian famine relief.

His support, the Trust said in a statement Monday, continued for years. \"His donations contributed to a vision of a world where people living with HIV live healthy lives free from prejudice and discrimination,\" the statement said. \"Thanks to George's legacy, we are a step closer to that world and we are so grateful for his support and friendship over the years.\" But Michael was often quiet in his giving. The founder of Childline, which offers counselling services to children, on Monday said that the songwriter gave millions to the charity anonymously. \"No one outside the charity knew how much he gave to the nation's most vulnerable children,\" said Dame Esther Rantzen, according to NBC News's British partner ITN. A woman on 'Deal Or No Deal' told us she needed \u00a315k for IVF treatment. George Michael secretly phoned the next day and gave her the \u00a315k. \u2014 Richard Osman (@richardosman) December 26, 2016 And in a post on Twitter , the English game show host Richard Osman recalled Monday that after a contesttant on \"Deal Or No Deal\" said that she needed 15,000 pounds for IVF, Michael secretly called the show the following day and provided the money. Another Twitter user , Emilyne Mondo , claimed that the star worked anonymously at the homeless shelter where she volunteered. \"I've never told anyone, he asked we didn't,\" Mondo wrote. \"That's who he was.\" I wrote in a piece ages ago about a celeb I'd worked with tipping a barmaid \u00a35k because she was a student nurse in debt.

The Abbott Laboratories campus in north suburban Abbott Park is seen in 2015. The company has received antitrust approval for its purchase of St. Jude Medical. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Ally Marotti Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Federal regulators greenlighted Abbott Laboratories' purchase of St. Jude Medical on Tuesday after the companies agreed to divest two medical device businesses. Abbott, based in north suburban Abbott Park, will sell the product lines to Tokyo-based Terumo Corp. to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the acquisition would harm competition. Abbott will divest its steerable sheaths, which are used to guide catheters for treating irregular heartbeats. Minnesota-based St. Jude will divest its vascular closure devices, which are used to seal punctures from procedures involving catheters. St. Jude has had a near-monopoly on steerable sheaths for more than a decade, and Abbott recently entered the market, according to an FTC news release. The merger would have eliminated any competition for the products, and given the combined companies more than 70 percent of the market for the vascular closure devices. \"We continue to work to obtain final regulatory approvals and anticipate closing before the end of the year or shortly thereafter,\" Abbott spokeswoman Elissa Maurer said in a statement. The FTC also said Abbott must notify the federal agency if it plans to acquire assets for a device that provides feedback to physicians on the force catheters apply. Only St. Jude and one other company make those devices \u2014 called lesion-assessing ablation catheters \u2014 in the U.S. Abbott has a partnership with Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics to develop the catheters, so if it acquired the assets from that company after the acquisition, it would eliminate competition. The agreement will be subject to public comment for 30 days, then the commission will vote again on whether to make the agreement final. Abbott's stock was up almost half a percent to $38.60 at market close Tuesday. St. Jude's stock was up 0.4 percent to $80.15. ",

Carrie Fisher, seen in June 2013, at Supanova Pop Culture Expo at Homebush in Sydney, Australia. TRACEY NEARMY / EPA During a Nov. 21 appearance on TODAY, Fisher showed no sign of being ill while she bantered with the hosts and dished about her affair with co-star Harrison Ford. Photo Gallery: Carrie Fisher: Actress, Author and 'Princess' \"It was a three-month one-night stand,\" she said. But on a flight from London back home to Los Angeles last Friday, Fisher went into cardiac arrest. Sources said members of the United flight crew, joined by a doctor and a nurse on board, performed emergency measures on her. Lucas said in a statement that Fisher \"was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved.\" \"In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess \u2014 feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think,\" he said. \"My heart and prayers are with Billie, Debbie and all Carrie's family, friends and fans. She will be missed by all.\" Co-star Harrison Ford echoed the sentiment, and said in a statement that \"Carrie was one-of-a-kind ... brilliant, original. Funny and emotionally fearless. She lived her life, bravely.\" So many thanks to the United flight crew who jumped into action, and the awesome doctor and nurse passengers who helped \u2014 Anna Akana (@AnnaAkana) December 23, 2016 Born October 21, 1956, Fisher was Hollywood royalty before she became a member of the fictional Organa royal family in the \"Star Wars\" movies. The daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds, Fisher was just two when her parents divorced and she went to live briefly with starlet Elizabeth Taylor. Reynolds thanked those who \"embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter\" in a post on Facebook following Fisher's death, adding, \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop.\" Post by NBC News . Following in her mother's footsteps, Fisher made her film debut in the 1975 movie \"Shampoo.\" But it was her turn as the tough-talking princess who defies the Evil Empire in \"Star Wars\" two years later that rocketed her into fame and turned her into a feminist icon at the tender age of 19. And she relished the role. \"And as much as I may have joked about 'Star Wars' over the years, I liked that I was in those films,\" she later wrote in her autobiography. \"Particularly as the only girl in an all-boy fantasy. They were fun to make. It was an anecdote of unimaginable standing.\" In 1983, Fisher became a sex symbol for a whole generation of \"Star Wars\" fans when she appeared in a memorable metal bikini chained to the villainous Jabba the Hutt in \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi.\" \"What's funny is I wish I had known I was a sex symbol,\" she later told The New York Daily News. \"That's so odd. Because I don't think that way. I don't look at myself even remotely that way.\" Carrie Fisher on the set of \"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\" directed by Welsh Richard Marquand. Sunset Boulevard / Corbis via Getty Images Fisher went on to appear in other movies, landing scene-stealing supporting roles in \"The Blue Brothers,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\" and \"The Burbs.\" Recently, Fisher played the annoying mother in a British TV comedy called \"Catastrophe\" that streams on Amazon. In 1987, Fisher published her first novel \"Postcards from the Edge,\" a semi-autobiographical book that drew on her real-life battles with drug addiction, bipolar disorder and her fraught relationship with her mother. It was a bestseller that was turned into a 1990 movie starring Meryl Streep and Shirley Maclaine. Fisher continued making movies and became one of Hollywood's most in-demand script doctors. She also found a new generation of fans with appearances on shows as varied as \"Entourage,\" \"30 Rock,\" and \"Sex and the City.\" She also was the voice of Peter Griffin's boss Angela on \"Family Guy.\" In 2014, Fisher confirmed that she was reuniting with Ford and Mark Hamill in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" Carrie Fisher on the set of \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" directed by Irvin Kershner. Sunset Boulevard / Corbis via Getty Images But after the movie came out, the actress was barraged with hateful tweets from body shamers who said she'd aged badly. Fisher fired right back at them. Two years later, Fisher released her tell-all book, that included her claim of an affair with Ford and the admission that she thought her days as Princess Leia were over. \"I was surprised. As surprised as you can be and still be so far over forty,\" she wrote. \"I mean, I thought they might make more Star Wars movies \u2014 not that I thought it all that much \u2014 but I doubted that I would find myself in them. And now it looked like I would! Hallelujah!\" Fisher was in a long-term relationship with musician Paul Simon and married to him for a year before they divorced in 1984. From 1991 to 1994, she was involved with talent agent Bryan Lourd \u2014 a relationship that produced her one child, actress Billie Lourd. She was also briefly engaged to comedian and actor Dan Aykroyd, whom she met on the set of \"The Blues Brothers.\" Funeral plans are not yet finalized. Andrew Blankstein ",

The Post moved to this new building on Washington's K Street in December 2015. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images The Washington Post expects to hire more than 60 journalists in the coming months \u2014 a sign of remarkable growth for a newspaper in the digital age. After a year of record traffic and digital advertising revenue, the Post newsroom will grow by more than 8 percent, to more than 750 people. The extent of the newsroom expansion was first reported by Politico. The Post will add a \"rapid-response\" investigative team, expand its video journalism and breaking news staff, and make additional investments in podcasts and photography. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos bought the Post in October 2013 and reportedly invested $50 million in the company last year. That investment is paying off, according to a memo from publisher Fred Ryan that said the Post is now \"a profitable and growing company.\" Ryan said the Post's online traffic had increased by nearly 50 percent in the past year, and new subscriptions have grown by 75 percent, more than doubling digital subscription revenue. Meanwhile, subscriptions at The New York Times have also surged. Times CEO Mark Thompson said on CNBC that the paper added 132,000 new subscribers in the 18 days after the election, a tenfold increase over the same period a year ago. The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal also reported record growth in subscriptions. Article continues after sponsorship In June, Donald Trump revoked the Post's press credentials at his campaign events, before lifting the ban on the Post and other news organizations two months later.

    "text": "Trump Inauguration Security Planners Brace for Wave of Protesters By NICHOLAS FANDOS Photo Workers building viewing stands at the Capitol for President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters WASHINGTON \u2014 Security surrounding the inauguration of Donald J. Trump is proving to be the most challenging in recent history, according to senior officials involved in its planning, largely because of the same forces of political rancor that shaped the race for the presidency. On top of the daunting threats to any inaugural ceremony, the three dozen agencies responsible for security at the Jan. 20 festivities are preparing for the possibility of large numbers of protesters flooding the capital, along with what may be nearly a million supporters of Mr. Trump. The agencies are worried about the possibility of confrontations between groups of Americans still deeply divided over the election \u2014 and at a moment when millions of people around the world will be turning their attention to Washington. At the very least, officials said, protests would put additional pressure on the region\u2019s already-stretched security apparatus. \u201cTo paraphrase Tolstoy: Each inauguration is risky, but each is risky in its own way,\u201d said Michael Chertoff, who was secretary of homeland security under President George W. Bush and oversaw the department for President Obama\u2019s first inauguration, in 2009. Photo The inaugural stage taking form in November. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times \u201cI can\u2019t think of an inauguration that presented more security challenges than this one,\u201d Mr. Chertoff said. Continue reading the main story There were, of course, heightened concerns for the second inauguration of Mr. Bush, in 2005, the first presidential swearing-in to follow the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And in 2009, Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration was the first transfer of power in the post-9/11 era \u2014 and the first in which an African-American was taking the oath of office. Mr. Obama faced a rash of racist threats, as well as concerns about a terrorist plot that ultimately proved unfounded but sent the president-elect and top aides scrambling on the eve of his swearing-in. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even so, Mr. Obama did not face the kind of large protests expected to greet Mr. Trump when he officially arrives in Washington. The 2009 crowd of nearly two million people, a record, included few, if any, protesters and did not lead to a single arrest, according to Christopher T. Geldart, the director of homeland security for the District of Columbia. The National Park Service, which controls much of the public land in Washington, from sidewalks to the National Mall, has already seen permit requests from groups hoping to host events both for and against Mr. Trump skyrocket to 23. In typical inauguration years, the agency receives just a handful of requests. Safeguarding the nation\u2019s peaceful transfer of power is no easy task even under the most predictable of circumstances. There are few higher-profile rituals in American public life than the swearing-in of a new president. Inauguration Schedule The Presidential Inaugural Committee has released a schedule for the Inauguration. There are also several protests planned, including the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Jan. 21. From the Metropolitan Police of Washington to the National Park Service to the F.B.I., a vast overlapping patchwork of intelligence analysts, military personnel and law enforcement officers numbering in the tens of thousands will be working to protect the inauguration and related activities. In total, more than three dozen agencies spread out across the capital will be working to prevent the occasion from becoming a platform for individuals or groups looking to do harm. Their work, begun months ago, has taken on a new urgency since Election Day and will soon include the imposition of a security perimeter around the Capitol, the Mall and large parts of the city. The costs of security alone are expected to exceed $100 million. Protecting the new president, the thousands of dignitaries who will be on hand and the crowds is the top priority of federal intelligence, law enforcement and military agencies, as it has been at inaugurations since the Sept. 11 attacks. Threats, from abroad and from homegrown extremists alike, remain a chief concern, current and former officials said. \u201cWhat the intelligence community says publicly is what they say privately, and that is more threats from more directions than ever before,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who is chairman of the congressional committee planning the inaugural ceremony. \u201cAnd that just means the Capitol Police and the security elements need to be more thoughtful and alert than ever to what could happen.\u201d But this time, security forces \u2014 particularly law enforcement officers who will be on the ground here \u2014 are also preparing to confront crowds of Americans who are unusually divided and anxious over the election results. The priority, officials said, is to avoid the kind of violent clashes that periodically flared up on the campaign trail between Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters and those who opposed him, while allowing groups on both sides to carry on with events. Photo News photographers with a model of the White House on a giant planning map used in preparations for the inauguration. Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press \u201cEverybody knows how contentious the campaign was,\u201d said Mr. Geldart, the District of Columbia homeland security director. \u201cHonestly, what really keeps me up at night around this is the ability for us to just allow folks to come in, express their views and leave safely.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said the agency was \u201cactively reviewing\u201d permit requests, with a goal of trying to accommodate as many events as possible. Groups that are granted permits will be spaced out to try to prevent mixing, Mr. Geldart said. The largest of those events, the so-called Women\u2019s March on Washington , was granted a permit for about 200,000 people to rally and then march in protest against Mr. Trump on Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration. Boris Epshteyn, the communications director for Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural planning committee, said the group welcomed the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of First Amendment rights \u201cas long as it is done peacefully and within all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\u201d Just how many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters will attend remains unclear. The planning committee said it was expecting two million to three million people. Such a crowd would be a record, though Mr. Geldart said his team had yet to see evidence that would cause it to revise its own estimates of 800,000 to 900,000 people. The security effort will require virtually the full strength of the region\u2019s law enforcement agencies, as well as significant reinforcements. More than 3,200 police officers from departments across the country and about 8,000 members of the National Guard will be on hand to help with basic crowd and traffic control around the city. An additional 5,000 active duty service members will be on hand to serve in ceremonial capacities. Photo President-elect Barack Obama and President George W. Bush in 2009, at the inauguration ceremony of the 44th president of the United States. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Mr. Geldart said those forces would allow local agencies better versed in crowd management tactics to monitor the protesters and pro-Trump groups, in person and with the help of social media. The security planning covers not just Inauguration Day itself but also a week of public and private events planned to celebrate Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, beginning with a welcome concert on the National Mall on Jan. 19. Thomas Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who is leading the inaugural planning committee, said each of those events had been carefully negotiated with the Secret Service and its partners. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal security was made somewhat simpler when he decided he would stay at Blair House, as his modern predecessors have, rather than at his new hotel in Washington, as was once under consideration. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s their party and we\u2019re there to develop the operation security plan to make their party safe,\u201d said James Murray, the deputy assistant director of the Secret Service\u2019s office of protective operations, which has overall responsibility for inaugural security. \u201cBut by all means it\u2019s certainly a back-and-forth kind of thing.\u201d Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

By Philip Bump December 27 at 9:41 AM Follow @pbump Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 21. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Donald Trump's depiction of the state of the American economy has consistently been as bleak as it is subjective. The unemployment numbers are fictional, he's claimed, with the real number perhaps as high as 42 percent! (It isn't anywhere close.) President Obama's never achieved 3 percent growth in a year, a first for a modern president! (True when you look at calendar years and presidents after Herbert Hoover .) But Americans don't often take the big picture view on the economy, either. How the country is faring economically is as subjective for us as it seems to be for Trump. Setting up a long-term question: When Trump's depiction of the Trump economy turns suddenly sunny, will America agree? That process began Monday evening, with another tweet from the president-elect. The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016 There are three economic indicators in that tweet, by our estimation: economic confidence (the measure of hope, if you will), the Dow Jones industrial average and holiday spending. (Why \u201choliday\u201d vs. \u201cChristmas\u201d? We'll get to that, but it's not because we've declared war on the Christian holiday.) Here's how those numbers look. Economic confidence spiked after the election of Trump, according to data from Gallup . The effect is pretty remarkable, in fact. What's going on here? Last month, Gallup explained the switch in one simple word: partisanship. \u201cRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economy's outlook than they did before the election,\u201d Gallup's Justin McCarthy and Jeffrey M. Jones wrote. \u201cJust 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse.\u201d Put another way: More than 8 in 10 Republicans were pessimistic about the economy before the election \u2014 but immediately after, more were optimistic than pessimistic. The hope, in other words, had a partisan tinge, just like everything else . The Dow Jones industrial average reflects confidence, too. Trump's right that the index is up nearly 10 percent since Election Day. We looked at this surge earlier this month, putting it into historical context. It matches the post-election surges enjoyed by Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover (the president whose tenure overlapped with the Great Depression, meaning he, too, failed to hit Trump's arbitrary 3-percent-growth metric). The Dow has been flirting with the symbolic 20,000-point mark for some time; if it's surpassed, expect another Trump tweet. How much credit is due to Trump for the increase isn't entirely clear. The Dow is up 16 percent since the beginning of the year. At the end of March, relative to a month-and-a-half prior, the index was up 12.9 percent. Since Obama was elected in 2008, the Dow is up 107 percent \u2014 more than double \u2014 but he isn't usually described as the cause of that growth. What's more, Trump is setting up a risky connection: If the Dow does well thanks to him, what happens if and when it tanks? Last week, CNN Money reported that Trump probably deserves some credit for the improved Dow in the sense that a quarter of the spike is a function of Goldman Sachs's \u00a0improvement. Goldman's up nearly a third since Election Day, an improvement that overlaps with Trump tapping its president and several alumni for posts in his administration. The credit Trump claims for holiday spending, though, is far less due. The number he cites \u2014 a trillion dollars \u2014 appears to come from a Deloitte survey that projected holiday sales from November through January and reached that trillion-dollar number. Mind you, that survey was released in October, meaning that the projections had nothing to do with a Trump electoral win. Deloitte instead credited better household finances and the steadily improving economy for the figure. In fact, Deloitte's numbers specifically indicate that three-quarters of Americans didn't expect the presidential election to affect their spending at all. That tweet, though, offers another taste of what we can expect from President Trump, once he's inaugurated. Just as he railed against government figures during the campaign, we can expect him to isolate and exaggerate good economic news once he's in office. (Or, apparently, even before.) This isn't unique to Trump, of course; politicians, including Obama, aren't shy about highlighting the positives and downplaying the negatives. What makes Trump different is scale: His willingness to take credit or assign blame tends toward the extremes. In an article at Politico , AEI's James Pethokoukis neatly summarizes what President Trump's economic pronouncements might be like. \u201cThe president-elect judges his own personal wealth based on his own feelings,\u201d he said, referring to a comment Trump once made in a deposition . \u201cSo on any given day, he could just decide based on his feelings that America is great.\u201d The catch? If voters aren't convinced by November 2020 \u2014 if their subjective analysis of the economy doesn't match Trump's rhetoric \u2014 he's in for an awfully tough reelection. politics ",

The 13-year-old's father had just left the van to speak with someone in a house when two people came up and fired into the vehicle, police said. The 14-year-old was hit in the back and was taken to Comer Children's Hospital in critical condition. The 13-year-old was grazed in the arm and was taken to St. Bernard Hospital in good condition. The 2-year-old was unharmed, police said. Guglielmi said the father was a gang member and police \"are operating under the belief that the father was the intended target.\" Other shootings as the holiday weekend came to a close: -- Around 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, a 25-year-old woman was shot as she sat in a parked vehicle in the 3500 block of West Van Buren Street. Another vehicle approached and someone inside fired shots. She was hit in the buttocks and went to Stroger Hospital in good condition. -- Around 10:50 p.m. Monday, a 23-year-old man was grazed by a bullet in the Near West Side neighborhood. He was outside in the 200 block of South Leavitt Avenue when someone got out of a silver Ford Fusion, shouted gang slogans and opened fire, police said. The man was grazed in the right arm and listed in good condition at Stroger Hospital. -- About 8:55 p.m. in the 800 block of North Keeler Avenue, a 23-year-old man was hit in the buttocks and taken to a hospital, where his condition was stabilized, police said. -- Earlier in the West Englewood neighborhood, someone was wounded around 7:20 p.m. An 18-year-old man was shot in the 6700 block of South Wolcott Avenue and taken to Holy Cross Hospital for treatment. -- Two shootings happened in about a 15-minute span in rival gang territories in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. The first, about 5:40 p.m, happened in the 4800 block of South Bishop Street. A 34-year-old man was shot in the neck and drove to a fire station seeking treatment. Paramedics took him to Stroger Hospital, police said. Just after 5:50 p.m., someone was shot in the 4400 block of South Hermitage Street a few blocks away. The 23-year-old was walking when someone stepped out of a vehicle and fired shots, hitting him multiple times. The 23-year-old is in critical condition, and the 34-year-old's condition has been stabilized. Both are at Stroger Hospital. -- Around 5:25 p.m., a 45-year-old man was shot in the 4100 block of West Arthington Street and taken Mount Sinai Hospital. He had been in an argument just before getting shot, police said. -- Two people were shot in the 5800 block of South May Street in the\u00a0 Englewood neighborhood about 3:25 p.m. A 20-year-old man was taken to Stroger Hospital with a gunshot wound to his back and a 35-year-old man refused medical treatment for a graze wound. Someone in a dark-colored sedan fired shots and fled the scene, police said. -- A 22-year-old man walked into Advocate Trinity Hospital on the South Side around 2:45 p.m. with a gunshot wound suffered in the 7900 block of South Cottage Grove Avenue, police said. -- Around 11:20 a.m. in the 1800 block of South Ridgeway Avenue in North Lawndale, a 23-year-old man was shot in each leg. He was being treated at Mount Sinai Hospital, according to police. -- Around 10:40 a.m., a 24-year-old man was shot in the hand in the 400 block of West Marquette Road in Englewood, police said. Details weren't immediately available. -- In the 7000 block of South Indiana, in the Park Manor neighborhood about 9:30 a.m., an initial call went out for two people shot in the area of 78th Street. Police later said a 25-year-old man had a graze wound to his head and also was shot in a leg. A 26-year-old man was shot in the face. The men were able to get themselves to St. Bernard Hospital, where they were being treated. -- The first daylight shooting Monday happened about 9:25 a.m. in the 300 block of South Kostner Avenue. A 24-year-old man was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital with gunshot wounds to the ankle and leg. He was stable, authorities said. Police said he was in a car in the 4400 block of West Van Buren Street when he was shot and he fled to the 300 block of South Kostner, around the corner. The holiday weekend began with five teenagers shot within feet of each other in the South Austin neighborhood. At 3:30 p.m. Friday, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the 4900 block of West Kinzie Street. A little more than an hour later, four other teenagers were shot just feet away, in the 4900 block of West Hubbard Street. Their conditions had stabilized. ",

By Carol Morello and Ruth Eglash December 27 at 7:14 PM Follow @CMorelloWP Follow @reglash The Israeli government stepped up its running battle with the Obama administration on Tuesday, saying it had proof that the United States had orchestrated a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning settlement activity. \u201cWe have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,\u201d \u00adDavid Keyes, a spokesman for \u00adIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night.\u201d State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied that the administration had \u201cprecooked\u201d the resolution. But the U.S. explanation did little to quell fears in Israel that another Security Council censure may be forthcoming, even though U.S. officials insisted that no more U.N. resolutions are expected. Toner said the United States had abstained, allowing passage of the resolution , because it was \u201cbalanced\u201d \u2014 it also condemns Palestinian incitement to violence and terrorism \u2014 and because there was growing concern that increased settlement activity was imperiling a two-state solution. \u201cThis was a resolution that we could not in good conscience veto, because it condemns violence. It condemned incitement,\u201d Toner said. \u201cIt reiterates what has long been the overwhelming consensus internationally [on settlements], and it calls for the parties to take constructive steps to advance a two-state solution on the ground. There was nothing in there that would prompt us to veto that kind of resolution.\u201d (Reuters) [ Netanyahu summons U.S. envoy over U.N. anti-settlement resolution ] The Israeli allegation of U.S. collusion in the resolution appears to be linked to meetings Secretary of State John F. Kerry had in recent months with Palestinian and Egyptian diplomats and officials from resolution co-sponsor New Zealand, where Kerry stopped last month en route to Antarctica. State Department officials said no specific language was discussed. \u201cThere is no truth to the notion that we discussed the text of any resolution or that we previewed any position we might take on a hypothetical resolution in those meetings,\u201d said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment on the private meetings. Amid acrid bitterness in Israel over what is seen as the United States\u2019 failure to protect Israel in not using its veto, Kerry is returning to Washington from vacation to give a speech Wednesday \u00admorning outlining his vision for resolving the conflict between the \u00adIsraelis and Palestinians. There will be an end-to-an-era undertone to his remarks. With less than a month left before President Obama leaves office, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed that the U.S.-Israel relationship will be markedly different. [ Trump could soon discard a long-standing precedent on Israel ] But there appeared to be little chance that the Israeli government would heed the \u201cwake-up call\u201d Toner said he hoped the U.N. resolution would sound for Israel and curtail settlement activity. Israeli officials pressed ahead, preparing to approve construction permits Wednesday to build 600 new homes in East Jerusalem, which came under Israeli control after the 1967 war. Since Friday\u2019s vote, Netanyahu has summoned diplomats from countries that voted for the resolution and recalled Israel\u2019s ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal, two of the four countries that sponsored the resolution. Some right-wing members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition have called on him to ramp up settlement construction and have said Israel should annex parts of the West Bank. Meanwhile, new details started to emerge about the behind-the-scenes diplomatic scramble that preceded the resolution \u2014 \u00adapproved by a vote of 14 to 0 \u2014 declaring that Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have \u201cno legal validity\u201d and are a \u201cflagrant violation under international law.\u201d It calls the settlements an obstacle to achieving a two-state solution and peace with the Palestinians. A diplomat from a Security Council nation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, largely backed up the Obama administration\u2019s account that it played no role in bringing the resolution to a vote. It had been discussed among Security Council members for months, but the U.S. position was well known. The United States never told anyone how it would vote, not even in a consultation room where the 15 members of the Security Council gathered before they filed in to vote, according to the diplomat. The U.S. officials in attendance said they were still in \u201cconsultations\u201d over the resolution, the diplomat said. In Israel, the newspaper Haaretz reported that Britain, not the United States, appears to have been the driving force behind the resolution after Egypt, which had initially sponsored the resolution, withdrew. It described Netanyahu being sharp and caustic in a phone call to New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister, Murray McCully, calling the resolution \u201ca declaration of war.\u201d Haaretz said that Netanyahu vowed to recall Israel\u2019s ambassador to New Zealand but that McCully rebuffed the threat. The report said that after Egypt backed down, Palestinian and Arab Persian Gulf diplomats urged the four co-sponsoring nations to move on with the resolution anyway. The message was driven home by Britain, which had worked directly with the Palestinians on drafting the language. A last-minute glitch came up when Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, proposed postponing the vote until after Christmas, according to an interview the deputy Russian ambassador to Israel gave on Israel Army Radio. This reportedly followed a phone call between Netanyahu and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. The other Security Council ambassadors refused to wait, however. Read more: ",

Though Carrie Fisher is best known as Princess Leia from Star Wars, she has performed in many other acting roles and has had a successful career as a book author and screenplay doctor. Though Carrie Fisher is best known as Princess Leia from Star Wars, she has performed in many other acting roles and has had a successful career as a book author and screenplay doctor. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Carrie Fisher, a daughter of Hollywood royalty who gained pop-culture fame as Princess Leia in the original \"Star Wars\" and turned her struggles with addiction and mental illness into wickedly funny books, a hit film and a one-woman stage show, died Tuesday after falling ill aboard a flight last week. She was 60. \"Carrie was one of a kind ... brilliant, original. Funny and emotionally fearless. She lived her life, bravely,\" ''Star Wars\" co-star Harrison Ford said in a statement. Fisher, the daughter of actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, had been hospitalized since Friday, when paramedics responded to a report of a patient in distress at Los Angeles airport. Her family gave no details on the emergency, but media reports said she had suffered a heart attack. \"Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,\" Reynolds wrote on her Facebook page Tuesday. \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.\" Fisher made her feature film debut opposite Warren Beatty in the 1975 hit \"Shampoo.\" She also appeared in \"Austin Powers,\" ''The Blues Brothers,\" ''Charlie's Angels,\" ''Hannah and Her Sisters,\" ''Scream 3\" and \"When Harry Met Sally ...\" But Fisher is best remembered as the headstrong Princess Leia in the original \"Star Wars\" in 1977, her hair styled in futuristic braided buns. She uttered the immortal phrase \"Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\" Actress and writer Carrie Fisher, who is perhaps best known for portraying Princess Leia Organa in the \"Star Wars\" films, died Dec. 27 . Most recently, Fisher published her eighth book, a memoir titled \"The Princess Diarist.\" She reprised the role in Episode VII of the series, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" in 2015, and her digitally rendered image appears in the newest installment, \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\" \"She was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved,\" ''Star Wars\" creator George Lucas said in a statement. \"In 'Star Wars' she was our great and powerful princess - feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think.\" Fisher long battled drug addiction and mental illness. She said she smoked pot at 13, used LSD by 21 and was diagnosed as bipolar at 24. She was treated with electroshock therapy and medication. In 1987, her thinly veiled autobiography \"Postcards From the Edge\" became a best-seller. It was adapted into a 1990 movie starring Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep. More books followed: \"Delusions of Grandma,\" ''Surrender the Pink,\" ''The Best Awful,\" ''Shockaholic\" and this year's autobiography, \"The Princess Diarist,\" in which she revealed that she and Ford had an affair on the \"Star Wars\" set. Fisher's one-woman show, \"Wishful Drinking,\" which she had performed across the country since 2006, was turned into a book, made its way to Broadway in 2009 and was filmed for HBO in 2010. Little was off-limits in the show. She discussed the scandal that engulfed her superstar parents (Fisher ran off with Elizabeth Taylor); her brief marriage to singer Paul Simon; the time the father of her daughter left her for a man; and the day she woke up next to the dead body of a platonic friend who had overdosed in her bed. \"I'm a product of Hollywood inbreeding. When two celebrities mate, something like me is the result,\" she said in the show. At another point, she cracked: \"I don't have a problem with drugs so much as I have a problem with sobriety.\" Ever ready to satirize herself, she played Carrie Fisher a few times, as in David Cronenberg's dark Hollywood sendup \"Maps to the Stars\" and in an episode of \"Sex and the City.\" In the past 15 years, Fisher appeared as a television guest star, perhaps most memorably as a has-been comedy legend on \"30 Rock.\" She also supplied the voice of a recurring character on the animated \"Family Guy\" for the past decade. \"Carrie Fisher was smart, funny, talented, surprising and always a hell of a fun time to be around. Family Guy will miss her immensely,\" show creator Seth MacFarlane tweeted. Fisher starred with her mother in a documentary set to air on HBO in 2017. \"Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher\" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. She endeared herself to the social-media generation with her quirky tweets, laden with crazy keyboard symbols and colorful typefaces. Her ever-present bulldog, Gary Fisher, had his own Twitter and Instagram account. (\"Saddest tweets to tweet. Mommy is gone. I love you @carrieffisher,\" the dog's Twitter feed read.) Besides her mother, Fisher is survived by her brother, Todd Fisher, and her daughter, Billie Lourd. In a 2009 interview with The Associated Press, Fisher wasn't coy about revealing details about her life. She hoped to remove the stigma from mental illness. \"People relate to aspects of my stories and that's nice for me because then I'm not all alone with it,\" she said. \"Also, I do believe you're only as sick as your secrets. If that's true, I'm just really healthy.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "Photo Credit Tim Gruber for The New York Times MANY people will receive drones as gifts this holiday season. But before heading to the nearest field to fly the devices, recipients may want to check their insurance coverage . \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a lot of drones given as Christmas gifts, and we\u2019ll start to see more drone-related claims,\u201d said Chris Hackett, the senior director for personal lines at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, an industry group. Demand for drones has surged because of their lower cost and expanded capabilities. More than 577,000 people \u2014 many of them owners of multiple drones \u2014 have registered as hobby drone operators as of early December, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that about 1.2 million drones will be sold this holiday season. Drones are highly maneuverable, and they can carry cameras to record spectacular vistas from the air. But accidents do happen: Recently, news outlets reported that a drone being used to record a wedding reception in New Hampshire injured two guests, who later sued the groom. \u201cThere are a lot of unfortunate things that can go wrong,\u201d said Christie Alderman, a vice president at Chubb Insurance . Advertisement Continue reading the main story Generally, if you are using a drone for personal purposes and it injures someone or damages their property, your standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy would provide liability coverage up to the policy\u2019s limits, said Mr. Hackett. (If you are using a drone to make money \u2014 even if it is a sideline, like photographing property for a real estate business \u2014 that would not typically be covered by a homeowner\u2019s policy). It is always wise, however, to check with your insurance carrier on the specifics of your policy, said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. Some insurers may exclude drone-related incidents from their policies \u2014 and those that do not do so now may decide to eventually, as the number of drones taking to the skies increases and insurers learn more about the cost of drone-related claims. \u201cGenerally speaking, we evaluate every claim on its own merit,\u201d said Justin Herndon, a spokesman for Allstate, in an email. \u201cWe continue to follow the evolution of drones and its impact on our customers\u2019 policies.\u201d It is also a good idea to reduce your risk by brushing up on drone operational and safety rules, Ms. Alderman said. The F.A.A. requires that hobby users fly drones at or below 400 feet, and keep them within sight. The agency offers a safety video on its website. Also, the Academy of Model Aeronautics, which charters more than 2,500 community-based model-aviation clubs, works with other groups and the F.A.A. to promote safety guidelines and instruction through the Know Before You Fly initiative. Simulation software that can help you learn to fly a drone on a home computer is available for about $100, said Chad Budreau, director of public relations and government affairs for the model aeronautics group. Here are some questions and answers about drones: What other insurance options are available? One option for hobbyists: If you join the Academy of Model Aeronautics, you will receive group liability coverage as a benefit of membership. (Membership is $75 for adults, free for those under age 19.) Advertisement The academy\u2019s insurance policy , issued by a specialty insurer, typically pays out after your homeowner\u2019s policy is exhausted, and it provides $2.5 million in liability coverage for property damage or bodily injury. What if my drone is lost or damaged? Homeowner\u2019s policies typically cover replacement of personal belongings, which would include a drone. But most policies have a deductible \u2014 say, $500. So unless you have a very expensive drone, it may not be worth filing a claim, Ms. Worters said. Do I have to register my drone? Federal rules now require recreational owners to register any drone \u2014 or \u201cunmanned aircraft system,\u201d in F.A.A. parlance \u2014 flown outdoors. Drones weighing a half-pound to 55 pounds can be registered online on the agency\u2019s website; the fee is $5 per person, can be applied to as many drones as you own and is good for three years. Failure to register a drone can be costly: The F.A.A. says generally it aims to educate operators, but can impose civil fines of up to $27,500, and criminal penalties can be much higher.

Hernandez is charged with killing two men in a 2012 drive-by shooting, because one of the men bumped into the former football star in a Boston nightclub, prosecutors said. Hernandez, who attended Tuesday's hearing wearing a suit and a tie, has pleaded not guilty to killing 29-year-old Daniel de Abreu and 28-year-old Safiro Furtado. His trial is scheduled to start in February. Hernandez had tattoos done soon after the victims were killed that link him to the slayings, prosecutor Patrick Haggan said in court. One is of a revolver with five bullets in the chamber and one missing, which prosecutors allege represents the five shots fired into the car occupied by the victims. They also pointed to a tattoo that reads \"God Forgives,\" but written backward so it becomes clear only when read in a mirror. Ronald Sullivan, one of Hernandez's attorneys, called the prosecution's theory \"speculation,\" and \"inference,\" and said allowing jurors to hear about the tattoos would be a violation of Hernandez's constitutional right to a fair trial. The defense also asked the judge to bar as evidence text messages between Hernandez and a former friend that were later forwarded to sports agent Brian Murphy. The prosecution said the texts, involving prosecution witness Alexander Bradley, also tie Hernandez to the crime . The defense said the texts are protected by attorney-client privilege. The prosecution said Murphy was not acting as Hernandez's lawyer at the time. Suffolk Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Locke did not immediately rule. Hernandez is already serving a life sentence for the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, the boyfriend of his fiancee's sister. 0 Shares ",

Jones , USA TODAY Sports 1:24 a.m. EST December 28, 2016 x Share USA TODAY Sports' Lindsay H. Jones breaks down the Buffalo Bills' reasoning for parting ways with Rex Ryan. USA TODAY Sports Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan gives a thumbs up as he leaves the field after beating the San Francisco 49ers at New Era Field. (Photo: Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports) The Buffalo Bills hired Rex Ryan\u00a0to make the team a contender and\u00a0true rival to the New England Patriots in the AFC East. But after nearly two full seasons, it became clear that vision wouldn't be fulfilled. After another year out of the playoffs (that\u2019s 17 straight seasons without a postseason appearance), Ryan\u2019s fate was sealed. With an undisciplined defense and major questions at quarterback moving into next year, the Bills are no closer to competing in the AFC East than they were when Ryan was hired. And Saturday\u2019s loss to the Miami Dolphins, who clinched a playoff berth in\u00a0Adam Gase's first year as coach, showed the Bills were indeed a team trending downward. When Ryan took over, the Bills\u00a0ranked No. 4 in total defense. The unit fell to 19th in his first season, and it stands in that same slot\u00a0this year upon his firing. NFL coaches' hot seat rankings: Who's feeling the most heat now? Two seasons may seem like a short lifespan for a head coach, but Ryan was a proven entity when he arrived in Orchard Park. The Bills knew they were getting a coach with a plus-size personality and a reputation for crafting a complicated and nasty defense. He promised playoffs and memorable battles with Bill Belichick\u2019s Patriots and was unable to deliver. The Bills\u2019 run defense (133.5 yards allowed per game) is the fifth-worst in the NFL,\u00a0in part because of poor tackling. Those struggles were evident\u00a0in the loss to the Dolphins, as running back\u00a0Jay Ajayi had his second 200-yard rushing day against the Bills this season. On a 57-yard run by Ajayi in overtime, the Bills' defense had just 10 men on the field. Ryan accepted responsibility for the error, calling it \"the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.\" When the Bills\u2019 offense struggled earlier this year, Ryan fired offensive coordinator Greg Roman just two weeks into the season. The offense rebounded under new coordinator Anthony Lynn, who on Tuesday was named interim head coach, but the defense continued to flounder. That was a sign that Ryan\u00a0and his twin brother Rob, who helped run the defense, were\u00a0on the hot seat. NFL playoff picture: Packers-Lions showdown could be play-in game The Bills also went 1-3 against the Patriots during Ryan\u2019s tenure in Orchard Park. The lone win came earlier this season while Patriots\u00a0quarterback Tom Brady was suspended. It will be interesting now to see the market for Ryan, 54, after two failed stints as a head coach. His personality makes him popular, but will another owner take a chance on a coach who has never won a division title? Or will Ryan be interested in taking a defensive coordinator job? In September 2015, Ryan told USA TODAY Sports that Buffalo would be his last coaching job, though he surely thought he would last more than two seasons with the Bills at the time. \u201cWhen my days are up, I\u2019ll turn it over to the younger generation. I\u2019m not going anywhere else,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan might now be best suited for television, and the networks should engage in a bidding war for his services. The Bills, meanwhile, once again are starting over. The new head coach will inherit a roster in flux, with more than 20 players set to hit free agency in March, including cornerback Stephon Gilmore, linebacker Lorenzo Alexander and wide receiver Robert Woods. But the biggest question is at quarterback. Will the new head coach want to move forward with Tyrod Taylor, who received a six-year, $90 million extension in August? The structure of Taylor\u2019s contract essentially made it a one-year deal, with a team option after this season. Regardless of who the Bills choose to hire, and whom that coach picks as quarterback, the Bills must find stability at those two key spots. Follow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjones .

Patriots (previously: 1): As if their Super Bowl path didn't already look promising, half the teams in the AFC's playoff bracket are now relying on backup quarterbacks.\u00a0 David Butler II, USA TODAY Sports 2. Cowboys (2): Does Tony Romo get onto the field in Week 17? Or does Dak Prescott earn shot at 14th win, which would set NFL rookie and franchise records?\u00a0 Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports 3. Falcons (8): QB Matt Ryan set single-season mark by throwing TDs to 13 different teammates, further proof the MVP candidate relies much less on Julio Jones.\u00a0 Jeremy Brevard, USA TODAY Sports 4. Steelers (5): Sunday was the first time defense had allowed more than 300 yards since Thanksgiving, really a sign of how progress Pittsburgh has made.\u00a0 Justin K. Aller, Getty Images 5. Chiefs (7): Is there any reason not to put in a read-option package for Dontari Poe? He's obviously proven a legitimate threat by both land and air.\u00a0 Jay Biggerstaff, USA TODAY Sports 6. Packers (11): Aaron Rodgers is one win from making good on \"run the table\" prediction and isn't leaving many table scraps (11 TDs, 0 INTs) during win streak.\u00a0 Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports 7. Seahawks (4): Bye likely gone. They've allowed 34-plus points twice in last three weeks. Russell Wilson is under siege. Tyler Lockett is done. Are they done?\u00a0 Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports 8. Giants (6): As dominant as he can be, dare we ask if Odell Beckham will be able to keep his emotions under control inside the playoff pressure cooker?\u00a0 James Lang, USA TODAY Sports 9. Lions (10): Monday's loss was definitely a setback to their playoff hopes, but maybe they at least found something in second-year RB Zach Zenner.\u00a0 Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports 10. Dolphins (14): RB Jay Ajayi's breakout has been welcome. But consistency is an issue as more than half his 1,213 rushing yards have come in three games.\u00a0 Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports 11. Raiders (3): Their future seems as bright as the Las Vegas Strip at midnight. It's just a shame Derek Carr's injury prevents a grand finale in Oakland.\u00a0 Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports 12. Buccaneers (12): Why is Dirk Koetter getting so many questions about benching a $35 million RB ... who hasn't averaged 4 yards per carry in a game this year?\u00a0 Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports 13. Ravens (13): Defensive collapse spelled ruin as formerly top-ranked unit was burned for 87 points and more than 1,200 yards over the past three weeks.\u00a0 Don Wright, AP 14. Redskins (15): It's a near certainty Kirk Cousins will return in 2017. But how will he look if team doesn't re-sign WRs DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon?\u00a0 Patrick Gorski, USA TODAY Sports 15. Texans (17): The quarterback drama has been so consuming, it's been easy to lose sight of fact Houston has NFL's top-ranked defense ... without J.J. Watt.\u00a0 Thomas Shea, USA TODAY Sports 16. Titans (9): Even before QB Marcus Mariota went down, they'd fatally overlooked the lowly Jags. Confirmation that Tennessee really still is a year away.\u00a0 Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports 17. Broncos (16): Trevor Siemian's QB rating has declined drastically each week of Denver's season-killing four-game slide. Is he really the answer in 2017?\u00a0 Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports 18. Saints (19): Drew Brees needs 142 passing yards in Week 17 to give him five 5,000-yard seasons. The rest of the QBs in NFL history have combined for four.\u00a0 Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports 19. Colts (18): They've now missed playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time in 1998. The next question is whether Jim Irsay will clean house.\u00a0 Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports 20. Panthers (20): At least one Carolina player has been steady as a rock. Greg Olsen is the first tight end to ever record three straight 1,000-yard seasons.\u00a0 Jeremy Brevard, USA TODAY Sports 21. Bills (21): Perhaps biggest blight of Rex Ryan era was watching Buffalo offense roll up 31 points and 589 yards ... and it wasn't enough to bail out the D.\u00a0 Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports 22. Cardinals (23): We'll cast our fantasy MVP vote with RB David Johnson. Be nice to see him join Roger Craig and Marshall Faulk in the 1,000-1,000 club.\u00a0 Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports 23. Bengals (25): Our advice to college scouting department -- scour the country for a reliable kicker, because you owe it to the 52 other guys on the roster.\u00a0 Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports 24. Eagles (26): Philadelphia is 4-1 this season when Lane Johnson plays. But the Eagles went 2-8 during their right tackle's 10-game PED suspension.\u00a0 Rich Schultz, Getty Images 25. Vikings (22): Who would have thought talent-laden defense would ultimately be Minnesota's undoing, with secondary apparently going rogue in the process?\u00a0 Rich Schultz, Getty Images 26. Chargers (24): Mike McCoy is second coach in NFL history to watch his team lose to 0-14 opponent. Probably means he won't be Bolts' coach much longer.\u00a0 Jake Roth, USA TODAY Sports 27. Jaguars (30): Now that was the Jacksonville many league observers expected to see in 2016. Apparently Gus Bradley should have been fired three months ago.\u00a0 Reinhold Matay, USA TODAY Sports 28. Bears (27): Rookie RB Jordan Howard's 1,178 rushing yards rank seventh in NFL. Too bad almost no one outside of Chicago has noticed amid miserable year.\u00a0 Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports 29. Rams (28): The latest example L.A. must hire an offensive-minded coach? Rams managed just 177 total yards Saturday against San Francisco's league-worst D.\u00a0 Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports 30. Jets (29): So this week, DE Sheldon Richardson tried putting the blame on WR Brandon Marshall. Richardson, by the way, last registered a sack in Week 7.\u00a0 Noah K.

    "text": "Carrie Fisher, best known as Princess Leia in Star Wars, dead at 60 Published               December 27, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Carrie Fisher, best known as the iconic double-bun hairdo-wearing Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise, died Tuesday following a heart attack, FoxNews.com confirmed. She was 60. \"It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning,\" a representative for Lourd told FoxNews.com. \"She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly.\" \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) December 27, 2016 Fisher's publicist also confirmed the news. SLIDESHOW: CARRIE FISHER THROUGH THE YEARS Fisher starred in a host of popular 1980s movies, was married or engaged to famous singers and actors, suffered from bipolar disorder and drug addiction and eventually became a mental health advocate. She had a medical emergency while on a flight from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23, during which she stopped breathing. She was later taken to an intensive care unit, but never recovered. \"Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter,\" mother Debbie Reynolds wrote on Facebook. \"I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop. Love Carries Mother.\" Fisher was born on Oct. 21, 1956 with showbiz \u2013 literally \u2013 in her blood. The daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and Reynolds, a star actress, Carrie appeared, at the age of 15, in the Broadway show \u201cIrene,\u201d which Reynolds starred in. But the theater turn cost her school time and contributed to Fisher never finishing high school. She first appeared on the movie screen in 1975\u2019s \u201cShampoo,\u201d though her career took off when she was cast as Princess Leia Organa in the inaugural Star Wars film, which was released in 1977. She would go on to reprise the role in subsequent films, most recently appearing in 2015\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d Rest In Peace, Carrie Fisher. pic.twitter.com/fTy7fgj1gH \u2014 20th Century Fox (@20thcenturyfox) December 27, 2016 Fisher revealed in her 2016 autobiography that she had an affair with \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-star Harrison Ford for three months in 1976. In the 1980s, Fisher appeared in a string of Hollywood hits, including \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d \u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d \u201cThe \u2018Burbs\u201d and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u2026\u201d Her romantic life also heated up during the decade. Fisher dated Paul Simon until 1983 and about a year later married to the singer/songwriter, again for about a year. In between stints with Simon, she dated and was briefly engaged to \u201cBlues Brother\u201d co-star Dan Akroyd in 1980. She had a child, Billie Catherine Lourd, in 1992 with talent agent Bryan Lourd, though Lourd later left Fisher for a man. STARS REACT TO CARRIE FISHER'S DEATH Fisher appeared to reflect on the relationship with Lourd in her 2004 book, \u201cThe Best Awful There Is,\u201d in which the character Suzanne is loosely based on Fisher\u2019s life. \u201cShe\u2019d had a child with someone who forgot to tell her he was gay. He forgot to tell her, and she forgot to notice.\u201d I'm deeply saddened at the news of Carrie's passing. She was a dear friend, whom I greatly respected and admired. The force is dark today! \u2014 Billy Dee Williams (@realbdw) December 27, 2016 \u201cBest Awful\u201d was the fifth and final of Fisher\u2019s novels, though she later wrote three non-fiction works, including 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Princess Diarist.\u201d A talented writer, she helped rework screen plays for \u201cSister Act,\u201d \u201cLast Action Hero\u201d and \u201cThe Wedding Singer.\u201d Fisher also continued her acting career later in life, often appearing as herself in comedic turns on television shows. Somewhat out of character, she provided the voice of \u201cAngela\u201d on \u201cFamily Guy\u201d from 2005-2016. Her last projects were in two yet-to-be released films: \u201cWonderwall\u201d and as Leia in \u201cStar Wars: Episode VIII.\u201d Fisher also publicly struggled with bipolar disorder and abused pain killers and cocaine. She said in 2008 that she received electroconvulsive therapy treatments every six weeks at one point. Fisher became an outspoken advocate for those battling mental illness and received an Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism from Harvard in 2016. \u201cI find it unappealing,\" Fisher said of her mental illness in a 2004 Los Angeles Times profile. \u201cBut there is a part of this illness that is funny. I don't understand the stigma. I understand funny. It is what I do. Because I have the sense of humor I have, things don't prey on me long. And that's why I have it. If I didn't, I would be\u2026in pain. If my life weren't funny, it would just be true, and that would be unacceptable.\u201d In her book \"Wishful Drinking,\" Fisher wrote the beginning of her ideal obituary. The remark came as the punchline to an anecdote about \"Star Wars\" director George Lucas telling Fisher that Princess Leia couldn't wear a bra in space -- because, by his logic, it would kill the character. \"I think that this would make for a fantastic obituary,\" she wrote. \"I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\" Eddie Fisher died in 2010. Carrie Fisher is survived by her brother, Todd Fisher, and her mother and daughter. FoxNews.com's Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Marco Garcia/AP In a somber ceremony Tuesday, the two leaders touted the U.S.-Japan alliance that arose in the aftermath of the bitter conflict and became a \"cornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Obama said. \"The U.S. and Japan chose friendship and they chose peace,\" Obama said. \"It has helped underwrite an international order that has prevented another World War.\" Abe, for his part, offered his condolences, but stopped short of an apology for the Dec. 7, 1941, air raid that killed more than 2,300 service members. \"As the prime minister of Japan, I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place,\" Abe said through an interpreter.

The Arizona was hit in the air raid. Marco Garcia/AP But while both leaders spent significant time memorializing the dead, it was the current relationship between the two nations that took center stage. Abe said \"the spirit of reconciliation\" was at work in U.S. efforts to aid the war-wrecked Japan following its surrender. He also credited the U.S. for allowing Japan to transition from an imperial nation to a peaceful democratic one. \"On behalf of the Japanese people, I hereby wish to express once again my heartfelt gratitude to the U.S. and the world for the tolerance extended to Japan,\" the prime minister said. Article continues after sponsorship Abe's visit also marks the first time a Japanese prime minister has made an official visit to the site of the surprise aerial attack, and takes place just seven months after Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to travel to Hiroshima , the Japanese city where the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb in 1945, hastening the end of the war. While Abe is not the first Japanese leader to visit this World War II landmark, he's the first do so publicly and alongside a U.S. president. Three Japanese prime ministers made low-key visits in the 1950s, including one in 1957 by Nobusuke Kishi \u2014 who was Abe's grandfather. Those visits received scant attention, so little that Abe himself was apparently unaware his grandfather had been to Pearl Harbor. At the time, the trauma of World War II was still vivid for millions of Americans and Japanese and neither side appeared eager to advertise the unofficial visits by the Japanese leaders. With Obama down to his final weeks in office, the two leaders held their last bilateral meeting and reviewed the state of the U.S.- Japan alliance. Obama has sought to increase the U.S. focus on the broader region with his \"pivot to Asia\" at a time of growing Chinese military and economic might. President-elect Donald Trump's approach has so far been marked by provocative statements about China, and also by calls for Japan to pay more for security assistance. However, he hasn't yet spelled out the details of his plans. Abe was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump. The two sat down at Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 18, though few specifics emerged from the discussion. ",

They are expected to generate enough energy to power 17,000 homes. \u201cWe see this being a big industry, we see offshore wind producing a lot of energy for the United States, particularly here in the Northeast where the winds are really strong,\u201d said Jeff Grybowski, CEO of Deepwater Wind, which built the wind farm. Wind turbines off of Rhode Island CBS News The turbines will most benefit Block Island. Because of its location, 45 minutes by boat from the mainland, it currently gets its oil and gas shipped in. Residents pay a premium; At peak times, nearly 60 cents per kilowatt. The wind farm is expected to cut that cost to about 24 cents. Steve Draper CBS News That is great news for 68-year old Steve Draper. His family runs the 1661 Inn, one of the oldest businesses on the island. \u201cOur bill last year was somewhere around $200,000,\u201d he said. \u201cYou try everything to cut your costs. It\u2019s a major factor in doing business here.\u201d While countries like Denmark have been using off-shore wind farms since the early 1990s, U.S.-based projects have been stalled due to court fights over environmental fears and protests over the turbines blocking beachfront views. \u201cIt took us eight years to build this project but we are finally here,\u201d Grybowski said. Boaters pass by the wend farm CBS News Other projects are in the works, potentially bringing 200 more wind turbines to the area within the next 10 years. Draper expects people will get used to the new scenery. \u201cWe all got used to telephone poles and telephone wires in our views and they\u2019re not beautiful,\u201d he said. A view of the future, powering the future. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Her family, friends, and fans expressed their sadness via social media. USA TODAY NETWORK Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) were reunited in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' (Photo: Lucasfilm) The last time we saw Carrie Fisher onscreen, she was a general. In Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\u00a0it was Leia's loss of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) we were grieving. But when Star Wars: Episode VIII\u00a0hits theaters Dec. 15, 2017, fans will be aching for\u00a0Fisher, who died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack during a flight four days earlier. The Force remains tight-lipped about Fisher's role\u00a0in the saga's upcoming installments. For now, few\u00a0details are available\u00a0about how the actress figures into the as-yet-untitled\u00a0Episode VIII, though\u00a0Fisher had completed her scenes for the film, which wrapped up shooting in July. Final slate of the final shot. VIII is officially wrapped. Cannot wait to share it with you all! - @rianjohnson pic.twitter.com/l4Apk0Ro4i \u2014 Star Wars (@starwars) July 22, 2016 USA TODAY has reached out to Disney and Lucasfilm for comment. The Force Awakens, seen as a \"little bit of a victory lap\" for the original cast, left Leia as a pivotal character,\u00a0says\u00a0Scott Huver, contributing writer for Moviefone.com. What is known about Episode VIII is that\u00a0the main players of\u00a0The Force Awakens\u00a0\u2014 including\u00a0Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and\u00a0Poe Dameron\u00a0(Oscar Isaac) \u2014 will have their stories continue\u00a0under writer/director\u00a0Rian Johnson. \"We know that the movie is supposed to be darker than The Force Awakens in its tone,\" says\u00a0Huver.\u00a0\"I would assume we should anticipate an onscreen reunion between Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia, given that he\u2019s going to be more prominent in Episode VIII.\" Appreciation: Carrie Fisher will forever be 'Star Wars' royalty But what isn't clear \"is whether or not they had planned to put her in Episode IX\u00a0as well, or if she had signed to do future Star Wars movies,\"\u00a0says\u00a0Erik Davis, managing editor for\u00a0Fandango.com\u00a0and Movies.com. Episode IX, directed by\u00a0Colin Trevorrow\u00a0(Jurassic World), hasn't\u00a0begun shooting yet. That film\u00a0has a release date set for May 23, 2019. After a brief cameo (spoiler alert!) in the new standalone movie\u00a0Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u00a0Leia plays a larger\u00a0role\u00a0in\u00a0Episode VIII,\u00a0 Deadline reports. That's not surprising, says\u00a0Davis, adding\u00a0that at the end of The Force Awakens,\u00a0\"she's taken\u00a0control of the Rebels, she's a general, she's very much a leader of that new Rebel Force. I imagine\u00a0in the the next one\u00a0she's still the leader in charge and commands are going through her.\" Adam Driver's Kylo Ren was revealed to be Princess Leia's son in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' \u00a0(Photo: Lucasfilm) And it's no small plot point that \"the villain in the movie is still her son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) that she had with Han Solo,\" Davis adds.\u00a0\"If they have a confrontation at all, you imagine that could be a pretty big one.\" While big-budget movies often require reshoots prior to release, technology has been a key player in difficult situations,\u00a0as in the loss of Paul Walker, who died in a car accident in 2013. Though the star had\u00a0completed the majority of shots for Furious 7,\u00a0his brothers Caleb and Cody stood in as body doubles to\u00a0help finish the remaining action sequences for the film. It remains to be seen if reshoots or\u00a0script rewrites will take place for Episode VIII or IX. Carrie Fisher had a gift for memorable lines Arriving first will be Star Wars Celebration, taking place April 13 through 16 in Orlando.\u00a0\"I imagine\u00a0much of that is going to be a celebration of her life and her role in the films,\" says Davis.\u00a0\"It's going to be probably the most emotional Star Wars Celebration that we've seen yet.\" Director J.J. Abrams, who helmed The Force Awakens, wrote Tuesday that \"You didn't need to meet Carrie Fisher to understand her power. She was just as brilliant and beautiful, tough and wonderful, incisive and funny as you could imagine. What an unfair thing to lose her. How lucky to have been blessed with her at all.\" Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford rose to fame for their roles in the 'Star Wars' franchise. \u00a0(Photo: Lucasfilm) 2456 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iBQAIU NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

News Sentinel 7:41 p.m. EST December 27, 2016 David Starling, his son, Hunter Starling, and girlfriend Amy Smith, were reported missing Monday on a plane traveling from Jacksonville, Florida to the Gatlinburg- Pigeon Forge Airport in Sevier County. The plane was reported missing over the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. (Photo: Courtesy Samantha Hodges.) KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Three people are dead after a plane crash in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, according to the National Park Service, which confirmed Tuesday night that a single-engine plane headed to the Gatlinburg-Pigeon Forge Airport had been found\u00a0and that there were\u00a0no survivors. Kim Smith, of High Springs, Fla.; her boyfriend, David Starling;\u00a0and Starling's 8-year-old son, Hunter Starling, were aboard the plane,\u00a0according to Samantha Hodges, of Jasper, Fla., Smith's second cousin, who said Tuesday afternoon that the family had not heard from them. A news release from the National Park Service said the three were on board the plane and that there were no survivors of the crash, but also said \"the identities of the victims have not been confirmed.\" The trio was traveling to the Gatlinburg area\u00a0for a vacation with members of Smith's family who already\u00a0were there, including her mother and sister, according to Hodges. Rescuers find flight recorder from Black Sea plane crash The National Park Service initially received a report about 7:35 p.m. Monday that the plane may have gone down in the central area of the park. Tuesday's release offered no details about the cause of the crash but said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead an investigation. A reconnaissance flight by the Tennessee Army National Guard was able to locate the missing plane within Great Smoky Mountains National Park at approximately 4:43 p.m.\u00a0Tuesday, according to the release. The plane was found on an unnamed ridge between Cole Creek and Bearpen Hollow Branch. Paramedics on board were hoisted down to the crash site and confirmed that there were no survivors. Kathleen Bergen, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman, said the plane was\u00a0a Cessna 182 that\u00a0took off from a Jacksonville, Fla.-area airport.\u00a0It was bound for the Gatlinburg-Pigeon Forge Airport, according to the park service. Ground search teams were deployed Tuesday to Bearpen Hollow Branch and areas southwest of the Bullhead Trail to search for signs of the aircraft,\u00a0but were unable to access some areas due to the rough terrain. Brazilian soccer team's plane ran out of fuel before crash A single Blackhawk helicopter was able to fly late afternoon and spotted the wreckage along the last known flight path of the missing aircraft. Recovery efforts of the three victims will begin Wednesday, the release from the park service said. Hodges said the private plane belonged to David Starling. Records from the Federal Aviation Administration show a Cessna 182H registered to Joseph David Starling\u00a0of Lawtey, Fla. A search for David Starling turned up no records, but the FAA did have an airman's certificate on file for Joseph David Starling showing he was certified in April 2014 as a private pilot. Members of Smith's family last had contact with the three\u00a0around 4 p.m. Monday, Hodges said, when Smith\u00a0told her mother over the phone that they were about 13 minutes away. \"They were waiting on them, but they never landed,\" Hodges said.

(Gillian Brockell,Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) By Matt Schudel December 27 at 6:14 PM \u201cI was born famous,\u201d Carrie Fisher said. The daughter of two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars of the 1950s \u2014 actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher \u2014 she would lead a life of inescapable fame, and the privilege and chaos that came with it. She became a celebrity in her own right, playing the heroic Princess Leia in the blockbuster 1977 film \u201cStar Wars\u201d and two sequels in the 1980s. She was only 19 \u2014 and the principal female character \u2014 when she filmed the first in the George Lucas sci-fi series that has become a cultural touchstone. The \u201cStar Wars\u201d enterprise became a universe of its own, spawning six sequels (so far) and legions of devoted fans who examined every line of dialogue \u2014 and every change of Ms. Fisher\u2019s sometimes revealing costumes \u2014 for esoteric meaning. Ms. Fisher appeared in dozens of other films and television shows, but Princess Leia would remain the role of a lifetime. 1 of 24 See photos of the life and career of Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) View Photos The former \u2018Star Wars\u2019 actress, daughter of actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, best-selling author and activist died at age 60. Caption The former \u2018Star Wars\u2019 actress, daughter of actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, best-selling author and activist died at age 60. June 14, 1958 Singer Eddie Fisher and wife Debbie Reynolds cuddle their two youngsters, 4-month-old Todd, left, and 19-month-old Carrie. Carrie played Princess Leia in \u201cStar Wars\u201d films and later wrote books about her fight against drug and alcohol addiction. She died Dec. 27, 2016, after suffering an apparent heart attack Dec. 23 on a flight between London and Los Angeles. AP Wait 1 second to continue. What proved more difficult was playing the role of Carrie Fisher. She died Dec. 27 in a Los Angeles hospital, her daughter, Billie Lourd said, four days after suffering a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles. She was 60. By design or necessity, Ms. Fisher was constantly reinventing herself, first as a character actress and later as a best-selling writer and raconteur, telling confessional tales about her parents and her troubled life amid Tinseltown\u2019s glamour and grit. Seldom far from a spotlight or the paparazzi, Ms. Fisher returned to the headlines in November, when she revealed in interviews and in a newly published memoir that she had an affair with co-star Harrison Ford while filming \u201cStar Wars\u201d in the 1970s. Already a celebrity from \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Ms. Fisher won a different kind of acclaim in her 30s, as she launched an unexpected second career as an acerbic, self-lacerating chronicler of Hollywood excess \u2014 or \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to live an all-too-exciting life for all too long.\u201d In her first book, the best-selling, semi-autobiographical 1987 novel \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d Ms. Fisher wrote of life inside drug-rehabilitation clinics, of bedroom couplings and uncouplings, and especially about the doubts, fears and resentments of a daughter who always seemed to stand in the shadow of her glamorous mother. The book\u2019s opening line could stand in as a nutshell summary of Ms. Fisher\u2019s problems \u2014 and humor: \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have given the guy who pumped my stomach my phone number, but who cares? My life is over anyway.\u201d She later wrote the screenplay for \u201cPostcards,\u201d which became a 1990 box-office hit directed by Mike Nichols. Meryl Streep received an Oscar nomination for playing Suzanne Vale, an aspiring actress whose life lurched from emergency to emergency. (Ms. Fisher wasn\u2019t interested in the role, she said, because \u201cI already did that.\u201d) Shirley MacLaine portrayed Doris, the lead character\u2019s vain, overbearing mother, but Ms. Fisher reserved her harshest words in her script for Suzanne, the stand-in for herself. \u201cI came from nowhere and made something out of my life,\u201d Doris tells her daughter. \u201cYou came from somewhere and are making nothing out of yours.\u201d Despite the big-screen airing of family dysfunction, Ms. Fisher and Reynolds stayed on remarkably good terms \u2014 and ended up living next door to each other in Beverly Hills. Reviewers likened the verbal agility and spitfire comedy of Ms. Fisher\u2019s script to a Hollywood tradition that was virtually part of her DNA. \u201cIn this era of postverbal cinema,\u201d Time critic Richard Corliss wrote, \u201c \u2018Postcards\u2019 proves that movie dialogue can still carry the sting, heft, and meaning of the finest old romantic comedy.\u201d The movie led Ms. Fisher to yet another career as one of Hollywood\u2019s top script doctors. Over a period of more than 15 years, she sharpened the dialogue of dozens of films, from \u201cSister Act\u201d (1992) and \u201cSo I Married an Axe Murderer\u201d (1993) to various \u201cStar Wars\u201d sequels. She wrote three more novels, \u201cSurrender the Pink,\u201d \u201cThe Best Awful There Is\u201d and \u201cDelusions of Grandma,\u201d before abandoning the pretense of fiction altogether in favor of unvarnished memoir, with \u201cShockaholic\u201d (2011) and \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d (2008). The latter book, a runaway bestseller, was based on a successful one-woman stage show in which Ms. Fisher mined the seemingly endless trove of embarrassing, tragic and absurd events that made up her life. \u201cYou can\u2019t make up this stuff!\u201d Ms. Fisher told Rolling Stone in 2015. \u201cSo I\u2019m stuck writing it. I mean, it\u2019s incredible. Stuff happens and you think, no one will believe this \u2014 no one.\u201d She was, by her own admission, an enfant terrible who never learned how to grow up. She had bipolar disorder, for which she received electroshock therapy. She loved LSD, rummaged through bathroom medicine cabinets and became addicted to cocaine, Percodan and booze. Her interviews were unscripted and unguarded, as she chain-smoked cigarettes, chugged Coca-Cola and made light of her emotional damage. Among other romantic attachments, she had a seven-year relationship with singer-songwriter Paul Simon before they were married in 1983. After 11 months, they were divorced. She later had a relationship with agent Bryan Lourd, with whom she had a daughter in 1992. Lourd then left her for a man. \u201cI turn people gay,\u201d Ms. Fisher told the Baltimore Sun in 2012. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. It is an unusual superpower.\u201d In the 1980s, she dated a U.S. senator whose name she did not divulge. \u201cI was shown the Supreme Court and taken to dinner,\u201d she told The Washington Post in 1987, \u201cand I said at one point, \u2018So, how many senators are there, actually?\u2019 I told my mother that later and she said, \u2018Oh darling, I\u2019m so ashamed of you. Everyone knows there\u2019s one per state.\u2019 \u201d In 2005, Ms. Fisher \u2014 a staunch Democrat \u2014 woke up in bed alongside the dead body of a friend who was a gay Republican political operative named R. Gregory Stevens. The autopsy listed cocaine and oxycodone use as the cause of death. Despite the relentless drama of her life, Ms. Fisher maintained a steady acting career, appearing in more than 40 films and dozens of TV productions. Her first movie role came in \u201cShampoo\u201d (1975), in which \u2014 still in her teens \u2014 she had a sultry seduction scene with Warren Beatty. Two years later, \u201c Star Wars \u201d changed Ms. Fisher\u2019s life. She portrayed Princess Leia as an alluring, resourceful and innocent combination of Little Orphan Annie and Joan of Arc \u2014 with her hair worn in coils on each side of her head. The on-screen chemistry between Ms. Fisher, then 19, and Ford, who played the dashing Han Solo, was enhanced by the torrid off-screen romance she had with the then-33-year-old married actor. \u201cIt was Han and Leia during the week,\u201d Ms. Fisher told People magazine in November, \u201cand Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.\u201d She reprised her Princess Leia role in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back (1980) and \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d (1983), but as the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise became entrenched in pop culture, her reviews grew increasingly hostile. \u201cShe\u2019s no longer a commander,\u201d critic David Ansen wrote in Newsweek, \u201cjust a whisky-voiced damsel in distress in a harem outfit.\u201d Nonetheless, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise has inspired armies of ardent fans, who have kept Ms. Fisher in a sometimes unwelcome spotlight. \u201cYou\u2019re not just an actor in this movie,\u201d she said in 2015, \u201cyou\u2019re a diplomat to a country you didn\u2019t know existed.\u201d During the 1980s, she appeared in other films, most notably as a vengeful love interest of John Belushi\u2019s in \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d (1980), as Dianne Wiest\u2019s business partner in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201c Hannah and Her Sisters \u201d (1986) and as Meg Ryan\u2019s best friend in \u201c When Harry Met Sally \u201d (1989). Those were also the years when Ms. Fisher\u2019s indulgence in drugs reached a high (or low) point. She went to rehab and a mental hospital. Then, after an overdose, came the episode in which she gave her phone number to the doctor who pumped her stomach. \u201cThere is not one area of sensationalism,\u201d she said when she was 30, \u201cthat I have not wandered into and trespassed wildly.\u201d Carrie Frances Fisher was born Oct. 21, 1956, in Burbank, Calif. Her mother, now 84, was a wholesome singer-dancer-actress who starred in the classic 1952 musical \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and in \u201cTammy and the Bachelor\u201d (1957), \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown\u201d (1964) and \u201cThe Singing Nun\u201d (1966). Her father, a crooning teen idol with 17 Top 10 hits between 1950 and 1956, was the host of two TV variety shows that ran from 1953 to 1959. (He died in 2010 .) When he and Reynolds married in 1955, they were called \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite couple.\u201d Reynolds\u2019s best friend in Hollywood was actress Elizabeth Taylor. After Taylor\u2019s husband, producer Mike Todd, was killed in an airplane crash in 1958, she found comfort in the arms of Eddie Fisher. Fisher left Reynolds and their two young children and, in 1959, married Taylor, creating one of the most notorious scandals in Hollywood history. Carrie was 2 at the time. \u201cI thought everybody had stepmothers living in bungalows at the Beverly Hills Hotel wearing negligees,\u201d she said in 2011. Reynolds later married an older businessman named Harry Karl, who squandered his wife\u2019s money before they ended up in divorce court. \u201cI grew up watching my mother do the show-must-go-on thing to a ridiculous extreme,\u201d Ms. Fisher told the Baltimore Sun. At 13, Ms. Fisher began performing in her mother\u2019s nightclub act, then dropped out of high school at 15 to sing in the chorus of her mother\u2019s Broadway show, \u201cIrene.\u201d (\u201dI don\u2019t care what you\u2019ve heard,\u201d Ms. Fisher wrote in \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d \u201cchorus work is more valuable to a child than any education could ever be.\u201d) Ms. Fisher studied acting in London for about 18 months before she began to land film roles. By the time she found success, her mother\u2019s career was in eclipse, and her father was all but forgotten. \u201cI knew better than I knew anything that what happens with stardom, with fame,\u201d she said in a 2006 interview with NPR, \u201cis it goes away, and it leaves you in a humiliated space.\u201d From an early age, Ms. Fisher was a devoted reader and journal-keeper, even when her life was in turmoil. She relied on the journals for her books, including \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d and her memoirs, including 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d about her experiences on \u201cStar Wars.\u201d In 2015, she appeared with Ford, Mark Hamill and other members of the original cast in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d which became a global box-office smash. Another sequel is scheduled for release in 2017. Ms. Fisher was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007 for a one-time role as an over-the-hill, mentally unbalanced TV writer on the sitcom \u201c30 Rock.\u201d Survivors include her mother; her daughter, Billie Lourd; and a brother, producer and director Todd Fisher. Meanwhile, Ms. Fisher and her mother soldiered on together like an old, squabbling vaudeville team. A documentary about their intertwined lives, \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,\u201d is scheduled to appear on HBO in 2017. At last, Ms. Fisher gets top billing. ",

Jerry Brown is the son of a governor; he grew up in privileged circumstances; he is, by any measure, a member of the elite. Yet he somehow manages to be a populist. He says things the people want to hear, but retains his idealism \u2014 a remarkable combination of traits that makes him very popular. \u2022 In your book, you say only in California could a politician as idiosyncratic as Mr. Brown flourish. What did you mean by that? For three and a half years, he studied to be a Jesuit priest; after his first two terms as governor, he spent six months in Japan studying Zen; he sprinkles Latin phrases in his speeches and refers to St. Ignatius and Buddhism; he has always been an unabashed intellectual, unusual in a politician. Californians like politicians who are out of the ordinary \u2014 witness the elections of movie stars Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It\u2019s doubtful someone such as Brown could be elected governor in, say, Iowa. But in California, he will have wrapped up 16 years as governor in 2018. Quirky state \u2014 quirky governor. \u2022 Is there an anecdote about him that you especially like? He\u2019s always had a reputation as a skinflint. There is the story that when he was dating singer Linda Ronstadt, they were headed for a party at the home of Rosemary Clooney when Linda received a dozen red roses as a gift.

    "text": "By Shanika Gunaratna CBS News December 27, 2016, 5:40 PM How climate change transformed the Earth in 2016 Polar bears, increasingly land-bound due to vanishing ice sheets in the Arctic, are a poignant example of climate refugees.\u00a0 Dustin Stephens/CBS News Email 2016 was a milestone year in the continued warming of the planet. From unstable agriculture to the drought in California to melting ice sheets to extreme weather events and heat waves, climate change has disrupted virtually every corner of the world. It\u2019s impossible to exhaustively list all the ways in which climate change was felt in 2016, but here\u2019s a guide to understanding the year that was for the planet: A carbon dioxide milestone \u201cIn the centuries to come, history books will likely look back on September 2016 as a major milestone for the world\u2019s climate,\u201d Brian Kahn of Climate Central wrote earlier this year. That\u2019s because, during September, a month in which atmospheric carbon dioxide \u2014 a heat-trapping greenhouse gas \u2014is usually at its lowest, the monthly value failed to drop below 400 parts per million. The 400 ppm mark has sad significance in the climate community, as it has long been considered a point of no return for the atmosphere by scientists.\u00a0 On pace to be the hottest year yet This year is poised to be the hottest year in the 137-year official record, with global temperatures climbing even higher than record-breaking 2015 , according to data released in November from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Temperatures were particularly high in the first half of the year due to the power of El Ni\u00f1o. People collect water at a slum area in Mumbai, India, April 30, 2016, during a week-long heat wave that decimated crops, killed livestock and left at least 330 million Indians without enough water for their daily needs.\u00a0 Rajanish Kakade, AP Though final data from December is not yet in, January to November 2016 was the warmest such period worldwide on record, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0 If 2016 ends up with the title of hottest year on record, as expected, that would mean that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have occurred in this century. The only outlier was 1998, according to the WMO. Still need perspective? Research released this year shows that, if we take a much longer view of Earth\u2019s temperature history and consider temperature averages in 5,000 year increments, the Earth is now\u00a0 warmer than it has been in 120,000 years . Transforming the Arctic Global warming has had a particularly dramatic impact on the Arctic, which has been transformed by significantly warmer temperatures, lower levels of sea ice , and more open water in recent years. NASA animation of Arctic sea ice cover, 1979-2015. NASA Scientific Visualization Studio Last month, the average Arctic sea ice extent \u2014 the measurement scientists use to represent the area of ocean where there is at least some sea ice \u2014 was 17.7 percent below the averages from 1981 to 2010, according to NOAA. That\u2019s the lowest November extent since the NOAA began keeping\u00a0 records \u00a0in 1979. \u201cFor the people in the Arctic, no one has to tell them an abrupt\u00a0 climate change \u00a0has hit,\u201d Paul Mayewski, professor at the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute, told CBS News in an interview last week. Continued\u00a0 melting of polar ice \u00a0could lead to\u00a0 catastrophic sea level rise \u00a0and flooding on coastlines around the world. Some 13 million Americans could become \u201cclimate refugees\u201d by the end of this century if the worst projections come to pass, one study this year warned. Scientists say human activities are directly linked to Arctic warming: driving a\u00a0 gas-powered \u00a0car about 90 miles \u2013 the distance between New York and Philadelphia \u2013 produces enough carbon pollution to melt about a square foot of\u00a0 Arctic sea ice \u00a0during the critical month of September, research shows. Around the world, instability in agriculture The continued warming of the planet in 2016 is having a destabilizing impact on agriculture worldwide.\u00a0 ",

The Council approved it 14 to 0, with the United States abstaining instead of using its unilateral veto, as it has in the past. Mr. Trump publicly pressed for a veto of the resolution and has chosen a settlement advocate as his administration\u2019s ambassador to Israel. He turned to Twitter on Monday night to air complaints that the United Nations \u201cis just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.\u201d Palestinian leaders made clear that they would use the resolution in international bodies to press their case against Israel. With the imprimatur of a United Nations finding of illegality, they said, they will campaign to require that other countries not just label products made in the settlements, but ban them. \u201cNow we can talk about the boycott of all settlements, the companies that work with them, et cetera, and actually take legal action against them if they continue to work with them,\u201d Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister, was quoted as saying by the Palestinian news media. He outlined other steps the Palestinians could now take, using the resolution to press the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders, file lawsuits on behalf of specific Palestinians displaced by settlements and urge the international authorities to determine whether Israel is violating the Geneva Conventions . \u201cWe are looking to devise a comprehensive vision, and hopefully 2017 will be the year when the Israeli occupation ends,\u201d Mr. Malki said. Israeli officials said such pronouncements showed that the resolution actually undermined chances for a negotiated settlement because the Palestinians now have less incentive to come to the table. By declaring Israeli settlements illegal, they said, the United Nations essentially took away the one chip that Israel had to trade, meaning land. \u201cThe Palestinians are waging a diplomatic and legal war against Israel. That\u2019s the strategy,\u201d Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, said in a phone interview. \u201cTheir strategy is not to negotiate an agreement with Israel because a deal is give and take. They want take and take.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Israel\u2019s settlement project, once a scattering of houses across the so-called Green Line marking the borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has grown substantially over the years. In 2009, the year Mr. Obama took office, 297,000 people lived in West Bank settlements and 193,737 in East Jerusalem. That increased to 386,000 in the West Bank by the end of last year and 208,000 in East Jerusalem by the end of 2014, according to Peace Now, a group that opposes settlements. Israeli officials note that when Mr. Netanyahu acquiesced to a 10-month settlement freeze sought by Mr. Obama in 2009, the Palestinians still did not agree to negotiate until just before time ran out. But the addition of more than 100,000 settlers during Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure convinced him that it was time to change his approach at the United Nations, aides said. The 618 housing units to be granted building permits in East Jerusalem on Wednesday have been in the works for a while, and the planning committee meeting agenda was set before the United Nations acted. But the committee chairman said he was determined to go forward with units totaling 5,600. \u201cI won\u2019t get worked up over the U.N. or any other organization that might try to dictate to us what to do in Jerusalem,\u201d Deputy Mayor Meir Turgeman, the planning committee chairman, told the newspaper Israel Hayom. \u201cI hope that the government and the new administration in the United States will give us momentum to continue.\u201d Although he did not specify which projects he had in mind, Ir Amim, a private group tracking settlements in East Jerusalem, said he was probably referring to projects in Gilo and Givat Hamatos. Betty Herschman, the group\u2019s director of international relations and advocacy, said it was \u201cdefiance demonstrated after Trump\u2019s election, now reinforced by the U.N. resolution.\u201d Anat Ben Nun, the director of development and external relations for Peace Now, said such construction was problematic. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s attempt to avenge the U.N.S.C. resolution through approval of plans beyond the Green Line will only harm Israelis and Palestinians by making it more difficult to arrive at a two-state solution,\u201d she said. Israeli leaders said they had no reason to stop building. The Security Council resolution \u201cwas absurd and totally removed from reality,\u201d said Oded Revivi, chief foreign envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents West Bank settlers. \u201cIsraeli building policies are set in Jerusalem, not New York.\u201d For the fourth day, Israeli officials accused Mr. Obama\u2019s team of ambushing them at the United Nations. While the White House denied it, Israeli officials pointed to a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his New Zealand counterpart a month before the Council vote discussing a resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. New Zealand was a sponsor of Friday\u2019s measure. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Dermer, the ambassador, said Israel had other, nonpublic information proving the Obama administration\u2019s involvement but provided no evidence and would not elaborate beyond saying it would be provided to Mr. Trump\u2019s team when he takes office. \u201cThey not only did not get up and stop it, they were behind it from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Dermer said. \u201cThis is why the prime minister is so angry. We\u2019re going to stand up against it.\u201d Israeli officials worried that Mr. Kerry would use a coming speech or a conference in France to outline an American peace plan that would be hostile to Israel\u2019s interests. Mr. Kerry\u2019s office had no comment. The fury of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s response has generated debate at home. Mitchell Barak, a political consultant, said the political left considered the resolution \u201can epic foreign policy and diplomatic debacle\u201d by Mr. Netanyahu. But to his base, the Security Council action confirmed what they believed all along, that Mr. Obama is inherently anti-Israel, and so the prime minister comes across as a champion beset by enemies. \u201cFor them,\u201d Mr. Barak said, \u201cNetanyahu emerges from this unscathed, as the lone wolf in a lion\u2019s den of hatred.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 27, 2016, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Defiant Israel Vows to Expand Its Settlements.

President Barack Obama speaking during a troop rally after arriving at Bagram Air Field for an unannounced visit, north of Kabul, Afghanistan, on\u00a0May 25, 2014. (Evan Vucci / AP) Ellen NakashimaThe Washington Post The Obama administration is close to announcing a series of measures to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election, including economic sanctions and diplomatic censure, according to U.S. officials. The administration is still finalizing the details, which are also expected to include covert action that likely will involve cyber operations, the officials said. An announcement on the public elements of the response could come as early as this week. The sanctions part of the package culminates weeks of debate in the White House about how to revise an executive order from last year meant to give the president authority to respond to cyberattacks from overseas, but which did not originally cover efforts to influence the electoral system. The Obama administration last year rolled the order out to great fanfare as a way to punish and deter foreign hackers who harm the United States' economic or national security. The threat to use it last year helped wring a pledge out of China's president that his country would cease hacking U.S. companies' secrets to benefit Chinese firms. But officials this fall concluded that it could not, as written, be used to punish the most significant cyber-provocation in recent memory against the United States - Russia's hacking of Democratic organizations, targeting of state election systems and meddling in the presidential election. With the clock ticking, the White House is working on adapting the authority to punish the Russians, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. President Barack Obama last week pledged there would be a response to Moscow's interference in the U.S. elections. One clear way to use the order against the Russian suspects would be to declare the electoral systems part of the \"critical infrastructure\" of the United States. Or it could be amended to clearly apply to the new threat - interfering in elections. Administration officials would also like to make it difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to roll back any action they take. \"Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back,\" said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. (Ellen Nakashima) Obama issued the executive order in April 2015, creating the sanctions tool as a way to hold accountable people who harm computer systems related to critical functions such as electricity generation or transportation or who gain a competitive advantage through cybertheft of commercial secrets. The order allows the government to freeze the assets in the United States of people overseas who have engaged in cyber acts that have threatened U.S. national security or financial stability. The sanctions would also block commercial transactions with the designated individuals and bar their entry into the country. But just a year later, a Russian military spy agency would hack into the Democratic National Committee and steal a trove of emails that were released a few months later on WikiLeaks, U.S. officials said. Other releases followed, including the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta . \"Fundamentally, it was a low-tech, high-impact event,\" said Zachary Goldman, a sanctions and national security expert at New York University School of Law. And the 2015 executive order was not crafted to target hackers who steal emails and dump them on WikiLeaks or seek to disrupt an election. \"It was an authority published at a particular time to address a particular set of problems,\" he said. So officials \"need to engage in some legal acrobatics to fit the DNC hack into an existing authority, or they need to write a new authority,\" Goldman said. Administration officials would like Obama to use the power before leaving office to demonstrate its utility. Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Barack Obama issued a public warning to... FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Barack Obama issued a public warning to... (Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima) \"When the president came into office, he didn't have that many tools out there to use as a response\" to malicious cyber-acts, said Ari Schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council. \"Having the sanctions tool is really a big one. It can make a very strong statement in a way that is less drastic than bombing a country and more impactful than sending out a cable from the State Department.\" The National Security Council concluded that it would not be able to use the authority against Russian hackers because their malicious activity did not clearly fit under its terms, which require harm to critical infrastructure or the theft of commercial secrets. \"You would (a) have to be able to say that the actual electoral infrastructure, such as state databases, was critical infrastructure, and (b) that what the Russians did actually harmed it,\" said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"Those are two high bars.\" Though Russian government hackers are believed to have penetrated at least one state voter-registration database, they did not tamper with the data, officials said. Some analysts believe that state election systems would fit under \"government facilities,\" which is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors designated by the Department of Homeland Security. Another option is to use the executive order against other Russian targets - say, hackers who stole commercial secrets - and then, in either a public message or a private one, make clear that the United States considers its electoral systems to be critical infrastructure. White House suggests Putin directly involved with Russian cyberattack White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved with \"malicious cyberactivity to erode public confidence in our democracy.\" Dec. 15, 2016.\u00a0 White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved with \"malicious cyberactivity to erode public confidence in our democracy.\" Dec. 15, 2016.\u00a0 See more videos The idea is to not only punish but also deter. \"As much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future,\" a second official said. \"I am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, 'That worked pretty well in 2016, so let's keep going.' We have elections every two years in this country.\" Even the threat of sanctions can have deterrent value. Officials and experts point to the agreement Chinese President Xi Jinping reached with Obama last year that his country would stop commercial cyberspying. Xi came to the table following news reports last summer that the administration was preparing to sanction Chinese companies. Complicating matters, the Trump transition team has not yet had extensive briefings with the White House on cyber issues, including the potential use of the cyber-sanctions order. The slow pace has caused consternation among officials, who fear that the administration's accomplishments in cybersecurity could languish if the next administration fails to understand their value. Sanctions are not a silver bullet. Obama noted that \"we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against the Russians\" for their activities in Ukraine. So it is questionable, some experts say, whether adding new ones would have a meaningful effect in changing the Kremlin's behavior. But in combination with other measures, they could be effective. Criminal indictments of Russians might become an option, officials said, but the FBI has so far not gathered enough evidence that could be introduced in a criminal case. At one point, federal prosecutors and FBI agents in San Francisco considered indicting Guccifer 2.0, a nickname for a person or people believed to be affiliated with the Russian influence operation and whose true identity was unknown. Before the election, the administration used diplomatic channels to warn Russia. Obama spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Group of 20 summit in China in September. About a week before the election, the United States sent a \"hotline\"-style message to Moscow using a special channel for crisis communication created in 2013 as part of the State Department's Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. As part of that message, the officials said, the administration asked Russia to stop targeting state voter registration and election systems. It was the first use of that system. The Russians, officials said, appeared to comply. ",

The change comes after singer Richard Marx helped crew members subdue an unruly passenger aboard his Dec. 20 flight to Seoul. \"Korean Air has incredibly strong security measures but is beefing them up and reinforcing them by increasing Taser training, looking at putting male flight attendants on all flights and it's going to increase the overall training in the cabin,\" Korean Air spokesperson Penny Pfaelzer told NBC News Tuesday. While some industry experts and veterans expressed support for additional training for stun gun use, others decried the addition of specifically male flight attendants as misguided.

Men account for about one-tenth of Korean Air flight attendants, according to Reuters. Kaplan added that part of the issue was that \"you don't tend to have career flight attendants in that part of the world as much as you do in the U.S. and Europe.\" Related: Singer Richard Marx Subdues Unruly Passenger Aboard Korean Air Flight Jeff Price, aviation safety expert and professor of aerospace management at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said that while he supported stun gun use on violent passengers and additional training, the idea of adding specifically male flight attendants was \"ridiculous.\" Flight attendants of Korean Air Lines Co. learn how to use stun guns against in-flight violence YONHAP / EPA \"I think the key point here is that we have trained person able to use the Taser to properly,\" he said, adding \"they shouldn't be handing them out to any flight attendant that comes on board.\" But Price also said he thought it was \"ridiculous to say that males are more capable\" of properly dealing with a violent passenger. Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, told NBC News in a statement that the airline \"should spend less time practicing sexist policies and more time implementing training and providing Flight Attendants with tools that actually make a difference.\" \"Flight Attendants are uniquely skilled to calm the ever crowded, tight-spaced aircraft cabin. Gender has no bearing on ability to control an unruly passenger,\" she said in the statement. \"Weapons are meaningless and likely even more dangerous without proper training to use them,\" she added. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) The incident that sparked the most recent change from the airline involved an erratic passenger and went on for more than four hours, according to Marx's wife, model and former MTV VJ Daisy Fuentes. She added on social media that crew were unable to stop the violent passenger even after pulling out a stun gun. \"On our flight from Hanoi to Seoul a guy sitting in the next row from us got crazy & started attacking the flight attendants & passengers,\" wrote Feuntes, who posted images of the incident on social media. \"When he started pushing the female staff and pulling them by the hair @therichardmarx was the first to help subdue him.\" Images Fuentes posted show Marx with his elbow to the back of the unidentified passenger and in a separate image holding a rope. \"They didn't know how to use the taser & they didn't know how to secure the rope around him (he got loose from their rope restraints 3 times),\" she added. Related: What Flight Attendants Say About Unruly Passengers Retired American Airlines Captain Jay Rollins said the United States had already been through an influx of increased security following the September 11 terror attacks and that the new guidelines were generally \"on the right path.\" However, Rollins added that better security was not about the gender of the crew members, but about individuals being \"prepared to get physical\" when dealing with a violent passenger.

Fahrenthold and John Wagner December 27 at 10:56 AM Follow @Fahrenthold Follow @WPJohnWagner President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to defend the charitable foundation he has pledged to close, saying the media had not given him enough credit for his generosity and ignoring the legal issues that have ensnared the organization in controversy. The Donald J. Trump Foundation has come under intense scrutiny this year after reports in The Washington Post detailing its practices, including cases in which Trump apparently used the charity\u2019s money to settle lawsuits involving his for-profit businesses. [ Donald Trump plans to shut down his charitable foundation, which has been under scrutiny for months ] New York\u2019s attorney general is investigating the charity, and a spokeswoman for that office said Saturday that the foundation could not officially shut down until that probe is over. Among the issues at hand is whether Trump violated a \u201cself-dealing\u201d provision that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charities\u2019 funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. \u201cI gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won\u2019t report!\u201d Trump said in one Monday night tweet. (Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \u201cThe DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!\u201d the president-elect said in another. Trump and his companies gave about $6 million to his foundation since its launch in 1987, according to tax filings. The most recent tax filings go up to the end of 2015. Other people have collectively given about $9.5 million. The biggest outside donors were Vince and Linda McMahon, two pro-wrestling moguls, who gave the Trump Foundation $5 million between 2007 and 2009. Trump recently nominated Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration. Trump himself gave nothing to his foundation between 2009 and 2014, according to filings. His businesses contributed in 2015 for the first time in several years. [ Trump Hotels has had its eye on China \u2014 but the door hasn\u2019t opened ] Experts on charities say it\u2019s rare for the founder of a private, name-branded foundation to give nothing to his own foundation while relying entirely on donations from others. That anomaly allowed Trump to take advantage of the idea that the money in the foundation was his. Trump\u2019s donations to his foundation are also small, by the standards of billionaires\u2019 philanthropy. 1 of 31 Here\u2019s a look at Trump\u2019s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

Filmmaker George Lucas, for instance, who is tied with Trump at 324th place on Forbes\u2019s list of the world\u2019s billionaires, donated $925 million to his family foundation in 2012. In 2014, Lucas\u2019s foundation gave $55 million in donations to museums, hospitals, artistic groups and environmental charities. While much of the Trump foundation\u2019s money has gone to charity, there are some high-profile exceptions. In 2013, the Trump foundation gave a $25,000 gift to a campaign committee backing Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R), even though nonprofits like the charity are not allowed to give political gifts. [ Trump pays IRS a penalty for foundation\u2019s improper gift to aid Fla. attorney general ] That gift was made as Bondi\u2019s office was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. A consultant who worked on Bondi\u2019s reelection effort has said that Bondi was not aware of the allegations when she solicited the donation from Trump. Ultimately, Bondi\u2019s office did not pursue the fraud allegations. Trump also reported using foundation money to buy items for himself, which runs afoul of federal tax law. The Trump Foundation spent $30,000 to buy two large portraits of Trump, including one that was hung up in the sports bar at a Trump-owned resort. Trump also appears to have used $258,000 of his foundation\u2019s money \u2014 legally earmarked for charitable purposes \u2014 to settle lawsuits involving two of his for-profit clubs. [ How a Univision anchor found the missing portrait Trump bought with his charity\u2019s money ] The office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) announced its investigation of the Trump Foundation after reports in The Post described such apparent cases of self-dealing that date back to 2007. Trump\u2019s foundation has admitted in IRS tax filings for 2015 that it violated a prohibition against self-dealing that says nonprofit leaders cannot use their charities\u2019 funds to help themselves, their relatives or their businesses. In these tax filings, the charity checked \u201cyes\u201d in response to a question asking whether it had transferred any income or assets to \u201ca disqualified person\u201d \u2014 a description that could have meant Trump, a relative or a Trump-owned business. Trump has not said what exactly he did to violate the rule or what he has paid the IRS in penalty taxes as a result. The IRS has not commented when asked whether it was investigating the Trump Foundation. The New York attorney general\u2019s investigation is unlikely to lead to any kind of criminal charge. Instead, Trump may be required to repay his foundation the money it spent to help him, and he may have to personally pay penalty taxes worth 10 percent or more of the value of the self-dealing transactions. Trump\u2019s tweet was correct in that his foundation has low overhead. It has no paid staff and only a five-member board. It also has spent almost nothing on legal fees, raising the question of whether the organization was aware of the legal problems it created. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Christopher Reyes attends a gala benefit for Lurie Children's Hospital on April 20, 2012, in Chicago. (Daniel Boczarski / Getty Images) The wedding-industrial complex has ensured that ostentatious displays of one-upmanship have become a routine part of getting hitched \u2014 even for the middle class. So how does a self-respecting billionaire assert his clout on his daughter's big day? For food and beverage distribution mogul Christopher Reyes, the answer was: ask Mayor Rahm Emanuel to close a major downtown street. Reyes, 62 \u2014 said by Forbes magazine to be the 206th richest American, with a net worth of $2.9 billion \u2014 wrote to Emanuel on Aug. 27, 2015, with the subject line \"street closure for my daughter's wedding.\" The email was among hundreds released by the mayor's attorney in recent days as part of a settlement of a lawsuit with the Better Government Association. The big shot, who has a home in Lake Forest and has been a major donor to Emanuel and to Illinois Republicans, told the mayor his request through the normal channels to close down Monroe Street twice for a total of two and a half hours on a Saturday night in September 2015 had been denied. He noted that he was \"hoping\" the street could be closed \"for our guests' passage from the Art Institute of Chicago to the reception across Monroe.\" Alas, Emanuel did not respond to the email, leaving Reyes, his daughter and their guests to slum it by crossing the street like ordinary mortals. The mayor's spokesman, Adam Collins, said there was \"no action taken regarding the street closure. Just because someone makes a request doesn't mean anything comes of it.\" ",

    "text": "CBS News Dec 27, 2016 12:38 PM EST President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday night to defend his charitable foundation, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, just two days after announcing he will dissolve it . In the posts, Mr. Trump says he gave \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to the Trump Foundation. He also said that all of the money goes \u201cto wonderful charities,\u201d a claim for which there is little to no evidence: I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016 The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016 Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that he has given \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to the Trump Foundation, news reports have indicated that Mr. Trump vastly oversells his charitable giving. And since he has not released his tax returns, it\u2019s impossible to verify how much money he has given to charity.\u00a0 According to the Washington Post , Mr. Trump has given only one traceable personal donation since 2008 -- for $10,000, to the Police Athletic League of New York City. As for the Trump Foundation, Mr. Trump has given $5.5 million to the group since its inception -- but has not contributed to it since 2008, meaning the organization has largely been funded by other people in recent years. In addition, several reports have established that Mr. Trump used money from the foundation to help further his political interests. The Washington Post reported, for example, that Mr. Trump used foundation funds to settle legal disputes -- and even to buy two large portraits of himself, one of which hung on the wall of a Trump-owned golf resort. He paid a $2,500 fine to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earlier this year after it was revealed that his foundation made a $25,000 political contribution that violated tax laws. The series of tweets came just two days after Mr. Trump announced he would be shuttering the foundation in the wake of questions about possible conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump said in a Christmas Eve statement that he has directed his counsel to begin taking steps toward dissolving the foundation; however, it cannot formally shut down until the New York state attorney general\u2019s office completes its investigation of the foundation. \u201cTo avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his statement. Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets about the Trump Foundation also came just hours after he insisted on Twitter that there was \u201cno way\u201d President Obama could have beaten him in a hypothetical 2016 election between the two men, and criticized the United Nations for not living up to its \u201cgreat potential.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

She died Dec. 27, 2016, after suffering an apparent heart attack Dec. 23 on a flight between London and Los Angeles. AP By Ann Hornaday December 27 at 4:27 PM Follow @AnnHornaday \u2018Some crappy dessert. Anything. I\u2019ll take it all.\u201d That was Carrie Fisher ordering a midafternoon snack at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where she was doing interviews for \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,\u201d a documentary about her mother, Debbie Reynolds; Fisher confided that she\u2019d wanted to make the film for the past few years because, as she explained, \u201cmy mother had been sort of declining, and I didn\u2019t know how much longer she would be performing.\u201d [ Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 dies at 60 ] In a cruel, cosmic twist Fisher herself would no doubt appreciate with her distinctive brand of gallows humor, she wound up going first \u2014 ahead of the mother whose multi-hyphenated gifts (singer-dancer-actress) and marriage to Eddie Fisher catapulted Carrie into fame that never seemed to fit her entirely comfortably. She went into the family business as an actress, vaulting from off-screen Hollywood royalty to the on-screen version as a generation\u2019s most revered space princess, along the way picking up and dropping a drug habit, turning it all into fodder for one of the finest, funniest show-business memoirs ever written, albeit in the form of a semi-autobiographical novel. Movie fans may consider \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d a piquant Meryl Streep comedy, but writers worship the book for the same tough, wry self-awareness Fisher brought to her script-doctoring work (including uncredited improvements to the dialogue in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d and other \u201cStar Wars\u201d sequels), her one-woman show, \u201cWishful Drinking,\u201d and her actual memoir, the just-published \u201c The Princess Diarist .\u201d [ From the archives: A 1987 profile of Carrie Fisher ] (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) Approaching the nearly deserted hotel dining room where Fisher was holding court at Cannes, a certain amount of anxiety was in order. She was, after all, a bona fide icon whose contribution to \u201cStar Wars\u201d and its mythic status cannot be overstated, if only because her version of a princess was so subversively, sarcastically salty. She was also whip-smart, armed with a well-attuned b.s. detector and a lethally barbed verbal arsenal with which to enforce it. Happily enough, Carrie Fisher turned out to be, not an Important Figure or Towering Intellect but, of all things, a person \u2014 whose mix of forthrightness and humor were on full, disarming display as she nibbled at a plate of petits fours and shared a dish of vanilla ice cream with her beloved French bulldog, Gary. (The two had been the hit of the red carpet at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner just a few weeks earlier. \u201cHe\u2019s changed,\u201d she said of the attention. \u201cIt\u2019s gone straight to his tail.\u201d). Although she looked terrific \u2014 if exhausted \u2014 she didn\u2019t hesitate to share the mortification of confronting her aging face and body on a 30-foot screen, in both \u201cBright Lights\u201d and, a few months earlier, in \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d \u201cI see it and I suffer, and then I see it again, and I\u2019m sort of able to watch it,\u201d she said, admitting that it was never easy to watch herself on the big screen, \u201cbut now it\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d Last week, after seeing her 1977 \u201cStar Wars\u201d persona briefly come back to life in the new spinoff \u201cRogue One,\u201d she tweeted, \u201ccgi me . . . like uber-Botox only more persistent,\u201d spelled by way of her own private language of emoji hieroglyphics. [ As iconic Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher was a life-force to be reckoned with ] Back at Cannes, even within the necessary confines of a rushed 20-minute interview, Fisher displayed what made her so distinctive as an actress and a writer: her honesty. No sooner had she ordered her \u201ccrappy dessert\u201d than she launched into a monologue about how ice cream and peanut butter help manage bouts of depression. Although she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder more than a decade ago, \u201cI don\u2019t get depressed that much,\u201d she confided, adding that \u201cI think it\u2019s important not to look for those things. So I don\u2019t.\u201d Fisher eagerly recounted how she advocated for electroconvulsive therapy after having been helped by the treatment. \u201cIt has such a bad rap,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s used as a technique of torture in every Hollywood movie in which it\u2019s ever been depicted. There\u2019s no shame in it, but there is shame in it. And part of me, I guess, likes to be sort of shocking.\u201d Fisher will be duly remembered for her wit, her intelligence, her acerbic self-awareness and her status as a pop-culture legend in one of the most pivotal films of the late 20th century (and beyond). But it\u2019s her willingness to bring lucid, sometimes lacerating candor to even her most private struggles that will be her most meaningful legacy. \u201cThe great thing about it is when a 14-year-old comes up and says, \u2018I found out I was bipolar, and my mom told me that Princess Leia is bipolar as well,\u2019 \u201d Fisher said, adding that \u201canyone who has this illness is heroic.\u201d Leave it to Fisher to have embodied that principle literally, figuratively and, now, forever more. lifestyle ",

Although Fisher is known for playing Princess Leia, she was just as famous for her wit and dry humor as she was for her iconic role in \" Star Wars .\" LucasFilm Ltd. Carrie Fisher, center, as Princess Leia, in a scene from \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.\" This is the Carrie Fisher you may not have known: Carrie Fisher the Script Doctor Fisher's work behind the scenes helped perfect other Hollywood blockbusters. She was asked to rewrite the 1991 Peter Pan adventure film \"Hook\" after she wrote \"Postcards from the Edge,\" she told the Phoenix New Times in 2008. TriStar Pictures Dustin Hoffman, left, as Captain Hook, and Robin Williams, as Peter Pan, in a scene from \"Hook.\" \"They told me they wanted me to rewrite Tinkerbell\u2019s part, but if Tinkerbell interacts, you\u2019re writing scenes,\" Fisher said. After \"Hook,\" Fisher also worked on \"Sister Act\" and \"Lethal Weapon 3,\" and she would rewrite dialogue in parts she played as well. \"It is easier as an actor to go into rewriting because you know what would fit into your mouth dialogue-wise,\" she told the New Times.

Fisher also starred in \"Censored Scenes from King Kong,\" which opened in March 1980, and 1982's \"Agnes of God,\" according to Broadway.com .

That took me by surprise.\u201d Fisher added, \u201cMy comfort wasn\u2019t the most important thing -- my getting through to the other side of difficult feelings was.\u201d In September, Fisher spoke to CBC's \"Radio Active,\" saying that speaking out about her mental illness has been \u201cfreeing.\u201d \u201cShame is not something I aspire to,\u201d she said, noting that \"a lot of people are bipolar.\" Fisher added that since speaking up, she had gotten \u201ca lot of people coming up to me and thanking me for that.\u201d ABC News' Andrea Dresdale and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

In Baton Rouge, little 9-month-old Mason Jackson sees his father\u2019s face every day, all the time \u2013 in photographs. His mother makes sure of that, makes sure he feels his father\u2019s presence. His mother tells him what a selfless, caring man his daddy, Montrell Jackson, was, and how much he wanted a child \u2013 they tried for nearly two years. She tells Mason how ecstatic Montrell was when he came into the world in March. \u201cThat\u2019s what hurts the most,\u201d said Trenisha Jackson, \u201cthat he\u2019s not here for his son. He was so excited about being a father. He felt his responsibility was to make sure he raised a wonderful young man. [Montrell\u2019s] father was not in his life. He really wanted to be there for his son.\u201d Montrell Jackson, 32, was shot fatally in an ambush in July \u2013 when Mason was 4 months old \u2013 by a man targeting police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Expand / Contract Baton Rouge Police Corporal Montrell Jackson, who was shot and killed by Gavin Long along with two other officers on July 17. (Officer Down Memorial Page) That gunman killed a total of three officers \u2013 just a fraction of the nearly 140 law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty this year, up from 130 in 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a non-profit group founded and run by active and retired law enforcement officials. The most recent shootings of police officers took place on Friday. In Mt. Vernon, Washington, Mike \u201cMick\u201d McLaurghry, a 30-year veteran, was shot in the back of the head while responding to a call. Officials said he was \u201changing in there\u201d in critical condition after surgery . Later the same day, Sgt. Rob Hatchell, of Dallas, Oregon, was shot in the leg while attempting to arrest an intoxicated man. Of those men and women in blue who died in 2016, 62 were killed by gunfire \u2013 a marked rise from the 39 the year before \u2013 about a dozen of them shot by gunmen who set out to kill police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, this year, is a big increase in gunfire murders of police officers,\u201d Lt. Randy Sutton, a retired police officer and author who represents Blue Lives Matter, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThe methodology, where they are targeted attacks or ambushes or where people are lured into attacks, is up too. We haven\u2019t seen that since the late \u201860s or \u201870s, when there was a tremendous amount of anti-police terrorism.\u201d Sutton, like many others in law enforcement, say that tension between police and minority groups like Black Lives Matter that have organized to focus attention on profiling and what they argue is unwarranted use of force has led some to see those in uniform as the enemy. \u201cIt legitimizes a call for terror, a call for violence,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt adds an element of danger for law enforcement.\u201d He added, \u201cOf course not everyone who is in the protests believes that. But when there\u2019s a mob in place and fervor builds up, people do things they wouldn\u2019t normally do independently. And it can inspire lone wolf attacks. There are weak-minded people, some mentally disturbed, who absorb this call to action and act upon it.\u201d The methodology, where they are targeted attacks or ambushes or where people are lured into attacks ... we haven\u2019t seen that since the late \u201860s or \u201870s, when there was a tremendous amount of anti-police terrorism. - Randy Sutton, retired police lieutenant who represents Blue Lives Matter The deadliest assaults occurred in July in Dallas and Baton Rouge amid protests over black men who had died in encounters with police. A black gunman in Dallas opened fire on officers at a Black Lives Matter protest, killing five officers and wounding four others. Tensions rose in Baton Rouge, where thousands of people were angry over the death of 37-year-old Alton Sterling, a black man killed by white Baton Rouge officers after a confrontation at a convenience store. Those in law enforcement say they know they are signing up for a potentially dangerous job when they enter the profession. \u201cThere are risks every officer knows going in,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThat includes everything from going up against an armed suspect who is going to resist and going to do everything to escape, including shooting to try and kill you, to being struck by a car during a traffic stop.\u201d He went on, \u201cBut what is particularly frightening and disturbing at this point are the assassinations and entrapments, where police officers are lured into situations [in order] to kill them.\u201d Before her husband\u2019s death, Ternisha Jackson just let the day-to-day risks of police work stay on the margins of her thoughts. \u201cMontrell loved his job,\u201d his widow said. \u201cWe put the risks out of our minds.\u201d The growing protests outside police departments across the country, however, concerned her. \u201cThat was the first time I became afraid, I was afraid for him, after everything taking place,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going out of my mind. I never feared for his life until the protests.\u201d She understands the anger many people feel toward police. She knows, too, that some of it could be justified. But the answer, she says, is not violence. \u201cI get pulled over, and it\u2019s for a reason,\u201d she said. \u201cA broken tail light, it\u2019s for [your] safety ... Police die protecting you. They chose to protect and serve, and they deserve respect.\u201d When someone encounters a police who acts unprofessionally, Jackson said, \u201cThey should call them out, file a report.\u201d In Texas, Cpl. Marcie St. John knew that a large but peaceful protest was underway in Dallas in response to fatal police shootings that week in Baton Rouge and suburban St. Paul, Minnesota. She had finished her shift at about 8:30 p.m. and was on her way home \u2013 looking toward starting vacation the next day -- when she received a phone call from a colleague in law enforcement. \u201cMy friend calls me and said, \u2018Something is going downtown,\u2019 something major,\u201d St. John recalled. Within minutes, she got an alert from her department, asking that everyone be ready to report to duty. At home, as she put on her tactical gear, she got a call from another friend who told her that her best friend, Michael Smith, her former partner, had been shot while on duty at the protest. \u201cHe was a sound cop, a strong cop,\u201d said St. John, whose brother, who also was a police officer, died in the line of duty when they both were rookies. \u201cI never, ever thought it would happen to Mike.\u201d Expand / Contract Sgt. Michael Smith was one of five Dallas police officers Micah Johnson killed on July 7. (Dallas Police Department) The killer was 25-year-old Micah Johnson, an Army veteran who told authorities he was upset about fatal police shootings and wanted to exterminate policemen, \"especially white officers,\" officials said. Johnson, who was killed by a robot-delivered bomb dispatched by Dallas police, had amassed a personal arsenal at his suburban home, including bomb-making materials, bulletproof vests, rifles, ammunition and a journal of combat tactics. The killings marked the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In all, 12 officers were shot. \u201cEverything that\u2019s going on in law enforcement, officers being ambushed,\u201d said St. John, \u201cin my 25-year career, I\u2019ve never seen this. All of our officers \u2013 their lives and their deaths \u2013 have to matter.\u201d She has been helping Smith's widow, Heidi, and their two young daughters put their lives back together. The youngest daughter, who was 9 at the time of Smith's killing, has thought back to her last conversation with her father before he went off to work. Smith asked his daughter for a kiss, but she said she was busy playing a game. He pressed again, saying \"This may be the last time,\u201d St. John said he told her. Ten days before his own death, Montrell Jackson felt deeply distressed over the contentious protests and Dallas ambush \u2013 both as a police officer and a black man. He said as much in a message he posted on his Facebook page. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote, according to screen shots of his post, which was taken down after his death. \u201cDisappointed in some family, friends and officers for some reckless comments, but hey, what\u2019s in your heart is in your heart. I still love you all because hate takes too much energy, but I definitely won\u2019t be looking at you the same. Thank you to everyone [who] has reached out to me or my wife \u2013 it was needed and much appreciated. I swear to God I love this city, but I wonder if this city loves me.\u201d Jackson saw himself as a bridge between police and black residents, saying he understood the difficulty of being in each group\u2019s shoes. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced so much in my short life, and the past 3 days have tested me to the core,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn uniform, I get nasty hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat.\u201d He appealed to protesters. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let hate infect your heart,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cThis city MUST and WILL get better. I\u2019m working in these streets, so any protesters, officers, friends, family or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer, I got you.\u201d In Missouri, Gavin Eugene Long, a black separatist, never saw, or cared about, Jackson\u2019s plea. He traveled to Baton Rouge to hunt for police officers. And that is where he ended the life of little Mason\u2019s father.

    "text": "FROM AUG. 9: North Korea Says It Has Conducted Its Strongest-Ever Nuclear Test 1:48 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161228013507if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/761703491552\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> In fact, Obama's Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said recently that the goal of getting the North to give up its nuclear program is \"probably a lost cause.\" \"They are not going to do that \u2014 that is their ticket to survival. They are under siege and they are very paranoid,\" he said. \"The best that we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap.\" The Confrontation Strategy The new president could ditch the United States' decades-long policy of \"strategic patience\" and instead confront Pyongyang. Related: How China Could Pose the Biggest Challenge for Trump To some degree, the U.S. is already doing that by holding increasingly large military exercises with ally South Korea that include rehearsals for regime change in Pyongyang. It flew B-1 nuclear bombers off North Korea in September as a show of force. Trump could ramp up this approach, but a direct, preemptive strike on North Korea is most probably not on the table \u2014 the risk is just too big. Pyongyang would immediately retaliate by blitzing South Korea's capital Seoul, which is only 50 miles from its border. The exact capabilities of Kim's long-range missiles are not clear. But it is safe to say he would try to retaliate to a foreign attack. And no one doubts he has a nuclear capability, however weak. The Accommodation Option There is another, as yet untried approach that the new administration might consider. Rather than trying to prevent or reverse North Korea's nuclear program, the U.S. might quietly accept it and manage the consequences. As it is, the North sees its nuclear program not as a bargaining chip but a vital part of its national security. It sees the world through the lens crafted by President George W. Bush, who in 2002 declared the country part of America's \"axis of evil\" that encompassed Iraq and Iran. Pyongyang undoubtedly watched carefully as Iraq's Saddam Hussein was overthrown and hanged after a U.S. invasion. And the regime surely noted the invasion was justified by allegations Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction, charges that turned out to be false. Later, Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya \u2014 another American bugbear who had harbored and then abandoned ambitions of developing a nuclear arsenal \u2014 was toppled and murdered during a U.S.-backed uprising. Kim's nuclear weapons are his defense against going the same way as Saddam and Gadhafi. Clapper notes that accepting North Korea's inconvenient arsenal and trying to cap it may require \"some sort of inducements.\" Play ",

    "text": "At Pearl Harbor, Obama says 'we must resist the urge to demonize those who are different' Shinzo Abe, Barack Obama Marco Garcia / Associated Press President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Tuesday. President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Tuesday. (Marco Garcia / Associated Press) Christi Parsons Contact Reporter President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe scattered\u00a0petals together\u00a0on the waters of Pearl Harbor on Tuesday in a symbolic act aimed at laying to rest the enmity of the Japanese attack 75 years ago that drew the U.S. into World War II. In a moment consumed with history, both leaders were fixed on the future. They expressed\u00a0concern\u00a0that the lessons of the war might be forgotten amid a shifting world order and the anti-internationalist sentiment that has swept over politics around the globe, most notably with the ascendance of President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cEven when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\u201d The ceremony was conceived of as an affirmation of close U.S. relations with Japan, once a bitter wartime enemy, and\u00a0Obama and Abe underscored the importance of building bonds between nations and the risks of slipping into isolationism. Their remarks also appeared to be\u00a0warnings for\u00a0Trump, whose divisive campaign took aim at longstanding alliances and stoked fears with harsh rhetoric about immigrants and minorities. \u201cOurs is an alliance of hope that will lead us to the future,\u201d Abe said, speaking to World War II veterans after paying tribute at the Pearl Harbor memorial. \u201cWhat has bonded us together is the power of reconciliation, made possible through the spirit of tolerance.\u201d Obama, as has been his custom in public remarks since the election, argued for the merits of his own worldview\u00a0without naming Trump, saying,\u00a0\u201cThere is more to be won in peace than in war.\u201d During the campaign and since his election, Trump has\u00a0challenged assumptions about U.S. commitments to the security of Asia. One of the central tenets of Obama\u2019s foreign policy was a commitment of resources toward Asia with an eye toward countering the rise of China. But Trump has obliterated long-established protocols. He spoke with Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen\u00a0despite the U.S. policy of officially acknowledging no Chinese government other than the one in Beijing. And when he met with Abe last month in New York, Trump brought not a battalion of Asia experts but rather his daughter Ivanka. Trump also promised last week to expand America\u2019s nuclear arsenal after decades of a deliberate shrinking of the American and Russian stockpiles. \u201cLet it be an arms\u00a0race,\u201d he told an MSNBC host, unnerving leaders in Asia, where North Korea and China are growing more aggressive. Though the U.S.-Japan relationship has evolved considerably in recent decades, the healing over World War II has gone more slowly, making Abe\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor, and Obama\u2019s trip\u00a0in May to Hiroshima, Japan, the site of one of the two nuclear attacks that ended the war, significant gestures. Abe became the first Japanese prime minister to make a highly publicized visit to the USS Arizona Memorial, though three of his predecessors are thought to have visited Pearl Harbor more quietly. Under a bright, sunny sky, Abe and Obama rode a small boat to the white memorial building in the harbor that looks out over the sunken remains of the Arizona, attacked by the Japanese on Dec. 7, 1941, killing\u00a02,403 people and thrusting\u00a0the U.S. into World War II.\u00a0Abe laid a wreath in honor of the dead. Veterans of the war gathered across the harbor to hear Obama and Abe deliver their brief speeches. Among those in the crowd was Sterling Cale, 95, a sailor at Pearl Harbor on the day of the attack. Of those killed that day, 1,177 were crew members of the Arizona. It was Cale\u2019s job to pull bodies from the burning battleship. He\u00a0recalled watching ashes rising from the deck of the ship. He and his crew were able to remove about 100 bodies. On Tuesday, he looked across the water where the Arizona is submerged. He did not come hoping to hear Abe apologize, he said.\u00a0 \u201c\u2018Sorry\u2019 is just a word,\u201d Cale said. \u201cWhat matters more is the action of coming here and going out there with our commander in chief. That says more than words.\u201d ",

It was the first formal visit to the memorial that rests above the USS Arizona by a Japanese leader. USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe place wreaths at the USS Arizona Memorial. (Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM, AFP/Getty Images) President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe paid emotional tribute Tuesday to the thousands of Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, and said the strong relations between their two nations in the decades since prove the power of reconciliation. \"Even the deepest wounds of war can give way to friendship and lasting peace,\" Obama said after welcoming his Japanese counterpart to the site of the attack that drew the United States into the\u00a0Second World War, a conflict that transformed America into a global superpower. Describing Pearl Harbor as \"a sacred place,\" Obama said: \"Here, in so many ways, America came of age.\" Abe, the first Japanese leader to pay a formal visit to Pearl Harbor, all but apologized for the attack of Dec. 7, 1941,\u00a0offering his \"sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls\" of the more than 2,400 Americans who lost their lives in the surprise attack. \"We must never repeat the horrors of war,\" Abe said. The prime minister also thanked the United States for helping his nation recover\u00a0\u2014 and develop a democracy \u2014 in the years after World War II, which ended with the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Obama visited Hiroshima in May, a trip Abe reciprocated with the ceremony at Pearl Harbor. Before their public remarks, Obama and Abe toured the memorial above the sunken USS Arizona. They visited the \"shrine\u00a0room,\" placing wreaths of peace lilies\u00a0in front of a wall adorned\u00a0with the names of American service members killed in the attack.\u00a0They\u00a0later dropped purple flowers into the waters of the harbor. The leaders also had a private meeting about U.S.-Japan relations, an alliance they praised during their public remarks. \"It has helped underwrite an international order that has prevented another World War,\" Obama said, and the U.S.-Japanese alliance \"has never been stronger.\" Abe said the U.S. and Japan have become the kinds of allies \"rarely found anywhere in history,\" a development he attributed to the \"power of reconciliation.\" Changes in\u00a0the alliance could be imminent as Donald Trump prepares to become U.S. president on Jan. 20.\u00a0During the campaign, Trump said Japan and other countries are taking advantage of the U.S. when it comes to trade deals. He also talked about demanding that Japan and other nations pay more for U.S. defense assistance. Publicly, Obama and Abe largely laid modern politics aside in speaking of those who made the ultimate sacrifice at Pearl Harbor. \"Here in this quiet harbor,\" Obama said,\u00a0\"\u00a0we honor those we lost, and we give thanks for all that our two nations have won \u2014 together, as friends.\" Both Obama and Abe spoke of the sacrifices made by service members during the conflict that engulfed the world less than a century ago. The sight of\u00a0the Arizona, its gutted hull at the bottom of the harbor, is \"a place that brought utter silence to me,\" Abe said. At the time of the attack and over the years, some citizens in Japan described the Pearl Harbor attack as retaliation for a U.S. oil embargo on their energy-starved country.\u00a0A\u00a0previous Japanese prime minister made an unannounced visit to Pearl Harbor in 1951, but Abe became the country's first leader to participate in a ceremony at the attack site. Obama may have made a reference to current events when he said that, even at times \"when hatred burns hottest,\" people \"must resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\" Such are among the lessons of war, he said. \"The fruits of peace always outweigh the plunder of war,\" Obama said. \"This is the enduring truth of this hallowed harbor.\" 75 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 48 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iBKKHh NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Like Jimmy Hoffa. mtmiceli says: Dec 27, 2016 11:48 AM Any team that hires him for more than a coach is headed for disaster.  They guy is blow hard, loud mouthed bully who has accomplished NOTHING, except extort millions from the Jets and Bills\u2026LOL Dec 27, 2016 11:49 AM Bully for Buffalo! ibillwt says: Dec 27, 2016 11:49 AM Hope he gets shot at DC somewhere instead of just another talking head.  Kind of pathetic being a loser criticising winners on tv.  DC job would be shot at getting some dignity back. patriotsticketssince1978 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:49 AM I hope he goes into broadcasting. He seems like a nice enough guy who could be entertaining. Coaching seems like a grind. getoveryourself999 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:49 AM I would love to see Rex as the DC for Washington State.  Can you imagine the fights that would go on there between those two blowhards? dickshotdogs says: Dec 27, 2016 11:49 AM At least they\u2019re keeping Whaley\u2026.:) bobC927 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM Never was Head Coach material. ontherocks1964 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM The Great Rex Error is over.  Merry Christmas!  I know it means starting over AGAIN, but this guy had to go in my book.  A complete clown. bigbluefan1 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM Wow shocked bad news is he will get paid just the same Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM Well, there goes the off-season. The Bills will probably lose. Footballfanz says: Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM Someone will hire him, he must be the smoothest talked in the NFL because he has an under .500 record as a head coach. And as far as being a \u2018defensive guru\u2019 he took over a #4 defense and turned it into a mid 20\u2019s defense. He cant even do that right. Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM When will Buffalo get an NFL QB? contactkylesmith says: Dec 27, 2016 11:50 AM The best day I\u2019ve had as a Bills fan in a long time. \u2026which is really sad. spotsdad says: Dec 27, 2016 11:51 AM He did say that this was his last hoorah in the NFL. Let\u2019s see if he keeps his word, which has always meant so much. I just wish there was a way to keep him in the AFCE. Not with the Patriots of course, that would be dumb. So I guess it\u2019s up to Miami. Fins Up! Dec 27, 2016 11:51 AM fat self important slob Dec 27, 2016 11:51 AM \u201cAs for Ryan, his days as an NFL head coach are likely done. He\u2019ll either become a defensive coordinator or a television analyst.\u201d Anyone that has watched his defenses for the last 5 years knows the former is pretty much out of the question. fumblenuts says: Dec 27, 2016 11:51 AM Those 2 BLOWHARDS can now get a snack!! bulbsboss says: Dec 27, 2016 11:51 AM Well at least now there\u2019s a suitable replacement for Bozo The Clown\u2019s TV show\u2026 tylawspick6 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:51 AM You have to figure we\u2019ve heard the last of this big mouth, entitled loser in the NFL in terms of being in front of a microphone as a coach. What a loser. I don\u2019t know why this is that hard to understand. He\u2019s made millions by fooling two different franchises. What a country. sdelmonte says: Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM Why fire him with a single game left?  Is Lynn getting an audition?  Somehow I doubt it. dablitz2 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM I don\u2019t see how he was doing such a horrible job.  They finished 8-8 his first year.  They would have again if he had been allowed to finish.  It seems like firing someone after 2 years when they do not have a losing season is a little unfair. lukedunphysscienceproject says: Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM I\u2019m no Rex fan, and I really can\u2019t stand Rob, but did the Bills really expect to be THAT much better than 8-8 or 7-9 this season? If they did, then it\u2019s only because of the blustering predictions made by the guy they just fired. Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM Step 1 Accomplished. tacowrecker says: Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM Stan Kroenke firing up the Brinks truck to bring Rex to LA!! It\u2019s a perfect fit!! BTW,  Stan also trademarked \u201c7-9\u201d and \u201c8-8.\u201d Also considering \u201c6-10\u201d thisonesforpat says: Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM I thought it would be funny if they fired Rex  and made rob the interim head coach. That would send a message to Rex, eh? Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM kfinfan says:Dec 27, 2016 11:46 AM Ah shucks\u2026..I was hoping Buffalo would keep him around a few more years. I love his baffoonary! Always makes coaching decisions that make me laugh and benefit my team. Go Dolphins! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 You Dolphin fans have got to stop! Yes you made the playoffs, Congrats! But you barely beat the Bills this year and he completely smoked your team the previous season. Not barely beat, SMOKED! Plus you got swept the previous year as well. Good grief.. Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM That escalated slowly. Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM What took so long ?? spotsdad says: Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM Regarding the timing of Rex\u2019s demise; if you are gonna fire a head coach, it can never be too soon, only too late. Dec 27, 2016 11:52 AM but THEY WON THE OFFSEASON!!!!!!!!!!!! Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM When are they going to fire Whaley? bassplucker says: Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM It seems like more teams are doing away with the formality of waiting out the season and are instead trying to get a jump on finding replacements. McCoy and Bowles are probably yet to get the axe, but unless the Bears brass pulls a shocker and dumps John Fox I think that should pretty much do it for the firings this year. Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM A mediocre coach fired by a bad franchise. Who exactly are they going to get to coach them that will be an upgrade? I almost feel bad for Bills fans. nsawins says: Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM Bills Mafia stand up LOL\u2026\u2026\u2026.clowns. kgunforhire says: Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM Tough to see another coaching change, but this had to be done. You can\u2019t be labeled a defensive genius yet produce a defensive product that drastically regressed. Keep in mind that this was a defense that was top 5 when he took it over from Schwartz. Continuity and roster gutting is what I fear the most about coaching changes. Hopefully we can bring in someone who will be flexible to mold their schemes to the roster\u2019s strengths. Usually two years isn\u2019t nearly enough to evaluate, but the Phins game provided more than enough to warrant this. Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM \u201cWe\u2019ll be out of work for like five minutes.\u201d Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM Nooooooooooo, please keep him in the AFCE! Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM OK, can them firing Rex, but Rob? Who\u2019s hair will the cameras focus on during the Jets game? tfarr45 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM Wow ! Shocked because I thought that they would at least wait until after the season . Not shocked because of the play of the defense which was supposed to be a specialty of him and his brother , and the apparent disorganization of the team with lack of cohesion, 10 or 12 men on the field , lack of communication, lack of discipline ,on and on . Took a top 5 defense and brought them down to the lower half of the league . Would make a good tv analyst with his antics , just not a good head coach / team manager . Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM bye felicia tonebones says: Dec 27, 2016 11:53 AM So now the GM has proven that he can\u2019t find a winning QB or head coach. Those are the two most imported requirements for a GM. Does the owner recognize this, or do they care? The Bills don\u2019t have an NFL QB on their roster. Rex lied his way into the job by saying he could win with the players on the roster. It\u2019s my guess that whoever was going to be chosen, was going to be the guy that told that lie. Now here we go again. Liars, line up. This GM obviously isn\u2019t going to admit that he has no clue, and the owner doesn\u2019t seem to care. bondlake says: Dec 27, 2016 11:54 AM Happy to see that bigmouth gone. rabidbillsfan says: Dec 27, 2016 11:54 AM Tom Coughlin, enough is enough. Something this team has lacked for many years is team discipline. Even just to right the ship for a pair of seasons. Rex had a few bad breaks, G-Ro neutering the offense the first 2 weeks, a heavy hit in terms of injuries, but you can\u2019t fold 3 of the last four the way they did. I want Whaley to go as well, but that may be a season away. Tyrod showed competence against Miami, but it needs to be done consistently. He\u2019s not worth $16m, that is a fact. I\u2019d pay Cutler $20m before I\u2019d pay Tyrod $16\u2026 lgw91s says: Dec 27, 2016 11:55 AM Really, I am looking forward to his role as an analyst on TV. Gruden makes $6 mil at ESPN. Can you believe that? Dec 27, 2016 11:55 AM Have fun starting all over again Bills Fans\u2026 Dec 27, 2016 11:55 AM Patriots need someone to polish all their rings. ranesmith says: Dec 27, 2016 11:55 AM As a pats fan this is so funny to me.all I remember him talking junk about coach billy.I\u2019m not gonna kiss the rings talk,now go out and find a job Rex \uf602\uf602.go patriots whatjusthapped says: Dec 27, 2016 11:55 AM Rex is loud mouth which makes for very entertaining press conferences and little else.    There was a great article back when he was hired on Cold hard football facts (since renamed to Football Nation) on how the biggest loudmouths in NFL coaching history (Rex, his father, Buddy, Jerry Glanville and others) never translated into success on the field. Good for Buffalo, now they can proceed on putting something positive together, something Rex could never do in a 1,000 years. sobceo75 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:56 AM The REDSKINS next DC! Book it! maust1013 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:56 AM The level of play in the AFCE just jumped exponentially unfortunately it came at the expense of it\u2019s comic relief. ricko1112 says: Dec 27, 2016 11:57 AM Not being able to call a simple timeout to ice the Dolphins\u2019 kicker at the end of regulation and then only having 10 men on the field for the last big run to set up the winning FG in OT are classic Rex. His teams were always out coached, unprepared, and undisciplined. His teams regressed year after year. He is a buffoon of the highest order. Dec 27, 2016 11:57 AM and the GM stays ???? lol\u2026 only in Cleveland, i mean Buffalo. who cares they both stink bassplucker says: Dec 27, 2016 12:00 PM Wow. They only gave him 2 seasons. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 It\u2019s not like he walked into a Browns or Bears situation where there were only a handful of NFL caliber starters on the entire roster. There is enough talent on the Bills to at least be contending for a wildcard by now. QB of course being the glaring exception but plenty of other NFL teams have gotten to the postseason with QBs no better that Taylor. spotsdad says: Dec 27, 2016 12:00 PM Now instead of seeing him twice a year we can see him daily on ESPN. Oh joy. Dec 27, 2016 12:00 PM Rex Ryan is just what the Colts need. xenova1 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:00 PM Can we call this Rexxit? patsfan1820 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:01 PM Goodbye and good riddance.  About time the Bills fired Rex Ryan I thought they\u2019d never do it. Dec 27, 2016 12:01 PM Jeff Fisher will be the next head coach of the Bills Dec 27, 2016 12:01 PM Not a Rex fan but, 2 years is too short a sample. 6ball says: Dec 27, 2016 12:01 PM . Is the Bills roster much better than 8-8? . abninf says: Dec 27, 2016 12:02 PM Didn\u2019t even last 24 months. They\u2019re becoming the new Browns, rebuilding every season or two. Dec 27, 2016 12:02 PM BREAKING NEWS: FOXBORO, MA Patriot\u2019s Coach Bill Belichick was asked about Rex\u2019s firing. \u201cThat gasbag? Are you kidding me?\u201d Strike that\u2026 no comment! then he chased the reporter out of the locker room as he laughed uncontrollably\u2026 xenova1 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:02 PM The Ryan brothers lived off their father\u2019s accomplishments. Dec 27, 2016 12:03 PM fire whaley RegisHawk says: Dec 27, 2016 12:03 PM Considering his vast experience with the AFC East, he\u2019s likely in consideration for the Miami and/or New England positions next. weepingjebus says: Dec 27, 2016 12:04 PM This has been the greatest year of my life. therick5000 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:04 PM Can\u2019t wait for that clueless Browns owner and his equally clueless wife to hire him\u2026 araidersfan says: Dec 27, 2016 12:05 PM \u201cAs for Ryan, his days as an NFL head coach are likely done. He\u2019ll either become a defensive coordinator or a television analyst.\u201d === Actually, I think that the Ryan Bros. are best suited as the lead act in a traveling 3-ring circus show.   Rex can also serve as the carnival-barker. Wisconsin's Favorite Son Jeffrey Be Dahmed says: Dec 27, 2016 12:05 PM I am just so glad we still have Mike McCarthy in Green Bay, wasting AR\u2019s last good years. scottarrowsmith says: Dec 27, 2016 12:06 PM Now you and your bro can go eat a GD sammich lol Dec 27, 2016 12:07 PM Anthony Lynn will be a good coach for years in buffalo. Good move. billsfn15 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:07 PM Time to celebrate.  Bring on the wings and beer. Don Humphrey says: Dec 27, 2016 12:09 PM I think his shtick will quickly wear thin in the broadcast booth; otherwise an entertaining guy though. Good for the Bills. I\u2019m a Pats fan but still scratched my head about that hire. Time for a new tatoo Rex 4sacroc says: Dec 27, 2016 12:09 PM Toe jam. Bizzareslantpass says: Dec 27, 2016 12:09 PM I don\u2019t get the Rex Ryan hate. Maybe Rob, with that goofy hair, but Rex seems like a likeble guy. Maybe not head coach caliber, but a good D.C. some where for sure. metitometin says: Dec 27, 2016 12:10 PM Perhaps the Patriots would take him.  He can kiss Bill Belichick\u2019s rings, which is apparently something he has always wanted to do. newsletterczar says: Dec 27, 2016 12:10 PM He needed to get fired; in his defense he had 8-8 talent at least at QB. But his act gets old fast if he cannot beat the Patriots. Dec 27, 2016 12:10 PM Yes, Jeff Fischer will definitely get the record now! john6583 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:11 PM The thrill of victory, and the agony of da-feet\u2026 Dec 27, 2016 12:14 PM Come fix the Packers defense Rex!! spotsdad says: Dec 27, 2016 12:14 PM Bills ownership will not tolerate losing, even if it means firing head coaches every 2 years\u2026 It\u2019s easy to see the stupidity in this when it\u2019s written down. Dec 27, 2016 12:14 PM Why do posters keep saying he is a DC ? He ruined a great defense in Buffalo, his last 2 years with NYJ were as well. Go to ESPN with the other blowhards. Dec 27, 2016 12:15 PM He\u2019s never been HC worthy, makes a great defensive cordinator ikeclanton says: Dec 27, 2016 12:15 PM I like Rex. No one ever really thought he was \u201cbuilding a bully\u201d or anything resembling the million or so colorful statements he made, but it was all very entertaining if you\u2019re not a Bills fan. He did give the Patriots some trouble early on as the Jets coach, but at this point, it\u2019s clear that head coaching is not his best skill. I hope he goes for a tv gig because he\u2019d be fantastic. horsepedlr says: Dec 27, 2016 12:16 PM maybe he can replace that other loudmouth berman. at least rex is funny. hehateme2 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:17 PM It\u2019s hardly like buffalo is a winning franchise\u2026. plus they\u2019ll have a hard time getting someone good to go coach there. It\u2019s groundhog day. Good times. themage78 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:17 PM Guy never got a fair shake. Never had a true franchise QB with the Jets or Bills. Never had a good GM to get the needed players for his system. Both of these teams stink and that is why the Pats win all the time. pancaketaco says: Dec 27, 2016 12:18 PM Glad I\u2019m not a Bills fan\u2026look at the owners record with the Sabres and one might wonder if they can hire the proper execs to run a sports team. aarons444 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:18 PM I am just so glad we still have Mike McCarthy in Green Bay, wasting AR\u2019s last good years. === Even a loss Sunday night won\u2019t remedy that. Would another epic playoff debacle bring him down? I doubt it. It\u2019s like watching the decay of the Roman Empire. Kylo Rendevous says: Dec 27, 2016 12:18 PM I gotta be honest, I just can\u2019t wait for them to hire a new coach who has accomplished nothing. And then the fans will get all hard again like they did with Rex. And we will hear all the hoopla about them filling the RV lot a week before the patriots come to town. And then\u2026 The pats will steam roll them like they always do, and the fans and team will fizzle out. Just like the last two years with Rex. Dec 27, 2016 12:18 PM Free Tyrod! Dec 27, 2016 12:20 PM Host on the Podiatry Network or at least he has his foot in the door . Dec 27, 2016 12:20 PM rabidbillsfan says: Dec 27, 2016 11:54 AM Tom Coughlin, enough is enough. Something this team has lacked for many years is team discipline. Even just to right the ship for a pair of seasons. Rex had a few bad breaks, G-Ro neutering the offense the first 2 weeks, a heavy hit in terms of injuries, but you can\u2019t fold 3 of the last four the way they did. I want Whaley to go as well, but that may be a season away. Tyrod showed competence against Miami, but it needs to be done consistently. He\u2019s not worth $16m, that is a fact. I\u2019d pay Cutler $20m before I\u2019d pay Tyrod $16\u2026 \u201d I\u2019d pay Cutler $20m before I\u2019d pay Tyrod $16\u2033 You\u2019re a moron for saying that. You obviously don\u2019t watch any Bills game to even be remotely serious about paying Jay Cutler before paying Tyrod. Tell me what has Cutler done in all these years as a qb? How many playoff games has he been to and won? How many times did he quit on his team? What leadership ability has he shown? I\u2019m a diehard Bills fans but some of you so called fans are a bunch of idiots.. gizzmonic says: Dec 27, 2016 12:22 PM No way he said he was an exceptional above-average coach and he was building a bully what\u2019s up with that mmack66 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:22 PM bosco264 says: Dec 27, 2016 12:01 PM Not a Rex fan but, 2 years is too short a sample. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The prospect of California\u2019s elevated role on climate change is the latest sign of how this state, where Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes, is preparing to resist the policies of the incoming White House. State and city officials have already vowed to fight any attempt by Washington to crack down on undocumented immigrants; Los Angeles officials last week set aside $10 million to help fund the legal costs of residents facing deportation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California\u2019s climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state\u2019s vast research community \u2014 including two national laboratories \u2014 which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards. \u201cThey could basically stop enforcement of the Clean Air Act and CO2 emissions,\u201d said Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco. \u201cThat would affect California because it would constrain markets. It would make them fight political and legal battles rather than scientific and technological ones.\u201d And some business leaders warned that California\u2019s embrace of environmental regulations \u2014 from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors \u2014 could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations. \u201cIf the other states pursue no-climate-change policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,\u201d said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. Photo Mr. Brown, center, signed landmark legislation in 2015 to combat climate change, including a goal of increasing the state\u2019s renewable energy use to 50 percent by 2030. Credit Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders. The bills \u201cimpose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone\u2019s daily lives or the fact that California\u2019s population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,\u201d the California Chamber of Commerce said. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment Democrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2.5 trillion. \u201cCalifornia more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,\u201d said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. \u201cWe will not deviate from our leadership because of one election.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The state has been at the forefront of climate and energy policy for more than half a century, beginning with setting appliance and vehicle emissions standards in the 1960s. Those policies will continue, analysts said, in no small part because they are overwhelmingly popular here: 69 percent of Californians said they supported the law requiring the state to roll back emissions in a July survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cThis is not something that\u2019s going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,\u201d said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThis will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science.\u201d Ms. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the fossil-fuel industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state\u2019s energy and climate initiatives. \u201cBut they would be fighting a very uphill battle,\u201d she said. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to really slow this train down.\u201d California\u2019s economy is powered by a high-tech industry and prominent research institutions that make it well placed to continue to lead on energy and climate. The state has already taken on an international role. Mr. Brown has spearheaded the Under 2 MOU initiative , backed by a coalition of state, local and regional governments in 33 countries \u2014 more than 160 jurisdictions with a total population of more than 1 billion \u2014 that have agreed to deep emissions cuts to try to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. California\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on cap-and-trade policies. Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight. More Reporting on Climate Change The clean-air initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very energy-efficiency policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California\u2019s economic reversal. \u201cIf the president-elect and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,\u201d Mr. de Leon said. \u201cThey will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G.D.P.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Still, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama. \u201cOur system works better \u2014 our cap-and-trade system and other ways of addressing climate change \u2014 if we have more company,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. \u201cThe more company we have, the better.\u201d Dan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can \u201ckeep doing what we are doing, leading the way.\u201d \u201cBut will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,\u201d he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an anti-Trump environmental movement. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the lawyers and we\u2019ve got the scientists and are ready to fight,\u201d Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to win.\u201d Mr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting. \u201cIn a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world.\u201d ",

    "text": "It has a complex system of carrots and sticks . Beneficiaries make monthly payments from $1 to about $27 into individual health savings accounts, and the state also contributes. That money can be used for doctor visits and prescriptions. If beneficiaries get vaccines and other preventive care, they get a discount on their premiums the following year. But they can also be penalized. People whose incomes are above the poverty line can be cut off for six months if they miss a payment. Those below the poverty line are knocked down to a plan with fewer benefits. And if a patient unnecessarily goes to the emergency room, extra money comes out of the health savings account. \"There are many ways to try and effectuate personal responsibility,\" Mann says. \"Some states have moved forward with healthy behavior initiatives, for example. Some states have done some premiums and copays.\" Indiana's plan requires everyone to contribute to a health savings account. \"And so the responsibility was really translated into payment requirements, and with pretty strong consequences if somebody was unable to pay.\" She says Verma and Indiana wanted the penalties to be even harsher \u2014 a full year with no coverage for people who miss payments. But CMS rejected that idea. So how does it work in practice? For Amber Thayer, a mom of three who lives in a Volunteers of America family shelter in Indianapolis, it's been a bit of a nightmare. Thayer is a recovering addict who has been clean for six months with the help of the medication Suboxone. And she's training to be a nursing assistant. \"It's been quite, quite the struggle, but we've gotten there and we're doing great, and we're getting ready to get into our own home,\" she says. She pays $1 a month for her Medicaid insurance. In October, she got a bill for that $1 from a different company than the one she had been dealing with. She assumed the state had switched her. \"It is only a dollar,\" she says. \"I could pay a dollar a month, or I could pay $12 and that will cover me for the year. Unfortunately, at that time, I only had I believe it was like $2.38 on my card.\" So she called the company and used her bank card to pay the dollar. But the company, or perhaps the state, lost track of her dollar, and her insurance was cut off. She had her bank statement and a receipt from the insurer that proved she had paid. But she still spent six weeks, with multiple phone calls and visits to state health offices, trying to get her coverage restored. All the while, she scraped together enough money to buy Suboxone one dose at a time. \"I'm fearing, you know, the withdraws,\" Thayer recalls. But she was also afraid the loss of insurance would interfere with her ability to take her nursing assistant exam, which in turn would threaten the stipend she gets because she is in job training. \"If I don't get my stipend, we're not going to have our money to help us get into our home.\" It's these types of complications that have some advocates worried. Adam Mueller, a lawyer for Indiana Legal Services , says he's happy more of his clients have health insurance. But he says the state's notion that people will feel more invested in their care if they pay $1 a month just doesn't play out in the real world. \"They don't feel like they have skin in the game,\" Mueller says. \"One guy told me that it feels like Indiana is trying to take his last $12.\" Joe Thompson , CEO of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, says it's just hard to be poor. \"The social stresses of low-income individuals probably make most aspects of managing through the day more difficult than if you have more affluence and have more resources available to deploy,\" he says. Thompson, who's a former Arkansas surgeon general, helped develop a Medicaid program in his state that had many of the same features as Indiana, including premium payments and health savings accounts. In the end, Arkansas decided it just wasn't worth it . \"We had about a year and a half of experience there, and candidly the administrative cost and the operating aspects exceeded what the Legislature subsequently perceived the benefit of that program was,\" Thompson says. So the state scrapped the health savings accounts. He says the ideas about personal responsibility are politically popular, but implementing them is too complex. \"We lose too many folks along the way, and we may be causing more challenges than we're solving,\" he says. Arkansas still charges nominal premiums for some Medicaid recipients, but they pay them directly to insurers. The carrots and sticks and individual accounts are gone. In Indiana, insurers also collect the premiums and administer the individual health savings accounts. James Gavin, a spokesman for the Family and Social Services Administration, says those costs are included in what the state pays the insurance companies, and so it's not clear exactly how much Indiana is spending to administer the health savings accounts. Verma has advised several states, including Iowa, Kentucky and Ohio, that are looking for Medicaid waivers from the federal government. Many of those waiver applications include cost features such as premiums or health savings accounts or incentives for healthy behavior. \"The cost-sharing policy is not to burden the individual,\" she told lawmakers at the 2013 hearing. \"I think it's to incentivize them and empower them to be part of the equation.\" When Verma testified in 2013, she urged lawmakers to make the process of getting Medicaid waivers easier. If she's confirmed as administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it will be her and her staff who review waiver applications and determine whether they should go forward. Correction Dec. 27, 2016 An earlier Web version of this story misreported the amount of time that people above the poverty line lose services if they miss a payment. The story said they would be cut off for three months. They actually are cut off for six months. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story An investigator appointed by the World Anti-Doping Agency, Richard McLaren, published more extensive evidence this month that prompted the International Olympic Committee to open disciplinary proceedings against dozens of additional Russian athletes. Russia\u2019s drastic shift in tone may be motivated by a desire to reconcile with the regulators, who have stipulated that the nation accept the findings of the recent investigation before the country is recertified to conduct drug testing and be a host again of Olympic competitions. Photo Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency. The country\u2019s doping operation \u201cwas an institutional conspiracy,\u201d she said while emphasizing that the government\u2019s top officials were not involved. Credit Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press The officials, however, continue to reject the accusation that the doping program was state-sponsored. They define the Russian state as President Vladimir V. Putin and his closest associates. Ms. Antseliovich, who has not been directly implicated in the investigations, said she was shocked by the revelations. Vitaly Smirnov, 81, a top sports official whose career dates to the Soviet era and who was appointed this year by Mr. Putin to reform the nation\u2019s antidoping system, said he did not want \u201cto speak for the people responsible.\u201d Mr. Smirnov said he had not met most of the individuals implicated in a report by Mr. McLaren \u2014 emphasizing that they had been dismissed as a result \u2014 nor did he know where they were. \u201cFrom my point of view, as a former minister of sport, president of Olympic committee \u2014 we made a lot of mistakes,\u201d he said, echoing Mr. Putin\u2019s broad denials of a state-sponsored system and noting that he would defer to the global governing bodies of each sport to rule on the evidence. Mr. McLaren said Tuesday that he was pleased Russian officials were no longer disputing his findings, suggesting they may have been motivated to stop further investigations into the scope of cheating. \u201cIt\u2019s damage control,\u201d Mr. McLaren said. \u201cThere are a number of different labels you can put on the facts, and they take a different view of government, but it\u2019s a bit of a vocabulary game.\u201d The 2014 Olympics in Sochi were a pet project for Mr. Putin, who was closely involved in politicking for and preparing for them. Proud references to the Sochi Games overwhelm the Russian Olympic Committee\u2019s offices along the Moscow River, including a nesting doll standing roughly six feet tall in the building\u2019s lobby signed by Russian Olympians. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Many of the athletes whose pictures decorate the Olympic committee\u2019s offices have been implicated in this year\u2019s doping scandal, with scores formally disciplined and more than 650 others now accused. One photo shows Russians kissing medals and another shows Paralympians in wheelchairs holding victory bouquets above their heads. Photo Vitaly Smirnov is a top sports official who was appointed this year by President Vladimir V. Putin to reform Russia\u2019s antidoping system. Credit Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press \u201cWe have to find those reasons why young sportsmen are taking doping, why they agree to be doped,\u201d Mr. Smirnov said, expressing eagerness to move forward rather than assign responsibility for previous violations. But even as he and other officials signaled their acceptance of the fundamental findings of Mr. McLaren\u2019s investigation, they were largely unconciliatory, suggesting that cheating to benefit Russia had served to offset what they perceived as preferential treatment for Western nations by global sports authorities. \u201cHave you seen the Fancy Bear records?\u201d Mr. Smirnov said, invoking medical records hacked by a cyberespionage group believed to be associated with G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence agency suspected of hacking computers at the Democratic National Committee. The medical records revealed that hundreds of Western athletes had been given special medical permission to take banned drugs for legitimate therapeutic reasons. \u201cRussia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries,\u201d Mr. Smirnov said. \u201cThe general feeling in Russia is that we didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d he added, acknowledging that anabolic steroids like those taken by Russian athletes have never been deemed medically excusable by regulators. The supposedly tamper-proof bottles that held Russian athletes\u2019 doping samples in Sochi were manipulated \u2014 enabling officials to switch out their steroid-laced urine. Mr. Smirnov and his advisers suggested that the same thing had happened at other Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky that the WADA had Rodchenkov,\u201d said Victor Berezov, a lawyer for Russia\u2019s Olympic Committee. \u201cMaybe in China, London and everywhere \u2014 maybe the same things could happen. Because the system is broken.\u201d Now, as Russia\u2019s global track and field athletes remain barred from competition and its drug-testing operations decertified, Mr. Smirnov and a team of about two dozen people are focused on overhauling Russia\u2019s antidoping system to satisfy global authorities. The group , selected over the summer, includes Russian politicians, Olympians, business people and even a celebrated pianist.

Adults should get at least seven to nine hours of sleep a night, experts say. But millions of Americans don\u2019t. ValuaVitaly, Getty Images/iStockphoto Email Finally, after months of non-stop work or school and busy family schedules, perhaps you\u2019re lucky enough to get a whole week off to sleep in, relax and just languish on the couch napping. But will it make up for all those sleep-deprived days and nights you\u2019ve racked up in recent months? \u201cThe answer is yes and no,\u201d said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Northwell Health\u2019s Huntington Hospital, on New York\u2019s Long Island, where he\u2019s also medical director and chief of pediatrics. \u201cThe short answer is yes, you can catch up on lost sleep, but making up for it depends on just how sleep-deprived you are,\u201d Grosso told CBS News. \u201cThere is some degree of variation from person to person. Children need more sleep than adolescents, adolescents need more sleep than adults,\u201d he said. But millions of Americans don\u2019t get nearly as much sleep as they should. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that a large portion of the population suffers from sleep deprivation . It\u2019s an American malady,\u201d Grosso said. Sleeping in on weekends and holidays can reverse some effects of sleep deprivation, but it requires an hour-for-hour payback. \u201cMeaning that if you lose an hour of sleep for each of five days during the week, you are literally five hours behind by the weekend, so sleeping an extra hour Saturday and Sunday won\u2019t make that up. You\u2019d need to sleep an extra five hours,\u201d Grosso explained. And the numbers can quickly add up beyond that. \u201cThat may mean a lot of sleeping for the first few days of vacation if you\u2019re really\u00a0 sleep-deprived ,\u201d he said. If you\u2019ve been sleep-deprived for months, the loss would be far more than you could make up on your holiday time. Experts offer these tips to help you get more and better sleep while in catch-up mode \u2014 and to improve your sleep habits long after the holidays are over: Don\u2019t set an alarm clock on weekends and vacation days. Let your body naturally wake up the next day. Cut out caffeine , at least later in the day, ideally after 2 p.m. Get into bed when you\u2019re tired. Listen to your body\u2019s signals; don\u2019t push beyond the yawns and nodding head. Don\u2019t go to sleep super-late or you may shift your body\u2019s natural sleep/wake cycle (called phase-shifting), which can be very challenging to reverse. College students are infamous for doing this. Avoid digital screen time close to bedtime, turning off devices at least one hour before you plan to go to sleep. \u201cWe do know screen time is stimulating and may interfere with other aspects of our day/night rhythms,\u201d Grosso said. Rediscover reading before bed to wind down, and other quiet activities. Only use your bed for sleep, not working on your laptop or watching TV. Keep your bedroom cool and dark. Don\u2019t overindulge in rich foods and alcoholic drinks as they interfere with sleep, including middle-of-the-night wakings. Exercise, but not too close to bedtime. With lazy vacation days come more time for afternoon naps, too. While midday shuteye isn\u2019t recommended for people who suffer from insomnia \u2013 chronic difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep \u2013 for others, a nap can help reinvigorate you and add back time to your pre-vacation sleep debt. Keep naps brief, though, recommended Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a fellow of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.

Security Council resolution condemning settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The United States broke with past practice by allowing the Security Council to pass the measure that called settlement building on land claimed by the Palestinians a \"flagrant violation\" of international law, sparking fury in Israel.

Baz Ratner / Reuters Israel was also reportedly advancing plans for thousands of new homes in east Jerusalem despite the recent U.N. vote. According to daily Israel Hayom, Jerusalem District Zoning Committee was convening Wednesday to discuss approving fresh construction in that part of the city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the White House after the U.N. vote . \"We have no doubt the Obama administration initiated it (the resolution), stood behind it, coordinated the wording and demanded it be passed,\" Netanyahu told the cabinet in comments released publicly on Sunday. Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem, on Dec. 11, 2016. Abir Sultan / Pool via AP, file His government also summoned the U.S. ambassador to Israel to discuss the U.S. abstention. Relations between the U.S. and Israel grew steadily icier over the course of Obama's presidency. Another official said Netanyahu had ordered that for the coming three weeks, until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, cabinet ministers refrain from traveling to or meeting officials of countries that voted in favor of the resolution. Trump waded into the debate Monday, questioning the United Nation's effectiveness, saying it's just a club for people to \"have a good time.\" Trump's tweet that the U.N. has \"such great potential,\" but it has become \"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.

Soup-kitchen style image, with some movement.</p> Close Getty Images/iStockphoto It is a sign of the uneven economic terrain impeding the recovery: Although U.S. consumer confidence is at its highest level in 15 years, a combination of stagnant wages and surging housing costs are leaving millions of people scrambling to afford food.\u00a0 Forty-one percent of cities surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported an increase in demand for emergency food assistance. More than half of the Americans applying for emergency food are employed, while only 8 percent were homeless, the study found. The cities with the biggest increases include Des Moines, Iowa, where the number of requests for food help jumped 15 percent, and San Francisco, where it rose 3 percent.\u00a0 The culprit is the impact of two intersecting trends that is spelling trouble for many working families: slow wage growth in the post-recession years as well as sharply higher rents. In 2013, one of four renters paid half their incomes toward rent, a trend that\u2019s projected by Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies to only worsen over the next several years.\u00a0 The increase in hungry Americans means that many food pantries and emergency kitchens have had to cut back in the size of servings they can provide, the Conference of Mayors found. \u201cIt is concerning that even people who are employed continue to need the help of food pantries to make ends meet,\u201d said Tom Cochran, the executive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in a statement. About one-third of cities reported their emergency food kitchens and pantries had reduced the number of times families or individuals could visit each month, while 47 percent of cities said they had to turn people away or cut back their portions.\u00a0 Housing prices back to pre-recession levels, study shows As 2016 draws to a close, food pantries around the country are reporting declining donations, although the cause isn\u2019t due to less charitable individuals. Supermarkets, which have historically been among the biggest food donors, have become more efficient thanks to computer networks. That\u00a0 has reduced the amount of surplus food they have on hand to donate to food shelves, according to The Providence Journal.\u00a0 At the same time, spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, has declined after the 2013 expiration of a benefit increase tied to the Recovery Act. The number of households getting aid under the federal program remains above pre-recession levels, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank. More cuts to food stamps could be coming. House Republicans want to overhaul the SNAP program, with The Associated Press reporting that the GOP may seek to strengthen work requirements or tighten eligibility , which could strike some food stamp recipients from the rolls.\u00a0 Renters need to earn at least $20.30 per hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in the U.S., according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Its 2016 report on housing affordability noted that hourly wages for workers in the bottom 10 percent of the income distribution rose just 0.2 percent from 2007 to 2015, while the top 5 percent saw income growth of 8.7 percent over that time. Meanwhile, the amount of affordable housing hasn\u2019t kept up with demand, the NLIHC found. The number of apartments around the U.S. that rent for less than $400 increased by 10 percent from 2003 to 2013, and the number of households who needed these low-cost apartments jumped by 40 percent.\u00a0 \u201cThis burden makes it difficult to afford other basic necessities like healthy food and medication and to save for financial emergencies,\u201d the NLIHC said. An analysis of household expenditures by The Pew Charitable Trusts found that many middle- and low-income American households are now caught in a financial stranglehold . Costs for essentials such as housing, food and transportation have surged over the last two decades, while income hasn\u2019t kept up. Its study found that low-income Americans end up in a financial hole of $2,300 on average because basic costs are outpacing typical income.\u00a0 Interestingly, it\u2019s not necessarily the most expensive U.S. cities where families face the greatest rent burden. The three cities where residents are paying the greatest portion of their income in rent are Hialeah, Florida (57 percent); Detroit, Michigan (48 percent) and Miami, Florida (48 percent), according to a December analysis of Census data from RentCafe . Because workers in expensive cities such as San Francisco tend to earn higher wages, they\u2019re more capable of handling higher rents.\u00a0 Trump picks Ben Carson to lead HUD Advocates for affordable housing are sounding the alarm about what President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies might mean for low- and middle-income families. His pick to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development, former neurosurgeon and one-time presidential rival Ben Carson, has no experience in housing policy and has criticized the social safety net.\u00a0 Still, the more stubborn problem may be addressing an economy that increasingly rewards the highest-earning Americans , while providing only small income gains to everyone else.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 2,403 Americans were killed on Dec. 7, 1941. It also comes seven months after Obama became the first sitting American president to visit the Japanese memorial dedicated to the more than 200,000 people killed when American forces dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Other Japanese primer ministers have made the trek before in the years just after the war. Former leader Shigeru Yoshida went there just six years after the country's World War II surrender. Related: Thousands Pay Tribute at Pearl Harbor, 75 Years After Attack Yoshida signed the San Francisco peace treaty with the U.S. and others in 1951, allowing Japan back into international society after its war defeat. His Pearl Harbor visit, which he made on his way home from San Francisco, was largely eclipsed by the historic treaty. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe presents a wreath at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl in Honolulu, Hawaii on Dec. 26, 2016. Hugh Gentry / Reuters Former PM Nobusuke Kishi, Abe's grandfather, also made the trip in 1957. And Ichiro Hatoyama visited the year before. \"While not the first Japanese Prime Minister to visit the site of the infamous attack, Shinzo Abe's trip to Pearl Harbor ... is a meaningful measure in a much larger effort to enhance the U.S.-Japan alliance,\" Harry Kazianis, a director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington D.C. foreign policy think tank, said in a statement. There is also another important and more pragmatic reason for Japan and U.S. cooperation, Kazianis said, \" an increasingly aggressive China. \" Halimah Abdullah ",
