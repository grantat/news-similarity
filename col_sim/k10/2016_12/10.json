Park aces the political fight of her life as lawmakers attempt to force her from office over prosecution claims that she helped a confidante extort money and favors from companies and manipulate state affairs. The signs read: \"Impeach Park Geun-hye immediately.\" (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) 0 Shares Email South Korea's national assembly voted Friday to impeach President Park Geun-hye over her alleged links to a corruption scandal. Backed by overwhelming public support -- evident from the millions of South Koreans who have filled the streets in recent weeks demanding her impeachment -- the opposition-controlled parliament passed the motion by 234 votes out of 300. The Constitutional Court now has up to 180 days to determine whether to formally end Park's presidency. Until then, Park is suspended, not removed, while all duties will be temporarily be relegated to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-Ahn. At a Cabinet meeting after the vote, Park apologized for her \"negligence.\" \"I'd like to say that I'm deeply sorry to the people because the nation has to experience this turmoil because of my negligence and lack of virtue at a time when our security and economy both face difficulties,\" Park said, adding she's preparing for the court review of the impeachment. Also after the vote, thousands of impeachment supporters gathered in front of the National Assembly cheering and congratulating each other, some in tears. Some protesters were spotted dancing in groups playing loud Korean traditional gongs. \"This is a very important historical moment,\" shouted impeachment proponent Kim Yoo-jin, 33. \"It is the victory for the people.\" Fellow protester Yoon Da-Hye, 32, said, \"I was nervous and couldn\u2019t sleep. I am so happy at the result.\" And Kim Choon-ho, 44, chimed in, \"Finally the politicians have now sensed what the public really wants.\" Park, 64, is South Korea's first female president and the second to be impeached after late President Roh Moo-hyun in 2004. Roh was accused of incompetence and for violating election law under a parliament controlled by then conservative opposition. After a huge public disapproval of the impeachment, the Constitutional Court reinstated him two months later. Roh completed his five-year term leaving office in early 2008, then killed himself a year later while his family was under investigation for corruption. Park's public approval rating has nose-dived in the past three months from 33 percent to 5 percent, according Gallup Korea, after local media reported a series of scandals ranging from inappropriate personal relationships with a cult leader, to appointments swayed by the cult leader\u2019s daughter, to mysterious, massive amounts of Viagra pills purchased by her office medical staff. Millions of South Koreans have taken to the streets in the past six weeks demanding Park to step down. \"She is a bad president influenced by Shamanism that doesn\u2019t make sense in the 21st century,\" said Kim Nam-hoon a college freshman cheering at a rally Friday in front of the National Assembly. Public anger is especially centered at Park\u2019s close ties with Choi Soon-sil, a longtime personal friend and a civilian with no official job title. Choi is currently indicted with two others for extorting donations of 66 million dollars from 53 large corporations and meddling in state affairs. The donations were sent to two foundations abruptly set up a year ago to back Park\u2019s public policies on culture and sports. There are also allegations that Choi was receiving confidential documents from the President herself, or her aides, to edit Park\u2019s speeches. Park has publicly apologized three times over the scandals and admitted that she did receive Choi\u2019s help in editing her speeches and with other \u201cpublic relations\u201d matters. But she denies any involvement in Choi\u2019s alleged criminal activities. ABC News' Sang-un Youn, Hye-jin Choi and Minsoo Cho, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

By Abby Phillip December 9 at 4:54 PM Follow @abbydphillip Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani waves as he leaves Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 22. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor and an early backer of Donald Trump, has withdrawn his name for consideration for a Trump administration job. Giuliani was on the president-elect\u2019s shortlist for secretary of state. [ What happened to \u2018America\u2019s Mayor\u2019? How Rudy Giuliani became Trump\u2019s attack dog. ] In a statement, the Trump transition team said Giuliani informed Trump of his withdrawal\u00a0at a Nov. 29 meeting. Giuliani delivered a letter to Trump, who declined to accept it at that meeting. On Friday, Giuliani again asked Trump to withdraw his name, and he accepted, according to a senior transition official. Giuliani said in a statement\u00a0that the decision was \u201cnot about me.\u201d \u201cIt is about what is best for the country and the new administration,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I joined the campaign I was very involved and fulfilled by my work with my law firm and consulting firm, and I will continue that work with even more enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cFrom the vantage point of the private sector, I look forward to helping the President-elect in any way he deems necessary and appropriate,\u201d he added. In a statement, Trump called Giuliani a \u201cclose personal friend\u201d whom he would continue to call upon for advice while in office. \u201cRudy would have been an outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles, but I fully respect and understand his reasons for remaining in the private sector,\u201d Trump added. The drawn-out search for a secretary of state has left two names near the top of the list: former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson. Both men are valued by Trump for their experience in dealmaking around the world in their capacities as business executives. But Romney has faced a public revolt from Trump loyalists who believed that his comments during the campaign denouncing Trump went too far. [ From enemies to potential allies: How the Trump-Romney divide began to heal ] Giuliani was backed by the loyal political outsiders within Trump\u2019s inner circle. But his candidacy faced challenges, including questions about potential conflicts raised by\u00a0the work his consulting business did on behalf of foreign governments. However, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, pointedly sought to address speculation that conflicts might have imperiled Giuliani\u2019s path to Senate confirmation. Giuliani \u201cwas vetted by our team for any possible conflicts and passed with flying colors,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cThe team appreciates Rudy\u2019s contributions to the victory and considers him a close friend and adviser.\u201d powerpost ",

If they do, the carriers would be required to inform passengers in advance that on board calls are allowed. Cicely Carroll from Virginia makes a call in the airport. Close CBS News Tara Quinnette from Florida would opt out. \u201cIf it\u2019s not much of a cost difference, I may go with the airline that didn\u2019t allow you to use them because I think it could get out of hand,\u201d she said.\u00a0 New rule could allow calls on flights \u201cWe are going to fight this tooth and nail,\u201d says Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cIf this is enacted, we will fight this in Congress. Flight attendants will be in a position of deescalating more and more conflict, which creates a security and safety threat for everyone on board.\u201d While the federal government currently bans cell phone calls on planes, the prohibition does not extend to calls placed through on board internet connections -- something that\u2019s become increasingly available on commercial flights. Delta, American and Southwest do not permit calls in-flight and said they have no plans to change their policy. United and Jet Blue are both reviewing the proposal. ",

Dimitri is bright, with an obvious aptitude for business. He won't show NBC News his profile on Google AdSense, an online advertising service that allows websites to make money, to protect five other teenagers who asked him not to reveal aspects of their shared interests. He's also wary of revealing his full income, worried it will make him a target for thieves, or worse. However, he does show NBC News a digital receipt from Google showing he earned more than $8,000 from the web giant in September. He says this was just one of several advertising accounts, and claims his most successful streak \u2014 in the run-up to the election \u2014 saw him rake in $27,000 in just one month. When asked for comment about the persistence of fake news even after the election, Facebook directed NBC News to a post from CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month in which he laid out the company's plan to tackle the phenomenon. In an interview with TODAY on Thursday , Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged \"there's a lot more to do.\" Google outlined steps last month that it said would restrict advertising on websites that \"misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.\" The company did not respond to NBC News' requests for comment on this apparently still-flourishing industry. Dimitri says even after the election, while business is less brisk, his fake news is still highly profitable. Like any business, he's aware of the need to adapt. \"This business updates every hour, every ten minutes, every minute,\" he says. \"There are always news ideas, new types of generating new visitors and that's the thing we all want.\" So while newspapers across the globe are losing advertising revenue, Dimitri's empire of lies is thriving. He says he now employs three 15-year-olds, paying them the equivalent of $10 per day. As well as buying new laptops and paying cash to boost his posts on social media, he has also invested some of his earnings into real estate \u2014 a joint venture with his parents, who are more than happy with his success. The Anatomy of a Lie As with many regular journalists, Dimitri starts his day by trawling the web looking for trending topics that he can harness to drive traffic to his websites. He copies his posts from other fake news websites, including many in the U.S., or takes content from mainstream media organizations before peppering them with invented details. He also posts provocative online polls such as: \"Should Trump Deport All Refugees?\" and: \"Do you consider Donald Trump, the Jesus of America?\" Most of this content is published on websites Dimitri has built to look like NBC News, Fox News, the Huffington Post and others. A fake news website run from Macedonia that is made to look like Huffington Post. NBC News To the untrained eye, fake headlines such as: \"BREAKING: Obama Confirms Refusal To Leave White House, He Will Stay In Power!\" look genuine. The only giveaway is the imitation URL. From then on, it's a case of throwing as much mud at the wall and seeing what sticks. \"The most-read news articles are usually the ones containing the click-bait words,\" Dimitri says. \"The click bait words, as you know, are, 'Oh my god, breaking news, wow,' and usually something that has never been aired before. Because if the title just says, 'Today this happened, today that happened,' no one will open that.\" He and his collaborators post these stories to their Facebook pages dozens of times a day. Again, he would only show NBC News a Facebook page that he runs on his own, which has an impressive 86,000 likes. But he said the six pages run by his collective have amassed more than 3 million likes between them. \"Say you produce ten lies a day, [the audience] is not going to believe ten lies, they are going to believe probably one or maximum two,\" he says. \"Usually the lies about [Clinton's] emails and the lies about Hillary. The anti-Hillary posts were really good.\" Stories from USA Daily News 24, a fake news site registered in Veles, Macedonia. An Associated Press analysis using web intelligence service Domain Tools shows that USA Daily News 24 is one of roughly 200 U.S.-oriented sites registered in Veles, which has emerged as the unlikely hub for the distribution of disinformation on Facebook. Both stories shown here are bogus. Raphael Satter / AP Dimitri says he has set up more than 50 domain names in six months, all in a bid to please Facebook's algorithm and get the maximum number of eyeballs on his posts. He claims in that time his posts have achieved some 40 million page views. \"We stay up late and we don't sleep that much \u2014 I haven't slept good for a couple of months now,\" he says. \"I have to go to school and then at night I have to work.\" He and his colleagues see the process as an art. At first they worked on a basis of trial-and-error. Now it comes naturally. \"You see what people like and you just give it to them,\" he explains. \"You see they like water, you give water, they like wine, you give wine. It's really simple.\" The challenge of engaging readers on social media is one familiar to most journalists. They have a formidable opponent in Dimitri and his peers; analysis by BuzzFeed after the election showed that fake news websites actually performed better than conventional press and television. Dimitri is unequivocal about why the mainstream couldn't compete: \"They're not allowed to lie.\" Partying to the Tune of Fake News The influx of money has created a thriving party culture in Veles. On Saturday, one local nightclub was barely keeping up with demand, as dozens of teens and young adults ordered ice buckets filled with large $35 bottles of vodka. In this new era, the purveyors of fake news are the coolest kids in the schoolyard. \"Since fake news started, girls are more interested in geeks than macho guys,\" says one 17-year-old girl standing at the bar. The most successful fake-news publishers have \"bought themselves houses, apartments, maybe invested in some real estate or in some businesses,\" according to Dimitri. \"They have bought themselves cars, they have bought ... their girlfriends better cars, better places to live,\" he says. Keen to feed off this gold rush, the nightclub even plans to organize a club night on the same day that Google pays out its advertising money. A nightclub in the Macedonian town of Veles where teenagers dabbling in fake news go to party. NBC News Following Google and Facebook's vow to clamp down on fake news, Dimitri says he knows people have lost tens of thousands after their accounts were shuttered. \"When they started to shut down webpages, business went down,\" says 20-year-old Kiko, a bartender at the nightclub. The impact appears to have been short lived, however, judging by the healthy flow of local currency, the Macedonian denar, being shoved into the club's cash registers. Most people are cagey about admitting any direct involvement in fake news. But Tony, a 40-year-old taxi driver, says that every young person he knows \u2014 including his own son \u2014 is in on the act. \"I've been doing this job for 18 years and I know everyone in the city,\" he says. \"I know kids who are minors, 16 or 17 years old, and they bought BMWs after running these websites.\" Is he worried about his son making money from selling hoaxes online? \"It's better to do this job than to go into the drug business,\" he says. Also unperturbed is Veles' mayor, Slavcho Chadiev. \"Is it criminal activity? Not according to the law of Macedonia,\" he says during an interview in his office. \"All that money went through the state system and everyone paid their taxes.\" He isn't bothered by accusations that Veles' teens swayed the U.S. election. In fact, he welcomes the idea. \"Not as a mayor, but as a man and as a citizen, I'm glad if Veles contributed to the Republicans' victory and Trump's victory,\" he says. A view of Veles in November. GEORGI LICOVSKI / EPA Like many Macedonians, he blames recent Democratic administrations in Washington for not doing more to help their country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO. (Greece has blocked these efforts in a dispute over Macedonia's name \u2014 the country's official title at the United Nations is the cumbersome Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.) On the flip side, the mayor still remembers fondly when Republican President George W. Bush recognized his country's new title in 2004. What would he do if he encountered one of these fake news tycoons? \"I would ask him, 'Are you looking for a job?' Because I have a lack of IT guys,\" he says, before admitting that the salary of less than $400 might not be attractive. Dimitri says his goal is to earn $1 million, and it's no surprise the young entrepreneur sees Trump as \"a small role model.\" There's only one question that sees doubt creep into Dimitri's cocksure demeanor. When he copies posts from other fake news websites, does he worry he's being used as a pawn to spread propaganda? \"When you buy a certain product, you don't know who created it,\" he says. \"You don't know who creates your shoes, and there are rumors that small children in Africa create them.\" He adds: \"Maybe I don't want to find out, because if I find out maybe I'm going to feel bad. Right now I'm feeling OK.\" Alexander Smith ",

    "text": "Share on Tumblr But on Aug. 25, the village would be shaken by an unexpected death that would pit family member against family member and threaten to reverse the hard-won gains of the last year. A young woman was poisoned, and one of the very counselors who tried to teach the men to change their ways was accused with her husband in the case, according to a police affidavit. Police say the young woman died in a dispute over dowry, the coercive practice of gift-giving that some say subjugates brides. The couple has not yet been formally charged, although warrants have been issued for their arrest. In some respects, this is not such an unusual case: In 2015, police records show, dowry disputes in India led to the murders of more than 7,000 women. The Center for Social Research's gender sensitivity classes in Chandan Hulla target men ages 16 to 35. Catalyst Ten years ago, there was no main road in and out of Chandan Hulla, no electricity and only two televisions. A decade later, even children have cellphones, and villagers who sold farmland to developers are tearing down their mud-brick dwellings in favor of multistory homes with balconies and deluxe kitchens. Still, the village of about 5,000, nestled in between the gated farmhouses of Delhi\u2019s elite and event palaces of the city\u2019s booming wedding industry, still occupies a tenuous space between old and new. A young girl wanders its narrow lanes swinging silver pails for buffalo milk as a shiny black Mercedes jolts by, its trunk stuffed with fodder for cattle. It\u2019s not far from the bustling shopping mall where a young student watched \u201cLife of Pi\u201d the night she was gang-raped and murdered four years ago \u2014 sparking a national movement for women\u2019s safety and fueling the demand for gender sensitivity training. Villagers may have embraced consumer advances, but tradition retains its grip: The majority of women from both Hindu and Muslim families observe purdah \u2014 wearing a veil with older male relatives and when they step outside \u2014 and young women and girls are expected to act modestly and eschew jeans, residents said. \u201cIf my sister had a boyfriend, I would cut her,\u201d one of the men outside Pal\u2019s store said recently. The village had a high rate of domestic violence, one reason counselors from the Center for Social Research were drawn to it. The Delhi-based nonprofit group dedicated to a \u201cviolence-free gender-just society\u201d was one of the earliest to embrace sensitivity courses as a way to engage men and boys in societal change, founding its Gender Training Institute in 1997. The group now runs programs for young men ages 16 to 35 in corporations, police academies and organizations such as UNICEF. Such work is needed because the attitudes of men have not kept the pace as Indian society has changed and women take a more prominent role in work and society, which creates tension, said Ranjana Kumari, the director. \u201cA lot of people carry the baggage of tradition and archaic, feudal thinking because that\u2019s the way they were socialized,\u201d Kumari said. \u201cWe have to change that mind-set.\u201d The other reason Chandan Hulla appealed was it was home turf for one of the counselors, Zahida Khan, a sociable woman with a gaptoothed smile who went door to door to persuade\u00a0residents to attend the class. Many were neighbors, and some were members of the sprawling Khan clan who knew the counselor had her own problems at home, arguing frequently with her daughter-in-law. The building where the gender sensitivity classes take place. The first session last July got off to a roiling start when the counselors suggested that the wives be present, too. The men \u2014 a mix of Muslims and Hindus \u2014 protested vigorously and said they feared the women would be \u201cled down the wrong path,\u201d as one of them described it, or would spill too much of their personal information in discussion sessions, particularly in regard to domestic violence. \u201cThe law has changed so much now that if you slap your wife the moment you step out of the house there\u2019ll be a bunch of cops standing outside your door,\u201d said Yunus Khan. \u201cThis is women\u2019s empowerment.\u201d Khan was full of bravado as he sat recently with other class members at the house where they had spent so much time together in the past year. He made his buddies hoot with laughter. \u201cSuch change has come,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, a man would gesture to raise his hand against a woman and the woman would cower. Now a man raises his hand and the woman just stares him in the face. This is not a bad thing. I feel good about it. Women are not going to get beaten now without reason.\u201d Khan had more to say. \u201cEarlier I used to beat my wife a lot. If she was late in getting my medicines or something, I would beat her. Now I don\u2019t beat her to the point where she has to go to the doctor.\u201d Khan was far more mild-mannered in a later interview with his family at his home, a one-room dwelling at the edge of a wide field, with a tin roof and two buffalo tied out front. He spoke of his frustrations as an out-of-work tailor who shelved his dreams of becoming a fashion designer after an eye injury. Now, he devotes his attention to educating his three young children. \u201cWe will make our dreams come true through them,\u201d he said. His wife, Shalima, 25, quietly defended her husband, saying he was not abusive. According to Yunus Khan, left, since he started the gender sensitivity classes, he has not hit his wife as hard as before. Journey After the uproar, a compromise was reached: the women could come to class, too, but they had to sit separately from men. Zahida Khan and the other counselor used a variety of discussion topics, parables and games to draw in the participants. After a few months, a young electrician in the class named Mohammed Sagir, 25, got to thinking it was high time his wife began leaving the village on her own. She observed purdah, and he had earlier nixed her plan of tutoring a group of Nepali migrant children at a nearby farm on the theory it would expose her to too much \u201cfree air.\u201d But something inside him began to soften. His wife, Rajeena, 21, resisted the idea at first. She had lived a sheltered life growing up in a village in a neighboring state before she moved to Delhi \u2014 no school trips, no girlfriends, an education that ended at ninth grade. And she had visions of venturing out past the village boundaries and being kidnapped by human traffickers who would knock her out by covering her mouth with some kind of ether-laced cloth, something she had seen on television. But nevertheless, about two months ago, she found herself walking to the busy main road and climbing aboard the No. 334 bus for her first-ever ride to a nearby commercial center, where she went to a government office to order a copy of her youngest daughter\u2019s birth certificate. The other commuters on the bus helped her figure out how to buy her 10 rupee bus ticket, she said. \u201cMy heart was pounding the whole time,\u201d she recalled, laughing at the memory. Scarier still was the walk to a market where she had to sort the family\u2019s paperwork for a ration card, through a wooded area populated by nilgai deer, monkeys and python. Others on the path threw bananas for the monkeys and the animals tore into the fruit with such ferocity that she said, \u201cI was afraid they would eat me, too.\u201d Home safely, Rajeena, who uses only one name, glowed as she recounted her trip. \u201cNow when there is any work to be done I can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t tell me not to step out, and my mother-in-law doesn\u2019t tell me not to step out. Earlier, I used to be scared. Now I feel a sort of freedom.\u201d Rajeena, 21, sits with her baby in her home. She had lived a sheltered life before she moved to Delhi, and about two months ago she was on her first-ever ride to a nearby commercial center. Death Despite her prominence, many in the village knew that Zahida and her husband had a complicated relationship with their daughter-in law, Arisha, a 19-year-old with hauntingly large brown eyes and dreams of becoming a model. She had eloped with Zahida\u2019s son Saif in 2012, when she was only 15. Her parents opposed the union in part because of the income disparity between the two families \u2014 Arisha\u2019s father owned a copper smelting business, and Saif\u2019s father was a taxi driver. The union was troubled from the start. Independent-minded Arisha argued with her husband and scandalized some of the more conservative young men in the village when she was spotted strolling in a nearby mall with friends. She ultimately filed two separate police complaints in 2014 alleging that her in-laws had been physically abusive toward her and were harassing her family for dowry. The centuries-old practice of the families of Indian brides giving dowry to the groom is illegal, but it has become more prevalent across caste and religions in recent years as incomes have risen and Indian families become more status-conscious, said Kumari, the author of a book called \u201cBrides Are Not for Burning.\u201d Dowry is also used as a method by families to extort money and other goods. Often, when there is no more money to be had, the women are burned in kitchen accidents. The country has a special classification for brides killed by their in-laws over dowry, and 7,634 women died this way last year, a growing number, according to crime records. LEFT: Arisha Khan, 19, died in an alleged dowry dispute in August. RIGHT: After she died, police found notes on the walls of her room. \u201cI am suffocating in this house,\u201d one read. \u201cHave pity on me.\u201d Another said, \u201cWhy me?\u201d \u201cSo many girls have been killed and we now have a very strong law preventing it, so we should have done away with it as a society by now,\u201d Kumari said. \u201cBut people\u2019s desires, aspirations and incomes have grown, and the cost is being paid by the new bride.\u201d According to court documents, Arisha\u2019s family has claimed that Zahida and her husband repeatedly pressed them for dowry, and over time her family gave them a used car and a new motorbike. Police say strife between the young girl and her in-laws boiled over the night of Aug. 24, when Zahida and her husband arrived at the home where she lived and allegedly force-fed her. A cousin who lives next door told police that Arisha Khan said, \u201cThey fed me something,\u201d according to court documents. Arisha fell ill and the cousin took the woman to the hospital. She later died there, from ingesting a pesticide, the medical examiner ruled. In the weeks since the incident, Zahida, her husband and son have disappeared, police say, and their cellphones are switched off. But their attorney says that they are not involved in the death, that the troubled young woman committed suicide. After she died, police found she had scrawled notes on the walls of her room. \u201cI am suffocating in this house,\u201d one read. \u201cHave pity on me.\u201d Another said, \u201cWhy me?\u201d \u201cThis was a love marriage \u2014 there was no demand for dowry,\u201d the lawyer, Ajay Raj Singh, said. \u201cThey are absolutely innocent. They were not even there\u201d\u201d Kumari said it is disturbing that one of her longtime employees would be implicated in such a scandal. \u201cIf you have been training people to be sensitive and they get into this kind of situation, then the challenge is much bigger. At what level do we need to start?\u201d she said. \u201cHow much Zahida was involved in the whole thing is an issue. She may have wronged someone. We don\u2019t know. But Zahida was not like that.\u201d Mehjabeen Khan, Arisha's mother, and her family have claimed that Arisha's in-laws killed her and repeatedly pressed them for dowry. Hope No more gender sensitivity classes have been held in Chandan Hulla since Arisha Khan\u2019s death. The case has divided families and cast a pall over the usually friendly lanes, which, in the evening, continue to ring with the sound of buzz saws and hammering as the villagers build new homes, new lives in the wreckage of the old. Yunus Khan and his extended family are building a three-story house, he says, bringing a part of the city to the village he will never get to leave. \u201cYou can try to improve India as much as you can, but India won\u2019t improve when it comes to women\u2019s issues,\u201d Arisha\u2019s aunt, Zaara Khan, said darkly. \u201cHow is it improving if in the capital of the country they are poisoning a 19-year-old? People can see it happening in the roads and in the streets, but nobody sees what\u2019s happening inside the house.\u201d But others think differently. Rajeena, the young woman who traveled outside the village for the first time, looks forward to expanding her horizons further \u2014 as her family expands. The couple\u2019s fourth child is due early next year. \u201cIf not today, change will come eventually,\u201d her husband said. \u201cThe children will grow and the parents will age and eventually the children will bring change for themselves.\u201d Rajeena sits with her children and her husband, Mohammad Sagir, 25, an electrician who attends a gender sensitivity class and recently permitted her to leave the village by herself for the first time.

    "text": "East Coast fishermen file appeal over cost of government-required 'at-sea monitors' By Cristina Corbin Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Dec. 2: David Goethel, of Hampton, N.H., speaks about the at-sea monitors aboard his 44-foot fishing trawler. \u00a0(Fox News ) SEABROOK, N.H. \u2013 \u00a0David Goethel built his life off the profits of cod, trolling the waters of New England for 30 years netting the region's once-abundant signature fish. \"My slice of the American Dream was paid for from fishing,\" Goethel said from behind the wheel of his 44-foot fishing trawler on a windy Friday afternoon in December. \"Cape Cod house, two cars, four college educations \u2013 it all came out of the fish hole in this boat.\" But a controversial federal mandate is threatening to put him out of business, he claims.\u00a0 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, requires groundfishermen -- those who catch cod, haddock and other common bottom-dwelling species -- to carry on board \"at-sea monitors.\" The observers, hired by three for-profit companies, are third-party workers whose task it is to observe fishermen's compliance with federal regulations and ensure annual quotas are not exceeded.\u00a0 The dispute lies in the cost of the monitors and who should pay for them: Fishermen are billed on average $700 a day when a regulator is present. NOAA, meanwhile, says monitors were placed on fishing boats like Goethel's only 14 percent of the time in 2016 -- and claims the fishing industry supported this system of regulation in 2010 when a vote went before the New England Fishery Management Council, an advisory board to NOAA that sets the rules. \"At sea monitors were originally supported by the sectors when we went from a days-at-sea form of management to a quota based form of management in 2010,\" said John Bullard, the regional administrator for NOAA's Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office.\u00a0 Goethel and other ground fishermen are suing the U.S. Department of Commerce, seeking to avoid paying the cost for the government-trained monitors. While many factors have led to an economically struggling fish industry in the Northeast, Goethel described monitor costs as \"the final financial blow\" to his business. Related Image Expand / Contract (Fox News) A federal district court judge in New Hampshire ruled against the group of fisherman in August, but the Cause of Action Institute -- a Washington legal watchdog representing them -- filed an appeal last month. The nonprofit advocacy group is suing on behalf of Goethel and Northeast Fishery Sector 13, which represents groundfishermen from Massachusetts to North Carolina.\u00a0 \"It's a lawless act by the government,\" said Julie Smith, vice president of the Cause of Action Institute and the lead lawyer on the case. \"If the government wants a catch monitored, the government needs to pay for the monitors -- it's that simple.\" The New England Fishery Management Council set groundfish catch quotas in May 2010 to prevent overfishing. NOAA claims it was determined then that the fishing industry would cover the cost of observers on board the vessels -- their training, commute to and from the boat, supervisor salaries and other expenses. In an effort to help an industry already suffering from economic hardship, NOAA said it agreed to subsidize those costs until 2012. The agency continued covering a portion of the costs until March 2016 when it ran out of funds to do so, a NOAA official told FoxNews.com. Fish stocks have been on a steady decline in the North Atlantic for decades. Overfishing, as well as shifting ocean patterns and climate change, have been cited as factors in the dwindling fish numbers. The Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than any other body of water in the world, according to scientists, and some say not enough regulation is in place. \"The ground fishermen in New England have paid an economic sacrifice that, if life were fair, would result in the rebuilding in stocks but we haven\u2019t seen that yet,\" Bullard said. Goethel begins his work day before the sun rises, leaving the dock in Hampton at 5 a.m. and fishing some 20 miles off shore. After 12 hours at sea with his crew, Goethel, who is also a marine biologist, unloads his catch at the Yankee Fisherman's Co-op in Seabrook. On a good day, his catch brings about $1,500, and he takes home $300. Under the observer program, Goethel must register his fishing trips on a government website 48 hours before departure. He said he does not know if a monitor will accompany the crew until he arrives at the dock in the morning. For the majority of trips, no monitor is present, but when one is, the cost to Goethel is several hundred dollars -- a fee he said he cannot afford. Related Image Expand / Contract Goethel puts his catch on ice after unloading at the Yankee Fisherman's Co-op in Seabrook. (Fox News) \"By the government's own study, 60 percent of the active boats that were registered were made nonviable the day this [mandate] was announced,\" Goethel said, as he lowered his net from the Ellen Diane, a trawler named after his wife and one of only six commercial ground fishing vessels still operating in the area. Goethel said he hopes a judge will rule it is illegal on the part of the government to require such a fee and that it is considered a tax.\u00a0 \"I think the regulatory industry has exceeded its legal authority because only Congress can tax people,\" said Goethel. \"This is a regulatory agency that has said, 'You will pay for at-sea monitors or you could lose your job.'\" \"It's either pay or don't fish,\" he said. \"We don't have any more money to give.\" Many fishermen question the necessity of the program given the regulations already in place and searches without warrants by the Coast Guard and unannounced inspections upon returning to port. Goethel argues that on-board monitors don't effectively deter unlawful activity. \"The fish off New England have suffered several declines in the last 100 years. I don't think any fisherman would say we don't need management -- what fishermen would say is we need rational management,\" said Goethel.\u00a0 Some lawmakers have been vocal in their opposition to the monitor costs, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who has questioned NOAA's claim that it does not have the funds to continue paying for the monitors. \"NOAA\u2019s at-sea monitoring fees place an impossible burden on New Hampshire\u2019s small-boat fishermen and that is why I\u2019ve consistently fought against these unfair fees and interference,\" Ayotte told FoxNews.com Wednesday. \"I continue to strongly believe that NOAA should fully fund its at-sea monitoring program,\" she said.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

The result marked the biggest gap between the popular vote and the electoral college in almost 150 years. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by at least 2.8 million, according to a final tally. The result marked the biggest gap between the popular vote and the electoral college in almost 150 years. (AFP/Getty Images) David Lauter Contact Reporter The final results of the 2016 presidential election look like this: Hillary Clinton got roughly the same number of\u00a0votes that\u00a0 President Obama received four years ago en route to his reelection, but she nonetheless lost the presidency to Donald Trump , who came in at least 2.8\u00a0million votes behind her. That\u2019s a highly unusual outcome \u2014\u00a0the biggest gap between the popular vote and the electoral college in almost a century and a half. Only now, with almost all the nation\u2019s ballots counted, have analysts begun to flesh out what led to that result\u00a0and what implications it has for the nation\u2019s deep political divisions.\u00a0 Start with California, where Clinton beat Trump by almost 2 to 1 , amassing a margin of more than 4.2 million votes. That\u2019s a victory more impressive even than Obama\u2019s in 2012, and it included a win in Orange County, which had sided with the Republican\u00a0in every presidential election back to 1936. But Clinton\u2019s huge majority in the nation\u2019s largest state was also part of her key weakness \u2014\u00a0a base of support too concentrated in the big, urban areas of the northeast and the West Coast. A candidate gets all of a state\u2019s electoral votes whether she wins by four\u00a0or 4 million, so in the national\u00a0picture, the huge size of Clinton\u2019s majority in California, as well as a similarly lopsided margin in New York, did her no good. Clinton piled up similarly \u201cwasted\u201d votes in some big, Republican states \u2014\u00a0notably Georgia and Texas \u2014\u00a0in which she did significantly better than recent Democratic nominees, but not well enough to win any electoral votes. By contrast, Trump\u2019s vote \u201cwas incredibly efficient,\u201d said Tom Bonier of TargetSmart, \u00a0a Democratic data and strategy firm based in Washington. \u201cWhere he lost, he lost big. Where he won, he won by a little. There weren\u2019t many wasted votes. He won almost all the close ones.\u201d Trump narrowly eked out the victories he needed in key states of nation\u2019s industrial belt, taking Michigan by 10,704, according to final returns, Wisconsin by 22,717 and Pennsylvania by just under 45,000, according to a compilation of the latest data maintained by David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. The reasons that happened varied from state to state, Bonier and other analysts note. In Ohio and Wisconsin, for example, turnout fell, belying the image of an army of previously hidden Trump voters storming the polls. In Pennsylvania, by contrast, that image may be more accurate \u2014 turnout rose significantly across the state. Similarly, in Florida, Clinton won heavily in nearly all the places that Democrats generally count on, but lost because of a huge election-day upsurge in heavily white, nonurban counties of the central part of the state, according to an analysis by Democratic strategist Steve Schale .\u00a0 One big, consistent piece of the problem was that Clinton performed worse than Obama did in\u00a0blue-collar, predominately white communities outside of major\u00a0cities;\u00a0such as the counties that include Scranton and Erie, Pa.;\u00a0Youngstown, Ohio;\u00a0Green Bay, Wis.;\u00a0and Daytona Beach in Florida.\u00a0In many such counties, Clinton\u2019s vote was 15 percentage points or more below what Obama received in his reelection.\u00a0 \u201cWhen I look at those blue-collar areas, I\u2019m still kind of in awe\u201d over how dramatic the change was, said Sean Trende, election analyst for the RealClearPolitics website. Clinton actually did better than Obama in counties that have high levels of education \u2014\u00a0Orange County being a prime example \u2014 as well as suburban counties outside Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston and several other major cities. Indeed, the share of the white population with a college degree or higher turned out to be one of the strongest predictors of which candidate would win a particular area this year. Trump\u2019s weakness in those suburban counties, which in the past have often sided with Republicans, provides \u201ca\u00a0big red, flashing sign for both parties,\u201d said Trende. The danger for Democrats is that \u201cif Trump can bring those suburban Republicans back into the fold\u201d without losing his core support among blue-collar, white voters, \u201che could win a pretty significant victory\u201d in the next election, Trende said. The danger for Republicans is that if Trump fails to improve his standing in the suburbs, \u201cthere are a bunch of GOP representatives from those districts\u201d who could suddenly be at risk. Like the \u201cwhere\u201d of Trump\u2019s victory, the \u201cwhen\u201d is also fairly clear: He won heavily among voters who made up their minds in the final two weeks of the campaign. The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times \u201cDaybreak\u201d tracking poll of the election provides evidence on that score. The poll, which tracked roughly 3,200 people through the campaign, resurveyed them after\u00a0the vote. Those who had said they were certain about which way they would vote almost all followed through as predicted. But among the smaller group who were still uncertain about their vote in late October \u2014\u00a0people who said, for example, that they were only 60% likely to vote for their favored candidate, Trump did notably better than Clinton. That finding suggests that voters who were undecided, or only weakly committed, late in the campaign broke toward Trump. Pollsters for both the Trump and Clinton campaigns say their internal data found similar results. Clinton aides blame that late surge for Trump on FBI Director James B. Comey , saying that he heavily influenced the outcome with\u00a0his disclosure, 10 days before the election, that the bureau was looking at a trove of emails that might be related to Clinton\u2019s handling of classified data while secretary of State. Comey said days later that the newly identified emails would not change his previous conclusion that there was no evidence to warrant indicting Clinton.\u00a0 Trump aides say that other factors were also at play, including the president-elect\u2019s unexpectedly disciplined\u00a0focus on his campaign message in the contest\u2019s final two weeks. But they don\u2019t deny that Comey\u2019s letter played a role. \u00a0 In contrast to the \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen,\u201d the\u00a0\u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of Trump\u2019s success remain more elusive. Analysts know, for example, that some people who voted for Obama four years ago turned around and voted for Trump this year. But they don\u2019t yet have a good picture of how many did so compared with the number of Obama voters who simply stayed home. Some of the answers won\u2019t be known until states release their detailed voter files, showing who actually voted this year. Only a few states have done that so far. Even before all the numbers are available, however, an intense and potentially disruptive argument has started among Democrats\u00a0about which groups in their\u00a0coalition were most responsible for Clinton\u2019s defeat and what the answer means for the party\u2019s future direction. One big argument involves the relative importance of economics and race. Aides to Trump say he won because voters in blue-collar communities favored his economic message. Particularly in the Midwest, he scored with his promise to bring jobs back to a region that has suffered from stagnant incomes and declining economic mobility for decades, they say. Some Democratic analysts agree, at least in part. Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg said Friday that a postelection poll conducted by his firm showed that Democrats and independents who had voted for Trump held many doubts and anxieties about the his character. Nonetheless, they \u201cheld their noses and voted\u201d for him \u201cbecause he offered a different economic vision,\u201d Greenberg wrote in analyzing the poll\u2019s findings. Other Democrats and some academic analysts stress Trump\u2019s ability to play on racial resentments among his core supporters. Michael Tesler, a political scientist at UC Irvine, has spent the year studying the role of race in the campaign. In a series of articles , he has described survey data that show\u00a0a strong link between measures of racial resentment and support for Trump among white voters. Whites who scored high on questions that are designed to measure racial animosity or anxiety were more likely to favor the Republican candidate this year than they were in 2008 and 2012, when the Democratic candidate was the country\u2019s first African American president, he found. That could be a result of some of the racially tinged language Trump used in the campaign. Another issue involves how badly Clinton underperformed among millennial generation voters. The Clinton campaign\u2019s internal data indicate\u00a0that the drop-off among voters younger than 30 was a key problem.\u00a0Those voters mostly did not side with Trump \u2014\u00a0he remains unpopular with younger Americans \u2014 but enough either stayed home or voted for third-party candidates to make the difference in the closest states. \u201cWe needed to be in the low 60s with young people, and at the end of the day, we were in the high 50s,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, said at a recent conference held by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University \u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why we lost.\u201d\u00a0 Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

They are part part of a small but effective network of former neo Nazis working to help people leave the far-right scene. Spread across Germany they work closely with an organization called EXIT that provides quick, non-bureaucratic advice to extremists who want out. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) 0 Shares Email Felix Benneckenstein was a rising star on Germany's far-right scene, a young songwriter whose rousing guitar anthems made white nationalism sound romantic and rebellious. But when fellow neo-Nazis attacked a friend, Benneckenstein found the doubts he'd ignored for years coming to the surface. \"It was a rude awakening,\" he recalled. \"You have an idea of what's wrong with the world and believe you've discovered hidden truths... And to then realize that everything you've done to yourself and others in the past years was built on lies is a bitter moment.\" After almost a decade on the far-right fringes, the 30-year-old is now part of a small but effective network of former neo-Nazis helping people to leave the scene. Spread across Germany, they work closely with an organization called EXIT that provides quick, unbureaucratic advice to extremists who want out. At a time when extreme nationalism is on the rise in Europe again, EXIT has helped hundreds of neo-Nazis start a new life, according to its founder Bernd Wagner, a former East German police detective. He says EXIT has an edge over government-run programs because those answering its hotline have dropped out of the far-right movement themselves. These former neo-Nazis call themselves the 'Action Group' and try to meet in person at least once a year. The meetings aren't advertised, and journalists aren't invited because some members fear their identity could be revealed to friends and colleagues unaware of their past. Last month The Associated Press received unprecedented access to the group's two-day retreat at a former police training center tucked away in a wood in the eastern state of Saxony \u2014 notorious for its strong far-right presence. About a dozen people \u2014 mostly young, mostly male \u2014 came to talk about their past and brainstorm ways to reach out to those still inside the neo-Nazi scene. Wagner says the Action Group gives ex-Nazis a way to become involved in political campaigns again where other organizations might reject them due to their past. The meetings also help them deal with their own demons. \"It does a lot for people that they can talk about the old days, not like old warriors who've won battles but about the mistakes they made in their lives,\" said Wagner. \"They're still looking for direction in a highly complex and diverse reality.\" That includes people such as Falk Isernhagen. Bespectacled and slight, he felt he was an outsider as a white kid in a mostly migrant neighborhood of Berlin. When older white students at his high school invited him along to football games, he was grateful. Soon he was marching alongside them at far-right demonstrations. Then he offered to run their website. Isernhagen left when the pressure from his comrades became too much. Shortly after making the call to EXIT , he was attacked by unknown assailants and ended up in hospital, under police protection. Instead of just turning his back on the far right, he chose to help others find their way out, too. \"I felt I'd done enough damage so I wanted to make up for it a bit,\" he said. But it's not all penance for the former neo-Nazis who met in Schleife, a village near the Polish border, in early November. Sitting on a frigid porch outside the training center, Isernhagen grinned as he recalled the previous nights' larks. \"It's really interesting to work with people who have the same or similar experiences,\" he said. \"Because you feel that they understand what you went through and felt. That welds people together.\" People who join the far right typically share a common history: an early interest in politics, a feeling that they were outsiders or underdogs, and anger at what they regarded as injustice around them. Benneckenstein was 13 when he came into contact with white nationalism. At first it was more teenage rebellion than genuine sympathy that drew him to the extreme right. \"I found the Nazi scene abhorrent. My little brother has Down Syndrome and of course I knew what happened to disabled people under Hitler,\" he recalled. But Benneckenstein enjoyed the music his new friends were listening to, and like many young Germans, he felt his generation was being unfairly penalized for their grandparents' mistakes. He fell for historical revisionism, to the extent of denying the Holocaust . \"I wanted to rid myself of a certain guilt one has because of Germany's history,\" he said. Soon his friends were bombarding him with information. There was \"fun, action and party,\" he said, but mainly it was about radicalizing young people. First they radicalized him. Then he radicalized others. Going by the stage name 'Flex,' he composed nationalist songs that included lines such \"Am I criminal because I want to change the world\" and \"I'm ready to rise up against everything that stands in our way.\" Some of those in his circle were arrested for planning to bomb a Jewish center in Munich. Benneckenstein insists he was never involved in organized violence, though it was seen as a legitimate response to attacks from left-wing demonstrators. \"If you want to be part of it, as I did, you have to be able to use violence,\" he said. A few months after his friends were attacked by other neo-Nazis, Benneckenstein \u2014 who resembles a young Matt Damon \u2014 found himself in jail. It was the last straw. He and his girlfriend called EXIT seeking help to leave the far-right movement. Since then Benneckenstein has become the go-to guy for remorseful neo-Nazis in Germany's southern state of Bavaria . First contact requires trust on both sides, as well as a willingness to hear the other side out, he said. Some people are ready to quit the far right immediately. \"We develop a scenario that allows people to leave the scene quietly.\" \"Then there are the others who get in touch and want to talk through the whole ideology, which is also an important step. Because if they contact me they are contacting a traitor.\" But Benneckenstein also has an advantage. Unlike a police officer or social worker, he knows firsthand what neo-Nazis believe and where their weak spots are. For many, the shift from mainstream politics to far-right ideology involved embracing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Unraveling those theories is a difficult but important part of the process of leaving the far-right scene, which Germany's domestic intelligence service says involved some 22,600 people last year. Members of the Action Group, of whom there are now almost 40, say they recognize those theories in the current debate over Germany's immigration policy . The country has seen a surge in attacks against migrants over the past two years amid an unprecedented influx of refugees. Far-right groups have claimed that the government is intentionally trying to import foreigners to weaken the German population \u2014 or even abolish it. To former neo-Nazis like Benneckenstein, such developments are worrying. \"I'm hardly concerned by the refugees, but I am concerned by the mood that's resulting from this,\" he said. \"Everyone can see how the political picture in Germany is changing at the moment.\" The situation has given the Action Group's work greater importance. Two years ago it made headlines when it got the public to 'sponsor' a far-right march. The stunt caught the neo-Nazis off guard: for every meter (yard) they marched, ten euros (dollars) were donated to an anti-Nazi campaign. The group followed up last year by soliciting donations for each racist post on Facebook \u2014 more posts, more donations to organizations that work to counter hate speech. Their stunts have since been copied by groups outside Germany, and EXIT now has a sister organization in the United States. Some of the Action Group's members have come a long way since leaving the far right. By his mid-20s, Stefan Rochow had risen from teenage activist to leader of the National Democratic Party's youth wing, responsible for recruiting new members and shaping the party's ideology. Outwardly he blamed foreigners and mainstream politicians for his country's woes, but inside Rochow was gripped by doubt. Corruption within the party and his own religious awakening made him question the ideas he'd spent more than a decade fighting for. \"I lived in two worlds,\" he recalls. \"My whole personality was completely split.\" With the help of his girlfriend and a Catholic priest, Rochow eventually managed to leave the party, a process that took three years. The turmoil and difficulties he experienced moved him to turn the tables on his erstwhile comrades. Rochow remembers the \"huge hole\" he felt in his life after finally leaving the far-right party in 2008. His new-found Christian faith helped fill the void. These days he's busier than ever. Aside from running his own business in the northern city of Schwerin and helping convert neo-Nazis, Rochow works in a cafe Wednesday afternoons \u2014 helping refugees from Syria and Iraq adapt to life in Germany. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter 0 Shares ",

The move to authorize an average pay raise of 2.1 percent for 2017 was announced in letters to the House and Senate. This comes after the president submitted a 1.6 percent raise in August. \u201cHowever, in light of the decision of Congress to provide a 2.1 percent pay increase for military personnel in 2017 and reconsideration of current and projected economic conditions, I have concluded it would be appropriate to revise my original alternative plan for locality payments so that the total combined cost of the 1.0 percent across-the-board base pay increase and varying locality payments will be 2.1 percent of basic payroll,\u201d the letter said. The raise will take effect on Jan. 1. Mr. Obama noted in the letter that civilian federal employees \u201cmade significant sacrifices as a result of the 3-year pay freeze that ended in 2014\u201d and that annual adjustments for them have been lower than pay increases for workers in the private sector .

The push, which could surface at Monday's City Council Finance Committee meeting, triggered preemptive opposition Friday from anti-smoking groups that have lauded the mayor for his anti-tobacco efforts. Under Emanuel, Chicago has raised the tobacco-buying age to 21 and increased the city's cigarette tax to the highest levels in the nation. \"Any rollbacks on the flavored tobacco ban only benefit Big Tobacco and will have serious consequences,\" stated a joint news release from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Heart Association, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and Respiratory Health Association. The groups urged 14th Ward Ald. Ed Burke to not call the ordinance for consideration Monday. They described Burke, the Finance Committee chairman, as \"an ally\" in anti-smoking efforts. A committee agenda released Friday only lists possible, nonspecified changes to the portions of city code that regulate city cigarette sales. Burke's aides declined to release a detailed proposal or to even confirm they were considering changes to the ban. When aldermen are about to consider controversial proposals, final versions sometimes aren't available because the fine print can change in the days and hours before a meeting. Supporters, however, said they've been working on what they described as a potential compromise: sales of menthol cigarettes would be allowed near elementary schools, but not high schools, based on the rationale that selling cigarettes to grade school kids isn't going to occur even without the ban. More than 400 Chicago retailers are affected by the ban, said Tanya Triche, vice president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. She could not say how many stores would be affected by loosening the rules on menthol cigarettes, but said far more stores are near elementary schools than high schools. With the partial rollback, \"it would target the audience that the ordinance was intended to target,\" said Triche, whose group has been pushing to reverse the ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products within 500 feet of schools since it was enacted in late 2013. \"We just think it's the right thing to do for the retailers who have had to take a very profitable product off their shelves and have some just very common-sense legislation,\" Triche added. But changing the rules is unlikely if it's not backed by the mayor, who is likely to be hard-pressed to accept even a partial rollback, given the accolades that he's won for his anti-smoking efforts. After Emanuel first proposed the ban on flavored cigarettes near schools, officials from the African-American Tobacco Control Leadership Council flew in to give him its Visionary Elected Leader Award, singling out his efforts to regulate menthol cigarettes. Studies have shown that menthol cigarettes mask the harshness of the smoke and are used more by young people and African-Americans. Asked Friday if Emanuel opposed the effort to once again allow menthol cigarette sales near elementary schools, his administration pointed to a statement released earlier indicating only that it \"will not support a repeal of the ban on flavor tobacco products.\" ",

Lisa Monaco speaks to reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday. (Michael Bonfigli/The Christian Science Monitor) Brian Bennett and W.J. Hennigan Contact Reporters President Obama has ordered a \u201cfull review\u201d of computer hacks and leaks that U.S. intelligence agencies say were aimed at disrupting this year\u2019s presidential election , a top White House official said Friday. The disclosure came after President-elect Donald Trump again dismissed an assessment by the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian authorities directed the theft and subsequent leaks from Democratic Party officials and Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign manager before last month\u2019s election. \"We may be crossing into a new threshold and it\u2019s incumbent upon us to take stock of that,\" said Lisa O. Monaco, the White House counter-terrorism and Homeland Security adviser. The report on what happened and \u201clessons learned\u201d will be provided to Congress before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20 but may not be made public, Monaco said at a breakfast arranged by the Christian Science Monitor. She said the administration would be \u201cvery attentive to not disclosing sources and methods that may impede our ability to identify and attribute malicious actors in the future.\u201d Trump has repeatedly dismissed claims that Russian authorities played a role in the hacks and subsequent release on WikiLeaks and other websites of thousands of emails from Democratic National Committee staff accounts and the private account of John Podesta , chairman of Clinton's campaign. In an interview with Time Magazine published this week, Trump said he doesn\u2019t believe Russia tried to interfere with the election. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point,\u201d he said, implying that the intelligence assessments attributing the attacks to Russia were politically motivated. On Oct. 7, a joint statement from Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , who leads the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, said senior Russian officials had directed the hacks in an effort to influence the presidential race. \u201cThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d it said. In addition, intelligence officials also said that \u201cscanning and probing\u201d of state election computers had originated from a Russian company, but stopped short of attributing that to the Russian government. Using an emergency communications system set up to prevent an accidental nuclear weapon exchange, the White House warned Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019s government not to try to interfere with voting on election day, according to later reports. No digital disruptions on election day were subsequently reported. The stolen emails, which were published by WikiLeaks and other websites, added fodder to accusations that Democratic Party officials worked with Clinton operatives to defeat her rival Bernie Sanders during the primaries, and that the Clinton family benefited financially from the Clinton Foundation global charity. When DNC officials realized their computers\u00a0had been hacked in early May, they called CrowdStrike, an Irvine-based cybersecurity firm that tracks the styles of some 80 global hacking groups, to make an assessment of their computer networks in early May. The team installed software on DNC computers to examine the attack. CrowdStrike revealed in July that their analysis found two known Russian intelligence groups, code-named Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, had implanted malicious \"backdoors\" into the networks. The firm\u2019s analysts said they were able to identify the group by their tactics in penetrating networks and tell-tale code they left behind. Much of the code was stealthy, capable of detecting and evading cyber defenses and virus scanners, according to CrowdStrike\u2019s forensic report. The groups have been active for years and were previously linked into the hacks on the unclassified networks belonging to numerous foreign governments, as well as the White House, State Department and U.S. military\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff . In the post, CrowdStrike said they found that Cozy Bear had been breaching DNC networks going back to summer of 2015, while Fancy Bear\u2019s first appeared in April 2016. \u201cWe have identified no collaboration between the two actors, or even an awareness of one by the other,\u201d the post said. \u201cInstead, we observed the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials.\u201d CrowdStrike\u2019s report tying Russian intelligence to the hack has since been supported by other watchdogs and government officials who have been given classified intelligence briefings. The issue has also received scrutiny from top Republicans, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who believes Russia is to blame. \u201cI think there\u2019s very little doubt,\u201d McCain said in an interview. \u201cThe problem with hacking is that if they\u2019re able to disrupt elections then it\u2019s a national security issue, obviously.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said this week that the Senate Armed Services subcommittee that he heads will investigate the Russian hacking under Putin. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said\u00a0Russia\u2019s cyber-attacks are \u201cno surprise\u201d and said the Obama administration has ignored calls from his committee\u00a0to take more forceful action against Russia. \u00a0 \u201cThe Intelligence Community has repeatedly failed to anticipate Putin\u2019s hostile actions,\u201d Nunes said in a statement responding to Obama\u2019s review. \u201cIt appears, however, that after eight years the administration has suddenly awoken to the threat,\u201d he said. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s unwillingness to accept the conclusions of career intelligence officials has sparked concern in both parties. In recent weeks, as\u00a0he meets with candidates for cabinet officials in his office building in New York City and holds victory rallies in Ohio and Louisiana, Trump\u00a0has turned down having more than a handful of intelligence briefings since elected. \"Given President-elect Trump's disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the Kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month,\u201d the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), said in a statement. Schiff has received multiple intelligence briefings on cyber threats against the 2016 election and his convinced the Russian government \u201csought to interfere\u201d and \u201csow discord,\u201d he said. The German and British governments are also raising alarms about Russian meddling in their political process. German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019s administration on Thursday published a stark rebuke of Russia, accusing Moscow of using hackers to spread fake information in Germany and influence the political process. In a rare public speech on Thursday, the chief of British Secret Intelligence Service Alex Younger warned of hostile governments trying to undermine democratic institutions, without naming Russia specifically. \u201cThey do this through means as varied as cyber-attacks, propaganda or subversion of democratic process,\u201d he said.

By Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin December 9 at 4:07 PM Follow @StevenMufson Follow @eilperin The Trump transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking officials there to identify which department employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation's carbon output. (Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post) \u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has issued a list of 74 questions for the Energy Department, asking agency officials to\u00a0identify which employees and contractors have worked on forging an international climate pact as well as domestic efforts to cut the nation\u2019s carbon output. The questionnaire requests a list of those individuals who have taken part in international climate talks over the past five years\u00a0and \u201cwhich programs within DOE are essential to meeting the goals of President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan.\u201d [ Pruitt, Trump\u2019s EPA pick, has both sides of climate divide girding for a major fight ] Trump and his team have vowed to dismantle specific aspects of Obama\u2019s climate policies , and Trump has questioned the reality of climate change.\u00a0The questionnaire, which one Energy Department official described as unusually \u201cintrusive\u201d and a matter for departmental lawyers, has raised concern that the Trump transition team is trying to figure out how to target the people, including civil servants, who have helped implement policies under Obama. Thousands of scientists have signed petitions calling on the president-elect and his team to respect scientific integrity and refrain from singling out individual researchers whose work might conflict with the new administration\u2019s policy goals. This potential clash could prompt a major schism within the federal government, with many career officials waging a battle against incoming political appointees. While there have been many instances of political appointees and career scientists clashing in various administrations, what is novel is the request for the names of so many individual scientists, and\u00a0the fact that it comes during the transition period, before the Trump administration has even taken power. This may be a signal of even more intense politicization after the inauguration. Yale University environmental historian Paul Sabin said in an interview that previous administrations have worked to install like-minded energy and environmental experts in key agencies, often at the expense of employees from previous administrations. \u201cBut what seems unusual is singling people out for a very specific substantive issue, and treating their work on that substantive issue as, by default, contaminating or disqualifying,\u201d Sabin said, adding that officials can now track a civil servant\u2019s past activities \u201cin such a systematic way.\u201d During Ronald Reagan\u2019s time, when his political appointees sparred with officials at the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, Sabin noted, \u201cit would have been so much harder to collect it on paper and track it down.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters that he could not speak to the questionnaire directly, saying, \u201cIf you have questions about activity that the president-elect\u2019s team is doing, you should check in with them and try and figure out why they\u2019re doing it.\u201d But Schultz added: \u201cAll I can tell you is that President Obama is enormously proud of the work of civil servants and federal workers across the administration, that over the past eight years they\u2019ve worked to make this country stronger. And they don\u2019t do so out a sense of great pay or because the hours are great. They do so out of a sense of patriotism. And\u00a0the president\u2019s proud of their record.\u201d The questionnaire was first reported by Bloomberg News. The Washington Post has obtained its own copies of both the initial document and one with some of the agency\u2019s replies filled in, in addition to confirmation from other people in the department that the documents are legitimate. Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), a physicist, warned that the questionnaire \u201cthreatens to undo decades of progress we have made on climate change,\u201d and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said punishing civil servants for their work under previous administrations \u201cwould be tantamount to an illegal modern-day political witch hunt and would have a profoundly chilling impact on our dedicated federal workforce.\u201d The document spanned a broad area of Energy Department activities, including its loan program, technology research program, responses to Congress, estimates of offshore wind and cleanup of uranium at a site once used by the military for weapons research. In many cases, the inquiries meshed with the priorities of conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, which held a meeting on energy and environment issues in Washington on Thursday, as well as priorities outlined in a recent fundraising pitch sent by the American Energy Alliance (AEA), a wing of the Institute for Energy Research. Thomas Pyle, who heads the AEA, leads Trump\u2019s Energy Department transition team. In a recent fundraising pitch, Pyle wrote supporters: \u201cAfter eight years of the Obama administration\u2019s divisive energy and environmental policies, the American people have voted for a change \u2014 a big change. We expect the Trump administration will adopt pro-energy and pro-market policies \u2014 much different than the Obama administration\u2019s top-down government approach.\u201d One question zeroed in on the issue of the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d a way of calculating the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions. The transition team asked for a list of department employees or contractors who attended interagency meetings, the dates of the meetings, and emails and other materials associated with them. The social cost of carbon is a metric that calculates the cost to society of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Obama administration has used this tool to try to calculate the benefits of regulations and initiatives that lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions. At Thursday\u2019s Heritage meeting, senior fellow David Kreutzer attacked the idea of using the social cost of carbon during the regulatory process. He said it \u201cactually can be considered a fiction, the way it\u2019s produced in the [Environmental Protection Agency] right now,\u201d adding that it \u201cis supposedly a measure of the damage done to the world economy for each ton of carbon emitted in a given year.\u201d Kreutzer\u00a0is a member of Trump\u2019s EPA transition team; Trump recently named Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who is suing the EPA over its environmental regulations, to head the EPA. [ The staggering economic cost of air pollution ] Another question appeared to delve deeply into the mechanisms behind scientific tools called \u201c integrated assessment models ,\u201d which scientists use to forecast future changes to the climate and energy system. It also asked what the Energy Department considers to be \u201cthe proper equilibrium climate sensitivity,\u201d which is a way climate researchers calculate how much the planet will eventually warm, depending on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. \u201cMy guess is that they\u2019re trying to undermine the credibility of the science that DOE has produced, particularly in the field of climate science,\u201d said Rob Jackson, a Stanford climate and energy researcher, in response to the question about the integrated assessment models. The questionnaire also appeared to take aim at the national laboratories, which operate with a high degree of independence but are part of the Energy Department. The questionnaire asked for a list of the top 20 salaried employees of the labs, the labs\u2019 peer-reviewed publications over the past three years, a list of their professional society memberships, affiliations, and the websites they maintain or contribute to \u201cduring work hours.\u201d Researchers at national labs focus on a range of issues, including renewable-energy development and climate analysis. Career Energy officials who are the designated liaisons to the Trump transition team are allowed to disclose only publicly available information, unless it is in the context of a classified briefing to transition team members who have obtained security clearance through the White House. A response to the question about the top 20 salaried employees read: \u201cDOE does not collect this information. This would require a call to the Labs, and the information is not available publicly.\u201d The department gave a similar to reply to questions about professional society memberships, websites they maintain or contribute to, and paid and unpaid positions. The transition team questionnaire\u00a0also asked how to keep open aging nuclear power plants, restart the controversial Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site shelved by Obama and support the licensing of small modular reactors. It included 15 questions for the Energy Information Administration, some of them routine but some questioning the way the agency uses data about energy production. The questions called to mind past cases of conflicts between Republican administrations and federal agency scientists, on the environment and other matters. In Reagan\u2019s first term, Anne Gorsuch was appointed to head the Environmental Protection Agency amid a major push for regulatory rollback. But after Gorsuch resigned amid controversy in 1983, Congress opened investigations into supposed \u201chit lists\u201d at the agency used to track the views of members of scientific advisory boards, according to contemporary news reports. During the George W. Bush administration, there were complaints that scientific documents had been edited to raise doubts about the science of climate change and that researchers had been prevented from speaking openly to the media and sharing their expertise. In late 2010, the Obama administration issued governmentwide \u201cscientific integrity\u201d guidelines aimed at shielding federal scientists from political interference, part of an effort\u00a0to distinguish itself from the Bush administration. The four-page memo, written by John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, included a prohibition against agency leaders or public affairs officers asking or demanding federal scientists to alter or suppress their findings. It also instructed agencies to \u201cinvolve science and technology experts where appropriate\u201d to craft \u201cpolicymaking of the highest integrity.\u201d [ Amid funding fears, NASA announces another climate research mission ] Energy Department officials have not yet decided how to respond to the questions targeting the agency\u2019s climate activities, according to federal officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity\u00a0to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cWith some of these questions, it feels more like an inquisition than a question, in terms of going after career employees who have been here through the Bush years to Clinton, and up to now,\u201d said one current Energy Department employee. \u201cAll of a sudden you have questions that feel more like a congressional investigation than an actual probing of how the Department of Energy does its job.\u201d Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 Center for Science and Democracy, called the memo\u2019s demand that Energy officials identify specific employees \u201calarming.\u201d \u201cIf the Trump administration is already singling out scientists for doing their jobs, the scientific community is right to be worried about what his administration will do in office. What\u2019s next? Trump administration officials holding up lists of \u2018known climatologists\u2019 and urging the public to go after them?\u201d Halpern asked. He added that lawmakers have attacked executive-branch scientists in the past for doing \u201cwork they find inconvenient. It seems that they are about to get accomplices in the Department of Energy. But don\u2019t expect the federal workforce to simply roll over. The new administration will find thousands of federal workers who still believe in their departmental mission and will work hard to resist attacks on their peers. Scientists outside government are standing by to expose these actions and fight back.\u201d Christine McEntee, the executive director of the American Geophysical Union, a large society of Earth scientists, added in response to the questionnaire\u00a0that \u201cwe don\u2019t know at AGU the intent of all these questions, but if you look at them without knowing that intent, they are raising alarm for us.\u201d McEntee said that in general, when it comes to politics and science under Trump, \u201cwe\u2019re hearing a lot from members, they\u2019re quite concerned.\u201d At the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco next week, where more than\u00a020,000 scientists gather annually, there will be sessions on the consequences of the election for science and on giving publicly funded scientists legal advice on how to respond to requests for their communications, she said. The Trump transition team\u2019s meetings with Energy Department officials so far have excluded political appointees, one current official said. At the Defense Department, Trump transition officials\u00a0are having multiple meetings a day with Pentagon personnel but in some cases have asked Obama administration political appointees not to attend those meetings, officials there said. Chris Mooney, Brady Dennis and Missy Ryan contributed to this report. Read more at Energy & Environment: ",

By Greg Jaffe and Greg Miller December 9 at 4:50 PM Follow @GregJaffe Follow @gregpmiller President-elect Donald Trump is assembling a national security team dominated by retired generals who share a deep distrust of Iran and have characterized the threat of militant Islam in far more dire terms than Obama administration officials and intelligence assessments. The trio of ex-generals represents an emerging core of the Trump administration that is at odds with President Obama\u2019s efforts to convince the American public that \u2014 15 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 terrorism continues to pose a persistent threat to the nation, but not an existential one. The generals\u2019 views also cut against the grain of U.S. policies seeking to empower moderates in Iran and of U.S. intelligence assessments that terrorism no longer stands alone atop the rankings of global security threats now crowded by concerns about cyberattacks and renewed aggression by China and Russia. Their views, though far from uniform, have been heavily influenced over the past 15\u00a0years by intensely personal battlefield losses, the country\u2019s waning attention to the wars and an up-close view of a ruthless enemy. Those experiences could lead retired Gens. Michael T. Flynn, James N. Mattis and John F. Kelly to urge caution in Trump administration debates about the use of force. But former colleagues and experts said the generals are also more likely, by virtue of their training and experience, to see malign intent or view the world as a struggle between good and evil. President-elect Donald Trump has already tapped three former generals to serve in his administration. The Washington Post's Jenna Johnson explains what attracts Trump to these men. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) [ How Trump naming Mattis as Pentagon chief would break with 65 years of U.S. history ] \u201cThe nature of the job in the military is to be responsible for threats against the nation and to be blamed if the country is not prepared,\u201d said Stephen Biddle, a professor at George Washington University and frequent adviser to the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThey tend to be very threat-focused in relation to civilians and tend to see that threat in more apocalyptic terms.\u201d Statements and online postings by Flynn, Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, have drawn the most alarm among intelligence analysts and the foreign-policy establishment. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world war, but very few Americans recognize it, and fewer still have any idea how to win it,\u201d Flynn wrote in his recent book \u201cThe Field of Fight.\u201d He has also repeatedly depicted Islam as a diseased religion that represents a growing danger. \u201cFear of Muslims is rational,\u201d he wrote in a posting to his Twitter account earlier this year. [ Trump\u2019s security pick brings experience and controversy ] Mattis and Kelly \u2014 Trump\u2019s respective nominees for secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security \u2014 have been far more measured in their foreign-policy pronouncements and are widely respected within the foreign-policy establishment and among the United States\u2019 Gulf Arab allies. Yet each has expressed hard-line views about Iran and the threat of terrorism. \u201cOur country today is in a life-and-death struggle against an evil enemy, but America as a whole is certainly not at war,\u201d Kelly said in late 2010, just days after his son, an officer leading Marines in Afghanistan, was killed. \u201cNot as a country. Not as a people.\u201d Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet Mattis\u2019s persistent warnings about the threat posed by Iran led to tensions with the White House, which urged him when he was in uniform to tone down his rhetoric. He has criticized the Obama administration for taking too passive an approach to Iranian aggression and fostering \u201cthe impression in the region that the U.S. was withdrawing.\u201d In a speech in April, Mattis described the Iran deal as one \u201cdrawn up with the expectation that Iran will cheat.\u201d He said that one of its principal advantages would be that \u201cwe\u2019ll have better targeting data should it come to a fight at some point in the future.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to plan for the worst,\u201d Mattis said. Obama has mounted an aggressive campaign to kill senior al-Qaeda and Islamic State leaders and wrest back territory seized by the extremists in Iraq and Syria. But he has also emphasized that the groups are not \u201cthe vanguard of a new world order.\u201d \u201cThese terrorists can never directly destroy our way of life, but we can do it for them if we lose track of who we are and the values that this nation was founded upon,\u201d the president said in a speech earlier this week. [ ISIS\u2019s second-in-command hid for months in Syria. When he stepped out, the U.S. was waiting. ] The three generals also share a widely held frustration in the military that they have been fighting for 15\u00a0years without the full support of the country or its civilian leaders. \u201cAll of us who served and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, month after month, year after year, have been too close to the human costs \u2014 our buddies killed in action and our Iraqi and Afghan partners assassinated,\u201d said J. Kael Weston, a State Department official who advised Marine officers in Iraq and Afghanistan and wrote \u201cThe Mirror Test,\u201d a memoir of his service. \u201cBut the policymakers in D.C. have been too far removed from the blood-red tally of war.\u201d When Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013, he spent two weeks zigzagging across the country visiting the parents of Marines killed under his command. Kelly and his two sons have taken part in more than a dozen combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. When his son\u2019s platoon was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, he made weekly and sometimes daily trips to visit his son\u2019s wounded Marines at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Those trips continued after his son was killed in combat. Flynn, who served in Afghanistan and as the Joint Special Operations Command\u2019s senior intelligence officer, has spent as much time deployed to war zones as almost any other general in the Army over the past 15\u00a0years. The disconnect between the generals and Washington also extended to the battlefield, where military officers often felt compelled to describe the messy wars to their troops as battles between good and evil. \u201cWhen you explain to a lance corporal why his best friend got horribly killed and he has to go out there again and again and again, you don\u2019t have time for geo\u00adpolitics,\u201d said retired Lt. Col. John Nagl, an Iraq veteran and counter\u00adinsurgency expert. \u201cYou tell him, \u2018We have to fight the enemy here so that we don\u2019t have to fight them at home.\u2019\u00a0\u201d A big question is how the perspectives of senior military officers, serving in Cabinet-level positions, will influence the direction of a Trump administration. Obama\u2019s deep skepticism of foreign intervention meant that he often served as a brake on discussions about how the United States might respond to hostile developments overseas. Trump has no foreign-policy or military experience to examine for insights into how he might respond, but his campaign posture was animated mainly by the promise of aggression. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely there will be terrorist attacks in the coming years, and I think Trump will feel tremendous pressure to be seen as acting very decisively,\u201d said Dan Byman, a former Middle East analyst at the CIA and a professor at Georgetown University. Trump\u2019s advisers may be quicker to see nefarious intent because of their military experience, he said, but be more cautious about U.S. military intervention or retaliation. Byman cited the example of the Iranian seizure of American sailors shortly before the Iran nuclear deal was signed as an example of an overseas provocation that had the potential to derail broader U.S. policy goals. Trump\u2019s advisers \u201chave a lot of personal experience and might be more inclined to see Iranian hostility as deeply planned,\u201d rather than the act of a rogue faction or a function of chaos, Byman said. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to read things negatively than the Obama administration would have.\u201d \u201cIn significant ways, the chances for limited conflict with Iran go up,\u201d Byman said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean, to me, we bomb them.\u201d Read more: ",

Giuliani, who is currently a vice chairman on the presidential transition team, had been rumored to be in consideration for secretary of state. \"My desire to be in the Cabinet was great but it wasn't that great and he had a lot of terrific candidates and I thought I could play a better role being on the outside and continuing to be his close friend and adviser,\" Giuliani told Fox News' Neil Cavuto. Trump met with Giuliani on Nov. 29., when the matter was discussed. He confirmed to Fox News that he had only been interested in being secretary of state. \"Honestly, the other positions I didn't have an interest in, so that really was the only one I had any real interest in,\" he told Cavuto. Giuliani said he now intends to continue his work in the private sector. He also warned against the selection of Mitt Romney for the position, saying the former Massachusets governor had \"gone over the line\" in previous criticisms he made about Trump. \"I will support [Trump's] decision, but my advice would be that Mitt went a little too far. You can make friends and make up but I would not see him as a candidate for the Cabinet,\" Giuliani told Cavuto. Trump praised Giuliani in a statement, calling him \u201can extraordinarily talented and patriotic American.\u201d \"He is\u00a0and continues to be a close personal friend, and\u00a0as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice\u00a0and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date.\"\u00a0 Reince Priebus, tapped to be Trump\u2019s chief of staff, said that Giuliani was \u201cwas vetted by our team for any possible conflicts and passed with flying colors.\" Advertisement ",

    "text": "Sensation of something in the eye Excessive tearing Doctors can diagnose the infection based on symptoms, or the amoeba can also be identified by a scraping of the eye or by viewing it through a process called confocal microscopy. The infection is treated with one or more prescription medications. In Carthew\u2019s case, antibiotics did not help, so his doctors then performed a corneal transplant. But the infection was so severe they finally had no choice but to remove his eye. Feast your eyes: 8 nutrients to help protect your sight After a year in and out of medical care and adjusting to the loss of the eye, UK news outlets are reporting that Carthew is now getting the word out to help other contact lens wearers avoid the same fate. The parasite is common in nature, where it can be found in lakes and oceans, the soil and even air. It\u2019s also\u00a0 present in tap water . About 85 percent of infections occur in people wearing contacts that got contaminated. Normally, only about one to two cases of infection per million\u00a0 contact lens users \u00a0occur in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But between 2005 and 2007, an acanthamoeba keratitis outbreak infected at least 138 people in 35 states. About 41 million Americans wear\u00a0 contact lenses , and while they are typically a safe and effective alternative to glasses, they can cause serious problems if wearers don\u2019t follow instructions on how to care for them. \u201cWhile patients, especially younger patients, are really excited about being fitted with contact lenses, I stress to them that contact lenses are medical devices that have to be properly fitted, evaluated and that they must adhere to proper contact lens care,\u201d Dr. Andrea Thau of the American Optometric Association (AOA), told CBS News in August when a new CDC report came out warning contact lens users to be vigilant about eye care. Here\u2019s what to do to avoid infections and other vision complications , according to the AOA: Visit your eye doctor every year.\u00a0 Buy your contact lenses from a trusted source.\u00a0 Don\u2019t panic if your lens is \u201clost\u201d in your eye. \u00a0 Don\u2019t ever share contacts. \u00a0 Never use tap water to clean and rinse lenses. \u00a0 Keep your lens case clean. \u00a0 No matter how tired you are, do not sleep in your contacts. Don\u2019t over wear your lenses.\u00a0 You can\u2019t be careful enough , as Carthew learned. A health professional himself, he said he followed contact lens cleaning guidelines, but he said that it\u2019s possible he handled his lenses with unwashed hands at some point, which might have led to his infection. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "<p>The future location of Newtok village, which is having to be relocated to Nelson Island, is seen on July 2, 2015 near Newtok, Alaska.&nbsp;</p> Close Andrew Burton/Getty Images ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- President Barack Obama responded to appeals from Alaska Native villages and gave them more of a say in the federal management of marine resources of the Bering Sea. Obama signed an executive order Friday to create a Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area that will focus \u201clocally tailored\u201d protections on marine resources. The newly created resilience area covers 112,300 square miles and stretches from north of the Bering Strait to north of Bristol Bay. The marshy, tundra landscape surrounding Newtok is seen from a plane on July 6, 2015 outside Newtok, Alaska.\u00a0 Close Andrew Burton/Getty Images The order requires more focused federal consultation with Alaska tribes and 39 communities that line the west coast of Alaska, along with state officials. The area supports what may be the world\u2019s largest annual marine mammal migration of bowhead and beluga whales, Pacific walrus, ice seals and migratory birds. The order also withdraws from federal petroleum leasing 40,300 square miles of Norton Basin and the offshore area around St. Matthew Island, two places already recognized as important marine mammal hunting areas. Kawerak Inc., a regional non-profit corporation that provides social services to Alaska Native Villages along Alaska\u2019s west coast, and the Bering Sea Elders Group in June urged Obama to give villages more of a voice to promote self-determination in management of natural resources and habitat.\u00a0 Residents of coastal villages have seen dramatic changes brought on by climate change, mostly in the form of sea ice that forms later in the winter and disappears sooner in spring. Changes in ice have modified migration patterns of marine mammals, in some cases making hunting uncertain and more dangerous. Loss of sea ice also has opened opportunities for expanded cargo traffic, offshore petroleum drilling, tourism and other commercial activities, changes that that villages may not welcome and that could affect the security of their traditional food from the sea. The executive order establishes a task force with village representation that will consult on federal management activities in the area and work to protect cultural and subsistence activities. Obama\u2019s order elevates Alaska Native comment on projects such as a port access route study nearing completion by the Coast Guard. With increased shipping, the agency is working on vessel traffic control measures through the Bering Strait, the choke point between North America and Asia. The decision would require village comment on expansion of large-scale commercial fishing that could affect subsistence life, such as trawling. Agencies were directed to consider Alaska Native traditional knowledge in their Bering Sea management decisions. Fred Philip, executive director of the Native Village of Kwigillingok, said in a statement that Obama recognizes his people\u2019s need for self-determination and is the first president to require that traditional knowledge and expertise be applied to federal management. \u201cThis is real progress,\u201d he said. Harry Lincoln, a Yupik elder from Tununak, and the chairman of the Bering Sea Elders Group, thanked Obama. \u201cIt is the Native elders\u2019 vision that the northern Bering Sea and the resources that our people rely on be protected because they are the foundation of our culture and way of life,\u201d he said. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott in a joint statement said while they support Bering Strait tribal leaders who worked to provide economic opportunities while protecting resources, they have other concerns. \u201cThe State of Alaska is concerned about any further erosion of our ability to support much needed resource development at a time when the state is grappling with declining oil prices and production,\u201d they said. Messages requesting comment from Alaska\u2019s all-Republican congressional delegation were not immediately returned Friday. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and U.S. Rep. Don Young on Thursday sent a letter to Obama warning of their strong objections to withdrawing any more acreage in the Arctic Ocean north of the Bering Strait, which is projected to hold 23.6 billion barrels of oil. \u201cPresident Obama has canceled lease sales, made permits all but impossible to acquire, and excluded Arctic basins from the next offshore leasing plan,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough damage for one administration.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "\u201cThe default recommendation you\u2019ll get from most security researchers for a messaging app is Signal,\u201d said Joseph Bonneau, a postdoctoral researcher at the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University. \u201cIt\u2019s still the best in the field.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story That said, Signal is not perfect. It lacks some features of other messaging apps, like the ability to send stickers. And during my tests, the service had some glitches. But adding Signal to your folder of messaging apps is a must in an era when technology companies are collecting more personal information and government surveillance may expand. Some people have already cottoned on to this. Signal experienced a 400 percent jump in daily downloads since Mr. Trump won the election, according to Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Open Whisper Systems, the nonprofit that developed Signal. To Mr. Marlinspike, the surge in downloads reflects anxiety among Americans about the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency for personal privacy. \u201cTrump has threatened a lot of people and he\u2019s about to be in control of the most pervasive and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cA lot of people are justifiably concerned about that.\u201d How Signal Stands Out Signal offers end-to-end encryption, meaning a message is scrambled so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient when it is sent from your device, and it remains so when it passes through the app\u2019s server and reaches the recipient. When you initiate a conversation with someone on Signal, you and the recipient exchange so-called cryptographic keys. Only the person who receives your message holds the key to decrypt and read it. That means that if a government agency had a wiretapping order for your Signal messages, Open Whisper Systems would not have the key to decipher the messages and would be unable to comply. Signal\u2019s technology sets the standard for other messaging services, with its protocol being an open-source system that other companies can freely use. WhatsApp, Facebook\u2019s Messenger and Google embedded Signal\u2019s encrypted messaging system into their own apps this year. Even so, security researchers said they preferred Signal over other messaging apps because it was more thorough in protecting users\u2019 privacy. The only information Signal stores about users in its database is the last time someone connected to its server and when a person signed up for Signal. Other messaging apps maintain pieces of personal data on their servers. By contrast, while WhatsApp enables Signal\u2019s full encryption by default in messages, there are caveats. WhatsApp may retain some so-called meta data on conversations, including the phone numbers used in an exchange and the times that the messages were sent, according to the company\u2019s privacy policy . WhatsApp also regularly accesses your phone number and contacts list , so the app can provide an up-to-date list of your contacts who use its service to make it easier to message them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Google Allo, Google\u2019s new messaging app that leverages artificial intelligence, does not enable Signal\u2019s end-to-end encryption in all its messages by default. Google offers full encrypted messaging only in so-called Incognito sessions, a private mode that must be turned on manually. When you\u2019re not chatting in Incognito mode, Google stores your Allo messages on its server. Similarly, Facebook\u2019s Messenger enables end-to-end encryption inside a private chat mode called Secret Conversations . But by default, normal Messenger chats lack that encryption. Even though Signal doesn\u2019t record your information, the app still works across devices, like a desktop computer and a mobile device. Messages and contacts\u2019 data are stored directly on users\u2019 devices and synchronized between them. Let\u2019s say you already use Signal on your iPhone and want to use it to chat on a Mac (Signal is available as a web app for Google\u2019s Chrome browser for desktop computers). To link the desktop app with your iPhone, you would use the iPhone\u2019s camera to scan a bar code on the Mac web app, which links the two devices together. Then, to get your contacts list and conversations to appear on the Mac, the Mac app pulls your contacts list and messages directly from the iPhone via an encrypted channel, according to Mr. Marlinspike. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more work, from our perspective,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than storing all this stuff on a server.\u201d Bugs and Missing Features Signal occasionally runs into glitches, such as when it comes to synchronizing data between computers and smartphones. In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app \u2014 though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later. Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service. Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time; I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad . Mr. Marlinspike said it would support multiple mobile devices eventually. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One last caveat is that Signal isn\u2019t as fun to use as apps like Facebook Messenger, which lets you send stickers and animated GIFs to add color and personality to conversations. Open Whisper Systems said it planned to add these features, noting that GIFs are already supported in the Android version of Signal. Still, this is a trivial issue. I\u2019d choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day. The Bottom Line There is no logical reason to skip using Signal. The app is free for Android and iOS , and for computers it is a free add-on for the Google Chrome browser. Plus, it\u2019s easy to install and so architecturally secure that you can have the confidence to say whatever you want without fear of being spied on. Another benefit is that Open Whisper Systems is a nonprofit that relies on donations and grants, not a business that might eventually have an incentive to share your information with third parties like advertisers. That\u2019s not to say Signal should be your only messaging app. You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters, like work-related conversations. Then for casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones, you could switch to more \u201cfun\u201d apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want. Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends. The app isn\u2019t as popular among consumers as other mainstream messaging apps, so hanging out on Signal can feel lonely. So if you care about your privacy, other than installing Signal today, you should nag everyone you know to join the service, too. A version of this article appears in print on December 8, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: For Online Privacy, Signal Stands Out.

Palin told Entertainment Tonight in an exclusive statement that she is expecting; it will be her second baby with husband Dakota Meyer, the Medal of Honor recipient who fathered her second child, Sailor Grace. Meyer, 28, and Palin, 26, married in June, six\u00a0months after Sailor's birth, following public arguing over the collapse of their\u00a0engagement in 2015, plus paternity and child-support issues. Reports: Bristol Palin marries Medal of Honor recipient But all is good now, according to Palin's blog and Instagram account , where she posts pictures of her family life and calls herself \"a\u00a0proud wife and mother of two beautiful children.\" A former Dancing With the Stars contestant, she also is the author of a memoir. Now the \"Pro-Life, Pro-God, Pro-Guns\" Palin\u00a0is prepping for Baby No. 3. \"We are so excited to announce that our family is expanding!\" the couple said in their ET statement, featuring a picture of Palin, Meyer, Sailor and son Tripp, holding a sign reading \"Baby Meyer Spring 2017.\" \"A springtime baby in the Meyer home and we can't wait!\" the statement said. Bristol Palin calls off wedding to decorated Marine Palin was an unwed pregnant teen with Tripp, soon to turn 8, while mom\u00a0Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, was running as a family-values Republican\u00a0vice-presidential candidate in 2008. Bristol was briefly engaged to Tripp's father, Levi Johnston, but their relationship fell apart after the 2008 campaign; legal wrangling ensued but was later resolved; Bristol shares custody of Tripp with Johnston. A photo posted by Bristol Meyer (@bsmp2) on Jun 19, 2016 at 9:03am PDT Like her mother, Bristol has lost none of her fiery conservatism: Her blog continues to be a feast of roasting liberals and Democrats, condemning abortion and\u00a0praising Donald Trump. Bristol urged her mother to endorse the 2016 GOP presidential candidate, which she subsequently did. Since the election, Sarah Palin has been both critical of some of President-elect Trump's moves and mentioned as a possible member of his cabinet. She is also trying to sell herself as the star of a new\u00a0Judge\u00a0Judy-style courtroom reality show in 2017. ",

    "text": "WATCH Doping Report Details 'Institutional Conspiracy' in Russia 0 Shares Email Russia's sports reputation was ripped apart again Friday when a new report into systematic doping detailed a vast \"institutional conspiracy\" that covered more than 1,000 athletes in over 30 sports and corrupted the drug-testing system at the 2012 and 2014 Olympics. The findings were handed over to the International Olympic Committee, which will be under pressure to take action against the Russians ahead of the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea . \"It is impossible to know just how deep and how far back this conspiracy goes,\" World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren said. \"For years, international sports competitions have unknowingly been hijacked by Russians. Coaches and athletes have been playing on an uneven field. Sports fans and spectators have been deceived.\" McLaren's second and final report said the conspiracy involved the Russian Sports Ministry, national anti-doping agency and the FSB intelligence service, providing further details of state involvement in a massive program of cheating and cover-ups that operated on an \"unprecedented scale\" from 2011-15. The Canadian law professor described the Russian doping program as \"a cover-up that evolved over the years from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalized and disciplined medal-winning strategy and conspiracy.\" The findings confirmed much of the evidence contained in McLaren's first report issued in July, while expanding the number of athletes involved and the overall scope of the cheating program in the sports powerhouse. \"Over 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and Paralympic sport can be identified as being involved in or benefiting from manipulations to conceal positive doping tests,\" McLaren said. The names of those athletes, including 600 summer sports competitors, have been turned over to international federations to pursue disciplinary sanctions, he said. The 144-page report provided further forensic evidence of manipulation of samples at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games, where sealed doping bottles were opened with special tools by intelligence agents and tainted urine was replaced with clean urine to beat the drug-testing system. Russians who won 15 medals in Sochi had their samples tampered with, including two athletes who won four gold medals, McLaren found. The report also found the Russian doping program corrupted the 2012 London Olympics on an \"unprecedented scale.\" While no Russians tested positive at the time of the games, McLaren said the sports ministry gave athletes a \"cocktail of steroids ... in order to beat the detection thresholds at the London lab.\" The report said 15 Russian medal winners in London had been on a list of athletes who had been protected by Russian officials from testing positive before the games. Ten of those athletes have since had their London medals stripped after their samples were retested. Declaring that McLaren's findings detailed \"a fundamental attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and on sport in general,\" the IOC said it would retest samples of all Russian athletes who competed in Sochi and London. IOC President Thomas Bach said any athlete or official involved \"in such as sophisticated manipulation system\" should be banned for life from the Olympics. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was studying the report and denied the country had any state-sponsored doping system. McLaren's first report, issued in July, led WADA to recommend that Russia be excluded from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The IOC rejected calls for an outright ban, allowing international federations to decide which Russians could compete. The IOC has two separate commissions that will study McLaren's report and make recommendations to the executive board for sanctions. While a blanket ban on Pyeongchang would seem unlikely, the IOC has indicated it will impose stiff sanctions. \"We now have detailed information which will allow us to take serious decisions, so let's take them,\" WADA President Craig Reedie, who is also an IOC member, told The Associated Press. \"If you look at the statements made by the IOC, it seems to be pretty likely they will take the appropriate decisions.\" Other findings in the report include: \u2014 Six Russian athletes who won a total of 21 medals at the Sochi Paralympics had their urine samples tampered with. \u2014 Two female hockey players at the Sochi Olympics had samples that contained male DNA. \u2014 Eight Sochi samples had salt content that was physiologically impossible in a healthy human. U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart called McLaren's report \"another staggering example of how the Olympic movement has been corrupted and clean athletes robbed by Russia's state-supported doping system.\" Tygart said the Russian Olympic Committee should be suspended and no international sporting events should be held in Russia until its anti-doping program is in line with global rules. While the report again accused the Russian Sports Ministry, it found no evidence of involvement of the Russian Olympic Committee. The IOC had repeatedly cited the fact that the national Olympic committee was not implicated in defending its decision not to ban the entire Russian team from the Rio Games. McLaren's first report set off bitter divisions and infighting in the Olympic movement and those recriminations have dragged on since the Rio Games. \"I find it difficult to understand why were at not on the same team,\" he said. \"We should all be working together to end doping in sports.\" McLaren opened his investigation earlier this year after Moscow's former doping lab director, Grigory Rodchenkov, told The New York Times that he and other officials were involved in an organized doping program for Russian athletes. He detailed how tainted samples were replaced with clean urine through a concealed \"mouse hole\" in the wall of the Sochi lab. The new report further backs Rodchenkov's account. McLaren's investigation found scratches and other marks left on the doping bottles. WADA investigators were able to recreate the method used by the Russians to pry open the sealed bottle caps. The report also detailed how some Russian samples were diluted with salt or even coffee granules. \"The report has proved without a shadow of a doubt there was organized manipulation of the doping process in Russia,\" Reedie said. \"Now the challenge is for Russia, first of all to admit that the report is worthy, and second to make sure they change their process so this does not happen again.\" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, the former sports minister in charge during the London and Sochi Olympics, said Russia would take legal action in response to the report. It was not clear what course any legal action might take. Asked how he would respond to Russian critics, McLaren said: \"I would say, 'read the report.'\" 0 Shares ",

Jones , USA TODAY 11:49 a.m. EST December 9, 2016 73 Shares \u00a0(Photo: Victoria's Secret/Raffael Dickreuter) Deddeh Howard is holding up to a mirror to the fashion industry. A \"Black Mirror.\" The Liberian-born model-blogger banded together with photographer Raffael Dickreuter to launch\u00a0 \"Black Mirror,\" \u00a0a project that recreates high-profile ad campaigns by brands including Chanel, Calvin Klein, Guess, Gucci, David Yurman, Louis Vuitton and Dolce & Gabbana to highlight the dearth of women of color represented in fashion and the media. For Chanel \u00a0(Photo: Chanel/Raffael Dickreuter) In an emailed statement to USA TODAY, Howard cites\u00a0the 2016 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show as the most recent example of underrepresentation, noting, \"you could see the same pattern you can see at New York Fashion Week or any other famous fashion event: Black girls are almost invisible. There is the odd one here and there, but it always feels like an afterthought.\" Or, a performance of diversity as opposed to actual inclusion. For Howard, who says she's been turned away by modeling agencies that \"already have a black model,\" the industry\u2019s routine devaluation of women of color is \"bizarre.\" \"What do you mean you already have 2-4 black models that looks (sic) like me?\" she captioned a composite of Kendall Jenner\u2019s Calvin Klein ad and her recreation. \"Did you say the same thing to the 50-100 white models you already have? If Kendall Jenner can do it, so can me (sic) and any other race!\" A photo posted by Deddeh Howard (@secretofdd) on Dec 6, 2016 at 11:51pm PST And with the \"Black Mirror\" project, Howard hopes to amplify that message.

    "text": "50 Photos Police lead suspected shooter Dylann Roof into the courthouse in Shelby, North Carolina, on June 18, 2015. Reuters/Jason Miczek CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Dylann Roof hesitated for about 20 seconds when an FBI agent asked him what he was doing on the night nine black church members were killed during Bible study. \u201cUh, I did it,\u201d Roof said in a video recording played for the public for the first time Friday at his death penalty trial. After waiving his rights and about a minute of small talk, the agents pressed Roof gently - asking him exactly what he did. He paused another 30 seconds or so. \u201cI killed them,\u201d Roof said. As he talked more, he chuckled and said, \u201cWell, I killed them, I guess.\u201d Murder trial for accused Charleston church shooter begins The video was shown on the third day of testimony. Roof is accused of opening fire inside a basement room of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17, 2015, just as members of the Bible study closed their eyes for a final prayer. Roof told the agents he didn\u2019t start firing as soon as he entered. \u201cI was sitting there thinking about whether I should do it or not. That\u2019s why I sat there for 15 minutes. I could have walked out,\u201d Roof said. Church surveillance videos indicate Roof was inside closer to 45 minutes. A survivor testified that he was given a Bible and a study guide to follow along with the prayer group. 17 Photos South Carolina church shooting victims Roof, as he has for much of the trial, hardly looked up as the confession played, mostly just shuffling papers in front of him at the defense table. FBI agent Michael Stansbury said he pushed Roof to confess so quickly because he sensed he wanted to talk. \u201cHe was calm. He wasn\u2019t upset,\u201d Stansbury said. Judge rules Dylann Roof mentally comptent to stand trial Roof is charged with 33 federal counts, including hate crimes. His defense has largely conceded that he committed the slayings and has instead focused on trying to spare him the death penalty. On Friday, they asked the judge to allow them to present more evidence about his personality and state of mind, and U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel said he would take up the issue on a case-by-case basis before jurors begin hearing testimony from a witness. If jurors find Roof guilty, they will decide whether he should be put to death or spend the rest of his life in prison. Roof has said he wants to represent himself during that penalty phase of the trial. In the confession, Roof said he left bullets in a magazine so that he could kill himself after the slayings but changed his mind when he didn\u2019t see any police immediately after the shooting. At one point, an agent asked if Roof thought about killing more blacks. \u201cOh no. I was worn out,\u201d Roof said. He said he chose Emanuel in part because it is the oldest black church in the South and that the killing of Trayvon Martin was a turning point in his life. Martin, a young unarmed black man, was killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting. Roof laughs occasionally throughout the questioning. About 45 minutes into it, agents finally tell Roof that he killed nine people. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even that many people in there,\u201d Roof said incredulously. \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d The only other glimpse into Roof\u2019s motivation is a 2,000-word statement he posted online on the afternoon of the shooting and 60 photos he carefully picked from more than 1,000 he had taken, Richardson said. Some of the photos included Roof posing with the Confederate flag. In Roof\u2019s essay, he said he thought blacks were stupid, inferior to whites and violent. Among other things, he wrote, \u201cwe have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

On Friday afternoon, Donald Trump\u2019s transition team announced that longtime loyalist Rudy Giuliani had removed his name from\u00a0consideration for any Cabinet post in the new administration. \u201cBefore I joined the campaign I was very involved and fulfilled by my work with my law firm and consulting firm, and I will continue that work with even more enthusiasm,\u201d Giuliani\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cFrom the vantage point of the private sector, I look forward to helping the President-elect in any way he deems necessary and appropriate.\" Trump said he would call on Giuliani for advice and \u201ccan see an important place for him in the administration at a later date.\" \"Rudy would have been an outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles, but I fully respect and understand his reasons for remaining in the private sector,\" Trump said in a statement. In an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Your World with Neil Cavuto , Giuliani said that he had given notice last month but\u00a0 \"they didn\u2019t accept the letter\u00a0and therefore they wanted to still hold me inconsideration for the state Department.\u201d \u201cThis is a good time to do it, they\u2019re down to the last two, three, four. So, it made sense to just get out of the way,\" Giuliani said about finally convincing the team to let him remove himself from the list of potential nominees to be America's top diplomat.\u00a0 \"Honestly, the other positions I didn\u2019t have an interest in, so that really that was the only one I had any real interest in. But it wasn\u2019t so overwhelming that you know I\u2019m terribly disappointed. I would like to anything I can to help the President-elect. If he had a need he couldn\u2019t fill somewhere I would\u2019ve done it but he has plenty of people that can fill that need, and I am extraordinarily happy in what I do.\" Reince Priebus, Trump's chief of staff, said that Giuliani passed vetting for potential conflicts of interest \"with flying colors.\" Critics had expressed concern about Giuliani's work consulting for foreign governments while he was in the private sector. Giuliani was favored for the post by Trump loyalists who did not like the idea of former Trump critic Mitt Romney getting the nomination.\u00a0Giuliani was one of those who was not in favor of selecting the former Massachusetts governor. \"Well, you know I probably agree with Newt and with Mike Huckabee and a group of other very loyal supporters of President-elect Trump. I though Mitt went over the line in the things that he said about Donald Trump, and the President-elect is going to make his decision, I will support that decision, but you know my advice would be Mitt went just a little too far. You can make friends and make up, but I would not see him as a candidate for the Cabinet,\" he said on Fox. Giuliani said his choice for the post would be former U.N. ambassador John Bolton. ",

By Renae Merle , Ylan Q. Mui and Philip Rucker December 9 at 2:00 PM Follow @renaemerle Follow @ylanmui Follow @PhilipRucker Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs veteran, is reported to be Trump's pick to head the National Economic Council. Here's what you need to know about him. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name\u00a0a top Goldman Sachs executive, Gary Cohn, to lead the National Economic Council, handing the Wall Street veteran significant sway over his administration's economic policy. The council includes the heads of various departments and agencies and works within the administration to coordinate economic policy. As director, Cohn would be in position to advise\u00a0Trump as he attempts to fulfill some of his chief campaign promises, including lowering corporate taxes and rethinking U.S. trade policy. Trump intends to formally name Cohn to the post, which does not require Senate confirmation,\u00a0but additional details remained unclear, according to a transition official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was not authorized to speak publicly. The expected appointment was first reported by NBC News. In\u00a0Cohn, Trump would once again be picking\u00a0a veteran of a\u00a0New York investment bank\u00a0that he repeatedly denounced during the campaign. During the campaign Trump argued\u00a0that Goldman held \u201ctotal control\u201d over both Democrat Hillary Clinton and GOP rival Ted Cruz and he even released a television ad that flashed an image of Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and warned of a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that was robbing American workers. But Trump has relied on several Goldman alums for key positions, so far. Steven Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of the bank, is nominated to be the next Treasury secretary, and Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist, worked on mergers and acquisition deals for Goldman Sachs.\u00a0Hedge fund manger\u00a0Anthony Scaramucci began his career at the New York bank and has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers on his presidential transition. [ Trump expected to name financier Steve Mnuchin to Treasury ] Cohn met with the Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence at Trump Tower at the end of November, and he would be, by far, the highest-ranking Goldman Sachs executive slated to serve in the Trump administration.\u00a0Cohn, president and chief operating officer of the bank, was\u00a0widely viewed as heir apparent at Goldman Sachs, poised to become CEO when Blankfein retired. He has been at the bank since 1990. As director of the NEC, Cohn would become Trump's chief economic policy adviser.\u00a0President Clinton established the National Economic Council in the early 1990s, elevating its first director, Robert Rubin -- also a former Goldman banker -- into an influential adviser responsible for overseeing the creation of policies to address the administration\u2019s core economic pledges of job growth and deficit reduction. The post has wielded significant power ever since, with Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers serving in the job under President Obama. Currently, Jeff Zients, formerly head of the Office of Management and Budget, holds the position. \"The NEC director is supposed to ensure there is a serious process for the president to make decisions after hearing the competing views of all relevant economic cabinet members in a fair and coordinated way -- as opposed to governing based on ad hoc information or who was the last person to whisper in their ear,\u201d said Gene Sperling, who served in the role under both Clinton and Obama. \u201cThere is no question Trump would benefit from empowering that type of deliberative decision-making process in his White House.\" For more than 20 years, Cohn has run several Goldman Sachs' businesses, including bond and commodities trading. Cohn\u00a0built a reputation for a \u201cno holds barred\u201d approach at the bank, said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA. \u201cHe tells it like how he sees it and should hold his own with blue collar and white collar people alike.\u201d [ How Goldman Sachs made it back into Washington\u2019s inner circle ] In news inteviews, Cohn has struck a moderate tone on controversial issues such as corporate tax inversion and deregulation. At a conference sponsored by the New York Times last year, he argued for keeping U.S. businesses onshore by creating a \u201creally competitive environment.\u201d He also appeared to take a softer stance on Trump\u2019s campaign promises to roll back the sweeping financial reforms known as the Dodd-Frank Act that were instituted under Obama and reinstate a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking. \"I do think that part of the regulation we've gone through has inhibited our ability to transmit that capital,\u201d Cohn told CNBC last month. \u201cOn the other hand, remember U.S. banks today are the strongest banks in the world.... that's a huge competitive advantage for U.S. banks and I don't want to lose that.\" Cohn has been a major donor to both parties, according to records from OpenSecrets.org. He supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during his presidential bid and he contributed $33,400 last year to the National Republican Congressional Committee. During the 2008 election cycle, he donated $55,500 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign committee and supported the campaigns of both President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Cohn's struggle with dyslexia was featured in Malcolm Gladwell's \u00a0\"David And Goliath.\"\u00a0Teachers and classmates wrote him off as an \"idiot,\" Cohn told Gladwell, but he managed to make his way through high school and college. After graduation, he took a job selling window frames and aluminum siding for U.S.\u00a0Steel. But, Cohn has said, he had a passion for financial markets. During an\u00a0impromptu visit to New York, Cohn followed a man exiting the commodities exchange center at\u00a0Four World Trade Center onto an elevator. He then offered to share\u00a0a cab to LaGuardia Airport with the banker. By the end of the car ride, Cohn had the man's number and weeks after that a job on Wall Street. \"The one trait in a lot of dyslexic people I know is that by the time we got out of college, our ability to deal with failure was very highly developed,\" Cohn told Gladwell . \"And so we look at most situations and see much more of the upside than the downside. It doesn't faze us. I've thought about it many times, I really have, because it defined who I am. I wouldn't be where I am today without my dyslexia. I never would have taken that first chance.\" business ",

But is the hit series about a zombie apocalypse starting to show signs of its own mortality? After ratings zoomed for the Oct. 23 season opener, which revealed Negan's victims (including fan favorite Glenn, played by Steven Yeun), they've been on a steady downward spiral in the six episodes that have aired since. A huge 21.5 million viewers \u2014 its second-biggest total yet \u2014 tuned in for that cliffhanger reveal, with 7-day delayed viewing counted. But in the weeks since, the show has lost more than 5 million viewers, or a quarter of its audience. And Dead is on track to have its lowest-rated season since spring 2013. \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 recap: Enough already Among young adults, Dead remains the No. 1 show on TV, broadcast or cable. \u00a0And on its own, the drop is consistent with declining ratings for a few other big hits: Fox's Empire is down 27% this season, and early NFL ratings took a dive. But unlike basic-cable rival FX, which has a growing array of acclaimed and popular series, AMC is uniquely dependent on this one much bigger hit, which airs just 16 episodes a year. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Negan and Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes in 'The Walking Dead' \u00a0(Photo: Gene Page, AMC) For that reason, the double-digit declines are worrisome for securities analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. With ratings dropping at \"an alarming pace, we are becoming increasingly pessimistic about AMC Networks' probability of sustaining the momentum of its biggest show,\" he wrote in a Dec. 7 report. And the network's newer series, including ratings disappointments such as Feed the Beast, Preacher and Halt and Catch Fire, \"have not resonated with viewers or critics the same way that AMC's holy trinity (of) The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad and Mad Men once did.\" Why the tumble for Dead, whose spinoff Fear the Walking Dead has fallen even more sharply? Theories abound: Shows naturally decline with age. Some favorite characters are dead. Fans on Twitter don't seem to like Negan much. And the show has tried to top itself with escalating levels of violence, which even Morgan bemoaned in an interview with USA TODAY: \"I don\u2019t know if you need to see the closeup gore of it all,\" he said of his season-opening\u00a0killing spree. \"It\u2019s a lot.\" Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) spells the death of fan favorite Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) in 'The Walking Dead' \u00a0(Photo: Gene Page, AMC) Still, the enduring popularity of a genre show is impressive to Billie Gold of ad firm Dentsu Aegis' Amplifi: \u00a0\"It\u2019s a pretty amazing feat that their ratings have stayed as strong as they have,\" she says. And while AMC \"has a lot invested\" in the franchise, with the spinoff and a talk show, it's \"considered a holy grail of audience in terms of sheer numbers and social engagement.\" (Mad Men remained fairly steady during its run, while Breaking Bad's\u00a0fifth and final season was by far its most popular). AMC says digital viewership \u2014 a combined total of 13 million views this season \u2014 \u00a0is up nearly 50% from last fall, though those views generate less ad revenue. \u00a0 And there's no sign of the show ending anytime soon. However big the drop, \"for a season-seven cable drama to be in its fifth consecutive year at number one is remarkable, and speaks to the passion and dedication of the fan community around this show,\" says AMC president Charlie Collier, in a statement. \"The Walking Dead has never been more alive.\" 12 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2huELDx ",

(Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) LOS ANGELES \u00a0\u2014 Actor/comedian T.J. Miller, star of Silicon Valley and the just-opened Office Christmas Party, was arrested early Friday after a car-service driver accused him of battery, Los Angeles police say. Miller's arrest came two days before he will host the Critics' Choice Awards in Santa Monica on Sunday. Officer Drake Madison says Miller was arrested around 1\u00a0a.m. Friday. The accusing driver wanted Miller booked under a citizen's arrest. Madison did not have additional details about what led to the dispute between the driver and Miller. TMZ reported that Miller and the driver got into an argument about President-elect Donald Trump, and Miller allegedly\u00a0slapped the driver in the head when they arrived at Miller's home. Kate Gorney and T.J.

Madison says Miller was released on his own recognizance and was ordered to appear in court on Jan. 9. Joey Berlin, president of the organization that bestows the Critics' Choice Awards, says Miller will remain the host for Sunday's show. \"We look forward to seeing what he's going to do on Sunday,\" Berlin said. A call to Miller's manager was not immediately returned. Miller is best known for his role as Erlich Bachman in the quirky Silicon Valley, in\u00a0which he plays the owner of a home that serves as headquarters for a fledgling start-up.

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats on Friday evening appeared to reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown over a dispute on health care benefits for coal miners, moving toward a vote on a House-passed measure to fund operations through April. The party\u2019s willingness to take the nation to the brink of a government shutdown signaled its intention, just weeks after their election drubbing in Rust Belt states, to quickly leverage the sorts of issues that propelled Donald J. Trump to victory. The House on Thursday passed a short-term bill that would keep the government open through late April and extend through that month health care benefits for retired miners who were set to lose them at the end of the year. But Democrats wanted those benefits to last for a year, and slowed down voting on the measure with the threat of rejecting the bill. Late Friday afternoon, Republicans and Democrats agreed to take up the issue again in January. \u201cWe\u2019re going to provide the votes to make sure we don\u2019t shut down,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the incoming minority leader, said on the Senate floor Friday evening. \u201cThere are so many people who want to stand with the miners. We never intended to shut down the government.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Joe Manchin III , Democrat of West Virginia, who led the charge on behalf of the miners, said that senators from both parties had campaigned on giving a \u201cfair shake\u201d to working people. \u201cIt\u2019s either put up or shut up,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked them to vote for you because of this reason. Now you have a chance to show them that\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d Photo Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, led the charge on behalf of miners.

On Friday morning, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, urged his Democratic colleagues to approve the spending bill, warning that without it, the miners would lose their health care at the end of the month. \u201cThis is a good time to take yes for an answer,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. He pledged to work to prevent the expiration of the miners\u2019 health care coverage next year and blamed Senate Democrats for contributing to the coal industry\u2019s plight in the first place. Democrats\u2019 flirtation with a government shutdown \u2014 the sort of intransigence adopted by Republicans in the recent past \u2014 indicates their willingness to use the few tools available to them to block legislation next year, when possible, and to bludgeon Republicans with populist issues on which they share common ground with Mr. Trump. Mr. Manchin had furiously worked the phones on Friday morning to see how many senators would join him in voting against a procedural measure to advance the short-term spending bill. But he found that many senators, like those in the House, wanted to avoid a shutdown. While Democrats now have the opposition party mantle that Republicans held through much of the Obama presidency, the dynamics are different. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For instance, while Mr. McConnell distanced himself in the past from Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas when they sought to disrupt bills, Mr. Schumer stood with Mr. Manchin on Thursday night to call for the miner provisions. Mr. McConnell did not prevent the government shutdown of 2013, but in later years he worked harder to stem disputes before they got that far.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Hillary Clinton\u2019s election defeat had many pundits declaring the Clinton era finally over. But a series of meetings with key Democratic donors and leaders \u2013 combined with still-fawning press coverage and even a quirky social media project driven by a longtime aide \u2013 are raising questions about what's next. A return to the speaking circuit? Advocacy work? Assuming the role of elder stateswoman? Or even, a 2020 presidential run?\u00a0 \u201cI think if she wants to run again, and my guess is she probably does, because they always do, then yes I think she\u2019s doing a good job laying the groundwork,\u201d Brad Bannon, Democratic strategist and CEO of Bannon Communications Research, told FoxNews.com.\u00a0 A third presidential run -- after two grueling campaigns that both ended in defeat to a rival political sensation who captured the imagination of voters -- could be a stretch for the former secretary of state, senator and first lady.\u00a0 But after a brief period of reclusion, Clinton is slowly but surely appearing more in public, and in ways that indicate a political and public future of some sort.\u00a0 One clue that her team wants to keep its cachet with millennials is the viral sensation surrounding pictures of her spotted by her Chappaqua home -- in the woods, at the grocery store and elsewhere. The Twitter account @HRCInTheWild \u00a0was created to track those appearances; the account was set up by longtime Clinton aide Adam Parkhomenko. Parkhomenko is no random staffer \u2013 he created the Ready for Hillary PAC to draft her to run and was director of grassroots engagement for the 2016 campaign. His Twitter account is littered with personal letters from Clinton and photos with the candidate. Parkhomenko is such a significant player in ClintonWorld that in January The Washington Post published a lengthy profile of him. \"When you're knocked down, get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't go on.\" -Hillary pic.twitter.com/53JRNck89B \u2014 HRC In The Wild \uf332 (@HRCintheWild) December 5, 2016 Parkhomenko told FoxNews.com the Twitter account has nothing to do with the campaign, which he says wound down in November. He says instead it was a request from supporters and he happily obliged. \u201cThese photos have put a huge smile on her supporters' face and I think it has really pushed them to get back up and keep going after a devastating presidential loss. It has been incredible to watch the account grow,\u201d he said. If, as Parkhomenko says, it is a response to supporters, then it has been wildly successful. The account, which had only been up for a few weeks, has over 27,000 followers on Twitter as well as countless likes and retweets, as well as corresponding accounts on Facebook and Instagram.\u00a0 Saturday Night Live even did a light sketch on the \u201cin the wild\u201d phenomenon. Meanwhile, days after Vanity Fair described Clinton\u2019s appearances a move \u201cfrom Presidential Candidate to Wandering Folk Hero,\u201d the New York Times used similar language Sunday, calling her \u201ca new folk hero in a familiar face\u201d for some Americans. \u201cAfter the knock-down, drag-out battle of the campaign, the images suggest she has, unexpectedly, found peace,\u201d the piece reads.\u00a0 Clinton indeed continues to enjoy favorable press coverage despite her upset defeat. Even as Time magazine declared Donald Trump its person of the year this week, the write-up on Clinton in the same edition compared her to \u201can American Moses.\u201d Clinton's team also has not exited the limelight quietly.\u00a0 Campaign manager Robby Mook last week blamed the loss in part on FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to re-open the probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Meanwhile, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s director of communication, accused Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway of having given a platform to white supremacists, and followed it up with a barbed op-ed in The Washington Post , calling on the Trump campaign to \u201cown up\u201d to how it won. (Conway told \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday that \"a little self-awareness would do for a team that is blaming everybody but themselves.\") Clinton herself drew attention Wednesday to what she called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of so-called \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 which some pundits and supporters have claimed contributed to her defeat. It also was blamed for a gunman visiting a D.C. pizza restaurant over the weekend looking for answers on a Clinton-related conspiracy theory.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences,\" Clinton said in a speech at the Capitol. CLINTON DECRIES FAKE NEWS IN CAPITOL SPEECH Clinton was in D.C. to pay tribute to retiring Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. While Reid is stepping down from his role, he is likely to remain as an elder statesman whose 2020 endorsement would hold value. Additionally, The New York Post reported Wednesday that Clinton is set to throw a party next week to thank her millionaire donors.\u00a0 Some strategists believe the actions may point to at least a consideration of a run in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s the Potomac Fever -- if you get close to being president, you can\u2019t get the smell off, and you\u2019re always going to want to do it again,\u201d Bannon said.\u00a0 Parkhomenko said whatever Clinton chooses to do, \u201cher supporters will be there to support her and help amplify her message. As we can see, she never sits still and I can't imagine she will not remain active in whatever she way she thinks she can continue to have the most impact for good.\u201d\u00a0 Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote, which supporters have been touting, gives her camp an argument that Clinton at least wasn\u2019t rejected by voters in a McGovern-like defeat, and if Trump\u2019s presidency stumbles, a do-over of 2016 may appeal to some. However, Bannon warned such a call could turn off many Democratic Party activists. \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure Clinton is thinking that way, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cWith both [Vice President Joe] Biden and Clinton, they\u2019re going to be pretty old by then, and what I\u2019m hearing in conversations I\u2019ve had with people in the Democratic Party is everyone really wants a new face.\u201d Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was part of a group of coal state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of health benefits for coal miners in the stopgap spending bill. Alex Brandon/AP Senate Democrats have dropped their objections to a short-term-funding bill that would keep the government running and avert a shutdown. Passage of that bill is expected Friday night. Timing is still unclear, and many Democrats are expected to oppose it, but the measure is on track to pass prior to a midnight deadline. That means Congress will adjourn for the year with a final, familiar act: passing a short-term-funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This measure's funding runs out in April. Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners. Retired Coal Miners At Risk Of Losing Promised Health Coverage And Pensions The stopgap includes $45 million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia's Joe Manchin, wanted a full-year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months. \"Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"But we'll be back at it in April, and I think it's highly unlikely that we'll take it away.\" With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday \u2014 and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations \u2014 Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown. Article continues after sponsorship The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April 28. Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly $1 trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs. The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year 2017 spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year. Since the spending bill is a must-pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump's defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis. Obama Orders Sweeping Review Of International Hacking Tied To U.S. Elections For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven-year cooling-off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in 2013. Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process. The measure also includes just over $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. An additional $4.1 billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew. Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some $170 million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children. Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as $352 million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and $500 million to states to combat the opioid epidemic. The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since 2010. ",

Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks about the 2016 at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. on Dec.\u00a09, 2016. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Friday morning described Washington D.C. as \"Disneyland on the Potomac\" during a panel appearance in the nation's capital, then apologized because, \"I don't want to insult Disneyland.\" But though Emanuel said through his spokesman Adam Collins later Friday that he had spent enough time in D.C. and had no interest in becoming DNC chair, the mayor's assurance in diagnosing a way forward for Democrats nationally showed why some commentators have suggested he might be a good fit for the role. Speaking at the Brookings Institution , Emanuel suggested that Hillary Clinton 's campaign had failed because it paid insufficient concern to voters' economic concerns. He argued that Democrats could use social inclusion as a \"wedge\" issue to win over suburban supporters. \"What is it about what we did when we won and what we didn't do when we lost?\" he asked, before answering his own question by adding, \"I'm all for a socially inclusive message but not at the exclusion of an economically robust message.\" The Democrats' campaign had focused on questions of Donald Trump 's \"character and temperament\" and not enough on economics, he said, describing Trump's victory as a reaction to the failure of the political system to deal with voters' \"core insecurities.\" While Collins said that Emanuel will not put his name forward as a potential DNC chair (contenders include Minnesota U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison , South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley), Chicago Magazine's Carol Felsenthal on Monday argued that both Emanuel and the Democrats would be well served by his return from Chicago to national politics.` ",

For decades, some Malibu property owners have made it hard for the public to reach public beaches, but the California Coastal Commission is taking action against such efforts. Dan Weikel For decades, some Malibu property owners have made it hard for the public to reach public beaches. On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission fined two of those property owners more than $5.1\u00a0million for denying surfers, sand castle builders, kite flyers, sun bathers, yoga enthusiasts\u00a0and other beachgoers access to the sand that is theirs by state law. In one of those decisions, the commission had\u00a0battled for nine years with\u00a0Dr. Warren M. Lent and his wife, Henny, before unanimously approving\u00a0Thursday\u2019s cease-and-desist order for the couple and fining\u00a0them about $4.2 million for diverting a public easement to private use at an expensive oceanfront rental they own at Las Flores Beach. Commissioners described the Lent case as \u201cvery egregious\u201d and a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of state law because the couple had long refused a commission request to remove an unauthorized gate, fence, stairway and deck that blocked an easement required by a coastal development permit issued to a previous owner. The fine was far more than the $950,000 recommended by the agency\u2019s staff. \u201cThis represents an attitude we often see in Malibu \u2014 that the shore is our private backyard,\u201d said Commissioner Mark Vargas, who made the motion at Thursday\u2019s hearing for a $4.185-million fine. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they are dragging this on as long as they can and damaging\u00a0the public\u2019s right to use the beach.\u201d A gate on the Lent property blocks public access to the beach in Malibu. californiacoastline.org A gate on the Lent property blocks public access to the beach in Malibu. A gate on the Lent property blocks public access to the beach in Malibu. (californiacoastline.org) In the second action, commissioners\u00a0approved an amicable settlement with the owners of the Malibu Beach Inn at Carbon Beach, which is known as \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Beach.\u201d \u00a0 Under the agreement, owners Simon and Daniel Mani, who are West Hollywood real estate investors,\u00a0must build two long-required stairways to the sand, install a $425,000\u00a0signalized crosswalk near the hotel and pay $200,000 in fines as well as $300,000 to a local\u00a0conservation agency. The penalties are the first that the powerful land use agency has imposed on property owners for violating beach access provisions of the California Coastal Act. State legislators granted the commission the authority\u00a0to level fines in 2014. Because of the deterrent effect, the agency usually resolves access violations\u00a0far short of imposing a financial penalty.\u00a0 The commission\u2019s decisions\u00a0will eventually provide much-needed access points to two Malibu beaches\u00a0that have\u00a0long been walled off to the public\u00a0by tightly spaced\u00a0homes. This represents an attitude we often see in Malibu\u2014that the shore is our private backyard. \u2014 Coastal Commissioner Mark Vargas Agency officials say that 19 of\u00a029 public easements for beach access in Malibu remain closed. Some property owners and residents  have tried to deter the public from going to the beach by hiring security guards , putting up fake no-parking signs, painting curbs red\u00a0and locking or blocking access ways. In the Lent case, the commission issued a coastal development permit in 1979 for the construction of a two-story house at 20802 Pacific Coast Highway. According to commission records, the original owner obstructed the required easement with a gate, fence, private stairway and a deck without permits. At the time, the commission had no enforcement plan or compliance officers to make sure permit recipients complied with conditions. Agency officials said the Lents bought the house in 2002 and have knowingly refused to remove the obstacles to correct the violations since they were notified by the commission in 2007. Under the law, the current property owner is responsible for fixing access permit violations. Commission officials said  the couple made money at the public\u2019s expense by, in effect, converting the easement to private use.

A beachgoer walks along Carbon Beach in Malibu, also known as \"Billionaires' Beach.\" The Malibu Beach Inn is seen in the left background. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) For years, the couple rented the house out to vacationers for about $1,000 a night and advertised on real estate websites\u00a0that the \u201cromantic, gorgeous\u201d property has\u00a0access to a private beach. According to the case, the Lents\u00a0spent nine years arguing against the removal of the obstructions, saying they never installed them and never desired to keep the public out.\u00a0 \u201cWe were not trying to block the easement, but trying in good faith to resolve the situation,\u201d Lent,  a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, told the commission. Alan Block, the Lents\u2019 attorney, said fines were not appropriate because the couple inherited the violations. He added that his clients were willing to pay a $100,000 fine and remove the obstacles. Commission officials say they sent some 30 warning letters to the Lents and repeatedly discussed the matter with the couple or their attorneys but could not reach an agreement.\u00a0They added that the easement was feasible and ready to be opened except for the Lents\u2019 constant refusal to remove the gate, fence, stairs and deck.

(California Coastal Commission) The nine-year fight with the Lents involved several government agencies, said Commissioner Mary Shallenberger.\u00a0\u201cThe public lost during that time while the private property owner gained.\u201d According to commission records, \u00a0the Malibu Beach Inn involved the owners\u2019 failure to build two public stairways at an adjacent state beach parking lot that was required by a coastal development permit issued in January 1988. The permit allowed the original owners, Marlin Miser and Martin Cooper,\u00a0to build the 47-room Malibu Beach Inn at 22878 Pacific Coast Highway\u00a0at Carbon Beach near the Malibu Pier. Records show that Miser and Cooper never built the stairway. Neither did Hollywood moguls David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg\u00a0after they bought the inn in April 2005. They received a violation notice from the\u00a0commission in 2007 after applying for a coastal development permit to remodel the hotel. Agency records show that the violations were not resolved by the time Geffen and Katzenberg sold the inn to the Mani Brothers Real Estate Group in May 2015 for $80 million. When the commission learned of the sale, it advised the owners of the\u00a0permit violations and they and their attorneys worked with the agency to reach a settlement.

Trump said Giuliani removed his name from consideration on Nov. 29 for a position in the administration. Giuliani has advocated to become the top U.S. diplomat , adding to the drama surrounding Trump's deliberations over the secretary of state position. Trump had a well-publicized dinner with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Nov. 29 as well. \"This is not about me; it is about what is best for the country and the new administration,\" Giuliani said in a statement. Giuliani had been a committed member of Trump's campaign and served as his attack dog against opponents. He was vocal in calls to bring Hillary Clinton up on charges for her use of a private email server \u2014 which the FBI deemed was not a criminal action. Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far Giuliani will remain a vice chairman of the presidential transition team, and then is expected to return to his law firm and the private sector. \"I will always be appreciative of his 24/7 dedication to our campaign after I won the primaries and for his extremely wise counsel,\" Trump said. \"He is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date.\" When Giuliani's name was first floated as a secretary of state pick, there were some who raised concerns of his potential conflicts of interest including his work for foreign governments that made him millions of dollars. White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus, in the statement announcing the decision, sought to head off this charge as a reason that Giuliani removed his name from consideration. Preibus said the former mayor \"was vetted by our team for any possible conflicts of interest and passed with flying colors.\" Phil McCausland ",

That mission, however, never would have happened without Katherine Johnson. Johnson, one of NASA's first black female employees, was one of the mathematicians who verified the computer's calculations that ensured Glenn's orbit was even possible. Upon Glenn's request, she was the only black woman in the control room during his launch. In 1960s Jim Crow America, Johnson and her two African-American female colleagues, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, were called the \"colored computers.\" Their remarkable story will be told in the upcoming film 'Hidden Figures' set to be released on Christmas Day. \"I read the script and I just remember initially being angry,\" actress Taraji Henson, who plays Johnson in the film, told NBC News. \"Here we have these women who changed the course of America, the history of this nation and we don't know about them.\" Johnson, now 98, is the last living member of the unsung trio who forever changed the trajectory of American space exploration. Growing up in West Virginia, she said numbers were always on her mind. \"I counted everything,\" Johnson told NBC News. \"I'd count plates when I washed dishes. I counted steps from church.\" Johnson graduated college at just 18 years old and went into teaching, the only field open to hiring black women at the time. Johnson still had a dream: to work at NASA. In 1953, at the age of 35, she was hired as one of the agency's first black female recruits. \"When she walked into the control center, she was the only black,\" Charles Bolden, current NASA administrator, told NBC News. \"They thought she was the maid.\" Katherine G. Johnson, a NASA mathematician, receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom from United States President Barack Obama during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC. The Medal is the highest US civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the US, to world peace, or to cultural or significant public or private endeavors. REX Shutterstock / AP Bolden, who himself is NASA's first black administrator, called Johnson a role model. In November 2015, President Obama awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, for her contributions to the advancement of the country's space program. A trailblazer for women of color in the field, Johnson's story will soon no longer be hidden from history. Rehema Ellis ",

Breitbart News on Thursday excoriated Trump for tasking fast food CEO Andy Puzder to run the Department of Labor, accusing the president-elect of putting foreign labor ahead of American workers. Trump's senior adviser, Steve Bannon, was CEO of the conservative news website before leading the Republican's campaign operation. \"Trump Expected to Tap Labor Secretary Who Prefers Foreign Labor to American Workers,\" the article's headline read. \"It remains to be seen whether Puzder will abandon his former open borders positions on these issues and will take up Trump's pro-American worker platform on trade and immigration, which won him the election,\" the article added. Numbers USA, a group that has taken a hard stance against undocumented immigrants, also expressed disappointment over Trump's pick. \"President-elect Trump campaigned \u2014 and won the election \u2014 on promises of boosting American workers wages and job opportunities by reducing excessive immigration,\" Roy Beck, the group's president, said in a statement. \"It is disconcerting to see that someone with a history of public statements in favor of immigration expansionism, including Gang-of-Eight-style legislation, has been appointed to head the department that is supposed to protect American workers from unfair foreign labor competition.\" Play ",

Donald Trump joined Republican Louisiana Senate candidate John Kennedy at a get-out-the-vote rally in Baton Rouge this afternoon, arriving almost two hours late. Louisiana is holding a runoff election on Saturday between Kennedy and Democrat Foster Campbell. Trump began by speaking of how Louisiana first taught him that the system he won was rigged. \"So I came down on a Friday night to a massive hangar. The place was absolutely -- thousands and thousands of people. I think 24,000, 25,000 people, and I left and I said, you know, I think I'm going to win this state and I won the state easily, right?\" he said. \"And then I checked on the delegates, and the delegates were -- I didn't have as many as people I beat, and then I said this system is crooked.\u201d He went on to praise Kennedy. \u201cTomorrow we need you to go to the polls and send John Kennedy to the United States Senate, and that's why I'm down here. That's why I'm here. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a good guy, No. 1, he's a good person. And if he doesn't win, I have got myself a problem in Washington because, you know, we have -- it's pretty close. It's pretty close. We need John in Washington not only for the vote. We need him for leadership and everything else, but if you go there, we're going to win.\u201d Trump dispelled rumors that he may not run for re-election, intimating that he would run again. \"Hey, I don't need your vote anymore, but I'm telling you I'm very good at that. I don't need your vote. Can you imagine that? Four years I'll need your vote.\u201d Before Trump headed to Louisiana he held meetings in New York. House Speaker Paul Ryan convened with the president-elect there this morning, his first meeting with Trump at Trump Tower. Ryan told reporters upon leaving Trump Tower that he had a \"very exciting meeting.\" He did not take any questions from the press. \"We had a great meeting to talk about our transition,\" Ryan said. \"We\u2019re very excited about getting to work and hitting the ground running in 2017 to put this country back on track.\" Trump is to close out the day with a thank-you tour rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that begins at 7 p.m. ET. He'll be joined by his pick to head the U.S. Department of Education, Betsy DeVos , a Michigan billionaire and charter school advocate. Michigan was the last state Trump visited on Election Day before heading back to New York. The Great Lakes State's results were not certified until Nov. 28 -- nearly three weeks after the Nov. 8 election, and the final count was exceptionally close. Trump won Michigan by a 10,704-vote margin over Democrat Hillary Clinton out of a total of nearly 4.8 million votes cast. A statewide vote recount of the presidential vote that was underway for three days at the request of Green Party candidate Jill Stein was cancelled Wednesday when a federal judge upheld a lower court ruling that Stein didn't meet the state's standard to request a recount. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will continue the thank-you tour next week with planned visits to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

    "text": "Texas attorney general drops a great big Yuletide truth bomb on school district By Todd Starnes Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Lucy, Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Linus in scene from tv special \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\" \u00a0(AP) Christmas in the Lone Star state has no greater defender than Attorney General Ken Paxton. So when he read my column about a middle school in Killeen that tried to censor the true meaning of Christmas, he decided it was time to jingle somebody\u2019s bells. First, a quick refresher on the back story: A staffer at Patterson Middle School was told she had to remove a poster depicting a scene from the cherished holiday classic, \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas.\u201d Click here to join America's most popular Conservative Christian Facebook page! \u00a0 The door-length poster featured Linus, a scrawny tree and that beautiful recitation of the true meaning of Christmas. \u201cFor unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord. That\u2019s what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown,\u201d Linus said. Dedra Shannon\u2019s poster was well-received among the staff and students \u2013 but a few days later she was told by the principal that she should either have to remove the religious references or remove the entire poster. Linus could stay but the Baby Jesus had to go. Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives! \u201cShe said my poster is an issue of separation of church and state,\u201d Ms. Shannon told me. \u201cShe said the poster had to come down because it might offend kids from other religions or those who do not have a religion.\u201d Ms. Shannon refused to compromise her religious beliefs and ultimately removed the poster. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave Linus and the Christmas tree without having the dialogue. That\u2019s the whole point of why it was put up.\u201d The incident proves that public school tolerance can only be achieved by being intolerant towards Christians. But it turns out the principal may have inadvertently broken the 2013 \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d law. That law stipulates no school official in Texas can silence a Biblical reference to Christmas. \u201cI am proud to have voted for the Merry Christmas law in 2013, when I was a member of the legislature,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cWe passed that law precisely because of this type of discrimination against people of faith.\u201d Paxton minced no words in describing what happened in that hallway at Patterson Middle School. \u201cThis is an attack on religious liberty and a violation of the First Amendment and state law,\u201d he said. \u201cI am calling on the school board of the Killeen ISD to immediately reverse their unlawful decision.\u201d For the past several days I\u2019ve been reaching out to the school district \u2013 but so far the superintendent has not returned my messages. The school board has a long history of standing up for religious liberty. Terry Delano, president of the school district\u2019s board of trustees, told me they voted to change the name of \u201cWinter Break\u201d to \u201cChristmas Break.\u201d And last year they defied the Freedom From Religion Foundation\u2019s demand to cease praying before meetings. The school district also ignored the Department of Education\u2019s demand that they open all bathrooms to the opposite gender. \u201cThese strong stances for Christianity and morality often go unreported and unnoticed, but they represent important victories in a time when our culture seems to be rotting in a cesspool,\u201d Mr. Delano wrote to me. It sounds as if the good people of Killeen are being well-served by the school board and I\u2019m certain they will resolve this incident at the middle school \u2013 whether it was intentional or a misunderstanding. Either way, Attorney General Paxton dropped a great big Yuletide truth bomb on the Killeen Independent School District: Don\u2019t mess with Texas and don\u2019t mess with Christmas.

That first case, announced Nov. 28, was a woman who lives in Brownsville, a town located on the Mexico border. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Friday that the new cases were identified in tests conducted after her infection was uncovered. Health officials are still investigating, but say the additional infections were likely also acquired in Brownsville, near her home. Health officials say the additional people were likely infected before mosquito control efforts intensified in the area. None of those infected are pregnant.

    "text": "<p>Ronald Bert Smith Jr. is seen in an undated picture released by the Alabama Department of Corrections in Montgomery, Alabama.</p> Close U.S. Alabama Department of Corrections/Handout via REUTERS ATMORE, Ala. --\u00a0Lawyers for an Alabama inmate who was put to death Thursday \u00a0night say movements he made demonstrate that he wasn\u2019t anesthetized during the execution.\u00a0 Alabama inmate Robert Bert Smith Jr. was executed using an injection of the drug midazolam . Execution witnesses reported that the 45-year-old prisoner heaved, coughed and appeared to move during tests meant to determine consciousness.\u00a0 In a consciousness test, a prison officer says the inmate\u2019s name, brushes his eyelashes and then pinches his left arm. During the first one, Smith moved his arm. He slightly raised his right arm again after the second consciousness test. One of Smith\u2019s attorneys whispered to another attorney, \u201cHe\u2019s reacting,\u201d and pointed out the inmate\u2019s repeated movements.\u00a0 The state prison commissioner said he did not see any reaction to the consciousness tests. \u201cWe do know we followed our protocol. We are absolutely convinced of that,\u201d Alabama Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn said Thursday evening. \u201cThere will be an autopsy that will be done on Mr. Smith and if there were any irregularities those will hopefully be shown or born out in the autopsy. I think the question is probably better left to the medical experts,\u201d Dunn said when asked if the movement\u2019s indicated the state\u2019s process should be changed.\u00a0 Smith was finally pronounced dead at 11:05 p.m. Thursday -- about 30 minutes after the procedure began at the state prison in southwest Alabama. \u00a0\u00a0 Alabama uses the sedative midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug lethal injection combination. Smith and other inmates argued in a court case that the drug was an unreliable sedative and could cause them to feel pain, citing its use in problematic executions. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the use of the drug. Smith\u2019s lawyers said in an email Friday that they believe two doses of midazolam were administered to sedate him. The Department of Corrections won\u2019t say whether a second dose was given. Critics of the lethal injection drug, which has been used in problematic executions in several states, say Thursday\u2019s execution in Alabama provides more evidence that it shouldn\u2019t be used to put inmates to death. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said medical experts have repeatedly said midazolam is not designed to render a person unconscious and insensate, and witness accounts of Smith\u2019s execution indicate that it did not. Smith was convicted of capital murder in the Nov. 8, 1994, fatal shooting of Huntsville store clerk Casey Wilson. A jury voted 7-5 to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment, but a judge overrode that recommendation and sentenced Smith to death. U.S. Supreme Court justices twice paused the execution as Smith\u2019s attorneys argued for a delay, saying a judge shouldn\u2019t have been able to impose the death penalty when a jury recommended he receive life imprisonment. Lawyers for the state argued in a court filing Tuesday that the sentence was legally sound, and that it is appropriate for judges to make the sentencing decision. Smith, the son of a NASA contract employee, became an Eagle Scout at 15, but his life spiraled downward because of alcoholism, according to a clemency request to Alabama\u2019s governor. He had a final meal of fried chicken and french fries and was visited during the day by his parents and son.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

And the criticisms of her work for Donald J. Trump. And the questions about whether she will go to work in the White House. Ms. Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager in the final months of the 2016 presidential race, sat for an extensive interview with The Run-Up in her office in Trump Tower. To get there, we were led through a secret passageway toward the elevators in the lobby, then up and past a row of glass-front offices, one of them with a sign reading \u201cNational Security Council,\u201d where Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has been working over the last few weeks. In the interview, Ms. Conway rebukes her critics, defends her boss, describes the atmosphere within the transition team and sheds light on the president-elect\u2019s relationship with the elusive next first lady, Melania Trump. \u201cI sometimes think I\u2019m in the men\u2019s room at a bachelor party at the Elks club in Republican politics,\u201d Ms. Conway tells us. \u201cIn some ways, being able to have a seat at the table is remarkable, and being able to have the seat at the table as a campaign manager, I think, has been pretty spectacular.\u201d How do I listen?

President-elect Donald Trump calls out to media as he and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani pose for photographs as Giuliani arrives at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse, Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Bedminster, N.J. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani formally withdrew from consideration for a post in President-elect Donald Trump 's administration Friday, putting an end to his ill-fated bid to lead the State Department . Giuliani's prospects to serve as secretary of state had already dimmed, in part because of questions about his overseas business ties. Trump is now seriously considering Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for the post, with Mitt Romney still in the mix. The deliberations have divided Trump's senior advisers, with some bluntly warning in public that tapping Romney would anger the president-elect's loyal supporters. Trump himself has sent mixed messages about Romney in recent days, according to people who have spoken with him, suggesting in some conversations that Romney isn't getting the job and saying in others that he is still in contention. The president-elect is said to be intrigued by the prospect of filling the diplomatic post with an international businessman. Tillerson has led Exxon since 2006, a period when record high oil prices and record corporate profits helped make it the most valuable public company in the world. He rose to prominence through the company's Russian energy business and was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship last year. Giuliani, a loyal Trump supporter throughout the presidential race, quickly emerged as a top contender for secretary of state. But his financial ties, as well as his public campaigning for the job, are said to have given Trump pause. The former mayor said he removed himself from consideration on Nov. 29. \"The whole thing was becoming kind of very confusing and very difficult for the president-elect,\" Giuliani said on Fox News. \"My desire to be in the Cabinet was great, but not that great.\" After leaving the government, Giuliani advised foreign political figures and worked for lobbying and security firms whose clients have had complicated relationships with the U.S. government. While not personally involved in lobbying, Giuliani spent years at firms that represented governments and multinational companies. He also made speeches demanding the State Department remove an Iranian opposition group from a U.S. terror blacklist. In a statement Friday, Trump said Giuliani would have been an \"outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles.\" Incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is seen inside the transition team as favoring Romney, said the former mayor was vetted for possible conflicts and \"passed with flying colors.\" Kellyanne Conway , Trump's senior adviser, said Giuliani's decision to remove himself from consideration was a \"mutual decision\" with the president-elect. Conway has been an outspoken critic of Romney, publicly warning Trump that his supporters would feel betrayed if he tapped the 2012 Republican nominee for the prominent and powerful Cabinet post. Romney had blasted Trump as a \"fraud\" who was playing the American public \"for suckers.\" But he emerged from a private dinner with Trump last week \u2014 their second meeting since the election \u2014 full of praise for the president-elect. Still, Trump moved to expand his pool of contenders following that meeting. He met this week with Tillerson in New York this week and has also had discussions with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Some Trump advisers had hoped Giuliani would be interested in being nominated for Homeland Security secretary, where they believed his financial ties would not be as much of a concern. But Giuliani made clear he was only interested in the diplomatic post. Friday's announcement means several of Trump's most ardent campaign supporters will not be joining his administration. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he doesn't plan to have a formal role. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was initially seen as a contender for a few posts, but is expected to be left empty-handed. Associated Press ",

    "text": "WATCH Opioid Epidemic: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email A new poll released by the Pew Research Center today indicates that a majority of Americans oppose any loosening of environmental regulations or a repeal of the Affordable Care Act , two of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign pledges. The survey also suggests that a minority of Americans approve of Trump's picks for his Cabinet so far. On Wednesday, Trump named Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as his choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt is an outspoken critic of environmental regulations and believes the EPA has crippled the U.S. energy industry. But 59 percent of people surveyed by Pew say stronger environmental laws and regulations are worth any potential costs to the economy. And when it comes to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, 53 percent said they expect the ACA\u2019s major provisions to be eliminated while 39 percent expect them to continue. Thirty-nine percent of respondents want to repeal the law all together; 15 percent favor leaving it as is; and 39 percent want to expand it. The Pew poll highlights the significant challenges Trump faces once he takes office in January. Can Trump Repeal Obamacare in First 100 Days? Americans view Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices less favorably than previous president-elects. Only 40 percent approve of Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices and other high level appointments. That compares to 71 percent who approved of President Obama\u2019s Cabinet choices in December of 2008 and 58 percent who expressed positive views of George W. Bush\u2019s appointments in January of 2001. While the Trump transition team has moved quickly to pick Cabinet members, the process has had a flair for the dramatic, with candidates filing through the Trump Tower lobby and reports of infighting among Trump\u2019s confidantes, most recently over the choice of secretary of State. And there is criticism that Trump is not delivering on his campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of establishment figures and insiders in Washington, D.C. Currently, his Cabinet is stacked with wealthy GOP donors and Wall Street insiders. On Thursday night in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump pushed back on criticism of his Cabinet picks. \u201cOne newspaper criticized me, \u2018Why can't they have people of modest means?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause I want people that made a fortune because now they are negotiating with you. OK?\u201d Americans are also concerned about Trump\u2019s Twitter habit. Eighty-two percent of people surveyed say once Trump enters the White House he \u201cwill need to be more cautious about the kinds of things he says and tweets.\u201d And a majority -- 54 percent -- think Trump has not done enough to distance himself from the white nationalists who supported his campaign. Thirty-five percent of respondents think Trump will be a good or great president; 18 percent say he will be average and 38 percent say he will be poor or terrible. But when Trump was just a president candidate, 25 percent of those polled by Pew in October said he would make a good or great president, while 57 percent said he would be poor or terrible. Pew Research Center surveyed 1,502 adults from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. 0 Shares ",

Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Dairy operations run 24/7, but federal law excludes its workers from overtime pay. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Patricia Aquilar, 21, began working at DeRuyter Brothers Dairy in central Washington nearly three years ago. She worked at the dairy's milking parlor, which she says handles about 3000 cows three times each day, seven days a week. Aquilar was one of four dairy workers responsible for pushing and guiding the cows into the parlor, connecting the animals to milking machines, wiping them and the machinery down, and cleaning towels and milk tanks. \"I worked six days a week for eight or nine hours,\" she explains. \"They said we would get breaks but we didn't have even a full lunch break, just 15 or 25 minutes,\" says Aquilar. Her colleague, Jose Martinez, 60, also worked at a milking parlor at DeRuyter Brothers. He worked there for more than a year, with his time at the dairy overlapping with Aguilar's. \"It was six days a week. It was supposed to be an eight hour shift but was always more,\" he says. \"It could be an hour or three hours more. If a machine broke it could be significantly longer,\" he explains. Article continues after sponsorship With its close encounters with large animals and machinery, dairy work is hard and dangerous. Injuries \u2013 including fatal injuries \u2013 are not uncommon. Aguilar describes being kicked in the hand and chest by cows. One time, says Martinez, \"a cow stepped on my hand and I had to literally pull my hand out from under the hoof.\" Both were paid about $12 per hour. Both say they weren't paid as they should have been for their brief break times and there was no overtime pay \u2013 a norm in this industry that runs 24/7. That's because U.S. federal law excludes people who work in agriculture \u2013 on farms and in dairies \u2013 from the right to overtime pay. It also excludes them from the right to organize or unionize, and under certain circumstances, the right to be paid the minimum wage. Why California's New Farmworker Overtime Bill May Not Mean Bigger Paychecks Now, Aquilar and Martinez are challenging this labor law exemption in Washington by filing a class-action lawsuiton behalf of all agricultural workers in the state. The suit \u2013 the first of its kind in Washington \u2013 against DeRuyter Brothers Dairy is being filed on behalf of the dairy workers by Columbia Legal Services in Yakima County Superior Court . The suit claims that the lack of overtime pay violates state wage law, which requires overtime pay for more than 40 hours worked per seven-day week, and also violates the state constitution's protections against discrimination and favoritism, explains Lori Isley, an attorney with Columbia Legal Services. The suit also seeks to recover payment for the dairy's failure to provide required meal and rest breaks, and failure to pay workers for that time. \"It's not fair that people who work at a dairy don't get paid overtime,\" says Aquilar. \"Everybody else gets paid overtime. We should be treated equally as everybody else.\" \"Part of the problem is also the management,\" said Martinez. It's \"constantly pushing people to work faster and longer.\" DeRuyter Brothers Dairy declined to comment on the lawsuit. But other dairy owners and industry representatives say a 40-hour week structure is problematic in light ofindustry's unique round-the-clock requirements. Paying overtime, they also say, adds costs that can't be recouped easily, given other business expenses and what they're currently paid for milk, and could result in reduced staffing or workers' hours. Aquilar and Martinez's law suit comes at a time when agricultural workers around the country are challenging these exemptions, which date back to the 1930s. At the same time, state laws are slowly beginning to change. Farmworkers in New York have filed a lawsuit challenging their exemption from the right to unionize. In New Mexico , farmworkers, led by dairy workers, have successfully challenged their exemption from workers' compensation. In Washington, over the past several decades, farmworkers have secured the right to workers' compensation, the right to organize and to paid rest breaks. \"The exclusion for farm work is rooted in racially discriminatory labor laws that were passed in the 1930s,\" says Bruce Goldstein, the executive director of Farmworker Justice , a nonprofit organization that supports migrant and seasonal farmworkers. The farmworker exemptions to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act date back to the New Deal and concessions made for Southern farmers, whose workforce was then largely African-American. \"It's long past time to end these exclusions,\" says Goldstein. \"We're dragging the industry into modern times,\" says Jeff Johnson, president of Washington State Labor Council , whose organization has been representing farmworkers on these issues for 30 years. But only four states require overtime pay for farmworkers: California (which passed legislation earlier this year to pay overtime after 40 hours), Hawaii, Maryland (where overtime starts after 60 hours) and Minnesota (where overtime begins after 48 hours). But farm and dairy owners generally aren't happy about these overtime requirements. They're used to longer work weeks, and they say the added costs are burdensome, since they can't be passed on to their customers, given milk pricing structures. California growers \"are having to make really difficult decisions to deal with this increase,\" says Matthew Allen, director of California governmental affairs for the Western Growers Association. These may involve cutting hours or staff, or even reducing farm acreage to remain competitive, he explains. \"We're not operating in a vacuum,\" says Allen. \"It's a global marketplace.\" \"The costs of dairy production in California are not competitive any longer,\" says California dairy owner Joaquin Contente. \"We have one of the lowest milk prices in the country.\" Added labor costs have shrunk profit margins, he says. Lucas Sjostrom of the Minnesota Dairy Producers Association says his state's dairy farmers are feeling similar pressures. The push to make agricultural work conform to a 40-hour work week, he says, is problematic. \"A full-time employee might have 60 to 70 hours of work one week, and 30 the next,\" depending on variations of weather and other aspects of the 24-hour operation, says Sjostrom. \"The restrictions of 40 hours just don't work well.\" Anja Radaubagh, CEO of Western United Dairymen, an organization representing dairies in California (the biggest milk-producing state), agrees. The burden, she says, will be felt most acutely by smaller dairies. But the number of smaller dairies has been shrinking over the past couple of decades, says Goldstein. Dairies have consolidated and grown in size so that more than 50 percent of U.S. milk is now produced by about 3 percent of the country's dairies . In 1992, most U.S. dairy farms had about 49 milk cows per farm. Now, most have well over 500 , and dairies with 2,000 or more cows have been growing in number the fastest . Dairies with upwards of 5,000 cows are not uncommon. Farmworker advocates also point to the increasing size of dairies as a reason to treat their workers like those in other industrialized workplaces. \"We're not talking mom-and-pop dairies, we're talking industry,\" says Johnson. In Washington state \u2013 one of the top 10 U.S. dairy states \u2013 dairy is the state's second biggest agricultural money-maker, with a direct economic impact valued at $1.3 billion . As the industry changes, agricultural workers like Aquilar and Martinez are pushing to end what many consider outdated exemptions to wage and workplace protection requirements. \"We want to make a better working environment for everybody,\" says Aquilar.

Much like Furby or Tickle Me Elmo, the Hatchimal \u2014 an egg that, if cared for, cracks open to reveal a furry animal \u2014 has become such a hot-seller that stores like Toys \"R\" Us are restricting sales to one-per-customer. Parents are standing in line for hours to snatch one of the coveted items for their children. Apparently, Kids can't get enough of the furry specimens. \"I feel incredibly lucky, I can't believe that I got one today,\" said one mother at a Chicago Toys \"R\" Us. Toy hysteria is nothing new to the American consumer during the Christmas season. There was the Cabbage Patch Kids., Tickle Me Elmo Mania and, of course, the Furby frenzy. Dottie Russo, a New Jersey mom, hatched a YouTube rant last month when she saw that individuals on Ebay attempted to sell the Hatchimals for hundreds of dollars above the normal $69.99 price tag. \"I have been to every Toys \"R\" Us from here to Timbuktu in the last five days,\" Dottie Russo said in the video. \"Only to be told, again and again and agian, sorry, we didn't get the shipment, sorry we're sold out.\" She blamed \"that guy\" \u2014 a \"43-year old guy\" who is \"sitting in his mother's basement\" \u2014 for snatching the hot toys up early and reselling them on line for a big markup. \"Have you no soul?\" said Russo in the video. She continued, \"Do you not know what it was like to be a kid?\" \"It's wrong to take advantages of parents who just want to make their kids happy on Christmas morning,\" Russo told NBC News. \"I don't think you can put a price on that, and you and you shouldn't.\" For Russo and lots of other parents, that happiness that one special toy brings her kids \u2014 for now \u2014 is, indeed, priceless.

But why? By MONICA DAVEY DEC. 9, 2016 CHICAGO \u2014 For hours, the body lay where it had landed, just steps from the wooden sign someone had put up \u2014 a painted gun with a red slash through it. Inside a nearby house, Lee Baez had heard the gunshots in the darkness and got up to move his car so his fianc\u00e9e would not have to walk past the body as she left for work before dawn. Down the block, Sandra Harris rose later to care for her ailing 85-year-old mother and saw the body, by then draped with a sheet. After the authorities finally carried away Lee Martin, the 43-year-old man who was shot in his head and back and died here on Walnut Street in the middle of an August night, another neighbor emerged to scrub the red streaks off the sidewalk. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Living on Chicago\u2019s West Side, where the dazzling downtown skyline always seems to shimmer in view but out of reach, means mornings like these grow strangely normal. The blue lights, the yellow tape, the next day\u2019s quiet moving on \u2014 all of it. Photo Chicago police officers investigating a triple shooting in the 3300 block of West Walnut Street on May 28, the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times Over Memorial Day weekend, when The New York Times tracked every shooting in this city, the largest concentration of them happened here, in about six square miles that make up Chicago\u2019s 11th police district. Of 64 people shot that weekend, 16 were in this district. Three people were shot on this same stretch of Walnut Street. The Times returned to the blocks in the 11th District where the Memorial Day weekend shootings occurred to try to better understand Chicago\u2019s crisis of violence. Residents along Walnut Street and at other crime scenes told of a fractured community \u2014 isolated by this city\u2019s entrenched segregation, hollowed out by joblessness and poverty, and battered by resignation and indifference. Here, graystone homes and brick cottages line elegant boulevards with wide, grassy medians. Garfield Park, once known as Chicago\u2019s Central Park, sits in the 11th\u2019s middle. But on Walnut Street, one vacant lot has been there so long that walking paths are worn through it. Young men gather on this section of the street, and neighbors say they hear calls for \u201cPills!\u201d or \u201cFlats!\u201d\u2014 slang for drugs \u2014 in the middle of the day. In places like this, cycles reinforce themselves: Poverty and joblessness breed an underground economy that leads to jail and makes it harder to get jobs. Struggling, emptying schools result in the closings of the very institutions that hold communities together. Segregation throws up obstacles to economic investment. And people and programs with good intentions come and go, thwarting hopes, reinforcing frustrations while never quite addressing the underlying problems, anyway. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Into it all comes a lethal mix of readily available guns, a growing number of splintering gangs and groups, and a sense among some here that the punishment for carrying a weapon on these streets will never be larger than the risk of not carrying one. \u201cIt\u2019s about desperation, decadence, depression and rage,\u201d the Rev. Marshall E. Hatch Sr., who has given eulogies for at least 12 victims of violence this year, says of the district, home to his New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church . \u201cIt\u2019s the concentration of all of that, all in one place.\u201d Three days, 64 people shot, six of them dead: Memorial Day on the streets, and the violence that has engulfed families and neighborhoods. Homicides citywide are up about 56 percent compared to last year and shootings are up about 49 percent, but just five of Chicago\u2019s 22 police districts are driving the bulk of Chicago\u2019s rise. All are on the South or West Sides. In the 11th, shootings are up by 78 percent compared to a year ago, and homicides are up 89 percent. So far in 2016, 91 people have been killed in this district, where only about 74,000 people live. That is more homicides than in all of last year in entire cities, such as Seattle (population 684,000), Omaha (444,000) and Buffalo (258,000). Early on the morning of May 28, a gray car pulled up on Walnut Street, several teenage witnesses told a Times reporter, and men with big guns got out and started firing at other young men on a porch. Shell casings littered the street. The police say witnesses were uncooperative, and no one has been arrested. Within weeks, that shooting was a hazy memory. \u201cNow which one was that?\u201d asked a woman who lives directly across the street. Soon after, neighbors say the large homemade sign of a gun with a condemning slash through it appeared beside a vacant lot. People were unsure who put up the sign, and more have followed, one beneath the clattering \u201cL\u201d train track to downtown, another across from a children\u2019s playground. By November, someone had split the Walnut Street anti-violence sign in two, a curse word scrawled on part of the crumpled remains.

Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times The 3900 Block of West Wilcox Street On the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, a 26-year-old woman was shot in the back while driving in a car around 4:30 a.m. The police say two men approached and started shooting. No arrests have been made. Weeks later, less than a block from that shooting on West Wilcox, a preacher led people holding hands in a circle, praying, singing and swaying. The group seemed not to notice as traffic rumbled down Pulaski Road, a crowded strip lined with storefronts promising tax preparation, hairbraiding, candy and liquor. Zaree Pendleton, a stranger to those in the circle, suddenly wandered up, agitated. He said he was recently out of prison and desperately needed help. He carefully set the Bud Light he had been drinking for breakfast on the sidewalk in the center of the swaying circle. Then he reached for the preacher\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching y\u2019all out here every morning, praying,\u201d Mr. Pendleton told the group, turning weepy. \u201cY\u2019all want to pray with me?\u201d Photo Pastor Jamie Thompson, center with his back to the camera, led a prayer outside the Reborn Community Church in the West Garfield Park neighborhood in August. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times Jamie Thompson, the pastor of Reborn Community Church , often holds services here, just outside the church he created at a shuttered fire station. The need is greatest among the people who cluster along Pulaski\u2019s corners in the middle of the day, many out of work or only working some, the preacher said. In 2014, almost half of the families in the community areas that make up much of the 11th District \u2014 East Garfield Park , West Garfield Park and Humboldt Park \u2014 had incomes under $25,000, close to the family poverty threshold that year. Industry once flourished here. The original headquarters and distribution center of Sears, Roebuck & Co. provided thousands of jobs. But the area changed in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as whites moved away and blacks moved in. In 2014, almost a quarter of the housing units in the neighborhoods in the district were vacant, census data show.

It can\u2019t be the drug trade.\u201d Residents like Mr. Pendleton say they feel stuck in an economic trap: go to jail for a crime, struggle to find work, wind up back in jail. DEC. 9, 2016 Anjali Singhvi/The New York Times | Source: City of Chicago Data Portal \u201cPeople have gotten to a place where they don\u2019t have any hope and they don\u2019t feel like they have any hope of getting any,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cYou accept all kinds of ways to make money when you\u2019re hopeless.\u201d Mr. Thompson used to live in a gentrifying neighborhood a few miles away, but he moved his family here a dozen years ago. He caught neighbors\u2019 attention when he brought his prayers to the streets. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s a white guy doing over here?\u2019 people would laugh,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNow they\u2019re used to me.\u201d Mr. Pendleton came to the prayer circle with a plea. \u201cI need a job,\u201d he said.

Witnesses said a black car sped away after the shooting. No arrests have been made. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Steps from Gladys Avenue, where the two men were shot, Garfield Park opens up to 184 acres of plush lawns shaded by old trees and surrounded by curving paths and historic buildings. For visitors, the park is a tourist attraction, a jewel of the city. Its lavish conservatory is jammed with hundreds of exotic plants and a dewy, tropical aroma even through Chicago\u2019s bleakest winter. Yet for many of the people who live here \u2014 some of whom say they rarely enter the conservatory \u2014 Garfield Park can be harrowing. Its nearby side streets, like Gladys, can feel menacing. On a bright afternoon not long ago, a man stepped out of an apartment onto a crowded sidewalk and a gust of wind blew his shirt up, revealing a gun. Residents say the park\u2019s perimeter can be a magnet for drug sales and violence. Seven of the 16 people shot over Memorial Day weekend were nearby. Photo A gunshot victim was wheeled toward an ambulance after a shooting in May near South Hamlin Boulevard, which runs along the western edge of Garfield Park. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times The police say statistics show the park is actually safer than it has been in several years, but Cardell Bradley, who fishes for catfish with sausage bait in the Garfield Park lagoon, said he was cautious. \u201cIf I see a group of people gathering, I get out of here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just heartbreaking to see these kids involved in all this \u2014 they\u2019re only young schoolkids, you know.\u201d Part of the problem is this: The district straddles the Eisenhower Expressway, a major thoroughfare that has long been known as the Heroin Highway. Suburbanites use it to drive into the city for drugs. Rivalries between Chicago\u2019s increasingly splintered gangs and cliques over sales of heroin, Ecstasy, prescription drugs and marijuana have given way to gunfire \u2014 even among small-time sellers who see themselves as only peripherally involved.

The teenager said he only occasionally helped sell drugs and just happened to be there when competitors turned up, armed. At the time, he was enrolled in middle school and working one-on-one with a mentor, who asked that the youth\u2019s name not be published for his safety. The teenager, the mentor said, was registered to attend a \u201cpeace conference\u201d with him on the very evening he was shot.

Police say the victim was uncooperative. No arrests have been made. An incongruously upbeat song plays loudly along this battered block all day every day: Scott Joplin\u2019s ragtime classic, \u201cThe Entertainer.\u201d The cheery tune tinkles from a pastel-colored ice cream truck that is permanently parked in a vacant lot on the block where the man was shot in the alley. Mina Marquez, the owner, also lives on the block \u2014 an odd amalgam of empty lots and cared-for homes, now decked with elaborate Christmas displays. In a police district that is mostly black, Ms. Marquez, 35, is unusual. She came from Mexico at 16, and after living in other Chicago neighborhoods, she and her husband and their three children moved to the 11th District because it was a place they could afford. Much of what happens here is driven by economics. People who can afford to leave, do.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb For Ms. Marquez, plunking down an ice cream truck on an empty lot next door was far cheaper than the family\u2019s effort a few years ago to open in a storefront in a different neighborhood. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Competition is scarce here. Sub shops and food marts struggle, and chain stores mostly stay away. Most of Ms. Marquez\u2019s ice cream customers are black, though there is a growing Hispanic population in this northern section of the district. Chicago is now made up of nearly equal thirds whites, blacks and Hispanics, but many of the city\u2019s stark lines of segregation still exist. New policies have actually hardened some lines. When Chicago\u2019s high-rise public housing projects were scheduled for demolition more than a decade ago, city leaders expected residents to spread across the city. But rental prices and other factors have concentrated many of those with government housing vouchers into neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, and kept many black public-housing residents out of richer, whiter areas. Ms. Marquez says her family coexists, if a bit awkwardly, with her customers. \u201cWe don\u2019t let them mess with us,\u201d Ms. Marquez said in Spanish. \u201cThey\u2019re not comfortable that we\u2019re here.\u201d Still, Ms. Marquez, who keeps her two youngest children in view as she stands at the truck window, said she had grown used to life on this block. She said that she sold more than 100 ice creams most days, and that she planned to stay. A line often forms outside the truck, where milkshakes are in high demand.

Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times The 4300 Block of West West End Avenue On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, a 24-year-old man was walking along just before 5 a.m. when two men approached, told him to lie down on the ground and shot him. The victim has not cooperated with the police, the police say. No arrests have been made. In this neighborhood, Marconi Elementary Community Academy was once the glue. Since the public school opened decades ago at the corner of Maypole and Kolmar Avenues \u2014 several blocks from where the man was shot over Memorial Day weekend \u2014 best friends were made there, parents kept in touch during drop-offs, children were taught by teachers who had once taught their parents. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe all went there,\u201d said Kenny Harvey, who attended the school half a century ago and still lives right here. In 2013, though, facing a fiscal crisis, the city closed Marconi and about 50 other public schools. Chicago\u2019s education leaders cited poor student performances and low enrollments in what was then the largest simultaneous closing for any school district in the nation. Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration has defended the closings as needed, and a University of Chicago research group found that most of the displaced students wound up in higher-performing schools. Since 2012, the city has spent $178 million on capital improvements in the 11th District and added programs and services, city officials said. But six schools here were also shuttered, including Marconi. To get to their new school, Tilton Elementary, the children from Marconi had to cross different gang lines and new drug turfs, parents at Marconi complained. There were new teachers, new students and, in some cases, a longer walk. And the neighborhood itself was losing one more bit of precious ballast: the rare public institution that held them together. There is also this: Based on the city\u2019s own criteria, Tilton barely rated a \u201cgood standing\u201d designation, and so was only marginally better than Marconi. For many parents, the difference was hardly worth the effort. Tasha Walker, her husband and her oldest daughter had all once gone to Marconi, but she chose not to send her younger daughter on to Tilton. Instead, her children attend charter schools in a different neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m not letting my kids get lost,\u201d Ms. Walker said. For a brief time, Ms. Walker\u2019s family had lived in a Chicago suburb, and she hopes to save enough money to move again. \u201cI want them to be able to be teenagers,\u201d she said.

The police say that both were gang members, and that neither would cooperate. No arrests have been made. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sonja Bellephant, 48, grew up in an apartment building just across from the stoop where the two men were shot over Memorial Day weekend. These days, she lives in a Chicago suburb but works as youth director at the church her grandfather started on the corner. \u201cTheir life,\u201d she said of the young people, \u201cI wish it could be like my life.\u201d Ms. Bellephant wants to create an urban boarding school for young men in a shuttered, hulking church, school and convent on this block. She envisions an arts studio in a church down the street. She regularly stops strangers, asking if their children are in day care, if they have found a job, if they are in school. \u201cDid you graduate from high school?\u201d she called to a young man one morning. He looked puzzled but said yes, then hiked up his pants. \u201cI want to tell them: \u2018You don\u2019t have to dodge bullets. You can finish school,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bellephant said. Ms. Bellephant, a former public school principal, is one in a vast array of individuals, government agencies, nonprofit groups and religious organizations with ideas for how to fix this area. The mayor\u2019s office this fall announced plans for $36 million for mentoring in areas like this, and for a $100 million fund to bring economic development to neighborhoods.

Mr. Emanuel\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cwill add nearly 1,000 new police officers, invest new dollars in our most challenged communities, make mentoring universal for young men in high-crime areas, spur economic development, strengthen sentencing for violent gun offenders, and bring together community and faith leaders around a plan to provide at-risk youth with better opportunities.\u201d Missing, though, community leaders say, is a single, overarching blueprint. Mentoring programs come and go with shifting grants. Job programs last a few months.

Everybody\u2019s in their own response mode. Sometimes, it\u2019s more gang-banging between the various community groups than it is on the streets.\u201d Leaders have long been trying to draw attention to this part of Chicago. In 1966, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. moved into an apartment near this district as part of his Chicago Freedom Movement campaign to desegregate neighborhoods and get fair, affordable housing. In 1986, Jimmy Carter helped build a Habitat for Humanity townhouse but it caught fire years later, and was eventually torn down. Ms. Bellephant is still trying to figure out how to pay for her urban boarding school. An old banner is plastered on the shuttered building, a vestige from a different plan to turn it into a family life center, gym and school of performing arts. \u201cIt\u2019s on the way 2013,\u201d the banner promises. Correction: December 9, 2016 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Tio Hardiman\u2019s conversation with a community member. It was Pulaski Road, not Pulaksi Avenue. Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting from Chicago, and Jack Begg and Giovanni Russonello from New York. ",

By Amber Phillips December 9 at 1:21 PM Follow byamberphillips President-elect Donald Trump greets Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) after a meeting at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster Township, N.J., on \u00a0Nov. 20. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) After a slow start, President-elect Donald Trump appears to be making a concerted effort to place women in his Cabinet. That's great for the women he chooses. It's not so great for those\u00a0they leave behind: Each time he chooses a GOP female elected official, he'll be reducing\u00a0the GOP's\u00a0already slim ranks of female elected officials. Perhaps the best illustration of this is\u00a0Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), widely expected to be named Trump's pick for interior secretary in the coming days. If confirmed by the Senate, she'd be only the third female interior secretary in U.S. history. But Trump would also be taking House Republicans' top-ranking woman\u00a0out of the chamber entirely. In fact, he'd be taking their only\u00a0female leader in 2017. (By comparison, Democrats just elected two women to leadership positions.) The departure of McMorris Rodgers from Congress would underscore a challenge\u00a0her party has struggled with for decades: its difficulty\u00a0elevating women to leadership roles. If you're a woman in Congress \u2014 and only 20 percent of Congress is female, despite women making up 50 percent of the population \u2014 there's a 3 to 1 chance you're a Democrat. Democrats have simply been investing in recruiting women longer than Republicans have, and women voters tend to lean more Democratic than Republican. [ Hillary Clinton made history, but women's groups aren't hailing a new 'Year of the Woman' ] For most of the 2000s, the ranks of Republican\u00a0women in Congress have been stagnant, at about\u00a010 percent of the GOP caucus. (They'll start 2017 with 21 GOP House lawmakers, which is par for the course.) When my colleague\u00a0Elise Viebeck asked where all the high-ranking GOP women are , she found Republicans had added a net of\u00a0only two new female lawmakers and virtually no women in leadership (besides McMorris Rodgers, in her role as chair of the House Republican Conference) in more than a decade. (Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) was elected vice chair of the House Republican Conference \u00a0in 2012, but she'll step down from that job next year to consider a run for governor of Kansas in 2018.) So it stands to reason that Republicans will want to replace McMorris Rodgers with a woman. But who? Underscoring their gender parity problem, there's no obvious choice. What would traditionally be considered her most likely successor \u2014 the incoming vice chair for 2017 \u2014 is a man. At least three women are thinking about running for the vacancy,\u00a0 Politico has reported . Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.): Elected in 2014 to an Orange County area district, her GOP class also elected her as their representative to the House Republican Conference that McMorris Rodgers chairs. Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.): Elected in 2012 to represent the suburbs of Indianapolis, Brooks briefly ran for governor when Trump chose then-Indiana Gov.\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0to be his vice president, and she'll start 2017 as chair of the House Ethics Committee. Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah): Elected to a swing district in 2014, Love is the first black Republican woman to be elected to Congress. All three of these women are relatively new to the Hill, which brings me to my next point: When women run for office, they win at the same rate as men, said Debbie Walsh of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. There just aren't enough women running, especially Republican women. Of the 10 viable Senate candidates in 2016, just\u00a0three\u00a0were Republican. [ Why can't women just be themselves when they run for office? ] Some\u00a0Republican female leaders\u00a0think\u00a0Trump didn't do them any favors in terms of recruiting women to replace ones\u00a0he's taking from them. But of course, it isn't all on Trump: Well before his election, Republicans were\u00a0struggling with gender diversity at all levels of government. While Democrats elected three new women of color to the Senate in November, bringing their total to 16, Republicans lost one of their women, knocking down their total from\u00a0six to five. And as\u00a0Trump tapped Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina to be his United Nations ambassador , GOP female governors' ranks slimmed from\u00a0three to two. (Actually, both parties severely lack female\u00a0governors.\u00a0Democrats have two right now. And GOP female governors\u00a0could rise back up to three if Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) is confirmed to be Trump's ambassador to China. He'd be replaced by Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) , who could become the first female governor of Iowa.) If Republican women simply have a pipeline problem, there are efforts at the state level \u2014 led by the Republican State Leadership Committee \u2014 to recruit, train and support more GOP leaders. But pipelines take a while to fill, and thanks to a new Republican administration,\u00a0Republicans\u00a0are losing female leaders faster than they can replace them. politics ",

    "text": "Email The U.S. government is trying to get automakers to move faster to fix 42 million vehicles that are being recalled because of potentially deadly Takata air bag inflators. Expressing renewed concern about the pace of the recall, which is the largest ever for the U.S. auto industry, officials from the National Highway Safety Administration released a schedule for further recalls on Friday and said the agency would require all 19 companies involved to submit plans to reach more owners. Eventually, about 69 million inflators that can potentially explode with too much force and spew shrapnel into people will be recalled. Some cars will have both the driver side and passenger side air bags replaced. As of last week, however, only 12.5 million, or about 18 percent, of the inflators had been replaced, and NHTSA said some automakers weren't doing enough to contact owners. The agency ordered the companies to turn in a \"recall engagement plan\" within 90 days to increase the completion rate. Eleven people have been killed by Takata inflators in the U.S. and as many as 16 worldwide. The government says about 180 people have been hurt in the U.S. alone. Recalls are being phased in through the end of 2020. NHTSA added sports car maker McLaren to the list of affected automakers. NHTSA officials said the recalls have been proceeding slowly in part because of a lack of available parts. Different cars need different air bag inflators, so it's not always easy to snap new parts into place. The agency said some consumers also haven't gotten repairs even though parts are available. The agency is urging anyone who gets a recall notice to contact a dealer and get their vehicle repaired as quickly as possible. Normally, around 70 percent of consumers complete recall repairs, the agency said. In this case, NHTSA wants the recall repair rate to achieve 100 percent. Takata inflators use the explosive chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion that inflates air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high heat and humidity, causing it to burn too fast. That can blow apart a metal canister designed to contain the explosion. NHTSA on Friday released a complete list of models covered by current and future Takata recalls. The full list can be found in an announcement issued Friday. Click on \"Amended Coordinated Remedy Order\" and scroll to \"Amended Annex A\" at the end to search for your vehicle. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show that the recalls will be phased in through 2020, not 2019. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Japan Ratifies Pacific Trade Pact That Trump Plans to Dump By elaine kurtenbach, ap business writer TOKYO \u0097 Dec 9, 2016, 2:11 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trade: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won parliamentary approval Friday for ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, despite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to withdraw from the 12-nation trade pact. Upper house lawmakers approved the TPP on Friday, heeding Abe's calls to push ahead with it despite Trump's rejection of the free-trade initiative championed by President Barack Obama . Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has an ample majority in both houses of parliament. Ratification of needed regulatory revisions by the Cabinet is expected soon. The market opening measures required by the trade pact are seen as a way for Abe to push through difficult reforms of the agricultural and health sectors. So far, Abe has made scant progress on a slew of changes he has proposed to help improve Japan's lagging productivity and competitiveness. Trump has vowed to take steps to exit the pact right after he takes office. A U.S. withdrawal would kill the trade pact unless its terms are revised. The agreement between the dozen members requires both the U.S. and Japan to join to attain the required 85 percent of the group's total GDP since the U.S. economy accounts for 60 percent of that total, and Japan less than 20 percent. After expending political capital to fight vested interests fearful of market opening and reforms likely to be required by the trade pact, Abe and other leaders in Asia have bemoaned the impending loss of the U.S. as TPP flag bearer. \"We want to carry this out and expect others will follow suit,\" Abe recently told a parliamentary committee. An opposition lawmaker, Eri Tokunaga, derided Abe's insistence on going ahead with ratification as \"egocentric.\" \"There is basically zero chance of this coming into effect since the next president, Trump, plans to leave it,\" Tokunaga told fellow lawmakers Friday. Leaders in New Zealand and several other countries have said they still hope to find a way to rescue the initiative. The TPP was meant to help give the U.S. a leading role in setting trade rules reaching beyond tariffs and other conventional trade barriers. It's possible demise could spur faster progress on another, much less discussed trade agreement called the RCEP, or Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. That trade grouping includes no countries from the Americas but all the big hitters in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea as well as Australia, New Zealand and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 0 Shares ",

Dylann Storm Roof, center, with his lawyers, during jury selection Monday in U.S. District Court in Charleston, S.C. Robert Maniscalco The recording of Roof was played Friday for the jurors weighing the fate of the 22-year-old for the first time at his federal death penalty trial. In the video, FBI agents could be seen reading Roof his rights and making sure he understood that he was giving a statement without a lawyer present. Roof did not appear to be under the influence of anything when he made the statement following his arrest on June 18, 2015 in Shelby, North Carolina, FBI investigator Michael Stansbury testified. And Roof was not sure how many people he killed at the Emanuel AME Church. \"Five, not really sure, \" he said. \"Maybe four?\" When asked if he said anything to the victims, Roof answered, \"I didn't say anything to them before.\" \"It was very fast,\" he said on the video. In a matter-of-fact tone, Roof told the FBI he researched his target and went on the killing spree because blacks were raping white women. \"I do consider myself a white supremacist,\" he admitted on the footage. Roof also said he was \"in absolute awe\" that there were no police outside the church when he came out. He said he would have killed himself if there were. In the course of the recorded conversation, Roof spoke about seeing a 1980's TV movie about a racist skinhead called \"Made in Britain.\" And when asked if he regretted what he'd done, Roof said, \"Yeah, I'd say so.\" Told the death toll was actually nine people, Roof appeared to react with disbelief and then remorse. \"Well, it makes me feel bad,\" he said, when asked how he felt. \"Are you guilty?\" an FBI agent asked. \"Yes, I am guilty,\" Roof replied. \"We all know I'm guilty.\" Also entered into evidence was a journal found in the back of Roof's car. \"I was not raised in a racist home of environment,\" he wrote, referring to himself as Dylann Storm Roof. But in there, Roof wrote that Florida security guard George Zimmerman was in the right when he fatally shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin and he disparaged African-Americans as \"stupid and violent.\" The journal also contained Nazi swastikas and the white supremacist code numbers 14 and 88. Sitting at the defense table, Roof did not look at Stansbury. But the wrenching footage is likely to ratchet-up the anguish at the already emotionally fraught trial. On Wednesday, Roof's mother suffered a heart attack after prosecutors laid out for the court how her son plotted the murders of the black Bible study participants on June 17, 2015 in the fellowship hall of the Emanuel AME Church. Before Stansbury took the stand, Roof's lawyer told U.S. Judge Richard Gergel they intend to present more evidence about his state of mind at the time of the shooting. They have not contested that Roof was responsible for the killing, but they are trying to save him from the death penalty. So far Roof, who has admitted targeting the Charleston church, has barely uttered a word at his trial. While the proceedings have been punctuated at times by the sobs of the victims' loved ones, Roof has sat stone-faced and has rarely looked at the people whose lives were torn apart by the massacre. Until Wednesday, when Roof showed up in court wearing a gray sweater and slacks, the go-to getup for the admitted killer with the bowl haircut had been his striped jail jumpsuit. Corky Siemaszko ",

While a game's final result is not entirely predictable, a game is designed to pay a specific rate if all tickets... (Cecilia Reyes) Illinois became the first state in the nation to turn over day-to-day management of its lottery to a private firm. The firm, Northstar Lottery Group, took over the Illinois Lottery in July 2011. Since then, Northstar has been criticized for failing to deliver the profits to the state it projected when it won the Illinois bid. The state is now looking for a replacement. But there has been little talk of how private management affected players. International Game Technology, formerly known as GTECH, and Scientific Games, which formed Northstar, are multinational companies that have long done behind-the-scenes grunt work for state lotteries, including Illinois. The management company has been paid based on how much profit it brought the state. The firms have touted their work in Illinois as they pushed to expand their business and manage lotteries in other states. IGT, which controlled Northstar, and Scientific Games did not dispute the Tribune findings that many big prizes weren't awarded, nor that those games' payout rates were lower than designed. But they argued the findings were irrelevant or misleading, and whatever problems may have existed could be blamed on a host of reasons, from meddling state officials to players not fully appreciating the innovative games offered. And the firms also said that players' odds of winning were never affected, even if a grand prize was never awarded. \"Northstar consistently and unwaveringly made decisions for the benefit of the players and the Illinois Lottery and not its suppliers IGT or Scientific Games,\" IGT wrote in response to Tribune questions. One of the state's most powerful lawmakers, Senate President John Cullerton, said the Tribune's findings left him \"very concerned.\" He said the unawarded prizes and payout rates could cause lasting damage and cost every taxpayer \u2014 even those who have never bought a lottery ticket \u2014 in a cash-strapped state that's grown dependent on lottery profits to help make ends meet. \"If the players are not treated fairly, then they'll stop buying it, and then we'll lose money,\" said Cullerton, D-Chicago. A bold experiment State lawmakers were hopeful when they turned over management of the lottery to a private company in 2011. In their eyes, the lottery had become a moribund business. Private hands, state officials argued, could spur new and creative games that would generate badly needed revenue for the state. \"Government bureaucrats simply are not in the best position to overhaul and remarket the Illinois Lottery,\" Cullerton said at the time. Northstar's winning pitch was bold. While it would continue to grow traditional draw games \u2014 in which bouncing numbered balls are randomly selected, for example \u2014 the Northstar consortium would look to supercharge sales in the popular instant game category with never-before-seen prizes in Illinois to capture the public's imagination and dramatically increase profits to the state. The Tribune obtained thousands of pages of records and analyzed scores of data sets from Illinois and several other states to study instant tickets, the best-selling and fastest-growing revenue stream for state lotteries. With names such as Dazzling Dollar$ and Freezing Your Bucks Off, each instant game tries to attract potential players with a mix of quirky themes and lucrative prizes. Unlike Lotto -type jackpot games, instant games are each preplanned, self-contained products. Each game pays for its prizes from the money it raises in sales. And that leaves a critical question: How many tickets should they print? Lottery officials from other states say they try to print only as many tickets as they think they can sell for each game. They know sales tend to taper off for games over time, and they say the goal is to award the final grand prize before sales tank. While printing fewer tickets may limit how many and the size of the prizes they can advertise, those states say they would rather be conservative. In Illinois, Northstar pushed to dramatically increase the number of tickets printed for games. This allowed them to offer bigger and better prizes for games. Players \u2014 enticed by bigger potential wins \u2014 bought more instant tickets than ever, the Tribune analysis found. Players' increased appetite was lucrative for IGT and Scientific Games, who were paid a cut of sales, as well as the state, which received more profit. But the appetite was not nearly enough to gobble up the sea of tickets printed, records show. And as sales eventually dropped in many of the big-prize games, Northstar pushed to remove tickets from store shelves before all, or sometimes any, of the grand prizes were awarded. The Tribune reviewed the 138 instant games begun and ended by Northstar in the last five fiscal years, through June 2016. Reporters focused on the 17 games that offered the biggest grand prizes: games with a grand prize costing the state at least $1 million to fund. Those 17 big-prize games made up only one-eighth of the instant games, but they played an outsize role in Northstar's efforts to meet its ambitious sales targets, accounting for more than a third of the sales. And the first of those 17 to end was a highly touted game called Birthday Surprise. Jim Carter Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Jim Carter, 41, questioned why many of the large grand prizes for scratch-off games were not awarded during Northstar Lottery Group's management of the Illinois Lottery. \u201cThere has to be accountability for that,\u201d the veteran lottery player said.

(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Surprise ending The top of the ticket said Happy Birthday, with the letters positioned as if they were hanging from a string banner at a party. Below them: the scratch-off area, its coating superimposed with an image of a massive present tied in a bow. In between were the details of just what could be behind the box: \"Win $150,000 immediately and $150,000 on your birthday for the next 20 years!\" For $5, a player could scratch off the present to see if it was a winner. The game's design called for two grand prizes, and nearly 10 million tickets were printed. That's 3 1/2 times more tickets than the state, when it ran the lottery, had typically sold for a $5 game. Northstar, through its majority owner IGT, declined to tell the Tribune exactly how many tickets it expected to sell for this game or others, but it acknowledged, in general, it printed more tickets for big-prize games than it anticipated it would sell. One reason it did so, it said, was to make sure it had enough tickets in case players really liked a game. Other states told the Tribune another solution to such a welcome dilemma is to order more tickets and offer more prizes.\u00a0Northstar did it for one of the 17 games, but not Birthday Surprise. Scientific Games, the minority partner in Northstar, told the Tribune it objected at the time to the large number of tickets printed to support what it called the Birthday Surprise game's \"poorly designed prize structure.\" The firm declined to provide further details on exactly how it believed the game should have been designed. Birthday Surprise hit the shelves in late 2012. Northstar's business plan showed the game sold slightly better than traditional instant ticket games through early 2013, when it awarded its first grand prize in a made-for-TV moment. A struggling cable installer, on his birthday, stopped into Casey's General Store in downstate Auburn and scratched off the first grand prize winner. The state issued a news release on the win , touting the game as one of its most popular on the market. Within weeks, the lottery invited TV cameras to record officials handing the winner the ceremonial oversize check. A local TV reporter wrapped up her story by showing the face of a Birthday Surprise ticket and noting: \"There's actually another winning ticket just like it floating around out there.\" Yet that same month, Northstar drafted a plan to end the game \u2014 making it less likely the second prize would be awarded. Regular lottery player Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Chicagoan Lottie Sowinski, 56, who often plays scratch-offs, said she assumed an instant game was stopped only after all the tickets were sold. \u201cIt makes you feel, like, that we\u2019re a fool to put money into it if they\u2019re not going to give out the top prizes,\u201d she said in response to findings of a Tribune investigation.

(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) 'Player favorite' In written business plans Northstar provided to the Tribune, the company told the state that the game was a \"current player favorite and well performing,\" but still wasn't selling well enough. So the game would be \"reintroduced.\" Sure enough, Birthday Surprise was soon pulled from shelves without awarding the second grand prize. Nobody can say for sure whether someone bought the second grand prize-winning ticket and never claimed it. IGT and Scientific Games said, for security reasons, nobody knows exactly where a winning ticket sits among the millions of tickets printed. But the game sold just 64 percent of its tickets. The remaining tickets sat in a warehouse until the game ended and then were destroyed. No winner of the second grand prize came forward. The lottery offered players no explanation. Ten weeks later, a new Birthday Surprise entered store shelves nearly identical to the first: same number of tickets printed and same prize structure. Only the ticket design was slightly different, with balloons and smaller presents. Northstar released a commercial featuring the first version's only grand prize winner \u00a0\u2014 the cable installer \u2014 who pitched what Northstar called the \"newest edition\" of the game. He recounted his lucky win and ended with a variation of the lottery's catchphrase: \"Anything's possible.\" The second edition of Birthday Surprise was ended after less than 10 months and 49 percent of tickets sold. Neither of its grand prizes were awarded. Scratch-off tickets Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Bob Kirby, of Chicago, scratches off Wheel of Fortune instant game tickets. For the biggest-prize instant games, beginning in 2011 and ending in 2015, the Illinois Lottery did not award 23 grand prizes, or more than 40 percent of those designed into the games, the Tribune found in an investigation.

(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Lagging other states Both Birthday Surprises were among 17 instant games whose combined results awarded a smaller share of grand prizes than similar games run under state management, or in other states studied by the Tribune. For comparable big-prize games begun and ended in Illinois in the six years before Northstar was hired, the state awarded 87.5 percent of the grand prizes the games were designed to pay out. That's in line with how other states have run their big-prize games. The Tribune sought data from states with the highest sales of instant tickets. Six states provided enough data from recent years for comparison. For grand prizes that cost lotteries $1 million or more to fund, New York awarded nearly 80 percent of them. In Pennsylvania, it was 83 percent. In Texas, it was 88 percent. Florida, Massachusetts and Ohio each had a perfect record: 100 percent. In Illinois, under Northstar, the rate was 59.6 percent. Other states' lottery officials said they would be worried about how their players might react to such a statistic in their states. ",

Scott Applewhite, AP) 2614 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 53 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The president of the United States can't exercise emergency powers without publicly declaring a state of emergency and notifying Congress, the Justice Department has concluded in a newly released legal opinion. That interpretation reverses a 34-year-old opinion from the Reagan-era Justice Department that held the National Emergencies Act of 1976 applied only to emergency powers that expressly required a presidential declaration. That opinion, if allowed to stand, could have allowed future presidents to exercise broad powers over the economy, the environment,\u00a0and the military without oversight\u00a0\u2014 or possibly even the knowledge of\u00a0\u2014 Congress. The new opinion came in a memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to the White House's top lawyer, and is binding on the executive branch unless rejected by the attorney general or the president.\u00a0The memo is dated Aug. 24 but was not publicly released until last week, suggesting the White House has signed off on the interpretation. It's unclear whether the opinion was prompted by any specific emergency, and the White House would not comment on why it requested the review. But the opinion noted that there had previously been \"conflicting guidance\" on the question. And it said the executive branch had never exercised an emergency power under an undeclared state of emergency since 1976. There are now 30 national emergencies now in effect, declared through proclamations and executive orders by presidents from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama. Under the National Emergencies Act, Congress is required to review each emergency every six months, but has never done so. The law also says that emergency declarations expire after a year unless renewed by the president. Special report: America's perpetual state of emergency Such emergencies are most often used to impose sanctions on foreign countries and freeze the assets of foreign nationals in the United States. But they can also be used to call up the national guard, waive environmental protections, change federal hiring and pay laws and suspend wage, health and safety protections for workers. Attorney Patrick Thronson identified 160 such powers in a 2014 article in the University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform . The issue confronted by the Obama Justice Department: Which of those powers require the president to declare a state of national emergency: All of them, or just those that specifically require a declaration? Thronson said even if Congress has never exercised meaningful oversight over the president's emergency powers, the opinion provides \"at least the possibility\" that Congress and the public would be aware of how the president is exercising them. \"This was a key concern for the framers of the legislation in the '70s. Congress did not appreciate until that point that substantial portions of government policy were being carried out on the basis of emergencies declared decades earlier,\" he said. But the Ford and Reagan administrations took a different view. \"Laws like the Defense Production Act of 1950, which do not require a Presidential declaration of emergency for their use, are not affected by this title \u2014 even though they may be referred to in a lay sense as 'emergency'\u00a0statutes.\" That was the testimony of President Gerald Ford's assistant attorney general \u2014 and future Supreme Court justice \u2014\u00a0Antonin Scalia, in 1976. In 1982, the Congress asked the Reagan administration for a report on what authorities the president had to deal with a severe energy disruption . The Justice Department said the president could call up the executive reserve\u00a0\u2014 a volunteer corps of professionals, union members and academics\u00a0\u2014 to serve in the Energy Department. And even though the law allows that action only \"during periods of emergency,\" the Justice Department said the president didn't need to declare an emergency and trigger the National Emergencies Act. Ted Olson, the assistant attorney general who wrote that opinion\u00a0said that opinion came in a footnote that was part of \"a very lengthy analysis of presidential authorities\" requested by Congress. \"Had Congress chosen to correct any misinterpretation of any of its enactments contained in the opinion, it was certainly in a position to do so during the succeeding 30-plus\u00a0years,\" Olson told USA TODAY in an email. \"But there may not have been any real occasion or impetus to do so.\" But Olson, who later served as the solicitor general under President George W. Bush, he also said he wouldn't second-guess the Obama administration opinion. \"I assume that the current OLC lawyers looked this over carefully and I have no reason at this distance in time, and without digging into the issues thoroughly, to doubt or fault their analysis,\" he said. 2614 CONNECT TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 53 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2h5Sa8k ",

In early October, they released a strongly worded statement saying they were \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\" The statement went on to say \"these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\" Shortly after that, WikiLeaks began posting emails hacked from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta's Gmail account. The slow drip of those emails, including transcripts of Clinton's remarks to Goldman Sachs, hung over the campaign in its closing weeks and proved embarrassing at times. Podesta said he spoke to the FBI about the hacking, and intelligence experts blamed Russia for that as well. Article continues after sponsorship Poll: Trump Needs To Choose Between Presidency And His Business \"We may be in, have crossed into a new threshold,\" said Lisa Monaco, the White House homeland security adviser, at a breakfast Friday morning hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, of the 2016 hacking. \"It is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after action, to understand what this means, what has happened and to impart those lessons learned, and that's what we're going to go about doing.\" Schultz said the review would look at \"all foreign actors and any attempt to interfere with our elections.\" He added, \"This isn't going to be a narrow dive; this is going to be a deep dive\" into this troubling pattern. He also noted the White House will aim to release as much of the review as it can appropriately to the public and will also brief Congress and other stakeholders. This news comes as Republican members of Congress are promising their own investigations into Russian hacking around the election. But all of that would be in direct conflict with the view of President-elect Donald Trump, who, in a debate earlier this year, questioned whether Russia was even behind it. ",

    "text": "Kesha on her eating disorder: 'When I was very sick...I kept hearing about how much better I was looking' Maeve McDermott , USATODAY 5:57 p.m. EST December 9, 2016 26 Shares Kesha attends the Billboard Women in Music 2016 event on December 9, 2016 in New York City. \u00a0(Photo: ANGELA WEISS, AFP/Getty Images) Even with her new music trapped\u00a0in a legal limbo, Kesha continues to make her voice heard. Taking the stage to accept the\u00a0Trailblazer Award at Billboard's Women in Music Awards in New York Friday, Kesha delivered a teary speech explaining why she continues to speak out about her eating disorder. \"I've realized through a long rollercoaster ride of ups and downs that if I'm lucky enough to have a voice someone will listen to, than I should use it for good, for truth,\" she said.\u00a0\"And that's why I've recently spoken openly about some of my struggles, including my crippling anxiety\u00a0and being\u00a0in recovery from an eating disorder, among many other things. And I know I'm not alone. These are struggles that millions of people\u00a0around the world deal with on a daily basis.\" The singer spoke\u00a0candidly about how, at the moments that she needed help most, she was hearing positive feedback about her dangerous weight loss. \"But the irony is, when I was very, very sick, and getting sicker, I kept hearing about how much better and better I was looking,\" she said.

And that's why I've decided to stand confident in my\u00a0ever-changing body, totally-imperfect\u00a0body, and try and live up to and practice the self-worth and self-love I preach in my music,\" she continued. And, like the rest of us, Kesha acknowledged\u00a0how she doesn't always wake up feeling flawless. \"I never dreamed of winning awards for talking honestly about uncomfortable things \u2014 I wanted everyone to like my songs, and think I looked pretty and that my videos were awesome. So it's\u00a0mind-blowing to be honored like this after the very public year I've had. I feel stuck, I feel sad, and quite frankly, I feel bloated,\" she joked.

    "text": "GOP's 'Obamacare' Repeal Path Worries Health Care Industry By ricardo alonso-zaldivar, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 9, 2016, 12:02 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Oct. 24, 2016, file photo, the HealthCare.gov 2017 web site home page as seen in Washington. One by one, key health care industry groups are telling the incoming Republican administration and Congress that it\u2019s not a good idea to repeal the 2010 health care law without clear plans to address the consequences. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) 0 Shares Email One by one, key health care industry groups are telling the incoming Republican administration and Congress that it's not a good idea to repeal the 2010 health care law without clear plans to address the consequences. Hospitals, insurers and actuaries \u2014 bean-counters who make long-range economic estimates \u2014 weighed in recently, and more interest groups are expected to make their views known soon. Representing patients, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network reminded lawmakers that lives are at stake. The concerns go beyond the obvious potential hardship for 20 million people covered by subsidized private insurance and expanded Medicaid under President Barack Obama's signature law. Hospitals say a stand-alone repeal would cost them billions, compromising their ability to serve local communities. Insurers say Congress must be careful not to create even more uncertainty and instability. Actuaries worry that the mere promise of an eventual replacement won't be enough to sustain the individual health insurance market. And the anti-cancer network is concerned that protection for people with pre-existing health conditions might be undermined or lost. Before the Affordable Care Act , it was common for insurers to deny coverage to people with a cancer diagnosis, even if successfully treated, or to charge them more. Also, uninsured people with cancer are more likely to be diagnosed late, when there's less chance of a cure. \"Replacement health care legislation that accompanies repeal needs to provide recognized patient protections that currently exist,\" Chris Hansen , the group's president, said in a statement. Republicans say they remain resolute in their determination to repeal \"Obamacare,\" but some also seem mindful of the potential political risks. The basic plan under GOP consideration involves repealing the health law next year, but delaying the effective date to allow Congress time to pass a replacement. That replacement presumably would do many of the things the Affordable Care Act does, such as subsidizing coverage and protecting people in poor health, but with less government regulation and without the unpopular \"individual mandate\" for most Americans to have coverage or risk fines. However, replacement legislation that covers a comparable number of people would still require billions in government financing and extensive regulations, a stumbling block for the most conservative Republicans. The path forward is complicated by the dynamics of the 2016 political campaign, which centered on personalities rather than policy. President-elect Donald Trump promised to repeal \"Obamacare,\" but his ideas for a replacement plan were more talking points than an actual plan. \"Public opinion seems to be shifting,\" said John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, an umbrella organization that includes doctors, businesses, unions, and religious groups. \"It's not clear when people say they want to 'repeal,' what they mean by that. It may mean they just want to get rid of the individual mandate.\" Rother believes the outcome ultimately hinges on a handful of GOP senators. \"Moderate Republicans are worried about the consequences,\" he said. His coalition has written Congress to express its concerns. Industry groups are giving lawmakers plenty to consider: \u2014 The two main hospital lobbies \u2014 the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals \u2014 released studies indicating more than $200 billion in potential losses for their members if the health law is repealed without restoring funding cuts that were used to finance coverage expansion. \"Losses of this magnitude cannot be sustained and will ... decimate hospitals' and health systems' ability to provide services, weaken local economies ... and result in massive job losses,\" the groups said in a letter to Trump. \u2014 America's Health Insurance Plans, the biggest insurer lobby, said its members need time, as well as an assurance that federal dollars will continue to flow, in order to successfully transition to a new system under different rules. It took the better part of three years once Obama's health law was passed to launch its major coverage expansion, and that was anything but smooth. Insurers said the new administration and Congress need to \"send strong signals\" that they're willing to maintain the current market through at least Jan. 1, 2019. \u2014 Perhaps the most sobering assessment comes from a little-known group, the American Academy of Actuaries, representing professionals who assess the financial stability of pension and health insurance programs. Actuaries, unlike hospitals and insurers, don't have a direct financial stake in the future of the health law. The group said delaying the effective date of a repeal while a replacement is worked out could create such uncertainty that it triggers a crisis for the individual health insurance market. That's where people who don't have job-based coverage can buy policies, including more than 10 million in government markets like HealthCare.gov and an estimated 9 million who purchase their plans independently. \"Significant market disruption could result, leading to millions of Americans losing their health insurance,\" the actuaries' group wrote Congress. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Stephen Bannon found inspiration in ancient thinkers, Ronald Reagan and Nazi propaganda Steve Bannon Evan Vucci / Associated Press Steven K. Bannon, the Breitbart News chief who was chairman of Donald Trump's campaign, will be a top advisor in the Trump White House. Steven K. Bannon, the Breitbart News chief who was chairman of Donald Trump's campaign, will be a top advisor in the Trump White House. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Matt Pearce In the 1990s, long before\u00a0 Stephen K. Bannon became the chairman of Breitbart News and\u00a0one of Donald Trump \u2019s top advisors, he was just another guy\u00a0in Beverly Hills who liked Shakespeare and wanted to make movies. The Navy veteran and former Goldman Sachs investment banker was a feverish reader who kept books neatly stacked on the floor of his condo that couldn\u2019t fit on his shelves. Bannon had the tastes of\u00a0a liberal-arts major, sampling ideas from ancient civilizations all over the world. He liked Sun Tzu\u2019s\u00a0\u201cArt of War\u201d and the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book, according to his former longtime writing partner, Julia Jones.\u00a0 \u201cBefore 9/11, he was different,\u201d said Jones, a liberal who fondly remembered discussing philosophy\u00a0with Bannon. \u201cHe talked about Plato and\u00a0Socrates all the time.\u201d At one point the pair developed a proposal for a TV show to feature philosophers from a wide range of traditions, including non-European\u00a0mystics and shamans. But Bannon, who kept a photo of Ronald Reagan over his desk, started\u00a0down a more hard-line\u00a0path of conservative thought after the 2001 terrorist attacks, according to those who knew him during his time in Hollywood.\u00a0 \u201cHe went further into a world of absolutes \u2014 \u00a0black and white, good versus evil,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe was so open to such a world of great thinkers.\u00a0I don\u2019t know how that same person could have chosen such a narrow path.\u201d Today, Bannon represents a new ideological force inside the Republican party ,\u00a0an antiestablishment\u00a0activist and businessman propelled from the fringes of the GOP to its very center \u2014 seen by his critics as the proverbial\u00a0barbarian who has breached the gates. Bannon is\u00a0Trump\u2019s choice for chief\u00a0White House strategist, a self-professed nationalist with a vision of reshaping\u00a0America\u2019s policies on immigration, trade and the economy, but whose\u00a0agenda and influence on\u00a0the president-elect\u00a0are little understood by the public. A survey of Bannon\u2019s intellectual influences over the years reveals\u00a0a voracious reader willing to expose himself to a range of international thinkers, but who holds hard-line, us-versus-them\u00a0views on immigration and Islam; a Roman Catholic who thinks of the world in terms of epic battles between\u00a0good and evil, who has been driven toward action by the Sept. 11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis;\u00a0a veteran of the Cold War and of Wall Street who believes America\u2019s military should be strong\u00a0and its capitalism more tender; and a Harvard-educated\u00a0agitator comfortable in the back rooms of the elite,\u00a0who has studied\u00a0propaganda to achieve his goal\u00a0of swaying\u00a0the masses. He went further into a world of absolutes \u2013 black and white, good versus evil. \u2014 Bannon's former writing partner, Julia Jones \u00a0Many left-leaning\u00a0critics have protested his selection as senior White House advisor and have\u00a0accused\u00a0him\u00a0of being a closet white supremacist and anti-Semite . (Bannon, who did not respond to interview requests submitted to the Trump\u00a0transition team, has denied such\u00a0assertions.) Bannon has repeatedly stated his\u00a0long-term goal: shatter the political establishment, including the conservative one,\u00a0and create\u00a0an unorthodox \u201ccenter-right\u201d populist movement based on nationalism and a more humane form of capitalism.\u00a0He seems to have found his vehicle for those goals in Trump, whose campaign Bannon joined in August. Bannon\u00a0has cultivated an archvillain image, recently declaring, \u201c Darkness is good ,\u201d and praising Dick Cheney,\u00a0Darth Vader\u00a0and Satan as emblems of power. (One \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor played Bannon by wearing a Grim Reaper costume.)\u00a0Bannon\u2019s remarks succeeded in further enraging his liberal critics, who see him as the master enabler of a demagogue.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) In the past,\u00a0Bannon has repeatedly expressed his affinity for the technique of\u00a0 Nazi propaganda filmmaker\u00a0Leni Riefenstahl , whose work in the 1930s glamorized the rise of Adolf Hitler. \u201cOne time we were in the office, and he said, \u2018I want to be the Leni Riefenstahl of George Bush,\u2019 and I was horrified,\u2019\u201d Jones said. (Jones said Bannon later amended his remark\u00a0to say he wanted to be the Riefenstahl of the GOP.) The filmmaker Tim Watkins, who approached Bannon around 2000 to create a documentary about Reagan, said Bannon introduced him to Riefenstahl\u2019s work, which many film students also study. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Watkins said of the content of Reifenstahl\u2019s work, \u201cbut you had to look at it as\u00a0the art it was and how it influenced the nation and the world.\u201d The ensuing documentary co-directed by Bannon and Watkins, \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d released in 2004, uses similar dramatic imagery, and\u00a0praises\u00a0Reagan as\u00a0\u201ca radical, with extreme views\u201d on government, while referring to America\u2019s fascist and communist adversaries simply as \u201cthe beast.\u201d\u00a0 The film also offers a clue as to\u00a0why Bannon seemed so at home in liberal Hollywood, where he would go on to create additional\u00a0conservative documentaries. A narrator praises\u00a0the Hollywood of the 1930s as \u201cthe most powerful crucible on Earth,\u201d\u00a0a \u201cbrutally efficient industrial process\u201d run by Jewish refugees with\u00a0\u201cruthlessness and uncompromising patriotism\u201d that\u00a0reinforced the values of Western civilization\u00a0with\u00a0stories of \u201corder versus chaos, good versus evil.\u201d Hollywood, in other words, was an ideological weapon. \u201cThat was mostly his writing and mostly him,\u201d said Jones, who was credited as a co-writer with Bannon on the film, and who said Bannon also admired the technique of liberal political filmmaker Michael Moore. (Both men share a fascination with populist messages and a disdain for business suits.) The Reagan documentary drew the attention of conservative provocateur Andrew Breitbart, who later\u00a0 called Bannon the Riefenstahl of the tea party movement. The pair fell into each other\u2019s\u00a0orbits.\u00a0 Bannon cited the 2008 financial crisis as another turning point that drove him deeper into conservative politics, like the Sept. 11 attacks and his military service during the Cold War. The 'alt-right' splinters as supporters and critics agree it was white supremacy all along \u00bb \u201cI come from a blue-collar, Irish Catholic, pro-Kennedy, pro-union family of Democrats,\u201d Bannon, who was born in Virginia,\u00a0 told Bloomberg Businessweek last year . \u201cI wasn\u2019t political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter [messed]\u00a0things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had [messed]\u00a0up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster.\u201d Breitbart\u2019s death in 2012 led to Bannon\u2019s installation as chairman of Breitbart News, a rabble-rousing conservative news site. At Breitbart, an editor, Joel Pollak, recalled seeing a \u201cstaggering collection of books\u201d at Bannon's desk, mostly about history, including some first editions. \u201cWe shared an interest in \u2018The Private Life of Chairman Mao\u2019\u00a0by Dr. Li Zhisui,\u201d Pollak said in an email.\u00a0\u201cThe most recent book I discussed with him was [Timothy] Snyder's new history of the Holocaust , \u2018Black Earth,\u2019\u00a0which argues that the Soviet destruction of its Eastern European neighbors eventually facilitated Hitler's Final Solution by creating a stateless, amoral environment.\u201d Stephen K.

Bannon talks with callers on his SiriusXM radio show in July. (Kirk Irwin / Getty Images) At Breitbart, Bannon dived into the populist realm\u00a0of right-wing radio and hosted a SiriusXM show, where\u00a0the Harvard Business School graduate occasionally\u00a0flashed\u00a0unorthodox reading habits. During one January program, he likened global migration to a \u201cCamp of the Saints,\u201d the title of a 1973 French novel about immigration that the Southern Poverty Law Center has called \u201ca racist fantasy about an invasion of France and the white Western world by a fleet of starving, dark-skinned refugees.\u201d The problem America faces, Bannon said in a 2014 speech at the Vatican , is \u201ca crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism,\u201d and\u00a0he outlined his belief that the West was in an existential struggle against \u201cjihadist Islamic fascism.\u201d In the same speech, Bannon criticized free-market capitalism as \u201ca capitalism that really looks to make people commodities\u201d and called for an \u201cenlightened capitalism\u201d that is \u201creally distributed among a middle class.\u201d\u00a0(In 2013, Pope Francis \u00a0 criticized capitalism for treating\u00a0people as\u00a0\u201cconsumer goods to be used and then discarded.\u201d Francis does not share Bannon\u2019s views on\u00a0Islam.) Bannon\u2019s moderator for the speech, Benjamin Harnwell of the Institute\u00a0for Human Dignity, a Christian think tank, said that Bannon\u2019s Catholicism had clearly influenced his views on capitalism. \u201cI think recognition of the imago Dei \u2014 that man is made in the image and likeness of God \u2014 runs all the way through Steve Bannon\u2019s thought in a sincere way,\u201d Harnwell said\u00a0in an email.\u00a0 Under Bannon's stewardship, Breitbart News has been criticized for running racist content \u00a0and\u00a0has attracted\u00a0a following among\u00a0white supremacists, some of whom see Bannon\u2019s nationalist views as a milder form of their own beliefs. But many of Bannon\u2019s associates have said they can\u2019t recall him saying anything explicitly\u00a0racist.\u00a0 \u201cIn all the years I knew him, he never talked about any eugenic or racial superiority,\u201d said Jones.\u00a0\u201cHe never even talked about a person\u2019s race or their religion.\u201d Since joining Trump\u2019s victorious campaign, Bannon has scarcely spoken at all publicly, and has moved out of the role of bashing the establishment to become one of its most powerful representatives. \u201cEight months ago, everybody could tell you Steve Bannon was one of the most opinionated people on Earth,\u201d said Watkins.\u00a0\u201cBut now you wouldn\u2019t know Steve\u2019s opinion about dinner.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 , Al Gore might have gotten played, \u00a0 South Korean lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, \u00a0and the American Dream is more elusive than ever, a study finds .

Tony Dejak/AP hide caption toggle caption Tony Dejak/AP Only 50 percent of kids born in the 1980s are earning more than their parents did at the same age, according to a new study that puts most of the blame on the narrow distribution of economic gains. Tony Dejak/AP The widening gap between rich and poor Americans has pushed the chances of children earning more money than their parents down to around 50 percent, economic researchers say. That's a sharp fall from 1940, when 90 percent of kids were destined to move up the income ladder. Describing an American dream that for many has faded into a less plentiful reality, Stanford economics professor Raj Chetty said in a news release , \"It's basically a coin flip as to whether you'll do better than your parents.\" The downward trend held true across the U.S. \u2014 and the steepest declines were seen among middle-class families, according to Chetty and his fellow researchers in the Equality of Opportunity Project . The proportion of U.S. children who go on to earn more than their parents has dropped sharply since 1940, when the rate topped 90 percent. Equality of Opportunity Project hide caption toggle caption Equality of Opportunity Project The proportion of U.S. children who go on to earn more than their parents has dropped sharply since 1940, when the rate topped 90 percent. Equality of Opportunity Project The study detailed \"absolute income mobility\" from one generation to the next by comparing the household income of 30-year-olds to what their parents made at the same age. The Stanford study used data from both the U.S. Census and anonymized Internal Revenue Service records to compile stats for people born between 1940 and 1984. Over that period, it became less likely that children born in every U.S. state would out-earn their parents, with the largest drops in upward mobility seen in Michigan, Illinois and other parts of the industrial Midwest. Article continues after sponsorship To unravel what caused the decline, the researchers tinkered with two variables \u2014 gross domestic product and the distribution of economic growth. In simulations, both stronger growth and more broadly distributed gains had positive effects \u2014 but the broader gains were far more influential. From the researchers' news release: \"When the economic growth rate was raised to the higher levels experienced in the 1940s and 1950s but the economic distribution mirrored today's highly uneven landscape, the estimated rate of absolute mobility rose to 62 percent. \"In contrast, when the economic growth rate was held at the low levels of 2 to 3 percent of recent decades, but the pieces of the economic pie were distributed more evenly as it was in the mid-20th century, then the fraction of children who ended up doing better than their parents climbed to 80 percent.\" \"The finding of this study implies that if we want to revive the American dream of increasing living standards across generations, then we'll need policies that foster more broadly shared growth,\" Chetty said. A map of the U.S. shows children's chances of moving from the bottom fifth of income levels to the top fifth. Equality of Opportunity Project hide caption toggle caption Equality of Opportunity Project A map of the U.S. shows children's chances of moving from the bottom fifth of income levels to the top fifth. Equality of Opportunity Project Results also vary depending on where children are raised. As their map of metro and rural areas in the U.S. shows, the researchers found large areas where kids had markedly better chances of moving from the bottom fifth of income levels to the top fifth. The study also found that children who are moved to a better environment get a sharp boost in their chance to reach economic success \u2014 and that the earlier such a move takes place, the greater the effect. Some cities have been able to buck the trend, with researchers citing Salt Lake City and Minneapolis as two places where children have a good chance to emerge from poverty. Such cities tend to share important qualities, the economists say: \"lower levels of residential segregation, a larger middle class, stronger families, greater social capital, and higher quality public schools.\" ",

USA TODAY Sports Penn State coach James Franklin celebrates after defeating the Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship college game. (Photo: Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports) 73 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE The national championship has yet to be decided: Clemson will meet Ohio State and Alabama will face Washington for the right to advance to Tampa on Jan. 9. But it\u2019s coaching-change season across college football, with dozens of head coaches and assistants on the move upon the conclusion of the regular season \u2013 with the rest staying put, many with a tidy new contract or extension in hand. For now, let\u2019s take a look back at the past three months and recognize those coaches who deserve praise for the way they handled the regular season. Here, in alphabetical order, are the 10 best coaching jobs of the 2016 season: Paul Chryst, Wisconsin With far more substance than flash, Chryst squeezed out a Big Ten Conference West Division crown and a Cotton Bowl berth despite what may have been the nation\u2019s toughest schedule: LSU out of conference in September, followed by Ohio State, Michigan, Nebraska, Iowa and Penn State in conference play. Bob Davie, New Mexico New Mexico\u2019s eight-win regular season marked the program\u2019s best finish as part of the Mountain West Conference since joining the league in 1999. It ended with the Lobos tied with Boise State and Wyoming atop the Mountain Division, thanks in large part to an option-based offense that keyed one of the nation\u2019s most devastating running games. The 8-4 mark heading into the postseason is the culmination of Davie\u2019s rebuilding project, which began to gather steam in 2014 before resulting in back-to-back bowl berths. How bad were things upon his arrival? UNM\u2019s three wins in November match the program\u2019s entire win total during his predecessor\u2019s three-year tenure. USA TODAY Sports' 2016 All-America college football teams P.J. Fleck, Western Michigan Fleck may end up staying at Western Michigan, which is remarkable given the nearly unprecedented nature of the Broncos\u2019 13-0 regular season. This was very likely the best team in the history of the Mid-American Conference, with an All-America headliner on offense in wide receiver Corey Davis and just enough defense to outlast all comers in a perfect run to the postseason. It\u2019s equally remarkable to consider the genesis of this year\u2019s breakthrough: WMU went 1-11 in Fleck\u2019s debut in 2011 while accumulating the talent needed to eventually stand atop the Group of Five ranks. Western Michigan coach P.J. Fleck on the sideline during his team's game against Toledo. \u00a0(Photo: Patrick Gorski, USA TODAY Sports) James Franklin, Penn State Franklin\u2019s most impactful coaching decision of the 2016 season actually came late in 2015, when he hired Joe Moorhead away from Fordham to be the Nittany Lions\u2019 offensive coordinator. With a rehabbed offense leading the way, Penn State notched an 11-2 finish complete with the program\u2019s first outright Big Ten title since 1994. The year will end in the Rose Bowl in a matchup against Southern California, with the winner perhaps vaulting into the top five heading into next season. Win or lose in Pasadena, however, the regular season proved that Franklin has PSU poised for national contention. Mike MacIntyre, Colorado Colorado\u2019s 11-win regular season has already earned MacIntyre well-earned praise as the Walter Camp Coach of the Year. The numbers say it all: CU won more games during the regular season than in MacIntyre\u2019s first three seasons combined, as many as from the past four seasons combined, and as many as the Buffaloes had posted in any two-year span since 2007-8. The Buffaloes won more games than the combined total of Mississippi and Mississippi State or Notre Dame and Texas. Won the same number of games as Oregon, UCLA and Michigan State \u2013 combined. MacIntyre was given a long leash to bring Colorado back to the forefront of college football and delivered. Urban Meyer, Ohio State Ohio State ended the year in unsurprising territory, facing off against Clemson in the Fiesta Bowl as part of the College Football Playoff field. That the Buckeyes returned to the Playoff might make this one of the finest coaching jobs of Meyer\u2019s entire career, perhaps on par with his title-winning team from 2014. Lest we forget, Ohio State had to replace 16 starters from last year\u2019s team, and typically had anywhere from 15 to 18 true or redshirt freshmen listed on its weekly depth chart. This youth and inexperience led to battles with consistency and production, particularly on offense, even as the Buckeyes raced to an 11-1 regular season. Like another coach on this list \u2013 see below \u2013 Meyer is too often overlooked when it comes to end-of-year accolades. Chris Petersen, Washington It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen so soon. Yet here we are. Just three years into his tenure, Petersen led Washington to 12 wins, the Pac-12 title and a spot against Alabama in the Peach Bowl. This should worry the rest of the conference: UW already stands atop the heap yet will be even stronger in 2017 and beyond. Don\u2019t be surprised. Washington hired the former Boise State coach for a reason, after all \u2013 to lead the Huskies team to conference and national titles. This fall has been a reminder: Petersen is one of the great coaches in college football. Washington coach Chris Petersen yells instructions to his team during the second half against Utah. \u00a0(Photo: Rick Bowmer, AP) Ken Niumatalolo, Navy OK, a quick rundown: Navy has lost 10 players to season-ending injury, including its starting quarterback and his eventual replacement, yet still managed to go 9-3 and win the American Athletic Conference West Division. And this isn\u2019t anything new. Last year, the Midshipmen went 11-2 despite underdoing a preseason staff shakeup at defensive coordinator. In comparison to 2016, that was a breeze. But despite this year\u2019s hurdles, Niumatalolo kept Navy battling for a spot in the Amway Coaches Poll and perhaps within a single win of the Cotton Bowl. Army-Navy is the can't-miss game that some must miss Matt Rhule, Temple (now at Baylor) The Owls\u2019 capped what may be the most successful regular season in program history by defeating Navy to capture the American title. That gives Temple 20 wins in the past two years, which in turn led Baylor to tap Rhule as its permanent successor to Art Briles. Temple won 10 games while nearly overhauling its entire defense \u2013 which remained among the nation\u2019s best in most categories \u2013 and sputtering out of the gate with losses to Army and Penn State in September. During his four seasons, Rhule went from 2-10 in 2013 and 6-6 in 2014 to a combined 20-7 during the past two years. Nick Rolovich, Hawaii Hawaii\u2019s six victories in Rolovich\u2019s first regular season constitute more than half of Norm Chow\u2019s overall win total during his disappointing four-year run. The Warriors\u2019 quick turnaround was keyed by an offensive resurgence: UH\u2019s 344 points \u2013 with a bowl game still to come \u2013 are already a program best since 2011. Next five:\u00a0Dabo Swinney, Clemson;\u00a0Clay Helton, Southern California;\u00a0Chris Creighton, Eastern Michigan;\u00a0Willie Taggart, South Florida (now at Oregon);\u00a0Dana Holgorsen, West Virginia.

Radio stations might be forced to pull dozens of top artists starting January 1st \u2014 or pay a $150,000 penalty per song, thanks to a contract spat now playing itself out in public. The artists are represented by a new boutique licensing company, Global Music Rights, and the repertoire at stake includes songs written or performed by stars such as Pharrell Williams, Adele, Drake, John Lennon, Smokey Robinson, Steve Miller, Taylor Swift, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, U2, and more. The group of over 70 songwriters accounts for around 7.5 percent of all songs on the radio. They include artists on labels owned by Universal Music Group, whose parent company owns NBC News.

Rather than each station having their own in-house expert who tries to make deals with every artist, most stations pay fees to RMLC to negotiate for them. After contract talks between the two broke down over Thanksgiving, RMLC sued GMR, accusing it of exerting \"monopoly power\" over its copyrights and seeking higher-than-market rates. In an escalating war of words, GMR this week shot back with its own lawsuit, calling RMLC an \"illegal cartel\" and accusing its members of colluding to keep artist rates low. \"Owners of terrestrial radio stations pay only about 4 percent of their revenue, a tiny fraction of their revenue, to the songwriters who create that music,\" said Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for GMR, in a statement. Meanwhile, streaming music services pay more, he said. For instance, digital streaming service Spotify, which costs less to run than a traditional terrestrial radio station, says it pays artists on average between $0.006 and $0.0084 each time one of their songs is played. Radio stations pay an estimated $0.000186 to $0.000372 per listener, according to estimates by David Touve, an Assistant Professor of Business at Washington & Lee University who studies the music industry. The suit contends that its songwriters aren't being compensated fairly and composers aren't financially encouraged to write new songs. Music publishers cheered GMR's move. \"For decades the archaic RMLC has operated as a monopoly that holds songwriters hostage to its below-market and artificially fixed rates,\" said National Music Publishers' Association President & CEO David Israelite in a statement. He commended GMR \"for holding the RMLC accountable for being a broadcasting bully.\" Charged words also appeared in RMLC's rebuttal, which called the suit \"bullying,\" \"baseless,\" and \"an obvious ploy designed to pressure RMLC.\" \"Courts have recognized, for many decades, that without regulation of their rates, performing rights organizations (PROs) like GMR are anticompetitive and violate the antitrust laws,\" said RMLC Executive Director Bill Velez in a statement. \"That is why all the other PROs (ASCAP, BMI and SESAC) are subject to rate controls.\" Broadcast lawyer David Oxenford said that rights groups like GMR need to have some kind of oversight otherwise radio stations lose the power to fully negotiate in \"all or nothing\" arrangements of artists packaged together. A similar 2012 suit by RMLC against the also relatively smaller and newer rights firm, SESAC, went RMLC's way and got SESAC under a rate agreement like BMI and ASCAP. But if this discord isn't resolved, \"radio stations could try to pull music by well-known artists,\" said Oxenford. Your favorite radio station could even turn from tunes to talk. \"Ultimately, we could see some radio stations changing from music to non-music formats as royalties get higher,\" he said.

(Photo: Stan Carroll/The Commercial Appeal) MEMPHIS\u00a0\u2014 Memphis has tied its record for the most homicides in one year after two people were killed Friday morning. The record for the city's homicides was last set in 1993 with 213 slayings. The deaths of a\u00a0man and a woman in two shootings\u00a0put\u00a0Memphis at that grim milestone with just a few weeks left in the year. Police responded to the first shooting, in which 59-year-old Jarvis Hinds was shot and killed,\u00a0just after 3 a.m. An hour later,\u00a0police were called to an apartment, where a\u00a023-year-old woman was found shot to death. \"This morning, I was awakened to the horrible news that we have reached 213 total homicides,\" said Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings in an emailed statement Friday. \"This means that 213 Memphians have been taken away before they could reach their full potential in life. 213 Memphians will not be here to enjoy the holiday season with their loved ones.\" Memphis reaches a grim milestone with 200 homicides Rallings blamed the violence on a combination of increased gang activity, access to guns and domestic-violence related incidents. \"It\u2019s even more heartbreaking to know that almost 50 percent\u00a0of these victims knew their assailants,\" he said.\u00a0\"These are family members, friends, neighbors, and known associates that were senselessly killed by someone that they loved or trusted.\" Rallings noted\u00a030 of the\u00a0deaths were domestic-violence related, 72 involved gangs and 173 were committed with guns. Friday's shootings were two of four homicides that\u00a0occurred in the city in less than\u00a024 hours. Thursday afternoon, police said\u00a033-year-old Montrail Williams was\u00a0shot and killed by his stepfather. About four hours later, 79-year-old Jerry Gibson\u00a0was found dead inside the record shop he owned . ",

By Angela Fritz December 9 at 1:12 PM Follow @angelafritz Forecast for next week: Brr. (Capital Weather Gang) Winter\u2019s first polar vortex blast,\u00a0already taking shape in the Arctic this weekend, targets\u00a0the Lower 48 next week.\u00a0By Tuesday, temperatures below zero will plunge south into the northern plains and Midwest. Over the course of a few\u00a0days, the cold air will\u00a0blast across the country to the Northeast. The northern tier has already seen a taste of what this winter has to offer \u2014 in fact, the region is already experiencing a significant cold snap. On Thursday morning, the temperature in Billings, Mont., dropped to minus-3. It was the first time the location saw a temperature below zero in 698 days, since Jan. 9, 2015 . Almost the entire state of North Dakota is under a wind chill advisory \u2014 the National Weather Service is calling for temperatures that\u00a0 feel like minus-35 . Next week\u2019s cold blast\u00a0will dive farther south and east. Weather forecast models are suggesting temperatures will nose-dive\u00a0in the Midwest. All of Minnesota and Wisconsin\u00a0\u2014 plus the Chicagoland area\u00a0\u2014\u00a0could see overnight lows plummet into negative territory: minus-15 in Minneapolis, minus-10 in Milwaukee and minus-5 in the Chicagoland area around Wednesday or Thursday. The forecast is 20 to 35 degrees below average for this time of year. Temperature departure from normal forecast for Thursday morning. (Capital Weather Gang) What will likely be the coldest air since last February will barge into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast late next week. Daytime temperatures from Washington to Boston will struggle to climb above freezing. Overnight lows will surely be in the single digits and teens, if not below zero in\u00a0parts of New England. Through Thursday, 75 percent of the Lower 48 will have experienced a temperature below freezing, including Texas, the Deep South and the Pacific Northwest, based on National Weather Service forecasts . The frigid air tied up in this polar vortex blast has its\u00a0 origins in Siberia and northern Canada . It will be the coldest air of the season so far for most of the United States. Future cold blasts may be more potent, but we haven\u2019t experienced this since last February. You can trace next week\u2019s cold air outbreak back to the Arctic. (weatherbell.com/CWG) The polar vortex is not a new thing \u2014 it\u2019s\u00a0a weather term that was popularized in 2014, though it\u2019s always been something meteorologists knew of and referred to among themselves. It\u2019s a very large, extremely cold air mass over the Arctic (the Antarctic has one, too). The concentrated area of cold air is bound by the jet stream, which is a current of fast-moving air at very high levels of the atmosphere. When the jet stream is strong and keeps the polar vortex area bottled up north, temperatures can fall to minus-100 degrees. The vortex is always present \u2014 even in the summer. But winter is when it really comes alive\u00a0\u2014 not only is Arctic air colder because of the lack of sunlight, this is also when the jet stream plunges south. When that happens, it allows the cold air to spill south, like a freezer with the door left open. Some of the most historic cold-air outbreaks of the past 30 years have been caused by the polar vortex diving south. Heavy snow, whiteout conditions, and frigid temperatures are hammering parts of the U.S. and forecasters predict that conditions will get worse next week. (Reuters) 3 ",

The watch is in effect from Saturday evening through late Sunday night for Cook, Lake, DeKalb, Kane, DuPage, Kendall and Will counties in Illinois and Lake County, Indiana, according to the weather service. A low pressure developing in the central plains will pass through northern Illinois over the weekend, enveloping a good portion of northeast Illinois, northern Indiana, much of Wisconsin and lower Michigan Saturday night, according to WGN-TV's Chicago Weather Center . Four or more inches could fall north of interstate 80 by Sunday morning. As the center of the low pressure passes later Sunday, an additional four inches or more of snow is expected to fall \u2013 again most of it north of Interstate 80. By early Monday morning, areas north of Interstate 80 could end up with well over six inches of snow. Snowfall totals for south of Interstate 80 is a little more uncertain, with the possibility of rain mixed with the snow. The weather service warns of hazardous, snow-covered roads and low visibility. The high Saturday is expected to be near 23 and on Sunday near 32, the weather service said. More snow is in the forecast for Tuesday but nothing like the weekend storm, according to the weather service. Snow this weekend ",

White House counterterrorism advisor Lisa Monaco told reporters that the results of the report would be shared with lawmakers and others. Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. Monaco used careful language, calling it a \"full review of what happened during the 2016 election process.\" Related: U.S. Publicly Blames Russia for Hacking But since the U.S. government has already said that all 17 intelligence agencies agree Russia was behind the hacks, Monaco's meaning was clear.

A senior intelligence official with direct knowledge told NBC News it is \"complex but clear.\" Another person who has seen the evidence believes it is \"enough to get some of the Russians indicted tomorrow.\" Sean Kanuck, who was the national intelligence officer for cyber issues with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence until this spring, said that the government had to have been very certain of its evidence to point a finger at Russia. Said Kanuck, \"Having led many of those attribution assessments of prior events for the intelligence community, I'm well aware of the level of research and analysis that goes into those kinds of statements and the level of confidence that would be required before such a national level statement would be made publicly.\" But intelligence officials are wary about disclosing information that can show Russia's involvement, fearful that doing so will compromise sensitive sources and methods. Republicans in Congress, including Lindsey Graham and John McCain, have indicated they will support efforts by Democrats to investigate the Russian hacks and other interference in the election. On Thursday, McCain, Graham, Marco Rubio and nine other GOP senators joined 15 Democratic senators in calling on Trump to maintain its support for Ukraine \"in the face of Russian aggression.\" Play ",

Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press The exterior of the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. The exterior of the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press) David G. Savage Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump is set to take an oath next month to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d But a previously\u00a0obscure provision in the\u00a0the nation\u2019s founding document\u00a0has now become the focus of special attention because of Trump\u2019s worldwide real estate holdings and business ventures. Known as the \u201cemoluments clause,\u201d the provision says \u201cno person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress , accept of any present, Emolument, Office or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign state.\u201d The word emolument\u00a0was used often in the 18th century to refer to the compensation or profit that would go with holding an office.\u00a0Beyond that, the precise meaning of the ban\u00a0remains in\u00a0question because, unlike other parts of the Constitution, it has not been interpreted in the courts. But as long as Trump and his family retain ownership in business enterprises that involve\u00a0foreign governments, state-owned entities or foreign government officials, the Constitution\u2019s ban on \u201cemoluments\u201d is likely to hang over his presidency. Here\u2019s a closer look at the provision and what it means. Why was this provision included in the Constitution? Because the framers feared foreign influence, in particular wealthy Europeans such as kings and princes, trying to exert influence or even control over the new nation.\u00a0When Alexander Hamilton explained why it was decided the president would be elected through specially chosen state \u201celectors\u201d who held no office, he pointed to \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d by interfering in the presidential race. Officeholders could be \u201ctampered with\u201d or \u201cprostituted,\u201d Hamilton explained in \u00a0No. 68 of the Federalist Papers, but the newly named electors would be free of the \u201ccorrupting\u201d influence from abroad.\u00a0 And the framers knew of the potentially corrupting influence of foreign gifts. When Benjamin Franklin, the first U.S. ambassador to France, decided to return home in 1784, King Louis XVI gave the beloved American a gold case with a portrait of the French monarch,\u00a0encircled by 408 diamonds.\u00a0When John Jay was sent to Spain for negotiations, the king presented him with a horse. The new Constitution let ambassadors keep such \u201cpresents,\u201d but only if they were disclosed and Congress gave its consent. Trump's victory assures a conservative majority on the Supreme Court \u00bb How does this prohibition apply, if at all, to Trump\u2019s business holdings? Of course outright\u00a0gifts would be banned. But many legal experts agree that it would also violate the Constitution if, for instance, the state-owned Bank of China decided to\u00a0forgive its multimillion-dollar loan against a Trump office tower in New York. Such a sweetheart deal would certainly look as though the president had accepted a \u201cpresent\u201d from a foreign state. But lawyers disagree over whether other business transactions could be considered violations. If, for example, foreign diplomats visiting Washington now decide to stay at the new Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, is that a routine business decision or a foreign gift to the new president? Indeed, there have already been reports of numerous groups, including some from abroad, opting to hold events or stay at the Old Post Office building. Some\u00a0ethics experts and lawyers say these transactions amount to violations if it appears the foreign officials are staying at Trump\u2019s hotel to curry favor with the new president. But many other lawyers argue that ordinary business transactions of this sort are not gifts or presents.\u00a0If a visiting diplomat pays what the hotel charges for other guests, that is a merely payment for a service, not a \u201cpresent\u201d to the company\u2019s owner, they say. But there is a considerable\u00a0gray area. What if a diplomat decides to book an entire floor or the entire Trump Hotel\u00a0for a party? What if a state-owned bank shaves a couple of points off the interest rate of a loan to a Trump entity, or agrees\u00a0to let a monthly payment slip? What if a Persian Gulf prince agreed to invest in a Trump venture and paid an exorbitant price for what some might view as a risky venture. Brianne Gorod, a lawyer with the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive group, said the ban should be interpreted broadly to cover business deals. \u201cThe framers had a deep and abiding concern for corruption, and the word \u2018emolument\u2019 had a broad meaning to encompass profit of any kind,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Trump is trading on his name, there is no exception for \u2018fair market\u2019 deals. I think there is a strong argument he is ineligible to serve as president if he is receiving these emoluments.\u201d Erik Jensen, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said he believed earlier this year that the \u201cemoluments\u201d ban would cause a problem for Hillary Clinton because foreign officials had given money to the Clinton Foundation. He agreed that it is hard to interpret the clause because the \u201cfounders weren\u2019t thinking of the sorts of business structures and transactions\u00a0we have now. My bottom line is the clause\u2019s underlying concern is to prevent government officials from\u00a0having divided loyalties, so it should be interpreted broadly. If there\u2019s any appearance of impropriety, a reasonable official should stay far away from a suspect arrangement.\u201d Isn\u2019t\u00a0there a question about whether the clause even applies to the president? It\u2019s a subject of some debate, though generally presidents have acted as though it does. Some scholars say the drafters of the Constitution intended the ban to apply only to appointed officers of the United States, not elected officials. When Hamilton listed the officers of the new government, he did not include the president or members of Congress. And when President Washington was given gifts by visiting diplomats, he kept them and did not ask for consent from Congress.\u00a0 Washington lawyer Jan W. Baran, who advises Republicans on ethics laws, said he doubts the foreign emoluments clause applies to the president. Federal\u00a0conflict-of-interest laws specifically exempt the president and vice president, he said. \u201cPresident-elect Trump has no legal obligation to do anything with his financial holdings,\u201d Baran said. But he will probably \u201cstep away from the management of his companies\u201d because of a \u201cdesire to retain public confidence in his judgment and performance as president.\u201d \u00a0That will satisfy most voters, but probably won\u2019t stop the criticism, he said. \u201cTrump is a very rich and very successful deal-maker. All of that was known before the election and may in fact be one of the primary reasons he was elected. The voters will not punish him for being and staying rich,\u201d Baran said. But since at least the 19th century, U.S. presidents, including President Obama , have acted as though the ban applies to them. \u00a0 Does the \u201cemoluments\u201d ban apply only to foreign money? No. A separate provision of the Constitution forbids the president from taking extra compensation from the United States government or any state. It says he shall \u201creceive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished\u201d while he is in office, and he \u201cshall not receive within that period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.\u201d \u00a0 This means a president may not receive a bonus from a state such as Texas for doing a good job, or\u00a0more significantly, receive more\u00a0money from the federal government. This provision could be invoked by critics of the new president if, for example, the Trump Organization sells products or services to federal agencies or if U.S. taxpayers are charged for renting space at Trump properties or paying the cost of operating his airplane. During the campaign, Trump frequently favored his own properties for events and meetings, charging his campaign for the use of them.\u00a0 How has the provision been interpreted in the past? Courts have not ruled on claims that the president has violated the ban on emoluments, but the Justice Department \u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has issued internal opinions interpreting its meaning and stressing that it\u00a0applies only to foreign governments, not to other foreign entities. In 1994, the OLC advised\u00a0U.S. scientists on leave in Canada that they may accept payment to teach at a university, but only if the school was\u00a0independent of the government. And in 2009, the OLC advised Obama that he was bound by the ban on foreign emoluments because \u201cthe\u00a0President surely \u2018holds an Office of Profit or Trust,\u2019\u00a0but its lawyers said he nonetheless could accept the Nobel Prize , valued at $1.4 million, because the Nobel Committee is a private foundation, not a foreign state.\u00a0 So who would decide\u00a0if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause? The answer may depend on the political\u00a0system, not the legal system. It is not clear whether the emolument ban\u00a0may be enforced privately through the courts. Litigants are required to have standing, which means they are suing over a personal injury of some sort.\u00a0Gorod and other lawyers say that a business owner who suffers losses because of favorable treatment for Trump\u2019s business may have a claim. \u201cThis is uncharted territory, but if I were a competitor, I would bring that suit,\u201d she said. But the Supreme Court has ruled\u00a0that taxpayers who are upset about a government policy or a U.S. official do not have standing to sue in court.\u00a0 The only certain remedy for ousting a president who violates the Constitution is impeachment by the majority of the House of Representatives and a conviction by two-thirds of the Senate. A congressional committee would have grounds to investigate if there were evidence of corrupt deals involving Trump-related businesses. And in a future Congress, such an investigation might gain steam if Democrats win a majority in the Senate or House. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Thursday at 95 , Al Gore might have gotten played, \u00a0 South Korean lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, \u00a0and the American Dream is more elusive than ever, a study finds .

Now, authorities say, this synthetically boosted narcotic has become even more dangerous. The Cook County Medical Examiner's office said Friday that for the first time it found the synthetic opioid carfentanil in the system of a Chicago man who died of an overdose in September. Normally used as an elephant tranquilizer, carfentanil is 10,000 times more potent than morphine; a batch of heroin laced with the additive caused 174 overdoses in six days in Cincinnati earlier this year. \"We've been hearing about it and now it's here,\" said Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Ponni Arunkumar.

Dozens of women applicants showed up to the Chicago Fire Department Academy South on\u00a0May 6, 2013 to apply to be firefighters after winning a lawsuit that changes the test that is more fair towards women. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy The city is set to pay a group of African-American women $3.8 million as part of a settlement of a long-running federal lawsuit claiming that Chicago Fire Department tests were discriminatory. The City Council Finance Committee will consider the payment Monday. It's the latest payout from the city because of allegations of racial or gender bias in hiring practices at the Fire Department in lawsuits that have gone back decades and already have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The suit was filed in 2012 by dozens of women who said they were subjected to strength tests that were not \"'job related' for the firefighter/EMT position, or 'consistent with business necessity' of the city,\" according to the suit. The city settled the case in 2015 and continues to make payments. The 12 women who would share the $3.8 million also were part of a larger group of African Americans who successfully sued the city in a separate case, alleging racial discrimination in a Fire Department written test given to job candidates in 1995. The city fought that case to the U.S. Supreme Court and in 2011 was ordered to pay a $30 million settlement to thousands of African Americans who lost out on becoming firefighters because of the written test. The city also was ordered to hire 111 members of what became known as the \"Lewis class\" of black firefighter candidates and pay them $15 million in pension money they would have earned had they been hired decades earlier. But as part of their hiring, the 12 women were then forced to try to pass a physical strength test that already was the focus of another lawsuit by women who said it was unfair. ",

    "text": "Senate Democrats end coal protest to avert government shutdown Erin Kelly , USAToday 7:05 p.m. EST December 9, 2016 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., left front, with his GOP leadership team (Photo: Yuri Gripas, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 With little time to spare before the government was set to run out of money, Democratic Senators agreed Friday night not to block\u00a0a stop-gap funding bill Friday to keep the government open through April 28. Federal agencies would have run out of money at midnight Friday if the Senate had been unable to move the spending bill. House members quickly left town Thursday after their 326-96 vote in favor of the legislation, and there were few options left for the Senate to change it. However, Senate leaders' efforts to quickly\u00a0pass the legislation after the House vote were thwarted by Democratic senators from coal-mining states, who objected to a provision that extends only through April a health care program for retired miners that was set to expire on Dec. 31. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and others\u00a0said the health care program should be extended at least one year to give retired miners and their family more certainty and keep the government's promise to care for them under the United Mine Workers Association 1983 Benefit Plan. \"We made commitments to them,\" Manchin said. \"We've been working and fighting and really clawing for this ...I guess we're supposed to be happy with (a four-month extension). But we're not. I'm sorry, we're not.\" Brown said it's difficult for miners and their families to make doctors' appointments when they don't know for sure how long their benefits will last. \"It's just cruel and unusual punishment,\" Brown said, vowing to continue the fight next year. The coal-state Democrats are from Republican-leaning states where working-class families voted in large numbers for Republicans in the last election. Manchin said he was encouraged by promises from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to work with his fellow coal-state senators next year to extend the miners' benefits beyond April. But Manchin said he doesn't trust House leaders to support those efforts. Under Senate rules, individual senators have the power to delay action on the Senate floor by refusing to agree to a fast-tracked vote. However, the Democratic senators dropped their demands Friday night when it became clear that Senate leaders were not going to change the bill. \"We're not going to shut down the government,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who will serve as minority leader in the new Congress. \"We've made our point.\" McConnell said it would have made no sense to force a government shutdown over the issue when the bill prevents miners from losing their benefits at the end of this year. \"This is a good time to take 'yes' for an answer,\"\u00a0McConnell said as he urged senators to pass the spending package. \"We should pass the (government funding bill) without delay. Because if we don't pass (it), the health benefits will go away at the end of this month.\" In addition to providing $45 million to extend the miners' benefits through April, the bill provides about $170 million to help clean up Flint's lead-contaminated drinking water system, which has poisoned the city's children. The legislation contains $4.1 billion in flood relief for Louisiana, West Virginia and Texas and for states damaged by\u00a0Hurricane Matthew, including North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. The bill\u00a0also includes initial funding for the newly passed 21st Century Cures Act,\u00a0including\u00a0$500 million for states to combat\u00a0addiction to painkillers. The overall spending level for defense programs is $8 billion above the rate in the bill that was set to expire at midnight, said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. However, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said it's misleading for lawmakers to tout that as an increase since it's actually $6 billion less than the amount Congress authorized in the recently passed National Defense Authorization Act. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said U.S. troops are still being short-changed as they try to battle the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. \"So this is Washington,\" McCain said bitterly. \"Democrats filibuster funding for our troops in a political game to extort more funding for pet domestic programs. Republicans feign outrage. Then those same Republicans return months later to negotiate a continuing resolution that gives Democrats the domestic spending increases they always wanted, does so by\u2026 cutting funds for defense\u2026What a sham. What a fraud. And is there any wonder why the American people hold us in such contempt?\" ",

    "text": "Trump looks to oil industry ally, GOP stalwart to run Interior Donald Trump Holds meets with Cathy McMorris Rodgers Drew Angerer / Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) meet Nov. 20 at Trump International Golf Clubin Bedminster Township, N.J. President-elect Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) meet Nov. 20 at Trump International Golf Clubin Bedminster Township, N.J. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Evan Halper and William Yardley Contact Reporters Donald Trump is expected to choose Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, a GOP leader and strident advocate for increased oil and gas drilling on federal lands, to head the Interior Department. McMorris Rodgers, the highest ranking Republican woman in the House of Representatives, would take the helm of a 70,000-person agency that manages hundreds of millions of acres of federal lands, including the National Parks system, according to news reports citing unnamed transition officials. Transition officials declined to comment. She would be charged with implementing Trump\u2019s plan to aggressively roll back many of the environmental restrictions the Obama administration has placed on federal lands. The\u00a0president-elect has said he wants to open up substantially more land\u00a0for drilling and mining. \u00a0 A week that started with Trump hinting he is keeping an open mind on environmental issues by meeting climate crusaders Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio\u00a0ended with him settling on unwavering enemies of the environmental lobby to manage federal lands at Interior and to run the Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump said he will name Oklahoma Atty. Gen.\u00a0Scott Pruitt to lead McMorris Rogers has also expressed skepticism of climate science and\u00a0worked against most of the major federal conservation measures supported by the environmental lobby since first getting elected to the House 11 years ago. She is an establishment Republican who supported Trump in the general election and shares his view that big energy companies should have more access to the lands under federal stewardship. McMorris Rodgers has\u00a0repeatedly voted against environmental protections. Defenders of Wildlife gave her a zero out of a possible 100 for her lifetime voting record; the League of Conservation Voters scored her\u00a04 out of 100. The  congresswoman supports opening the Atlantic Ocean for drilling, aligns\u00a0closely with timber companies seeking to expand logging\u00a0and has fought efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on federal holdings.\u00a0McMorris Rodgers also voted to make it easier to drill in Native American lands. Defenders of Wildlife Chief Executive Jamie Rappaport called the pick \u201canother signal from the Trump administration that environmental protections will likely be rolled back and that America\u2019s land, water and wildlife are up for sale.\u201d\u00a0 The Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement that McMorris Rodgers has \u201cattempted to interfere with the use of science in public policy\u201d and \u201csponsored legislation that would erode the scientific foundation of the Endangered Species Act.\u201d If confirmed, McMorris Rodgers would continue the tradition of a having a Westerner run the Interior department, reflecting\u00a0the vast acreage of federal land in the West. While environmental issues are not the profile for which she is known, McMorris Rodgers has been a trusted advisor to Trump, serving as one of the co-chairs of his transition team and working with Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, on childcare policies. She is a polished and steadfast leader of the GOP caucus in the House, where she is often a point person representing the party before the media. Her experience brokering deals, rallying fellow Republicans\u00a0and staying on message would help Trump build bridges on Capitol Hill and project an orderly pursuit of his agenda. But if confirmed, McMorris Rodgers will find herself at the center of the nation\u2019s most contentious environmental battles, facing an organized resistance that already is mobilized to fight Trump\u2019s plans.\u00a0 She will also face confrontations with Native American tribes who are assertively challenging energy production on their lands. That battle has been crystallized by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe of North Dakota\u2019s protest against the Dakota Access pipeline. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the agency making final decisions in that issue, Interior more than once has expressed support for paying more attention to the tribe\u2019s concerns. On Sunday, when the Corps said it would look at alternate routes for the pipeline, a victory for the Standing Rock Sioux, Obama\u2019s Interior Department applauded the move. Earlier this year, it issued an order to ensure that Native communities have an active role in the management of public lands that \u201chave special geographical, historical and cultural connections to the tribes.\u201d It has approved a plan to prevent oil and gas development on Montana land that is important to the Blackfeet tribe. Just this week, Obama cited Native American concerns in issuing an executive order protecting a wide stretch off the coast of western Alaska from energy development.\u00a0 But Trump has signaled he will work to lift such protections. McMorris Rodgers, whose district includes all or parts of several reservations, has been on opposite sides of tribes on some issues. Her steady support of hydropower has put her in opposition to some tribes that want to remove four dams from the Lower Snake River to help endangered salmon. As secretary, she could face pressure for dam removal elsewhere, including on the Klamath River in Oregon and California, where tribes want dams removed. But some tribes have applauded her efforts, particularly those seeking to lure logging or energy production jobs to their land, such as the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which are partly in her district. \u201cWhile we have not always agreed with Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers on every issue, she has always listened to and considered our perspective,\u201d said a statement from the Colville tribes.

By Adam Entous , Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller December 9 at 7:36 PM Follow @nakashimae Follow @gregpmiller The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter. Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton\u2019s chances. \u201cIt is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia\u2019s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,\u201d said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. \u201cThat\u2019s the consensus view.\u201d The Obama administration has been debating for months how to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions, with White House officials concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton\u2019s campaign. In September, during a secret briefing for congressional leaders, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) voiced doubts about the veracity of the intelligence, according to officials present. The Post's Ellen Nakashima goes over the events and discusses the hacker groups responsible. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russian hacking. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they interfered\u201d in the election, he told Time magazine this week. The hacking, he said, \u201ccould be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d The CIA shared its latest assessment with key senators in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill last week, in which agency officials cited a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources. Agency briefers told the senators it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The CIA presentation to senators about Russia\u2019s intentions fell short of a formal U.S. assessment produced by all 17 intelligence agencies. A senior U.S. official said there were minor disagreements among intelligence officials about the agency\u2019s assessment, in part because some questions remain unanswered. For example, intelligence agencies do not have specific intelligence showing officials in the Kremlin \u201cdirecting\u201d the identified individuals to pass the Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, a second senior U.S. official said. Those actors, according to the official, were \u201cone step\u201d removed from the Russian government, rather than government employees. Moscow has in the past used middlemen to participate in sensitive intelligence operations so it has plausible deniability. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has said in a television interview that the \u201cRussian government is not the source.\u201d The White House and CIA officials declined to comment. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) says he wants to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election, among claims that Donald Trump's rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) On Friday, the White House said President Obama had ordered a \u201cfull review\u201d of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as pressure from Congress has grown for greater public understanding of exactly what Moscow did to influence the electoral process. \u201cWe may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,\u201d Obama\u2019s counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Obama wants the report before he leaves office Jan.\u00a020, Monaco said. During her remarks, Monaco didn\u2019t address the latest CIA assessment, which hasn\u2019t been previously disclosed. Seven Democratic senators last week asked Obama to declassify details about the intrusions and why officials believe that the Kremlin was behind the operation. Officials said Friday that the senators specifically were asking the White House to release portions of the CIA\u2019s presentation. This week, top Democratic lawmakers in the House also sent a letter to Obama, asking for briefings on Russian interference in the election. U.S. intelligence agencies have been cautious for months in characterizing Russia\u2019s motivations, reflecting the United States\u2019 long-standing struggle to collect reliable intelligence on President Vladi\u00admir Putin and those closest to him. In previous assessments, the CIA and other intelligence agencies told the White House and congressional leaders that they believed Moscow\u2019s aim was to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system. The assessments stopped short of saying the goal was to help elect Trump. On Oct.\u00a07, the intelligence community officially accused Moscow of seeking to interfere in the election through the hacking of \u201cpolitical organizations.\u201d Though the statement never specified which party, it was clear that officials were referring to cyber-intrusions into the computers of the DNC and other Democratic groups and individuals. Some key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there\u2019s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence \u2014 even now,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that\u2019s it.\u201d [ U.S. investigating potential covert Russian plan to disrupt elections ] Though Russia has long conducted cyberspying on U.S. agencies, companies and organizations, this presidential campaign marks the first time Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election, the officials said. The reluctance of the Obama White House to respond to the alleged Russian intrusions before Election Day upset Democrats on the Hill as well as members of the Clinton campaign. Within the administration, top officials from different agencies sparred over whether and how to respond. White House officials were concerned that covert retaliatory measures might risk an escalation in which Russia, with sophisticated cyber capabilities, might have less to lose than the United States, with its vast and vulnerable digital infrastructure. The White House\u2019s reluctance to take that risk left Washington weighing more limited measures, including the \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d approach of publicly blaming Moscow. By mid-September, White House officials had decided it was time to take that step, but they worried that doing so unilaterally and without bipartisan congressional backing just weeks before the election would make Obama vulnerable to charges that he was using intelligence for political purposes. Instead, officials devised a plan to seek bipartisan support from top lawmakers and set up a secret meeting with the Gang of 12 \u2014 a group that includes House and Senate leaders, as well as the ranking members of both chambers\u2019 committees on intelligence and homeland security. Obama dispatched Monaco, FBI Director James B. Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to make the pitch for a \u201cshow of solidarity and bipartisan unity\u201d against Russian interference in the election, according to a senior administration official. Specifically, the White House wanted congressional leaders to sign off on a bipartisan statement urging state and local officials to take federal help in protecting their voting-registration and balloting machines from Russian cyber-intrusions. Though U.S. intelligence agencies were skeptical that hackers would be able to manipulate the election results in a systematic way, the White House feared that Moscow would attempt to do so, sowing doubt about the fundamental mechanisms of democracy and potentially forcing a more dangerous confrontation between Washington and Moscow. In a secure room in the Capitol used for briefings involving classified information, administration officials broadly laid out the evidence U.S. spy agencies had collected, showing Russia\u2019s role in cyber-intrusions in at least two states and in hacking the emails of the Democratic organizations and individuals. And they made a case for a united, bipartisan front in response to what one official described as \u201cthe threat posed by unprecedented meddling by a foreign power in our election process.\u201d The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests. According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics. Some of the Republicans in the briefing also seemed opposed to the idea of going public with such explosive allegations in the final stages of an election, a move that they argued would only rattle public confidence and play into Moscow\u2019s hands. McConnell\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. After the election, Trump chose McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, as his nominee for transportation secretary. Some Clinton supporters saw the White House\u2019s reluctance to act without bipartisan support as further evidence of an excessive caution in facing adversaries. \u201cThe lack of an administration response on the Russian hacking cannot be attributed to Congress,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who was at the September meeting. \u201cThe administration has all the tools it needs to respond. They have the ability to impose sanctions. They have the ability to take clandestine means. The administration has decided not to utilize them in a way that would deter the Russians, and I think that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Philip Rucker contributed to this report. Read more: ",

    "text": "By Scott Clement and Lenny Bernstein December 9 at 1:15 PM Follow @sfcpoll Follow @LennyMBernstein UNNATURAL CAUSES | SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: Since the turn of this century, death rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women. In this series , The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Respondents who took part in The Washington Post-Kaiser survey on long-term, opioid painkiller use share their experiences of living with pain. (Monica Akhtar,Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post) One-third of Americans who have taken prescription opioids for at least two months say they became addicted to, or physically dependent on, the powerful painkillers, according to a new Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey . Virtually all long-term users surveyed said that they were introduced to the drugs by a doctor\u2019s prescription, not by friends or through illicit means. But more than 6 in 10 said doctors offered no advice on how or when to stop taking the drugs. And 1 in 5 said doctors provided insufficient information about the risk of side effects, including addiction. The survey raises sharp questions about the responsibility of doctors for an epidemic of addiction and overdose that has claimed nearly 180,000 lives since 2000. Opioid deaths surged to more than 30,000 last year, according to new data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with deaths from heroin alone surpassing the toll from gun homicides. Doctors have been widely blamed for sparking the crisis by overprescribing highly addictive opioids to treat everyday pain. The survey suggests that they are still doing too little to stop it. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it 100\u00a0percent?\u201d demanded Gary Mendell, founder of Shatterproof, a grass-roots group dedicated to reducing addiction in the United States, referring to the share who say doctors have counseled them on stopping the medication. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that it\u2019s not 100\u00a0percent.\u201d Patrice A. Harris, chairwoman of the American Medical Association\u2019s Board of Trustees and chair of its task force to reduce opioid abuse, acknowledged that doctors could do more to counsel patients on avoiding addiction. \u201cThe doctors that I have talked to are discussing this with their patients,\u201d Harris said. But, citing the survey, she added: \u201cWe could certainly do a better job.\u201d Despite the high rate of dependence, the poll finds that a majority of long-term opioid users say the drugs have dramatically improved their lives. Opioids relieve pain that is otherwise in\u00adtrac\u00adtable, they said in follow-up interviews, allowing them to walk, work and pursue other activities. Fully two-thirds of users surveyed said relief is well worth the risk of addiction. People living with opioid users tend to have a darker view of the drugs\u2019 effects. While one-third of users say they are hooked, more than half of people living with them suspect addiction, the survey found. Family members are also far more likely to say the drugs have damaged the users\u2019 physical and mental health, finances and personal relationships. White women living in less-urban areas have seen a stark increase in death rates \u0097 as much as 40 percent in some age groups. View Graphic White women living in less-urban areas have seen a stark increase in death rates \u0097 as much as 40 percent in some age groups. Still, the survey\u2019s findings highlight a fundamental conflict: While the drugs are a scourge for many, they are a godsend to others, especially the estimated 100 million Americans who live in chronic pain. Efforts by policymakers to restrict use have been met with outrage. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that no one should ever be on these pills,\u201d but most people would be \u201chealthier and more functional if they were off them,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden, who this spring urged doctors to sharply limit the number of pills they prescribe. \u201cThe bottom line here is that prescription opiates are as addictive as heroin. They\u2019re dangerous drugs,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cYou take a few pills, you can be addicted for life. You take a few too many and you can die.\u201d Opioid abuse \u2014 both prescription painkillers and their chemical cousins, heroin and fentanyl \u2014 is the main cause of rising death rates among middle-aged white Americans, particularly women in rural areas. It also has contributed to the first overall decline in U.S. life expectancy at birth in more than two decades, the government reported Thursday. [ CDC issues guidelines for prescribing opioids ] In 2014, U.S. doctors wrote 240 million prescriptions for opiates, enough for every adult to have their own bottle of pills. The CDC estimated that about 2.1 million Americans are addicted to legal narcotics. In the first-ever guidelines on opioids for physicians, the CDC in March urged doctors to try nonnarcotic methods before offering patients pills containing oxycodone, hydrocodone and other opioids. The guidelines noted that there is little evidence that opioids are effective beyond 12 weeks. \u201cThree days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed,\u201d the guidelines say. But many people take the drugs much longer. In the past two years, about 5\u00a0percent of American adults have used prescription opioids for at least two months, the poll found; about half of those report taking the drugs for two years or more. For the survey, one of the most comprehensive polls of long-term opioid users to date, The Post and Kaiser interviewed 622 people who said that they had taken narcotic painkillers for at least two months over the past two years. The survey also included 187 people who said they share a household with an opioid user, usually a spouse or a parent. The survey did not include people who were treated for cancer or a terminal illness. At the time of the interview, 45\u00a0percent of long-term users were no longer taking the drugs, while 55\u00a0percent were still taking them. Users were slightly more likely than the general public to be white and far more apt to be middle-aged. Nearly all long-term users (95\u00a0percent) said that they began taking the drugs to relieve pain from surgery, an injury or a chronic condition. Just 3\u00a0percent said that they started as recreational users. More than 8 in 10 said that they tried to manage their pain with nonnarcotic medication; about 7 in 10 said that they tried alternative treatments, such as physical therapy and acupuncture. More than half (57\u00a0percent) found those methods ineffective. Charles Stonesifer, 74, a former bricklayer who lives in Baltimore, has taken Tylenol with codeine and then Tramadol over the past two years. \u201cBoth my knees are shot,\u201d he said, adding that he would be unable to walk without narcotics. Stonesifer said that he had no trouble giving up the drugs when he tried, but his pain returned and he was forced to resume taking them. \u201cIf they actually stopped you from getting the [drugs], it would be very difficult for me,\u201d Stonesifer said. \u201cIt would put me in a wheelchair instead of being able to get around. And once you\u2019re in a wheelchair, you never get up.\u201d Nancy Horton, 62, of Martinsburg, W.Va., admits that she is addicted to the 190 milligrams of oxycodone she takes daily to dull the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Without the drugs, \u201cI get the shakes. I am very anxious,\u201d she said. \u201cI just pace constantly. I can\u2019t get comfortable.\u201d After 15 years on opioids, she said, \u201cI look back now and think, \u2018What could I have done differently?\u2019 \u201d [ A new divide in American death ] Sizable minorities of respondents report using the drugs for purposes other than managing pain. Such behavior is much more common among people who say they are addicted or physically dependent on opioids. Among this group, 47\u00a0percent say they sometimes take the drugs for \u201cfun or to get high\u201d; 38\u00a0percent use them to \u201cdeal with day-to-day stress\u201d; and 30\u00a0percent use them to \u201crelax or relieve tension.\u201d Side effects are widespread. Over half of long-term users said that they have experienced constipation; almost as many felt indigestion, dry mouth or nausea; and 15\u00a0percent said that they have had breathing problems. One in 5 (21\u00a0percent) have taken additional medications to treat those symptoms. More than half (52\u00a0percent) of long-term users said that they have taken other prescription medications for anxiety, depression and sleeplessness while on opioids, and 1 in 6 said that they have consumed the drugs along with alcohol \u2014 risky combinations that could have dire consequences. Overall, nearly 6 in 10 said that they take at least four prescription drugs, and about one-third said that they take seven or more medications. The survey revealed a largely positive relationship between opioid consumers and their doctors. Large majorities said doctors have warned them to avoid alcohol, cautioned them about possible side effects and explained the risk of addiction. But 61\u00a0percent said that their doctors did not suggest a plan for getting off the drugs when they were first prescribed, and more than half said doctors have not altered their dose or frequency. Among long-term users who stopped taking opioids, 34\u00a0percent said the termination of their prescription was a reason. Just 4\u00a0percent said that they have a prescription for naloxone, the drug that can be administered by someone else in an emergency to reverse the effect of an overdose. While about a quarter of long-term users said a friend or family member has suggested they stop taking the drug, two-thirds said that they are \u201cnot too\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about becoming addicted. And about 6 in 10 of those who report being addicted have not sought treatment or other help. Yngvild Olsen, chair of the American Society of Addiction Medicine\u2019s public policy committee, said doctors \u201chave a vital role to play in addressing the epidemic, not only by changing their prescribing patterns and learning a lot about more about chronic pain management and addiction, but also by stepping up to the plate in learning how to treat addiction.\u201d Emily Guskin, Monica Akhtar and Erin Patrick O\u2019Connor contributed to this report. national ",

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama has ordered American intelligence agencies to produce a full report on Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, his homeland security adviser said on Friday. He also directed them to develop a list of \u201clessons learned\u201d from the broad campaign the United States has accused Russia of carrying out to steal emails, publish their contents and probe the vote-counting system. \u201cWe may have crossed a new threshold here,\u201d Lisa Monaco, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s closest aides and the former head of the national security division of the Justice Department, told reporters Friday. \u201cHe expects to receive this report before he leaves office.\u201d The report, according to senior administration officials, will trace the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and on prominent individuals like John D. Podesta , the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But it is unclear that the contents of the report will be made public. Intelligence agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which still has an active investigation of the hacking underway, have been reluctant to make public any of their findings; they fear it will reveal sources and methods of how the incursions were traced back to Russia. After past investigations involving sensitive intelligence information, declassified versions of reports were sometimes published, with a classified version sent to congressional committees and some agencies.

    "text": "Former senator and presidential advisor Elizabeth Dole started a program for caregivers of wounded military veterans. She visited \"CBS This Morni... \u00a0As secretary of Labor under President Bush, Dole launched the \u201cGlass Ceiling Study\u201d to identify the gender barriers preventing women and minorities from holding senior management positions. Dole herself has also held elected office. Like her husband, Dole has been a senator, in her case from her native North Carolina.\u00a0 As secretary of Transportation she spearheaded the campaign to increase the drinking age to 21 and advanced auto safety requirements, according to the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame, of which Dole is a initiated member. On  a more personal level, Zelizer also sees the women\u2019s shared background, particularly their marriages to prominent Republican men, as more than a mere coincidence. Rather, it\u2019s the culmination of a post-1960s trend in which the one-wage male breadwinner family model was challenged. \u201c[Their] marriages to the Senate signal just how entrenched Republicans have become over the decades as more families have multiple senior party brokers in the home,\u201d he told CBS News. The \u201ccoming of age\u201d narrative, he added, contributed to the rise of women holding powerful and influential positions. Zelizer also explained that Dole and Chao exuded powerful influence in their husbands\u2019 political campaigns . \u201cThey both were very supportive to their husband\u2019s campaigns, each being seen as a huge statement within a Republican Party that suffered from a gender gap,\u201d he said. \u201cMore important they offered important strategic assistance to them.\u201d A Washington Post article from 1996--the year Bob Dole ran for president against Bill Clinton-- wrote, \u201cNo other presidential challenger\u2019s wife has ever addressed a national political convention. No other wife of a challenger or sitting president has so overtly taken on her husband\u2019s foe. And no other wife has drawn so much speculation about her own political plans in the closing days of a campaign.\u201d Mrs. Dole did launch a brief presidential campaign in 2000, but withdrew her name before any of the primaries began. As for Chao, Time Magazine profiled her as her husband\u2019s \u201cSecret Weapon\u201d on the campaign trail, which Sen. Mitch McConnell reiterated publicly at a GOP political picnic. \u201cThe biggest asset I have by far is the only Kentucky woman who served in a president\u2019s cabinet, my wife, Elaine Chao,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Florida Gov. Says Florida Free of Zika Transmission By Gillian Mohney Dec 9, 2016, 11:06 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Florida Governor Lifts Zika Warning Over South Beach 0 Shares Email Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced today that Florida is now clear of locally-transmitted Zika for the first time since July. Since the Zika outbreak was announced in the state, four zones of ongoing Zika transmission had been identified and subsequently cleared in recent months. Today the last \"Zika zone\" in the state, located in the South Beach area of Miami Beach, was declared free of the Zika virus transmission. \"The South Beach area now does not have any local transmission of Zika and that's a very good day for our state,\" Scott told reporters. The Zika outbreak in Florida was the first time the virus had spread via mosquitoes in the continental United States. Texas announced its first case of locally transmitted Zika virus last month. Scott called the end of the outbreak an \"outstanding day.\" \"We're going to make sure that everybody knows that this state is open for business,\" Scott said. As a result of the announcement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was lifting the \"red area\" designation for South Beach neighborhood. The designation warned pregnant women and couples planning to get pregnant to avoid the area. Miami-Dade County is still considered a \"cautionary\" yellow area by the CDC due to past transmissions of the Zika virus. \"Florida\u2019s rapid response and comprehensive mosquito control program has allowed them to interrupt Zika transmission, but we must stay vigilant and also take what we have learned and be prepared for next season,\u201d CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement today. \u201cPregnant women who live or have been to this area should continue to be evaluated for Zika exposure during their prenatal visits to prevent the devastating effects Zika can cause in their infants.\u201d There have been 249 locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Health. The Zika virus is primarily spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and generally causes mild symptoms in adults. But when a pregnant woman is infected, it is associated with an increased risk of birth defects, including microcephaly , characterized by an abnormally small head or brain. It can result in diminished mental capacity or other developmental delays. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "OPEN Interactive Graphic The Obama program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, granted deportation protection and work permits for two years to immigrants brought to the country as minors who have passed criminal background checks. The Durbin-Graham measure, which also has at least one co-sponsor from each party, would give current recipients a reprieve even if Mr. Trump undoes the order, and allow new applicants to apply. Mr. Trump, who has included the so-called Dreamers in his broader deportation plan, appeared to back down in an interview published in Time magazine this week when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud.\u201d Goldman Sachs president is expected to lead National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn, president of the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs , is expected to be named director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, joining the Treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin as Goldman voices on the economic team. Mr. Trump used Wall Street and \u201cthe global elites\u201d as constant foils during the campaign, featuring Goldman\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, in his dark closing argument. Donald Trump's Argument For America Video by Team Trump Since his victory, however, Mr. Trump has tapped Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, for Treasury secretary; the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to be his commerce secretary; Todd Ricketts, heir to the Ameritrade fortune, to be deputy commerce secretary; and now Mr. Cohn. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The National Economic Council was created by President Bill Clinton \u2014 another frequent foil of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 to show that domestic policy would be equal to foreign policy. Like the older National Security Council, the N.E.C. coordinates the policies of the Treasury, labor and commerce departments, as well as other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Council of Economic Advisers. And because Mr. Cohn will sit in the White House complex, he is likely to be extremely influential on Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohn is also a big contributor to federal campaigns on both sides of the aisle , including tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees. Adding Mr. Cohn to the economic team was a favorite idea of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. And he does not break the streak of wealthy Trump teammates. Mr. Cohn\u2019s most recent total compensation package made public at Goldman exceeded $20.5 million. Goldman Sachs shares, by the way, are up 33 percent since Election Day. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is likely choice for interior secretary. Ms. McMorris Rodgers , the highest-ranking woman in the House Republican leadership, is expected to be announced as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of the interior as early as Friday, two people close to the transition efforts said. Ms. McMorris Rodgers comes from Washington, a state with large federal land reserves, and she was also critical of Mr. Trump at various points during the presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump campaign outraised Clinton\u2019s at the end. In the last part of his winning run, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign amassed more money than Hillary Clinton\u2019s, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign took in $70 million from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, compared with $86 million for the Trump campaign, of which $10 million came from the candidate\u2019s own pocket. In terms of spending, Mrs. Clinton relied on the war chest she had built up during the course of the campaign to spend almost $131 million, compared with $94 million by Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton closed the period with under $1 million in the bank, much less than the $7 million remaining for the Trump campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Give and take a few million. Mr. Trump may have tossed in a few million in the final weeks of his campaign, but he also took a few, soliciting donations from supporters, then reimbursing himself for rent and his airplane. From Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, the period covered by a postelection report filed with the F.E.C., the campaign paid nearly $3 million to properties owned by Mr. Trump, including rent to Trump Tower and event fees to other Trump hotels. The largest part went to Tag Air, the company that operates Mr. Trump\u2019s airplane. The new disclosures bring the total amount that Trump companies earned from his campaign to nearly $12 million. The campaign itself was hardly a moneymaker for Mr. Trump himself, though. The president-elect\u2019s total cash contributions came in at more than $65 million, well short of the $100 million he had originally promised but likely more than his businesses earned off the venture. Cash and carry. Photo Linda McMahon, the president-elect\u2019s choice to head the Small Business Administration, at Trump Tower last month. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Linda McMahon, a pro wrestling impresario, put $1 million into Future45, a pro-Trump \u201c super PAC ,\u201d in the final stages of the presidential campaign, taking her total contribution to the organization to $7 million. This week, Ms. McMahon \u2014 who lost twice in recent years as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut \u2014 was chosen by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who took down Gawker, gave $1 million to Make America Number 1, an anti-Clinton \u201csuper PAC\u201d run by the Mercer family, hedge fund billionaires. He has not been named to a position by the transition team, but he has been mentioned as a possib ility for the Supreme Court .
