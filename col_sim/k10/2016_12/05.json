The Army Corps of Engineers notified the Standing Rock Sioux that the current route for the Dakota Access pipeline will be denied. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images The Army Corps of Engineers has decided to deny a permit for the construction of a key section of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The decision essentially halts the construction on the 1,172-mile oil pipeline about half a mile south of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The decision is also a victory for the thousands of demonstrators across the country who flocked to North Dakota in protest. \"Our prayers have been answered,\" National Congress of American Indians President Brian Cladoosby said in a statement. \"This isn't over, but it is enormously good news. All tribal peoples have prayed from the beginning for a peaceful solution, and this puts us back on track.\" Jo-Ellen Darcy, the the Army's assistant secretary for civil works, said after talking with tribal officials and hearing their concerns that the pipeline could affect the drinking water, it became \"clear that there's more work to do.\" \"The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing,\" Darcy said in a statement.

Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples.\" ",

Austrian far-right candidate Norbert Hofer on Sunday congratulated his opponent in presidential elections after projections indicated that he had lost. Helmut Fohringer/AFP/Getty Images Austria's far-right presidential candidate conceded defeat Sunday shortly after polls closed and preliminary results from the election showed Alexander Van der Bellen to win 53.6 percent of the vote. Van der Bellen's opponent, Norbert Hofer of the conservative Freedom Party brought in just over 46 percent of the vote. Final results will not be certified until absentee votes are counted on Monday, according to the Associated Press. The AP also reports that election officials said the remaining ballots will not alter the outcome, but the percentages each of the candidates received may vary. Polls going into the vote indicated the outcome would be tighter than what appears to have taken place. Hofer campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform that cast a spotlight on Austria's inflow of refugees, while the former leader of the Green Party and now President-elect Van der Bellen stumped on a message of tolerance and inclusion. As the BBC reports , political watchers took a keen interest in this campaign and were using it as a litmus test of how other populist candidates may fare in upcoming elections across Europe. \"The result is sure to be welcomed by establishment parties and officials in the EU. \"France, the Netherlands and Germany all face elections next year in which anti-mainstream and anti-immigration parties are gaining ground. \"A referendum underway in Italy is being closely followed for further signs of anti-establishment populism, with polls suggesting a setback for centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.\" Article continues after sponsorship Austria's president is a largely ceremonial role. Sunday's election was a do-over from May when Van der Bellen won by less than 1 percent of the vote. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Vienna that Hofer called on his supporters to respect the outcome of the vote. And adds: \"Hofer had been poised to become the first far-right president in Western Europe since World War II and says he will run again in six years.\" ",

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf also said at a press conference Sunday afternoon that the Alameda County District Attorney had \"activated\" a criminal investigation team that was at the site of the blaze and working with law enforcement. \"I want to confirm that we have activated the criminal investigation team,\" Schaaf said at the press conference. \"That means that we are engaging in protocol that allows a criminal investigation to be conducted.\" Related: Oakland Warehouse Fire Survivors Describe Escape From Blaze Schaaf stressed that \"it is far too early for us to have any suspicions about what caused this fire\" and only the district attorney's office could announce any possible charges.

Authorities have made their way through about 35 to 40 percent of the building and there was much more work to do, he said. Seven of the victims have so far been identified, Kelly said, and authorities would be releasing those names later Sunday. Kelly also said that the tragedy at the warehouse had personally impacted one of the first responders. \"This tragedy has hit every close to home for our agency, one of our deputies that we work with lost his son in this fire,\" he said. \"Our family and our department are hurting from that.\" Kelly also said that some of the victims who they recovered were minors.

Kelly described the painstaking process of identifying victims, saying that the 24/7 operation was working to match fingerprints with identification they have found on some of the victims, in wallets, purses and backpacks. The Alameda County Sheriff's coroner's office asked the families of those missing to preserve objects with possible DNA for evidence.

Max Ohr, the creative director of the art collective that leased the warehouse, told the TODAY Show Sunday that he was working the door for a party on the night of the inferno, and around 70 people were \"in the venue enjoying music\" when he heard someone say there was a fire.

Credit Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times Federal officials announced on Sunday that they would not approve permits for construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a dammed section of the Missouri River that tribes say sits near sacred burial sites. The decision is a victory for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of protesters camped near the construction site who have opposed the project because they said would it threaten a water source and cultural sites. Federal officials had given the protesters until tomorrow to leave a campsite near the construction site. In a statement on Sunday, the Department of the Army\u2019s assistant secretary for Civil Works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, said that the decision was based on a need to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing. \u201cAlthough we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s more work to do,\u201d Ms. Darcy said. \u201cThe best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\u201d ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story According to Mr. Trump, the penalty would be a 35 percent tariff imposed on goods that companies ship back into the United States after they move production abroad. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump would have the legal authority to punish individual companies without congressional action. But he is also promising a broader overhaul of corporate taxes and the elimination of a host of regulations that he sees as stifling American companies, in addition to individual incentive packages like the $7 million one that Carrier received. The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 4, 2016 without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ...... \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 4, 2016 Mike Konczal, an economist at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute, said he also thought Mr. Trump\u2019s approach was doomed to failure, especially if he kept his campaign pledge to reduce taxes on corporations and investors. \u201cCutting taxes for shareholders will destroy more factories than whatever he saves by jawboning companies from the bully pulpit,\u201d Mr. Konczal said. And incentives like the ones Carrier received only forestall the inevitable shift by multinational giants to low-cost locales like Mexico and Asia. \u201cThey will just go later after pocketing some money,\u201d Mr. Konczal said. Making deals with big business may prove much harder than Mr. Trump is willing to acknowledge. After all, he held off on using a stick with Carrier, and handed over $7 million worth of carrots, but the company gave Mr. Trump only half of what he wanted, with 1,000 Indiana jobs still leaving for Mexico. Moreover, Mr. Trump is pushing back against tectonic economic forces that show no sign of easing. Besides the continuing loss of factory jobs to automation, Carrier is far from unique in shifting blue-collar jobs to places like Mexico, even as it keeps white-collar functions like sales and research and development in Indiana. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d said Steven Rattner, a veteran financier and Democrat who led President Obama\u2019s successful effort to rescue the auto industry in 2009. \u201cAnd what\u2019s ironic is that there isn\u2019t a single thing in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign platform that would help people hurt by these trends.\u201d Mr. Rattner is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times. Still, whether it\u2019s a smart strategy or not, it is clear Mr. Trump is planning more Carrier-like standoffs after he moves into the Oval Office on Jan. 20. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis is no one-off,\u201d he said in an interview with The Times after touring the Carrier factory floor in Indianapolis on Thursday and greeting cheering workers. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here as opposed to doing it from my lobby in Manhattan.\u201d Rather than tax breaks or tariffs on a case-by-case basis, perhaps the best argument for Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics are that they may prompt a rethinking of corporate responsibility among executives, said Justin Wolfers, an economist and New York Times contributor who teaches at the University of Michigan. \u201cThe question is, what\u2019s the game?\u201d Mr. Wolfers said. \u201cIf it\u2019s about changing norms, and saying private enrichment at the expense of the broader public good is no longer socially acceptable, that\u2019s important.\u201d To be sure, actually imposing tariffs is much, much more difficult than sending Twitter posts \u2014 or negotiating deals with individual companies like Carrier and its corporate parent, United Technologies, a major defense contractor. Although the president has wide-ranging powers to impose trade sanctions on countries found to be manipulating their currencies or exporting goods for less than it costs to produce them, Mr. Trump is venturing into uncharted territory with tariffs aimed at individual American companies. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that this has been tried before or what authority the Trump administration would be relying on,\u201d said Miriam Sapiro, who served as deputy United States trade representative from 2009 to 2014. \u201cThen there is the question of what kind of retaliation these tariffs could cause, harming both American workers and consumers as well as companies,\u201d said Ms. Sapiro, now a partner at Finsbury, a strategic communications firm in Washington. The off-the-cuff nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s outbursts may partly explain why economists have been left aghast by Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics to keep jobs at home. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But some experts say the shock is overdone. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m flabbergasted by the opposition on the left,\u201d said Alan Tonelson, an economist formerly with the United States Business and Industry Council, which represents family-owned and privately held domestic manufacturers. \u201cThey\u2019ve been just fine imposing tariffs to help Detroit, the steel industry and organized labor.\u201d As for conservative and libertarian criticism, Mr. Tonelson speculated that might have more to do with corporate support for the Washington think tanks they call home, rather than genuine ideological fervor. The economic soundness of Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics may be in question, but they clearly offer political rewards, especially in the Rust Belt, where the costs of free trade are more readily apparent than the benefits. \u201cThe dry statistics on trade aren\u2019t working to counter Trump,\u201d Timothy A. Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, said in a blog post on Sunday. \u201cThe aggregate gains are irrelevant to someone suffering a personal loss. Critics need to find an effective response to Trump. I don\u2019t think we have it yet.\u201d While the costs of free trade tend to be concentrated, benefits like lower prices for imported goods are spread very broadly, making them less obvious. In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House and a Republican Trump ally, questioned whether that trade-off made sense. In some cases, he said, Americans should be \u201cprepared to pay a little bit more for imported products\u201d to keep jobs at home. If trade advocates can\u2019t make a better case, or at least come up with better ways to help the inevitable economic losers of globalization cope, then free trade itself may be imperiled, whatever the overall benefits. \u201cPeople who advocated for free trade policies, myself included, should have advocated more forcefully for things to help these people, through ideas like retraining or tax credits to simply maintain their incomes,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something to help these people, we will end up without free trade, as may well happen with Mr. Trump coming into office.\u201d ",

Years? Paul Ryan: I can\u2019t give you an answer to that. We\u2019re still working on that. Scott Pelley: But people talked about three years in terms of a transition. Paul Ryan: Yeah, I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now. What we know is we have to make good on this promise. We have to bring relief as fast as possible to people who are struggling under Obamacare. Scott Pelley: What do Republicans intend to put in its place? Paul Ryan: Patient-centered healthcare that gets everybody access to affordable healthcare coverage. So they can buy what they what they want to buy. Scott Pelley: So people will still get coverage regardless of their preexisting condition? Paul Ryan: Yeah. We think preexisting conditions is a very important feature of any healthcare system. Scott Pelley: Children will stay on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26? Paul Ryan: Yeah, that\u2019s something that we actually have always had in our plan, as well. Scott Pelley: And women will pay the same as men? That didn\u2019t used to be the case. The six priorities on Ryan's agenda Paul Ryan: It depends on the age of a person. So we believe that we should have support based on age. The sicker and the older you get, the more support you ought to get. If you\u2019re a person that has low income, you probably should have more assistance than a person with high income, for example. Scott Pelley: Is your plan going to cover everyone in America? Paul Ryan: We will give everyone access to affordable healthcare coverage. Scott Pelley: In the first year, what else do you expect to get through the Congress? Paul Ryan: We really want to focus on economic growth and growing the economy. There are a lot of regulations that are really just crushing jobs. Look at the coal miners in the Rust Belt that are getting out of work. Look at the-- look at the loggers and the timber workers and the paper mills in the West Coast. Look at the ranchers or farmers in the Midwest with regulations. Scott Pelley: Are you talking about rolling back environmental regulations, safety regulations-- Paul Ryan: We\u2019re talking about smarter regulations that actually help us grow jobs in this country. We want to have good stewardship and conversation of the environment and economic growth. We have a real economic growth problem in America. We are limping along. Wages are flat.\u00a0 And jobs aren\u2019t being created near to the extent that they could and should be.\u00a0 So we think regulatory relief is very, very important.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to work on day one. Ryan told us that he can now support Trump\u2019s changed positions on immigration from deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants to focusing on only those who\u2019ve committed crimes and from building a 2,000-mile wall to something less. Paul Ryan: No, we\u2019re not working on a deportation force. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with respect to immigration, securing our border, enforcing our current laws. He talked about criminal aliens. That\u2019s just enforcing laws for people who came here illegally, who came and committed violent crimes. We should enforce those laws. But really, what we\u2019re focused on is securing our border. Scott Pelley: Well, Trump said he was going to build a wall. Paul Ryan: Yeah, I think conditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area. Some areas, you might need a wall. Some areas, you might need double fencing. I-- my own view on this is, whatever kind of device or barrier or policy to secure the border, that\u2019s necessary to secure the border, then do it. Scott Pelley: How big will the tax cut be for the middle class? Paul Ryan: Well, again, we haven\u2019t written this bill. But if you want to get a sense of what we\u2019re looking at it\u2019s virtually identical with the one that Donald Trump rolled out in the campaign. It means everyone gets lower tax rates. But we plug loopholes to pay for it. Scott Pelley: But give me a number. What is the tax cut for the average middle-class family. Paul Ryan: When I have a bill, I\u2019ll tell you the number. Let\u2019s do this again. Scott Pelley: You\u2019ve thought this through. You\u2019ve been thinking it through for years. What would you like to see? Avoiding the Boehner problem Paul Ryan: Yeah, so the tax rates that we talked about for individuals, we would have a 15 percent bracket, I think a 25 percent bracket, and a 33 percent bracket. We have seven brackets. We consolidate down to three. The other thing that\u2019s really important in tax reform is making sure that we don\u2019t tax American businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors tax theirs. It is costing us jobs. It\u2019s one of the reasons all these American companies are moving overseas. Scott Pelley: What should the corporate tax rate be? Paul Ryan: Well, our plan says 20 percent. And Donald Trump\u2019s plan says 15 percent. It\u2019s now 35 percent. Scott Pelley: Do you think the rich will benefit the most from your tax reform plan? Paul Ryan: Here\u2019s the point of our tax plan. Grow jobs. Get this economy growing. Raise wages. Simplify the tax system, so it\u2019s easy to comply with. Scott Pelley: You-- you\u2019re a little shy, when I ask you about the rich receiving the greatest part of the-- Paul Ryan: Well, here\u2019s the problem when you-- Scott Pelley: --of the tax cuts. Paul Ryan: --when you ask these things. Most of that income is small-business income. You have to remember, eight out of 10 businesses in America, they file their business as individuals, as people. And so we think of that as the rich. But it\u2019s that business in the-- in the business park outta Jamesville, Wisconsin, that has 50 employees. And do I want to lower their tax rates? You bet I do. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 Mr. Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure program.\u00a0 What are you going to build, and how are you going to pay for it? Paul Ryan:\u00a0 Well, I think, that should be decided by the marketplace. That should be decided by the needs in the particular states and communities as to what is built or rebuilt. And it\u2019s going to be one of our high priorities that we\u2019re we are going to be addressing this year. Scott Pelley: One of your high priorities that we heard almost nothing about during the campaign is poverty. Paul Ryan: Actually, I\u2019ve talked to him a lot about that. We feel very strongly about making work pay, about getting people transitioned from welfare to work. Get people skills they need, help they need, so they can get on the ladder of life.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ryan told us he has no plans to change Social Security but government health insurance, including Medicare, is a fire he says burning in the budget. Paul Ryan: If you want to think of the fire that\u2019s burning-- it is the fact that-- the Baby Boom generation, no offense, and there\u2019s a lot of you. Scott Pelley: I qualify. Paul Ryan: Yeah, you qualify. And we\u2019re just not ready for the retirement of the Baby Boomers. And we\u2019d better prepare for that. Scott Pelley: What changes do you plan for Medicare? Paul Ryan: Here\u2019s the problem. Medicare goes bankrupt in about 10 years. The trust fund runs out of money. So we have to make sure that we shore this program up. And the reforms that we\u2019ve been talking about don\u2019t change the benefit for anybody who is in or near retirement. My mom\u2019s now enjoying Medicare. She\u2019s already retired. She earned it. But for those of us, you know, the X-Generation on down, it won\u2019t be there for us on its current path. So we have to bring reform to this program for the younger generation, so that it\u2019s there for us when we retire, and so that we can keep cash flowing to current generations\u2019 commitments. And the more we kick the can down the road, the more we delay, the worse it gets. Scott Pelley: But you are going to kick the can down the road for the next year or two. This is not your top priority. Paul Ryan: It\u2019s not our t-- I haven\u2019t even discussed this with Donald Trump yet. But it is an issue that we have to tackle. Close CBS News From his balcony the speaker is watching the rise of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration platform. But, for Ryan, the best view in Washington isn\u2019t a pretty sight. Scott Pelley: You know, one thing I noticed during our interview inside was that every time you talked about the evils of Washington, you glanced out the window. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 I do, \u2018cause that\u2019s where all the bureaucracy\u2019s are. Yea. Yea. Yea. That\u2019s right. Scott Pelley: You think of this town as part of the problem not part of the solution. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 Absolutely I do. If you look down, I can see HHS, Education, EPA.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: The two most prominent things on the skyline from this vantage point are the Washington Monument and the new Trump Hotel. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I knew you were going to say.\u00a0 Scott Pelley: The new Trump Hotel. Paul Ryan: That\u2019s the new Trump Hotel.\u00a0 Yeah he notic\u2014he actually noted that when I took him up here. Scott Pelley:\u00a0 I bet he did, he probably told you what a great place it was. Paul Ryan:\u00a0 He said something like that. Scott Pelley: Is that a reminder of who\u2019s boss? Paul Ryan:\u00a0 The Washington Monument\u2019s the tallest one.\u00a0 And by the way, the dome, it\u2019s a little higher. Beneath the dome, Ryan will have a front row seat to Trump\u2019s swearing in. Scott Pelley: Did you believe he could be nominated? Really? Paul Ryan: Yeah, no, I-- I didn\u2019t see this one coming. He knows that. I don\u2019t think most people in the country saw. If you would\u2019ve put last year into a movie script and taken it to Hollywood two years ago, they would\u2019ve laughed you outta the room. Because it wouldn\u2019t have been believable. Scott Pelley: Did you see Election Night coming? Paul Ryan: No, not really. I think-- Scott Pelley: You expected Hillary Clinton to win? Paul Ryan: I thought the odds were clearly in her favor. So I was a little surprised, pleasantly so. Scott Pelley: Do you trust him? Paul Ryan: Yeah.\u00a0 Scott Pelley:\u00a0 Here\u2019s something many people wonder. Does he say the same bizarre things to you in private that he says in public?\u00a0 And it\u2019s an important distinction\u2014 Paul Ryan:\u00a0 You know, I think there is a bit of a difference between the private person and the public person. In the private person, there\u2019s a conversation like this. And it\u2019s all about how to get things done. So every conversation I have almost always revolves around, you know, personnel and policy focused on producing results.\u00a0 ",

According to the Associated Press , martial music could be heard from outside the cemetery, but scenes that were scheduled to be broadcast from within, were nixed. \"The military caravan bearing his remains in a flag-draped cedar coffin left the Plaza of the Revolution in the eastern city of Santiago at 6:39 a.m., returning empty two hours later. Thousands of people lined the two-mile route to Santa Ifigenia cemetery, waving Cuban flags and shouting \"Long live Fidel!\" \"The ceremony appeared to last about 90 minutes and took place out of the public eye after Cuban officials made a last-minute cancellation of plans to broadcast the events live on national and international television. International media were also barred from the ceremony.\" Until Castro's death, announced by his brother on Nov. 25, details of his final resting place had been shrouded in mystery. Even now, there is little known about how much access to the public will have to the gravesite.

Natacha Pisarenko/AP hide caption toggle caption Natacha Pisarenko/AP A woman holds a picture of Fidel Castro before a rally honoring Cuba's late leader at Antonio Maceo plaza in Santiago, Cuba. Natacha Pisarenko/AP As the Miami Herald reports: \"The cemetery is located in the northwestern part of Santiago, close to the bay. Castro's tomb had been a long-guarded secret. Construction began about two years ago, according to those who live nearby. \"Cuban officials have said nothing about future access to Castro's tomb, but its apparent location alongside Marti's, a grand site heavily visited by tourists and Cubans alike, indicates that there will be some form of public access to the grave. ... \"Beyond Cuban patriots, martyrs, celebrities and other important figures, Santa Ifigenia also houses the remains of prominent members of families who fled after the revolution such as Emilio Bacardi Moreau, who managed his family's rum dynasty and died in 1922. The Bacardi family left Cuba in the early years of the revolution after their properties were nationalized by the Castro government.\" On Saturday, Raul announced that in keeping with his late brother's wishes about avoiding the development of a cult personality, Cuba will prohibit the erecting of statues and naming of streets after the former leader. This is in contrast to the Cuban patriot Marti, who has numerous monuments around Cuba and the nation's airport \u2013 Jose Marti International \u2013 bearing his name. ",

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump, Alec Baldwin Tweet Over Continuing 'SNL' Skits 0 Shares Email Donald Trump took to Twitter early Sunday morning to express his displeasure with Alec Baldwin 's portrayal of him on \" Saturday Night Live \" last night -- and Baldwin didn't keep quiet. \"Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad,\" tweeted the president-elect shortly after midnight. Baldwin shot back about 15 minutes later, tweeting, \"Release your tax returns and I'll stop. Ha.\" Release your tax returns and I'll stop. Ha \u2014 ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) December 4, 2016 Last night's episode, which featured \"SNL\" cast member Kate McKinnon as Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, poked fun at Trump's use of Twitter, his campaign promises and vanity. The cold open began with a high school student in a classroom sharing that Trump retweeted him -- in reality, Trump did retweet a 16-year-old named Seth who slammed CNN's coverage of Trump. \u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) December 4, 2016 \"Seth seems so cool,\" gushes Baldwin's Trump in his office. \"His Twitter bio says he wants to make America great again. It also says he loves the Anaheim Ducks .\" McKinnon's Conway says Trump tweets so much \"to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his cabinet.\" Baldwin\u2019s Trump responds, \"Actually that's not why I do it. I do it because my brain is bad.\" Then, taking a jab at Trump's campaign promises, the fictitious Trump says, \"And next I'm going to do what I promised my whole campaign ... I am going to build that swamp.\" McKinnon's belwildered Conway asks, \"Don't you mean drain the swamp and build the wall?\" Responds Baldwin's Trump: \"No, that's too many things. Just smush them together. Smush!\" Trump senior counselor Stephen Bannon was also ridiculed during the cold open. Can\u2019t start the meeting without Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon. #SNL pic.twitter.com/R5NVUyBu1C \u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) December 4, 2016 \"Where is my chief strategist Steve Bannon? I can't start without Steve Bannon,\" says Baldwin's Trump. Who walks in? An actor in a grim reaper costume. And in a nod to Trump's vanity, something appears to grab the attention of Baldwin's Trump off-camera, and he asks McKinnon's Conway, \"Wait is that the picture of me I hate, the one the press is using where I look so ugly?\" Says McKinnon's dumbfounded Conway: \"No, that's just a plate of mashed potatoes.\" \"Wait a minute... is that the picture of me that I hate?\" #SNL pic.twitter.com/0H3KUZlbUa \u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) December 4, 2016 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story But that\u2019s not what has happened. Zuckerberg\u2019s idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site. On Facebook, the political divide has only been entrenched further. It\u2019s the BuzzFeed dress debate, only for our entire lives: We are two countries, one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold. The internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another. But they are rapidly disappearing. Photo Credit Photo illustration by Adam Ferriss. Most social media \u2014 like Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it, but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness, a Gal\u00e1pagos of sorts, where culture thrived untouched. They included Vine (whose closure was announced in October) and Snapchat, and even Tumblr, which were homes for marginalized ideas, theories and lifestyles. The video-sharing app Vine was the first place I got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own, including those of the Middle East. I was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them: prospering, aware. A young woman living in Saudi Arabia who goes by the name Amy Roko used Vine to show clips of herself living her life \u2014 her version of normalcy \u2014 at the mall, goofing off at home. In her most viral video, she stares into the camera, her face covered in a niqab, save for her perfectly outlined eyes. \u201c[expletive] called me ugly,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI said, [expletive] where?\u201d The emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath. I was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community. But Vine links could be shared independent of the network, and people did so with abandon, meaning that Vines appeared scattershot around the web, defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds. They could land on your screen via text message, direct message, email. Roko\u2019s Vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black American named Brionna London, who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty. You can draw a straight line from brown women in Saudi Arabia to black women in America, a marvel unto itself, a window into the way the internet flattens space and time \u2014 a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides. At Vine\u2019s peak, it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of times, and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities: that, say, black kids in New Orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in Florida. (At the very least, they shared a similar humor and taste in music, which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as well.) And yet Twitter, which owns Vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers, could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature (which reportedly costs millions a month to maintain) afloat. Following news about Twitter\u2019s decision to close the service, there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing Vine\u2019s remains. But it\u2019s most likely too late to salvage the community there. In its earlier days, Snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange. The app had an incredible series on \u201ccity life\u201d that gave users direct windows into different worlds. People submitted short video diaries about life in their cities, which the company compiled into a single video, viewable by anyone using the app. I remember feeling delighted watching people in Istanbul and S\u00e3o Paulo showing off their routines and customs. But the company is now prioritizing \u201clive stories,\u201d which feature more mainstream events like the Super Bowl and music festivals. The effect is still fascinating, but less intimate. Snapchat seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar. The future of Tumblr, the blogging platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender theory, critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the internet, is the most uncertain. Yahoo, its parent company, succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by Verizon, raising questions about the future of its properties. What we\u2019re seeing with Snapchat, Tumblr and Vine reflects a larger shift in the social-media economy. User-generated content, by and large, is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies investors, and as a result, most social-media companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams. One of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging. Semiprivate messaging applications \u2014 group text threads and applications like WhatsApp (which is owned by Facebook) and Slack \u2014 have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for conversation, a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks. New features are introduced daily, it seems, to make messaging with your friends more \u201cfun.\u201d The latest version of the iPhone\u2019s software includes the ability to make messages \u201cexplode\u201d with confetti. WhatsApp now offers the ability to tag people in messages, as you might tag them in a photograph online. These changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications overseas, which used similar features to attract and retain customers. (Line, a Japanese company that built an addictive messaging app with 220 million monthly users worldwide, had one of the biggest initial public offerings \u2014 $1.1 billion \u2014 earlier this year.) These new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter together, by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large. What happens when we would rather look inward? I have found something of an answer in a short story called \u201cThe Great Silence,\u201d by Ted Chiang, about humankind\u2019s search for signs of alien life. The story is narrated by a parrot in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. \u201cTheir desire to make a connection is so strong that they\u2019ve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe,\u201d the creature begins. \u201cBut I and my fellow parrots are right here. Why aren\u2019t they interested in listening to our voices?\u201d The paradox is not to be missed: We are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with. The story ends on a somber note. \u201cHuman activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction,\u201d the narrator explains. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it maliciously. They just weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d Chiang\u2019s lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment. Social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with people; instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we don\u2019t agree with. But if we can\u2019t pay attention to one another, we might as well not live on the same planet at all. Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.

By John Wagner December 4 at 12:20 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Rudolph W. Giuliani, left, and Mitt Romney, right, have been among the leading contenders for secretary of state. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump has expanded his search for a secretary of state beyond the four finalists his aides previously identified, including former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a senior adviser said Sunday. Kellyanne Conway, who managed Trump\u2019s election campaign, told reporters that he plans to interview additional candidates this week and does not want to rush the decision. \u201cIt is true that he's broadened the search, and the secretary of state is an incredibly important position for any president to fill,\u201d she said. \u201cHe's very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s emerging Cabinet is looking less Trumpian than expected ] Among the other names that have surfaced for the position is Jon Huntsman, a former Republican Utah governor who also has served as ambassador to China. Huntsman sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, backing Romney after dropping out. Speaking to reporters in Trump Tower, Conway declined to confirm consideration of Huntsman or to offer names of other possible contenders. \u201cWho knows how many finalists there will be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a big decision, and nobody should rush through it.\u201d Besides Romney, the secretary of state finalists whom Trump aides had previously identified were former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump confidant during the campaign; retired decorated military officer David H. Petraeus; and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Trump\u2019s consideration of Romney has been most visible, including a dinner last week in New York that Romney afterward described as \u201ca wonderful evening.\u201d [ In an abrupt about-face, Romney emerges from dinner with Trump full of frog legs and high praise ] The choice of Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, would send a reassuring signal to the moderate wing of the party and to the foreign policy establishment. But Trump loyalists have bristled at the prospect of rewarding someone who was among Trump\u2019s harshest Republican critics during the campaign. In arguing against Trump\u2019s fitness for office, Romney called him a \u201c phony ,\u201d a \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201ccon man.\u201d Evidence of the unease with Romney was evident at Trump\u2019s first stop on a \u201cthank you\u201d tour last week in Cincinnati, where chants of \u201cNo Romney\u201d broke out among the boisterous crowd. Giuliani has openly campaigned for the secretary of state post but faces questions about his international business ties that could make Senate confirmation challenging. Petraeus, a former CIA\u00a0director, also has interviewed with Trump, but he has a significant liability: Last year, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information, admitting that he gave sensitive materials to former lover and biographer Paula Broadwell. During an appearance Sunday on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Petraeus acknowledged his mistake and said that\u00a0\u201cthey'll have to factor that in and also obviously 38\u00bd years of otherwise fairly, in some cases, unique service to our country in uniform and then at the CIA and then some four years or so in the business community.\u201d Corker would probably be easily confirmed by his Senate colleagues but has said he does not expect to get the job. During an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, acknowledged that the search \u201cis taking just a little bit longer, and I think it\u2019s just fine.\u201d \u201cEverything doesn't have to happen all at once,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cHe's taking his time, making a smart decision, and we will see where that goes.\u201d Priebus sought to play down the significance of Romney\u2019s past criticism of Trump. \u201cI think Governor Romney is very talented,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think what really we should look at is that we have got a president here in Donald Trump that wants to look at the best and brightest of America, regardless of background, regardless of past disputes that we may have had with each other, that that is the past. That's the rearview mirror.\u201d Conway, who has publicly voiced concerns about Romney, however, questioned during another television appearance on Sunday whether it was \u201cappropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump\u201d during the campaign. \u201cAnd never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly?\u201d Conway said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cSo, I've spoken my piece on that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, certainly, the president-elect knows and I said publicly and will say here again: Whatever he chooses and whomever he chooses has my full support and backing.\u201d politics ",

Some in the crowd banged drums. Miles Allard of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said he was pleased by the decision but remained cautious, saying opponents of the pipeline \u201cdon\u2019t know what Trump is going to do.\u201d Allard said he\u2019s been telling his people \u201cto stand up and not to leave until this is over.\u201d Carla Youngbear of the Meskwaki Potawatomi tribe traveled from central Kansas to be at the protest site. She said she has grandchildren and is going to have great-grandchildren who will need water and that\u2019s why she was there.\u00a0 The easement marks a stunning victory for pipeline protesters, who for weeks have gathered at an encampment in southern North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others who have joined them wanted changes made to the route of the pipeline, which is largely complete except for a short segment underneath a Missouri River reservoir. They said the pipeline could pollute drinking water and threatens sacred sites. MAIN Coalition, a pro-pipeline coalition, called the move a \u201cpurely political decision.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not surprising that the President would, again, use executive fiat in an attempt to enhance his legacy among the extreme Left,\u201d a statement from MAIN said. \u201cThat the President continues to believe that he is above the law is simply un-American and it is this arrogance that working class Americans soundly rejected on November 8.\u00a0 For millions of hard-working people across the heartland, January 20 cannot come soon enough.\u201d\u00a0 Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier released a statement on the decision Sunday.\u00a0 \u201cI have stated from the beginning that the easement is a federal decision and local law enforcement does not have an opinion on it,\u201d Sheriff Kirchmeier said. \u201cOur role is to enforce the law and that is what we will continue to do.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan is calling the decision \u201cbig-government decision-making at its worst.\u201d The Wisconsin Republican tweeted Sunday night that he looks \u201cforward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us.\u201d This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. https://t.co/Qu0nFTmGZv \u2014 Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) December 5, 2016 Attorney General Loretta Lynch says the Department of Justice will still monitor the protest in North Dakota and is ready to \u201cprovide resources\u201d for those who \u201ccan play a constructive role in easing tensions.\u201d\u00a0 Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners previously said it was unwilling to reroute the project .\u00a0 Earlier on Sunday, tribal elders had asked the military veterans joining the large Dakota Access pipeline protest encampment not to have confrontations with law enforcement officials, an organizer with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock said. The organizer added that the group was there to help out those who have dug in against the four-state, $3.8 billion project.\u00a0 Veterans Stand for Standing Rock\u2019s GoFundMe.com page had raised more than $1 million of its $1.2 million goal by Sunday - money that was due to go toward food, transportation and supplies.

Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images A collapsed roof and debris slowed down the recovery efforts of firefighters on Dec. 3 following a fire that killed at least 30 people at a warehouse in Oakland, Calif. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Updated at 7 p.m. ET Sunday. Officials say they have so far recovered 33 victims killed in a warehouse fire in Oakland, Calif., and say there may be more. The fire broke out around 11:30 p.m. Friday during an electronic music show at the \"Ghost Ship,\" an artists' collective in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood. As of Sunday afternoon local time, searchers had been through \"35 to 40 percent\" of the building, said Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff's Department Coroner's Bureau at a news conference. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said authorities had so far contacted seven families of victims. Kelly said they had identified victims using found IDs and fingerprints. \"I don't know how many more people are left in there,\" Kelly said. \"We're expecting the worst and hoping for the best.\" He said teenagers are among the victims, and many others are in their 20s and 30s. Foreigners from Europe and Asia are among the fire's victims. Mayor Schaaf said that a \"criminal investigation team has been activated\" and is on site. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, authorities said. YouTube \"The scope of this tragedy is tremendous,\" the mayor said. Article continues after sponsorship Firefighters were removing debris from the cluttered warehouse \"literally bucket by bucket\" overnight, Oakland Fire Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton said during a Sunday morning news conference. She described the search as \"a long and arduous process.\" \"This is the most deadly fire in Oakland Fire's history that I'm aware of,\" she said. The roof of the warehouse collapsed Saturday, creating safety concerns for rescuers and slowing down their progress. \"We will be here for days and days to come,\" Kelly said earlier Sunday. A musician who was at the show told the East Bay Times that as many as 40 to 50 people were in the building when it began to fill with thick smoke and became pitch black. Many people became trapped on the second floor and a makeshift staircase made escape difficult. The Times posted a diagram of the building with photos corresponding to its location. You can see it on their site . The building is owned by Chor N. Ng of Oakland but was primarily operated by Derick Alemany and his wife Micah, according to the Times. The couple collected rent from artists in the space and held parties and concerts to raise money for rent. \"If you were not familiar with the building and the way that it was, if you were going there for a party, you wouldn't be aware of the maze that you have to go through to get out,\" a former friend of the couple told The Associated Press. Posting on Facebook early Saturday, a person the Times identified as Alemany wrote: \"Confirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound... it's as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope.... to be standing now in poverty of self worth.\" Criticism poured in on Facebook, calling his post insensitive to the people killed. The building was zoned as a warehouse, but many people lived there illegally, according to the AP. Oakland Planning and Building Director Darin Ranelletti said during a Saturday news conference that the city had opened investigations into the property last month after complaints about \"blight and unpermitted construction.\" He also said an investigator was unable to get into the building last month. The electronic music show's event page was filled with sympathetic posts from well-wishers all over the world. On Saturday, friends used the page to exchange information in hopes of finding information about loved ones who were still missing. Friends created a Google document Saturday with a list of names of missing people and contact information for reaching family members and friends. Authorities have released the names of seven identified victims. They will not release the name of an eighth identified victim, who was 17 years old. In a statement, the city of Oakland said the victims' families have been notified. ",

But in the balance, for me, what we have had weighs more than what we haven\u2019t had.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story As many Cubans are quick to do, she extolled the virtues of the country\u2019s free health care and education systems. Her father was from a poor family and became a manual laborer in the sugar industry at 15, before the revolution. But a generation later, Ms. Dominguez and her two siblings earned university degrees \u2014 thanks, she said, to Mr. Castro\u2019s initiatives. Many spoke of Mr. Castro after his death on Nov. 25, at age 90, in terms befitting a father figure. But his long illness, which compelled him to cede power to his brother Ra\u00fal Castro a decade ago, seemed to blunt the emotional impact of his death. The nation\u2019s response was generally stoic, with public displays of unchecked emotion rare. \u201cFor me, he\u2019s going to be alive forever,\u201d said Julia Piloto Cuellar, 53, who attended one of several public memorial gatherings last week in Havana, the capital. \u201cHe left physically, but he\u2019s going to be with us forever.\u201d While analysts abroad speculated about the possible effects of Mr. Castro\u2019s death on Cuba \u2019s domestic and foreign policy, Cuban citizens appeared to keep expectations in check, perhaps because hopes for speedy improvements at other historic junctures, like the re-establishing of diplomatic relations with the United States in 2014, had gone unrealized for most people. Photo Revolution Plaza in Santiago early on Sunday. Credit Tomas Munita for The New York Times The government harnessed Mr. Castro\u2019s death to reaffirm its socialist program, urging people to honor his legacy by redoubling their commitment to the ideals he espoused and the country he built. The government even placed logbooks in schools and other locations throughout the country and invited Cubans to sign an oath of loyalty to the revolution\u2019s ideals. \u201cThis is undefeated Fidel, who summons us with his example and with the demonstration that, yes, we could; yes, we can; and, yes, we will be able to overcome any obstacle, threat or turmoil in our firm commitment to build socialism in Cuba,\u201d Ra\u00fal Castro , the president, said during an address to a large gathering in Santiago on Saturday night. The public events during the mourning period, as expected, drew vast, yet restrained, crowds. Perhaps the most dramatic homage was a three-day cortege that carried Mr. Castro\u2019s ashes hundreds of miles to Santiago from Havana, reversing the route that he and his guerrillas took after overthrowing the forces of Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Hundreds of thousands of people lined the route, with some traveling long distances and many hours for a glimpse of the modest convoy and the small, flag-draped wooden box containing Mr. Castro\u2019s ashes, which sat in a glass case on a trailer hitched to a military jeep. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Esteban Caraballo, 63, a maintenance worker at an agricultural studies institute, rode in a caravan of 36 buses that his town had provided to carry spectators to the cortege route. They were waiting roadside at a spot east of Havana by 2 a.m. one day last week, even though the cortege was not expected to arrive until after 8 a.m. People held small plastic Cuban flags on wooden sticks or clutched images of Mr. Castro to their chests. \u201cWe\u2019re here to accompany our commander,\u201d Mr. Caraballo said. \u201cEven though our commander has died, he will always accompany us.\u201d The cortege came into view at about 8:30 a.m. As the crowd went quiet, the convoy passed and, a second later, disappeared from view. The bystanders walked in silence to their vehicles and drove away. For those who could not make it to the cortege route, the entire trip was covered live on television and radio, which was how most Cubans saw it. Among them was Maria Aleisy Hernandez Ruiz, 71, a retiree in Santa Cruz del Norte, who kept her television on for much of the week. \u201cA man so large in a box so small \u2014 it really impacts you,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was such a big man, with his big chest.\u201d The cross-country caravan was bookended by two large memorial events, one at Revolution Plaza in the capital on Tuesday night and the other at Revolution Plaza in Santiago on Saturday night. Both were attended by heads of state from around the world and other high-level representatives of foreign governments, many from developing countries that admired Mr. Castro\u2019s socialist idealism and pugnaciousness toward the United States. Photo Outside the cemetery in Santiago on Sunday, a supporter held a flag depicting Mr. Castro. Credit Mauricio Lima for The New York Times The engineering of the week\u2019s homage included a nine-day ban on alcohol and a shutdown of Havana\u2019s nightclubs and music venues, as well as a near-total dedication of state-run newspapers, television and radio to tributes to Mr. Castro and often breathless coverage of the week\u2019s events. \u201cHe is now absolutely tranquil,\u201d a broadcaster intoned as the cortege set off from Havana on Wednesday. \u201cA sad nation, but a committed nation.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dissent within Cuba was, unsurprisingly, muted. At a gathering of students and faculty on the campus of the University of Havana to honor Mr. Castro, not everyone attended with an equal degree of conviction. A professor allowed that she was not exactly in mourning, noting with a sardonic laugh that she was not wearing black. Indeed, she was wearing a blouse decorated with colorful flowers. The professor, who requested anonymity because she was wary of repercussions from her colleagues and the authorities, said her view of Castroism was lowered by the ordeals of scarcity and hardship, citing food rationing and low salaries. But voices like hers were overwhelmed by the outpouring of praise, often unbridled, for Mr. Castro and the country he built, however flawed. In conversations across the country last week, many spoke about the country\u2019s free health care and educational systems, the high literacy rate, the low infant mortality rate and the government\u2019s efforts to combat racism. But Mr. Castro\u2019s greatest legacy may well be the deep and unyielding national pride he cultivated, in part by unifying the Cuban people against the common nemesis of the United States government and its trade embargo. \u201cWe aren\u2019t fearful,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Perez, 64, a merchant mariner who was standing in a long line under a hot sun to view a shrine to Mr. Castro in Havana\u2019s Revolution Plaza last week. Earlier that day, President-elect Donald J. Trump had threatened on Twitter to reverse the rapprochement carefully brokered by Ra\u00fal Castro and President Obama. The news elicited a shrug from Mr. Perez. \u201cIf we lived for 50 years with it,\u201d he said of the animosity between Washington and Havana, \u201cwe can live 50 years more.\u201d \u201cAnother country couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we can. We\u2019re a nation that has always fought.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2016, on page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: In Subdued Ending, Cubans Put Castro to Rest.

    "text": "After national anthem protest, Colin Kaepernick dreadful in loss to Bears Photos from the Bears-49ers game at Soldier Field on Dec. 4. 2016. Chris Kuc Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Colin Kaepernick had to duck under a massive American flag to get to the 49ers sideline moments before it was unrolled and stretched across the field for the performing of the national anthem Sunday at Soldier Field. Later, Kaepernick didn't duck questions about why the veteran quarterback again kneeled in protest during the anthem or his subpar play that led to him being replaced in the fourth quarter of the Bears ' 26-6 victory that sent the 49ers to their 11th consecutive defeat. Some in the crowd of 46,622 jeered Kaepernick when he and teammate Eli Harold kneeled during the anthem, something Kaepernick has done before games to protest what he believes are wrongdoings against minorities in the United States. \"I will continue to do it,\" Kaepernick said after the game. \"There are a lot of issues that still need to be addressed. \"And I do think there is significance in being here (Sunday) seeing it's the anniversary of the assassination of chairman Fred Hampton,\" continued Kaepernick, who was wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Hampton, a leader of the Illinois Black Panther Party who was killed during a raid by Chicago police on Dec. 4, 1969. \"Being in Chicago, being able to acknowledge that a black figure, a black leader like him is very important and his role in being a leader in this community and bringing this community together is something that needs to be acknowledged.\" If my teenage son had behaved like controversial 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick the last three months, the advice would come easily. Stand up for the national anthem and pay respect to the men and women who have risked their lives to preserve the freedoms you enjoy. Register to vote so your... If my teenage son had behaved like controversial 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick the last three months, the advice would come easily. Stand up for the national anthem and pay respect to the men and women who have risked their lives to preserve the freedoms you enjoy. Register to vote so your... (David Haugh) Kaepernick's activism has received more scrutiny than his play, but when it comes to football, he has had better days than Sunday. Much better days. With snow falling, Kaepernick failed to generate anything through the air and had one completion, a 4-yarder to tight end Vance McDonald midway through the second quarter. Kaepernick finished 1-for-5 for 4 yards and ran six times for 20 yards. He was sacked five times for losses equaling 25 yards and finished with a passer rating of 39.6. \"The weather was something that definitely played a factor,\" Kaepernick said. \"We have to be able to do a better job of managing that, handling it and being able to throw the ball.\" With the 49ers trailing 21-6 after three quarters, coach Chip Kelly pulled Kaepernick in favor of backup Blaine Gabbert . \"I thought we needed a spark on offense and needed to get something going,\" said Kelly, who coached despite his father's death Friday night in New Hampshire. \"We knew we were going to be throwing it every down, so give Blaine a shot. That was it. Nothing more.\" Despite his ineffectiveness, Kaepernick said being pulled \"wasn't something I was expecting,\" but he didn't try to plead his case to remain in the game. \"It's not my place to really argue on the sideline,\" Kaepernick said. \"It's not about my feelings. It's about being able to help this team win. This coaching staff didn't feel like I was out there being able to help this team win, so they made a change, whether or not I agree with that.\" ",

By Michael Birnbaum and Anthony Faiola December 4 at 7:31 PM Follow @michaelbirnbaum Follow @Anthony_Faiola BRUSSELS \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Europe\u2019s embattled political establishment lost another round Sunday in its effort\u00a0to thwart the anti-elite movement, as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after voters rejected his constitutional reforms. But a center-left presidential candidate in Austria handily defeated his far-right challenger. The thorough rejection of Renzi\u2019s referendum to streamline lawmaking was a significant boost for the country\u2019s surging populist\u00a0forces just weeks after Donald Trump prevailed in the United States. Renzi\u2019s loss also risks unleashing financial upheaval in Europe\u2019s third-largest economy as Italy\u2019s weak banks struggle to contain the fallout. But the surprisingly strong presidential victory in Austria for an elder statesman formerly of the Green Party suggested there were still some limits to a wave of anti-elite anger that began in June with Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and continued with Trump\u2019s victory last month. A populist takeover of Italy is still an uncertain prospect, since Renzi\u2019s center-left Democratic Party remains in control of Parliament and national elections do not have to be called until 2018. But much will depend on the makeup of the next government and how anti-immigrant, Euroskeptic parties capitalize on their success. \u201cI have not managed to reach victory,\u201d an emotional\u00a0Renzi said early Monday, conceding defeat at the Palazzo Chigi, his official residence.\u00a0\u201cMy government ends today.\u201d\u00a0 Austrian presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leading member of the Greens Party, celebrates as election returns show him leading in the race. (Matthias Schrader/AP) \u00a0With 90 percent of ballots counted, 60 percent of voters rejected the reform, a\u00a0drubbing that far outpaced opinion polls ahead of the referendum. Viewed narrowly, Sunday\u2019s vote was actually in favor of the status quo, since the constitution will now remain unchanged. But the referendum to streamline the political system and diminish the role of the Senate long ago turned into a broader vote of confidence in Renzi, the youthful, Twitter-loving leader who portrayed himself as a lone warrior against Euroskeptic forces. Renzi, who took office in February 2014, always struggled to budge unemployment and improve the economy. The lead opposition to Renzi, the insurgent Five Star Movement, ran a spirited campaign against the prime minister\u2019s reforms, joining forces with an unlikely cross-section of allies, including some in Renzi\u2019s own party. Many establishment politicians also questioned whether the reforms truly made sense as the country contends with grim prospects for growth and a wave of migration from Africa.\u00a0Some said the changes were poorly written and, by removing checks on the prime minister\u2019s power, could actually enable populists should they ever win the country\u2019s top job. Italy, which has had 63 governments in the past 70 years, is no stranger to political chaos. What comes next will depend partially on Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who is charged with picking a new person to try to form a government, as well as with deciding whether to hold early elections. Elections are a key demand from the Five Star Movement, which is running a close second to Renzi\u2019s party in the polls. There may also be economic consequences, with Italy\u2019s shaky banks teetering amid the uncertainty. The euro dropped 1 percent against the dollar in early Asian trading following Renzi\u2019s resignation, but many financial analysts cautioned against panic. In the wake of Renzi\u2019s resignation, Italy\u2019s mainstream political parties are likely to change voting laws to make it more difficult to rule without a wide coalition, diluting the possibility that an insurgent force could seize power in the next elections . That would be a further check against the Five Star Movement, although it would also further entrench Italy\u2019s general political dysfunction. Renzi\u2019s anti-establishment opponents were trying to capitalize on a wave of skepticism about the ability of elites to deal with globalization and the long, painful effects of the economic crisis that started nearly a decade ago. Trump\u2019s victory last month cheered the Five Star Movement, an insurgent anti-euro force that has support on the left and the right. Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announces his resignation after voters struck down a referendum on constitutional reforms. (Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images) \u201cToday the arrogance that\u2019s remained in power these last years has lost,\u201d said Luigi Di Maio, who is expected to be the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister in the next election. \u201cSo ends the era of shortcuts and tweets.\u201d Sunday\u2019s votes in Austria and Italy\u00a0 captured the extent to which Europeans are as politically polarized as Americans, split on issues including immigration and free trade. In Austria,\u00a0the far-right Freedom Party\u2019s Norbert Hofer conceded the election on his Facebook page less than 30 minutes after polls closed; projections showed a surprisingly strong lead for independent Alexander Van der Bellen. The 72-year-old statesman and former Green Party politician was winning by 53.3 percent to 46.7 percent with nearly 100 percent of the votes counted. The result was an unexpectedly clear victory for Austria\u2019s beleaguered political establishment \u2014 one suggesting that the aggressive tactics and Trump-style campaign deployed by the Austrian far-right may have hurt more than they helped. Sunday\u2019s election, in fact, was a rerun of one in May in which Hofer lost by 31,000 votes, a result he successfully contested. His defeat on Sunday by a far larger margin, observers said, may suggest European voters\u2019 unease with the comparisons of their politicians to Trump. It also seemed to rob the momentum from far-right leaders in France and the Netherlands who have called Trump\u2019s victory part of a new \u201cworld order\u201d they hope to join in elections next year. Following Hofer\u2019s concession, he and Van der Bellen exchanged a long handshake for photographers in the Vienna studios of Austrian state broadcaster ORF. Van der Bellen credited his victory to a \u201cbroad movement\u201d backing \u201cfreedom, equality and solidarity.\u201d His campaign manager, Lothar Lockl, saw the margin as evidence of a push against the nationalist tide by moderates. \u201cA movement could be evolving here, which is not only for Austria, but can also bring about a change of attitude in the whole of Europe,\u201d he said. The race for the president\u2019s ceremonial role held\u00a0 high stakes. The position is constitutionally ambiguous, yet Hofer, who has decried Muslim immigration and free trade, vowed to beef it up \u2014 setting up a clash with the center-left government and the European Union. Freedom Party supporters on Sunday had hoped for a \u201cTrump bump\u201d \u2014 but it bumped the wrong way. \u201cThe Trump bump could always go either way,\u201d said Reinhard Heinisch, a political scientist at the University of Salzburg. \u201cThe fact is, Trump is not very popular in Austria.\u201d Hofer\u2019s campaign in Austria seemed to echo Trump\u2019s, with far-right outlets spreading damaging fake news and Hofer and his surrogates taking aim at red herrings such as his opponent\u2019s health. There were more allegations of dirty tricks on election day. On Sunday, Austria\u2019s domestic intelligence service launched an investigation into a mass text message that stated that only Hofer voters should show up because polling stations were overcrowded. Van der Bellen supporters, the text said, should instead vote Monday \u2014 although polls would be closed by then, according to the Austrian daily Der Standard. The race was perhaps more important as a bellwether of post-Trump voter trends in Europe, where nationalists are poised to stage potent 2017 campaigns in France, Germany and the Netherlands. A Hofer victory would have potentially signaled the new electability of the far right. Indeed, the Freedom Party sought to leverage Hofer\u2019s guy-next-door demeanor that seemed to take the bite out of his harshest condemnations, such as that \u201cIslam is not part of Austria.\u201d Still, while portraying himself as the face of a reformed far right, he persisted in courting a more extreme base. For instance, he wore a cornflower lapel pin \u2014 a symbol of German nationalism also used by the Nazis. Hofer on Sunday called for national unity following his defeat. Yet within his party, the attacks were already flying. The Freedom Party\u2019s powerful chairman, Heinz-Christian Strache, accused Hofer\u2019s opponents of running a \u201cmassive fear campaign,\u201d saying Green Party supporters of Van der Bellen had painted Hofer as \u201ca Nazi.\u201d Faiola reported from Berlin.

    "text": "CBS/AP December 4, 2016, 7:20 AM Penn State sets record in Big Ten title game win over Wisconsin; top 25 NCAA football roundup Wisconsin Badgers running back Bradrick Shaw (7) is tackled by Penn State Nittany Lions cornerback Grant Haley (15) in the second half during the Big Ten Championship college football game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Dec. 3, 2016. Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Email INDIANAPOLIS - Trace McSorley threw four touchdown passes and No. 8 Penn State stunned No. 6 Wisconsin 38-31 in college football Saturday night, overcoming a 21-point first-half deficit in the greatest comeback in Big Ten title game history. Penn State (11-2, No. 7 CFP) won its first conference title in eight years. The Nittany Lions must wait to see if the selection committee rewards them with one of the four coveted playoff spots Sunday. Penn State trailed 28-7 with 5:15 left in the first half, but McSorley led the Nittany Lions to touchdowns on each of its next four possessions, finally taking a 35-31 lead on an 18-yard pass to Saquon Barkley with 13:41 left. Things looked bleak early, but McSorley repeatedly burned the nation\u2019s No. 3 defense with long passes on a record-breaking night. McSorley finished 22 of 31 for 384 yards. The yardage and TD passes were both Big Ten championship game records. He also broke the school\u2019s single-season records for yards passing and touchdown passes. And he wasn\u2019t the only one to have a memorable performance. Saeed Blacknall caught six passes, two for touchdowns, and finished with a championship-game record 155 yards. CBSSports.com\u2019s Tom Fornelli and Adam Silverstein write that most experts expect the top current playoff rankings to remain the same, with the top 4 in order being Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and Washington.\u00a0 However, CBSSports.com\u2019s experts write they want to see Penn State given a shot, and not just because they already beat Ohio State this season , but also because \u201cIt just seems somewhat illogical that a team that couldn\u2019t win its own conference should be allowed to play for a national title over the team that did.\u201d ALABAMA 54, FLORIDA 16 ATLANTA - Alabama showed off all its weapons in the Southeastern Conference championship game. Now, the Crimson Tide can expect a return trip to Atlanta for the College Football Playoff. The nation\u2019s No. 1 team scored off a blocked punt and an interception return Saturday before wearing down No. 15 Florida in the second half with a dominant running game. The rout positioned Alabama to go for its second straight national title and its fifth crown in the last nine years under coach Nick Saban. Next up: a likely semifinal game at the Georgia Dome on Dec. 31. The Crimson Tide (13-0, No. 1 CFP) bolted to a 16-9 lead in the first quarter, despite being held to minus-7 yards and no first downs. They scored one touchdown off a blocked punt, another off an interception return. A field goal was set up by another pick - one of three thrown by Florida quarterback Austin Appleby in the first half. The Tide led 33-16 at halftime - the most points ever scored in the first two quarters of an SEC title game - and iced the victory with scoring drives of 98 and 91 yards, sparked by a goal-line stand that finished off the last gasp by the Gators (8-4, No. 15 CFP). NO. 3 CLEMSON 42, NO. 19 VIRGINIA TECH 35 ORLANDO, Florida - Deshaun Watson bolstered his Heisman Trophy candidacy by passing for three touchdowns and running for two more to lead Clemson past Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game. Winning consecutive league titles for the first time in 28 years likely will send the Tigers (12-1, No. 3 CFP) back to the four-team College Football Playoff for the second straight year, providing Watson with an opportunity to resolve unfinished business from last January, when his team lost to Alabama in the national championship game. The Clemson star completed 23 of 34 passes for 288 yards, including TDs of 21 and 10 yards to Jordan Leggett and 15 yards to Hunter Renfrow for a 42-28 lead midway through the fourth quarter. He also rushed for 85 yards on 17 attempts for the Tigers, who\u2019ve won back-to-back ACC titles for the first time since winning three straight from 1986-88. Watson\u2019s counterpart, Jerod Evans, was just as impressive for Virginia Tech (9-4, No. 23 CFP). The 6-foot-3, 238-pound quarterback ran for two touchdowns and rallied the Hokies from a 21-point deficit to make it close at the end. NO. 7 OKLAHOMA 38, NO. 11 OKLAHOMA STATE 20 NORMAN, Oklahoma - Baker Mayfield passed for 288 yards and three touchdowns as Oklahoma beat Oklahoma State in a matchup that decided the Big 12 title and likely guaranteed the Sooners a trip to the Sugar Bowl. Mayfield performed well throughout, despite finishing the game without top receiver Dede Westbrook. Westbrook caught four passes for 111 yards before being knocked out of the game on a crushing hit by safety Jordan Sterns. Samaje Perine rambled for 239 yards on a career-high 37 carries and Joe Mixon caught a touchdown pass and busted a 79-yard touchdown run for the Sooners (10-2, 9-0 Big 12, No. 9 College Football Playoff). Mason Rudolph completed 11 of 25 passes for 186 yards for Oklahoma State (9-3, 7-2, No. 10 CFP). His top target for the season, James Washington, caught two passes for 50 yards on eight targets. NO. 14 WEST VIRGINIA 24, BAYLOR 21 MORGANTOWN, West Virginia - Skyler Howard threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score as West Virginia held on in the Big 12 regular-season finale for both teams. Justin Crawford rushed for 209 yards to help the Mountaineers (10-2, 7-2) to their first 10-win regular-season since 2007. They came from 11 points down in the first half to hand Baylor (6-6, 3-6) its sixth straight loss after a 6-0 start. Baylor held the momentum for nearly three quarters in the final regular-season game for acting coach Jim Grobe, but that changed on two plays. Howard, having one of his worst games of the season, threw to Gary Jennings over the middle and he turned it into a 58-yard scoring play. After Baylor got the ball back, Marvin Gross stripped quarterback Zach Smith, and Darrien Howard recovered for West Virginia. An unsportsmanlike penalty on Baylor gave the Mountaineers the ball at the Bears\u2019 6, and Howard scored on a 1-yard sneak on fourth down for a 24-14 lead. TEMPLE 34, NO. 20 NAVY 10 ANNAPOLIS, Maryland - Phillip Walker threw two touchdown passes and Temple stifled Navy\u2019s running game as the Owls claimed their first American Athletic Conference title. After Temple (10-3) scored touchdowns on its first three possessions, protecting the 21-0 lead became substantially easier when No. 20 Navy (9-3, No. 19 CFP) lost standout quarterback Will Worth to a second-quarter ankle injury. Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said Worth is done for the season, along with running backs Toneo Gulley and Darryl Bonner, both of whom left with first-half injuries. Although the defeat took Navy out of the running for the Cotton Bowl, the Midshipmen are expected to play in the Armed Forces Bowl after facing Army next Saturday. The Owls extended their winning streak to seven and earned their first league title winning the Middle American in 1967. Walker was 16 for 25 for 199 yards. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Dec 4 2016, 7:27 pm ET Italian Prime Minister to Resign After Referendum Fails by Tim Stelloh, Tracy Snyder and Reuters Share Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will resign after voters rejected a constitutional referendum that would have given his office sweeping new powers. Renzi made the announcement during a news conference early Monday in Rome. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announces his resignation Monday in Rome. Alessandro Bianchi / Reuters The proposal lost by a wide margin, exit polls and early projections showed Sunday, throwing Renzi's future into doubt and opening the door to renewed political instability. The euro fell sharply against the dollar in light of the exit polls, slipping from $1.0625 to $1.0550. Earlier, a trio of polls for various television stations indicated that the \"No\" camp was ahead by at least 8 percentage points. Within half an hour, projections based on the initial counts suggested that Renzi could lose by as much as 20 points. If it's confirmed, the result would represent a new blow to the European Union, which is struggling to overcome an array of crises and was eager for Renzi to continue his reform drive in the euro zone's heavily indebted third-largest economy. Renzi, 41, took office in 2014 as an anti-establishment \"demolition man\" determined to crash through a smothering bureaucracy and redraw the nation's creaking institutions. Sunday's referendum, designed to hasten the legislative process by reducing the powers of the Senate and regional authorities, was to have been his crowning achievement. However, his reforms so far have made little impact, and the opposition 5-Star Movement has claimed the anti-establishment banner, tapping into a populist mood that saw Britons vote to leave the European Union and Americans elect Donald Trump as president. After voting in Genoa earlier Sunday, Beppe Grillo, founder of the 5-star Movement \u2014 which backed a \"No\" vote \u2014 said the country needed new elections as soon as possible. His party is running neck and neck with Renzi's Democratic Party in opinion polls. Tim Stelloh ",

Austria's presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but if Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer had won, he would have become Austria and Western Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since World War II. Coming after Donald Trump 's win in the United States and the Brexit vote in Britain, the vote was being watched across Europe as an indication of how well right-wing figures would do next year in elections in other European nations. French Candidate: Trump's Win Frees Voters From 'Diktats' The result was greeted with relief and congratulations by mainstream politicians in Austria and neighboring Germany. German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who heads that country's center-left Social Democrats, told the Bild newspaper that \"a load has been taken off the mind of all of Europe.\" He called the result in Austria \"a clear victory for good sense against right-wing populism.\" Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, called Van der Bellen's victory a defeat for \"anti-European, backward-looking populism.\" Hofer, a 45-year-old former engineer, conceded defeat on his Facebook page to Van der Bellen, a 72-year-old former economics professor. \" />HELMUT FOHRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Austrian Presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen makes a press statement in Vienna, Dec. 4, 2016. Hofer thanked his supporters on Facebook and expressed sadness that his campaign was unsuccessful. He also congratulated his rival and appealed for unity. \u201cWe are all Austrians,\u201d he wrote, \u201cno matter how we decide at the ballot box.\u201d Sunday\u2019s vote was a runoff after balloting in May gave Van der Bellen a razor-thin majority of roughly 31,000 votes. The Freedom Party contested the outcome in Austria\u2019s constitutional court and won, with the court citing ballot-counting irregularities and ordering a new election.

    "text": "Dec 4 2016, 4:10 pm ET Will North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory Concede This Week? by Emma Margolin advertisement Trailing his opponent by over 10,000 votes nearly a month after Election Day, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory could be close to accepting defeat. The Durham County Board of Elections is expected to hold a machine recount of 90,000 votes this week in the Democratic stronghold, which is possibly where the Republican governor's final hope of eking out a re-election victory will die. Democrat Roy Cooper, the state's attorney general, won Durham County by a wide margin of 79 percent to 20 percent, according to the State Board of Elections ' official tally. After the county recount, if the results are unchanged, McCrory's campaign is on record saying it will abandon plans to pursue a statewide recount in the already drawn-out governor's race. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory tells supporters that the results of his contest against Democratic challenger Roy Cooper will be contested, while his wife Ann looks on, in Raleigh on Nov. 9. Jonathan Drake / Reuters Asked how long the recount would take, Brian Francis, media liaison for the Durham County Board of Elections, couldn't give an exact estimate. \"We don't know yet,\" he told NBC News. Yet some political experts believe the recount will be swift, producing the same result as the one that came in from the strongest Democratic county in the state late on November 8: McCrory lost. \"The reality is that the Durham numbers are extremely consistent with how Durham always votes,\" said Tom Jensen, director of the North Carolina-based firm Public Policy Polling. \"There's nothing in the numbers that strikes me as particularly suspicious.\" McCrory's supporters disagree. The roughly 90,000 votes under scrutiny in Durham were added to the statewide tally very late on the night of the election, eliminating the lead McCrory had maintained throughout the entire day. Related: North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory Files for Recount as Challenger's Lead Grows According to the Raleigh News & Observer, the delay came because election workers entered information from ballot tabulators' paper tapes after they were unable to read data from six memory cards that also came from the tabulators. Experts on the equipment told Durham officials that the paper tapes were reliable, the News & Observer reported. But McCrory's supporters wanted to rule out chicanery as a factor. \"I'm not saying that's what happened here,\" retired Judge James Baker, a Republican member of the State Board of Elections, said Wednesday, according to the News & Observer. \"I personally don't have any reason to doubt that any information entered was correct.\" The state board voted 3-2 along party lines that night to order a machine recount in Durham County. Roy Cooper, North Carolina candidate for governor, smiles as he walks on stage during an election night party in Raleigh on Nov. 9. Chris Keane / Reuters McCrory's hopes of closing the widening gap between himself and his opponent were complicated in the past week when, for the first time, Cooper's lead surpassed 10,000 votes, the threshold whereby state law allows McCrory to ask for a recount. His campaign had already filed for a recount before all the absentee and provisional ballots were tallied. But in a press release earlier this week, McCrory's campaign said it would \"be prepared to withdraw its statewide recount request\" if the Durham recount produces the same results. Cooper's campaign manager, Trey Nix, issued a statement when the Democrat's margin of victory hit 10,329 votes. \"Game over,\" Nix said of McCrory's refusal to concede. Given that no evidence of voter fraud has surfaced so far, some are confident the end is near for McCrory, who faced significant hurdles to his re-election after his state lost jobs, conventions, businesses and basketball events over the so-called \"bathroom bill\" he signed that restricts transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. \"The results have already been certified by the Republican-led Durham County Board of Elections,\" said Steve Greene, political science professor at NC State University. \"There's no reason to think anything should change when those votes are recounted. The Republicans have been in charge of this process.\" Others are less sure. The Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank backed by billionaire retail magnate Art Pope, has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the State Board of Elections from certifying the results until tens of thousands of voters who registered on Election Day have their addresses verified. While Greene believes it would be an \"extreme step\" for a judge to change the election results based off that lawsuit, other legal experts think it could further delay the process \u2014 even if McCrory concedes after the Durham recount. \"The lawsuit is a stand-alone action that was not geared to whether the governor concedes or not, but to test the underlying voting count and procedures that occurred here,\" Irving L. Joyner, legal counsel at the North Carolina NAACP, which has filed a motion to dismiss Civitas' lawsuit , said on a press call Friday. \"I would think those arguments are independent of what Gov. McCrory might decide to do with respect to the outcome of the Durham recount.\" Emma Margolin ",

Dave Archambault II said the Army has denied the permit to bore under Lake Oahe, the reservoir behind the Missouri River in North Dakota. Native Americans and environmentalists have camped out near the lake for weeks protesting the 1,172-mile pipeline, which is intended to\u00a0carry crude oil from the Bakken oil region in North Dakota to a distribution hub in Patoka, Ill. \"I wanted you to hear it from me,\" the chairman said as people banged drums, danced and cheered in glee at the snowy camp. The Missouri River portion of the pipeline was the only remaining contested portion. A federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C. is still pending. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

USA TODAY NETWORK In this image made from webcam video provided by Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the CFHT telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island is covered in snow on Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016. The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a winter storm warning for the summits of Hawaii's Big Island as wind and snow engulf the high peaks. (Photo: Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, AP) Another foot of snow could fall Sunday on Hawaii's highest mountain peaks, on top of the 2 feet already dumped there\u00a0since Thursday, the National Weather Service said. The summits of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea on the Big Island remain under a winter through Monday morning. Heavy snow and howling winds could reduce visibility to below a quarter-mile at times. The rest of the island \u2014\u00a0and all of Hawaii \u2014\u00a0were\u00a0under a flash flood watch Sunday with heavy showers and thunderstorms in the forecast. \"Heavier downpours and thunderstorms could cause streams to quickly overflow their banks, leading to flash flooding,\" the weather service said. Despite the rain, temperatures will be typically mild throughout the rest of Hawaii, with a high near 80 degrees in Honolulu Sunday and Monday. \u2014 lavapix.com (@lavapixcom) December 4, 2016 Snow on Hawaii's mountain peaks is not uncommon in the colder months because they are nearly 14,000 feet high. Mauna Kea has a sub-Arctic climate, the weather service said. \u201cAs long as we have deep enough clouds to support ice crystals, and when you have cold enough temperatures at the summit level, you can get snowfall,\u201d said Matthew Foster, a staff meteorologist with the weather service in Honolulu. Mauna Loa and its sister peak of Mauna Kea are both volcanos. Mauna Kea is the highest point in the state. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see three to five snow events a year during the cold season. Some years we might not get any, some years we might get more,\u201d said Foster. The only other area of Hawaii that gets snow with any regularity is the Haleakal\u0101 volcano on Maui, which at about 10,000 feet gets snow once every five years or so, he said. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Hawaii was 12 degrees on Mauna Kea on May 17, 1979, the weather service said. 12186 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gCQdzJ ",

    "text": "Trump Threatens Payback for US Companies That Move Abroad By paul wiseman, ap economics writer WASHINGTON \u0097 Dec 4, 2016, 2:05 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump gestures toward reporters as he arrives for a party at the home of Robert Mercer, one of his biggest campaign donors, Saturday, Dec. 3, 2016, in Head of the Harbor, N.Y. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose heavy taxes on U.S. companies that move jobs overseas and still try to sell their products to Americans. But the plan could drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers and risk setting off a trade war \u2014 if it's legal to begin with. In a series of early-morning tweets Sunday, Trump vowed a 35 percent tax on products sold inside the U.S. by any business that fired American workers and built a new factory or plant in another country. Trump campaigned on a vow to help American workers but also to reduce taxes and regulations on businesses. Trump tweets \"there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 percent for these companies wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border.\" He says companies should be \"forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake.\" Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Trump would face a potent legal challenge if he tried to impose taxes, known as tariffs, on specific companies without congressional approval. Hufbauer also doubts that Trump could identify a group of companies \u2014those that move jobs overseas, then ship goods back into America \u2014 for special tariffs. \"I'm skeptical,\" he says, predicting that courts would block such a move. University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers saw another problem with Trump's plan: His proposed tariffs would only hit U.S. companies that build plants overseas. They wouldn't apply to foreign firms that ship goods to the U.S. \"Tariffs are one thing,\" Wolfers tweeted. \"Tariffs that attack only on U.S. firms are another altogether.\" Trump made the comments three days after he announced that appliance maker Carrier had agreed to reverse its decision to ship 800 jobs from an Indiana factory to Mexico. During the presidential campaign, he repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs \u2014 35 percent on Mexican imports, 45 percent on Chinese. Tariffs are meant to give homegrown companies a price edge by making their foreign competitors' products more expensive \u2014 and to punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices. Since Trump's election, his team has described tariffs as a potential tool to be used to pry concessions from America's trading partners. \"Tariffs are part of the negotiation,\" Wilbur Ross , an investment banker slated to become Trump's Commerce secretary, told CNBC last week. Tariffs could prove costly. They are imposed at the border, and importers would likely try to pass along as much of the cost as possible to their customers. A 45 percent tariff on Chinese-made goods could drive up U.S. retail prices on those goods by an average of about 10 percent, Capital Economics has calculated. Consumers would probably have to pay up because there are few alternatives to Chinese-made for many products. China, for instance, produces about 70 percent of the world's laptops and cellphones. Taxing foreign goods could also start a trade war. The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper, has already warned that China could retaliate by limiting sales of U.S. cars and iPhones and by ordering aircraft from Europe's Airbus instead of America's Boeing. In 2009, the Obama administration taxed Chinese tires to protect American tire makers from a surge in imports. Beijing retaliated with a tax of up to 105 percent on U.S. chicken parts. Researchers at the Peterson Institute found that the tire tariffs probably saved 1,200 jobs in the U.S. tire industry. But higher tire prices cost American consumers an extra $1.1 billion \u2014 more than $900,000 for every job saved. 0 Shares ",

Mr. Vega said he had heard from a friend that his brother was at the party. \u201cGive me some gloves. I\u2019ve got work shoes. I\u2019m ready,\u201d Mr. Vega said. \u201cLet me find my brother, that\u2019s all I want.\u201d The structure had a permit to function as a warehouse, but not as a residence or for a party. Officials said they were investigating reports that the building had also been used as a living space. The building, known as the Ghost Ship, in the Fruitvale neighborhood, was the site of an event that was to feature a range of experimental and electronic music, performed by a synth musician drawing from the \u201cblack, queer diaspora\u201d and others, as well as a visual installation. On Saturday morning, the event\u2019s Facebook page said admission to the show was $10 for those who arrived before 11 p.m. and $15 after that. By the end of the day, the pricing had disappeared and the page had turned into an emergency message board, as dozens of friends and family members posted about missing loved ones. \u201cA lot of these people are young people,\u201d Sergeant Kelly said Saturday. \u201cThey are from all parts of our community.\u201d Some of the dead may be citizens of other countries, he said. Images from the building\u2019s website depict a wooden studio filled with antiques, sculptures and curios. Old lamps, musical instruments, suitcases and rugs decorated the ornate space. Photo Melinda Drayton, a battalion chief with the Oakland Fire Department, addressing the news media on Sunday. Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press Emergency workers said they arrived to find the building filled with heavy smoke and flames. Bodies were found on the second floor of the building, Chief Teresa Deloach Reed of the Oakland Fire Department said Saturday. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIn my career of 30 years, I haven\u2019t experienced something of this magnitude,\u201d she said. Even without a full accounting, the fire was one of the deadliest in the United States in many years. In 2003, 100 people were killed in a fire in a nightclub in Warwick, R.I. An explosion at a fertilizer plant in Texas in 2013 killed 15 people. \u2014         Oakland Firefighters (@OaklandFireLive) Dec. 3, 2016 Chief Deloach Reed said there were \u201cno reports of smoke alarms going off.\u201d At least two fire extinguishers were inside, she said. On the event\u2019s Facebook page, people distributed a spreadsheet that listed identifying information \u2014 age, height, weight, hair color, tattoos \u2014 and contact numbers for many of those who were unaccounted for. Oakland\u2019s music and art scene was already struggling with high rent prices. The city\u2019s underground bands and artists live a seminomadic existence in search of warehouses, homes and other spaces to show art, play music and dance into the early hours. Diego Aguilar-Canabal, 24, a blogger and freelance writer who lives in Berkeley and plays guitar in a band called the Noriegas, estimated he had been to three dozen house and warehouse parties over the past two years. \u201cThe basic idea is people want to do loud things late at night, and industrial space is really good for that because there aren\u2019t many neighbors to complain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety about income inequality and class warfare, and a lot of these artists are trying to do the best they can to have a community.\u201d Mr. Aguilar-Canabal has been to the Ghost Ship once, last summer, and remembered it as a dim and cluttered area with a \u201cmaze\u201d of furniture, canvas paintings on the walls and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hanging from the ceilings. \u201cThe reason we left was that it had only had one source of water, which was a sink, and the water tasted really gross,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe went to a corner store to get something to drink and were like, \u2018Let\u2019s just go home.\u2019\u201d Thomas Fuller and Conor Dougherty reported from Oakland, and Jonah Engel Bromwich from New York. Melissa Wen contributed reporting from Oakland, and Christopher Mele and Eli Rosenberg from New York.

    "text": "advertisement The blaze in an Oakland, California, warehouse that functioned as an unsanctioned residence and event space is one of the deadliest building fires in the United States in the last 50 years. Although the fire's current death toll of 33 puts it seventh on the list, the number of victims is expected to grow \u2014 likely pushing it higher. Below are the 10 deadliest building fires of the past 50 years. 1. World Trade Center, New York City: Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 2,753 Killed People walk in the street where the World Trade Center buildings collapsed in September 2001. Mario Tama / Getty Images A day that will live in infamy . The World Trade Center was the worst terrorist attack in United States history. The crashing of two jetliners into the World Trade Center Buildings, perpetrated by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, killed 2,753 people in New York City. Though the initial impact of the plane and building collapse killed many, the fires were deadly as well and continued for 99 days after the 9/11. Tens of thousands of people have developed illnesses, some of them terminal, because of exposure to toxins and poisons from the site. The attack led to the war in Afghanistan, which has continued for 15 years. 2. Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Oklahoma City: April 19, 1995 \u2014 168 Killed The north side of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City shows the devastation caused by a car bomb that detonated on April 19, 1995. Bob Daemmrich / AFP/Getty Images file More than 20 years ago, a truck bomb exploded outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , killing 168 people \u2014 including children. Now known as the Oklahoma City Bombing, it was the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil until 9/11 and the worst act of domestic terrorism in the country's history. Many died from the ensuing fire and from smoke inhalation \u2014 almost 40 percent of the victims who died or were injured suffered from the latter, according to the Oklahoma Department of Health. Timothy McVeigh, an anti-government militant, set off the explosives and was put to death by lethal injection in 2001. His co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, is serving multiple life sentences in a Colorado federal penitentiary. 3. Beverly Hills Supper Club, South Gate, Kentucky: May 28, 1977 \u2014 165 Killed The Beverly Hills Supper Club in Southgate, Kentucky., lies in rubble May 29, 1977, after a fire killed more than 200 people. AP More than 3,000 people were at the Beverly Hills Supper Club when a fire started in the \"Zebra room,\" according to the Center for Fire Research, a department of the National Bureau of Standards. Most were able to escape, but 165 were killed inside the club. The fire fed through an interior corridor and spread throughout the club. At the time, it was the deadliest fire in more than 30 years.

The Station Nightclub, West Warwick, Rhode Island: Feb. 20, 2003 \u2014 100 Killed A firefighter grieves at the scene of a deadly fire at The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in February 2003. Elise Amendola / AP The Station nightclub blaze \u2014 the fourth-deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history, according to the National Fire Protection Association \u2014 killed 100 people and led the NFPA to create code provisions for sprinklers and crowd management in similar venues. Hundreds of people had gone to the nightclub to see the band Great White, whose pyrotechnics display caused the inferno that engulfed the club in less than six minutes. The band's manager and the nightclub owner were sentenced to 15 years in prison, although both were granted parole in 2008, The Associated Press reported. 5. Happy Land Social Club, Bronx, New York: March 25, 1990 \u2014 87 Killed An arson fire at the Happy Land social club killed 87 people in 1990 in the Bronx, AP A spurned boyfriend, unemployed Cuban refugee Julio Gonzalez, set the Happy Land social club in the Bronx ablaze after getting into an argument with his girlfriend, who worked there, according to NBC New York . He was kicked out of the club and returned after 3 a.m. with gasoline and matches. He lit the guest exit on fire and pulled the metal front gate closed. Eighty-seven people died within minutes. It was the deadliest blaze in the city's history since the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire in 1911, exactly 79 years earlier. 6. MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas: Nov. 21, 1980 \u2014 84 Killed A fire at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas killed at least 80 people in November 1980. AP The MGM Grand Hotel and Casino fire, which is considered the second deadliest hotel fire in U.S. history, killed 84 people and injured more than 700 others. According to the Clark County Fire Department's report, the source was an electrical fire in the Deli restaurant. Within six minutes of its discovery, the fire had started to spread at 15 to 19 feet per second because of a \"flashover\" that quickly ate plastic ornamental fixtures, wall coverings, furniture and other combustibles. 7. 'The Ghost Ship,' Oakland, California: Dec. 3, 2016 \u2014 33 Killed (number expected to grow) Firefighters battle a fire in Oakland, California, that killed at least 30 people Saturday. David Butow/Redux / Redux Pictures The death toll of the warehouse fire in Oakland has climbed to at least 33 people, with more missing and expected to be added to the list. It is the deadliest fire in Oakland history. The interior of the building, known as \"The Ghost Ship,\" was filled with combustible wooden objects and didn't have a sprinkler system. Many people were trapped on the second floor during a party, as the staircase \u2014 which was built of wooden pallets \u2014 was quickly swallowed by the fire. People were illegally living in the unsanctioned art collective, as well. 8. UpStairs Lounge, New Orleans: June 24, 1973 \u2014 32 Killed A fire at the UpStairs bar in New Orleans killed 32 people in June 1973. AP file An unknown arsonist set fire to a New Orleans gay bar in 1972, killing 32 people. It was considered the deadliest attack on an LGBT space until the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, this year . The arsonist doused the stairwell into the bar with lighter fluid and threw a lighted torch to ignite the fire. The entire bar was alight in minutes. Many people died because the building didn't follow proper fire safety measures and the only emergency exit wasn't clearly marked, according to New Orleans Historical, a history project created by the University of New Orleans and Tulane University.

Imperial Foods Chicken Processing Plant, Hamlet, North Carolina: Sept. 3, 1991 \u2014 25 Killed A blocked door contributed to the number of deaths in the Imperial chicken plant fire, which killed 25 people in Hamlet, North Carolina, in 1991. U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration According to report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the fire at the Imperial Foods Chicken Processing Plant killed 25 people and injured 54 others in September 1991. The conveyor of a hydraulic line on one of the plant's cookers burst, which ejected hydraulic fluid that burst into flames because of the plumes of heating gas expelled by a cooking vat. This created a fireball, and spread smoke rapidly, confusing those people inside. Many of the exit doors were locked, causing many people to hide in a cooler or to seek other exits. The toxic gas killed many of those trying to escape. 10. House fire in Charleston, West Virginia: March 24, 2012 \u2014 Killed 9 Authorities and investigators at the scene of a house fire that killed nine people in Charleston, West Virginia, in March 2012. AP - file A house fire in Charleston, West Virginia, left nine dead \u2014 seven of them were children between the ages of one and eight. The home had only one smoke alarm that was not properly installed, according to NBC affiliate WSAZ . All were sleeping at the time of the early morning fire and likely died from smoke inhalation. Fire officials were never able to determine the cause of the blaze, but they did not believe it was suspicious. Phil McCausland ",

    "text": "After Carrier deal, Trump vows tax of 35 percent for US business going overseas Published               December 04, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that he\u2019ll slap a 35 percent tax on U.S. companies that move jobs or operations to other countries -- days after announcing a controversial deal with Carrier to keep roughly 1,100 manufacturing jobs in the United States. Trump, a prolific tweeter with about 15 million followers, needed six posts, each limited to 140 characters, to get out his message. \u201cThe U.S. is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBut any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! \u201cThere will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ... Please be forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.\u201d The string of tweets follow Trump\u2019s announcement last week that he had reached a deal with the Carrier furnace and air-conditioning manufacturer to keep the jobs in Indiana, instead of moving them to Mexico where labor costs are significantly less expensive. Trump made vowing to keep Carrier in the country and returning other good-paying manufacturing jobs to the economically challenged Midwest a major part of his successful presidential campaign. But the Carrier deal -- which purportedly includes $6 million in tax incentives and $1 million in job-training grants over 10 years -- has been criticized by liberals and conservatives alike. Among them are self-described socialist and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who suggest the deal was an example of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who remains governor of Indiana until next month, defended Trump\u2019s effort on Carrier on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\" \u201cWe were heartbroken when we heard Carrier was pulling up stakes,\u201d said Pence, who acknowledges he couldn\u2019t broker the deal. \u201cThe only reason Carrier is staying in the United States is because Donald Trump was elected president.\u201d Advertisement ",

Three games after a 49-10 loss to No. 6 Michigan, it pulled off a 24-21 upset of No. 3 Ohio State. Penn State\u2019s quarterback, Trace McSorley, has evolved over the last half of the season. In a 21-point comeback against Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game Saturday, McSorley threw for 384 yards and four touchdowns without an interception. The game followed the path of Penn State\u2019s season as a whole. The Nittany Lions have become comeback specialists. They have erased a second-half deficit in more than half of the games in their nine-game winning streak. Asked to explain such success after halftime, Franklin replied with a joke. \u201cWe cut up the orange slices like Little League,\u201d he said.\u00a0 USC has a 24-9 record in the Rose Bowl game. Penn State is 1-2. The teams first met in the Rose Bowl in 1923, a 14-3 victory for USC. They didn\u2019t meet there again until 2009, a 38-24 USC victory.

The Saturday report by IRNA said Babak Zanjani was sentenced to death over a number of charges including money laundering and disrupting the country\u2019s economy. On March 2016, a primary court sentenced Babak Zanjani and his two associates to death. Babak Zanjani iranwatch.org The two defendants are facing charges of complicity in money laundering, forgery and fraud. IRNA also said Gholam-Reza Ansari, a senior official at the Supreme Court of Iran, announced that the Supreme Court has upheld the death penalty for the two other defendants involved in the embezzlement case, retired businessman Hamid Fallah-Heravi and British-Iranian businessman Mehdi Shamszadeh. Zanjani was arrested in 2013 as part of a crackdown on alleged corruption during the rule of\u00a0 former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Iran\u2019s Oil Ministry says Zanjani owes more than 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion) for oil sales he made on behalf of Ahmadinejad\u2019s government. Zanjani, 41, is one of Iran\u2019s wealthiest businessmen, with a fortune worth an estimated $14 billion. He was arrested shortly after the election of President Hassan Rouhani, who\u00a0 ordered a crackdown on alleged corruption \u00a0during the eight-year rule of his hard-line predecessor. The trio was originally sentenced for being \u201ccorruptors on earth,\u201d which is an Islamic term referring to crimes that are punishable by death because they have a major impact on society. The verdict came after a nearly five-month trial. According to Iranwatch.org , an Iran weapons watchdog, the E.U. has also linked  Zanjani \u201cto Iran\u2019s proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities or Iran\u2019s development of nuclear weapon delivery systems,\u201d and has helped the government in Tehran filter money to sanctioned entities in the country. Iran\u2019s prosecutors contend Zanjani withheld billions in oil revenues channeled through his companies. In a 2013 interview with the BBC , Zanjani claimed he was not a political person, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t do anything political, I just do business.\u201d Iran has in the past executed other wealthy individuals found guilty of similar charges. In 2014, Iran executed billionaire businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi over corruption charges. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Just look at a few of his top picks. Video provided by Newsy Newslook Retired Gen. David Petraeus speaks to members of the media while leaving  Trump Tower Nov. 28. President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is widening his search for a secretary of State after high-profile meetings with four top candidates failed to yield a decision last week. \"It is true that he's broadened the search, and the secretary of State is an incredibly important position for any president,\" Trump aide Kellyanne Conway told reporters at Trump Tower Sunday. \"There is not a finite list of finalists only because he will interview with additional candidates early this week.\" Last week, the transition team said the top diplomat's position had been \"narrowed down\" to four potential candidates:\u00a0Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman\u00a0Bob Corker, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, retired Army general and former CIA director\u00a0David Petraeus\u00a0and 2012 GOP presidential nominee\u00a0Mitt Romney. Former United Nations ambassador John Bolton also met with Trump on Friday, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence included Bolton's name in a list of possible secretaries of State Sunday. 'Just a phone call': Trump officials downplay talk with Taiwan president Conway suggested that more candidates had come forward eager to join the Trump administration. \"There are a number of people that we may not have thought wanted to leave their very lucrative private industry positions to go and serve the government, and they are coming forth now and expressing interest,\" she said. The expanding list of candidates comes as one of the top candidates, Petraeus, appeared on ABC's This Week to answer questions about his interest in the job\u00a0\u2014 and his conviction for mishandling classified information. He pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor charge of giving journals containing state secrets to his biographer and mistress, Paula Broadwell. FBI Director James Comey has said that violation was far worse than what Trump's former rival, Hillary Clinton, was accused of in receiving classified information on a private email server. He remains on probation, meaning he needs approval from a probation officer \u2014 or a presidential pardon \u2014 in order to leave western North Carolina to serve in government. State contender Petraeus knowingly leaked secrets to biographer, lied to FBI \"Five years ago, I made a serious mistake. I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I paid a very heavy price for it and I've learned from it,\" he said. \"And, again, they'll have to factor that in and also obviously 38-and-a-half years of otherwise fairly \u2014 in some cases \u2014\u00a0unique service to our country in uniform and then at the CIA and then some four years or so in the business community.\" Petraeus did not have an answer for how the Trump administration would fulfill a campaign promise of building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 and make Mexico pay for it. \"I'm not sure what the scheme would be there for that,\" he said. Pence defended Petraeus on This Week, calling him \"an American hero,\" \"But look, he made mistakes. And he paid the consequences of those mistakes.\"\u00a0He said Trump would \"factor the totality of Gen. Petraeus' career in making that decision.\" \"Whether it be Gen,\u00a0Petraeus or Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani or Sen. Bob Corker or John Bolton or others who may be added to the list, what people are seeing is an extraordinary capacity of an executive to bring the broadest range of people around him,\" Pence said.

Perhaps only one guy in Chicago still believed in Bears wide receiver Josh Bellamy after the ball slipped through Bellamy's buttery fingers yet again Sunday in the Bears' 26-6 win over the 49ers . Fortunately for Bellamy, that one guy was his quarterback. \" Matt Barkley came up to me after that (drop) and said, 'Don't worry about it, I'm going to come back to you,' and I told him, 'Good, because I'm going to come through on the next one,' '' Bellamy said at his locker. You could understand why everyone else watching felt skeptical. It was Bellamy whose drop in the end zone on the final series one week earlier against the Titans helped the Bears snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. As an NFL wide receiver, Bellamy had proved himself a capable special teams player. Yet what Bellamy lacks in sure-handedness, he makes up for with self-assuredness. This is a player who reported to Bourbonnais in July wearing a T-shirt with his likeness on the front. So Bellamy relished having his No. 11 called in the third quarter just six plays after he let the offense down. \"I stayed positive, like I did all week,'' Bellamy said. \"I beat myself up (after the Titans game). But Coach (John) Fox told me one play doesn't define you as a player. You've just got to come back. And I did.'' Trent Brown had little chance. As the 49ers right tackle tried to set in pass protection in the final minutes of Sunday's game, Bears outside linebacker Leonard Floyd was already at full bore. From a crouched two-point stance well wide of the ball, Floyd burst off the snap and accelerated. And... Trent Brown had little chance. As the 49ers right tackle tried to set in pass protection in the final minutes of Sunday's game, Bears outside linebacker Leonard Floyd was already at full bore. From a crouched two-point stance well wide of the ball, Floyd burst off the snap and accelerated. And... (Dan Wiederer) The tough 24-yard catch over 49ers cornerback Rashard Robinson on third-and-7, setting up Jordan Howard's 2-yard touchdown run two plays later, restored confidence that fueled Bellamy's best day as a pro. Bellamy caught four passes for 93 yards and even gained 12 rushing yards on a reverse, a play the Bears called to take advantage of their most athletic receiver still healthy. \"He needed that,'' Barkley said. \"He said, 'Keep feeding me.' I'm not going to stop coming to him.'' And Barkley didn't. Imagine how prolific Bellamy's numbers would have been had he not dropped a likely 61-yard touchdown on a crossing pattern, underscoring the inconsistent hands that have made him an NFL journeyman. Not that Fox made the passionate 6-foot, 211-pounder sound like anything but a keeper. \"I'd take 20 of him,'' Fox said. \"He's got a huge heart. One of the best special teams players in the league. I couldn't be happier for him and how he responded.'' Bellamy's resilient day mirrored his team's as the Bears overcame embarrassing mistakes well enough to prevail over the pathetic 49ers. When it was over, cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc made snow angels, linebacker John Timu ran to the south end zone to accept congratulations from loved ones and Bears players celebrated like a team that hadn't won since Oct. 31. Colin Kaepernick had to duck under a massive American flag to get to the 49ers sideline moments before it was unrolled and stretched across the field for the performing of the national anthem Sunday at Soldier Field. Later, Kaepernick didn't duck questions about why the veteran quarterback again... Colin Kaepernick had to duck under a massive American flag to get to the 49ers sideline moments before it was unrolled and stretched across the field for the performing of the national anthem Sunday at Soldier Field. Later, Kaepernick didn't duck questions about why the veteran quarterback again... (Chris Kuc) The Bears had every reason to savor what might be their last victory celebration until next September. The 1-11 49ers represented the San Francisco treat on the Bears schedule, a respite before playing four straight NFC playoff-caliber teams. \"Hats off to those guys in the locker room,'' Fox said. The 49ers played poorly enough to wonder why coach Chip Kelly wouldn't want to return to Oregon to improve his chances of enjoying another 10-win season. A team from California that practiced all week in Florida looked out of its element in 28-degree wind chills as the snow created a picturesque football setting. But both teams made it ugly early in front of a sparse Soldier Field crowd of 46,622. The 13,160 no-shows \u2014 an alarming increase of 2,074 from Week 12 \u2014 seemed like the smart ones after the Bears bungled through an unwatchable first half. The special teams suffered a blocked punt and a lost fumble on a kickoff return. The defense, which brought its pass rush, came up big in limiting the 49ers to field goals after both turnovers. The offense didn't complete a pass until 1:43 remained in the first half. The only people excited about the run-to-pass imbalance were NFL draftniks who count losses as wins and the Three-Yards-And-A-Cloud-Of-Dust crowd. Bears offense entered Sunday\u2019s game ranked 31st in points scored. The 49ers defense entered the game ranked 32nd in points allowed. Fox Sports should\u2019ve repackaged the show as \"So you think you can play football?\u2019\" No. The answer to the question above would\u2019ve been no. The game began amid moderate...

Fox Sports should\u2019ve repackaged the show as \"So you think you can play football?\u2019\" No. The answer to the question above would\u2019ve been no. The game began amid moderate... (Steve Rosenbloom) Then Kelly helped the Bears. He called consecutive timeouts on the Bears' final drive of the second quarter after two straight running plays suggested Fox was content running out the clock. After the second timeout, facing third-and-5 at his own 24, Barkley completed his first pass before hitting three of his next four to drive the Bears toward their first touchdown. \"All of a sudden they realized Matt could handle it,'' said Kelly, the Eagles coach when Barkley was drafted in 2013. Added Fox: \"We had to open it up.'' Barkley proved more than capable leading the offense to its biggest point total of the season, protecting the football and looking like a guy worthy of being the Bears' backup quarterback in 2017. The sloppier conditions got, the sharper Barkley functioned. In his second NFL start, Barkley outplayed 49ers quarterbacks Colin Kaepernick and Blaine Gabbert , who combined for 6 measly net yards passing. Somewhere, Joe Montana groans. \"It's an all-time high in this league,'' Barkley said of his confidence. \"Just knowing I can play, that we can make plays.'' Barkley made enough plays that his last two to run out the clock felt satisfying. The Bears quarterback took a knee, marking his first victory as an NFL starter on a day his attitude changed the game as much as his ability. ",

County Men's Central Jail in 2011. Some legal experts say certain municipality policies have turned jails into modern-day debtors prisons. A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy prepares to unlock a security door to a cell block at L.A. County Men's Central Jail in 2011. Some legal experts say certain municipality policies have turned jails into modern-day debtors prisons. (Los Angeles Times) Jazmine Ulloa Contact Reporter California lawmakers next year will make it a top priority to reform the system through which judges award criminal offenders bail, saying courts across the state are punishing \u201cthe poor for being poor.\u201d Assemblyman Rob Bonta and Sen. Bob Hertzberg said they plan to fire the first salvo Monday, when lawmakers descend upon the Capitol for the start of the 2017 legislative session. They will introduce bills stating\u00a0the Legislature intends\u00a0to enact laws that will reduce the number of people detained before trial\u00a0and address\u00a0the racial and economic disparities in the bail process. The details of  upcoming\u00a0legislation are still under deliberation, but Bonta and\u00a0Hertzberg\u00a0said they have\u00a0 assembled a broad\u00a0coalition of organizations and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to tackle\u00a0what they consider to be\u00a0one of the most significant\u00a0pushes\u00a0\u2014 and likely one of the hardest battles\u00a0\u2014 of the year. Lawmakers discuss reform for California's bail system \u00bb Bonta, an Oakland Democrat, said he sees \u201cunprecedented\u201d energy and momentum on the issue, but predicted\u00a0\u201ca heavy, strong resistance from the bail industry and insurance companies.\u201d Debate over bail reform\u00a0has simmered\u00a0at the national level in recent years and has often been waged in court, with cities and counties across the country facing lawsuits over\u00a0policies that some legal experts say have turned jails into modern-day debtors prisons. At\u00a0least two\u00a0of those cases \u2014 against statewide practices used in San Francisco and Sacramento \u2014 have been filed in\u00a0federal courts in California. Under state law, bail is set when a person is arrested according to a county fee schedule and depends\u00a0on the gravity of the alleged crime. Offenders must post the amount upfront, or pay a 10% fee to a bond company, before they are released.\u00a0 Those who can\u2019t afford to do so either can remain incarcerated\u00a0up to an additional 48 hours before they are formally charged and arraigned. A judge then sets the conditions for release before trial, weighing such factors as whether the defendants pose a flight risk or are a\u00a0threat to their community. Those conditions typically include bail, and\u00a0lawyers and legal experts say the rules on how high that monetary amount\u00a0is\u00a0set\u00a0vary by city and county, often allowing courts to keep people in jail based on their inability to pay their fees. \u201cWe have to make the criminal justice system more just,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cWhen you have a system that is making decisions simply and solely based on a person\u2019s wealth, something is fundamentally wrong and that is simply not acceptable.\u201d Bail reform legislation has failed in California in the past,\u00a0often because of tough opposition from bondsman companies that argue\u00a0the current system\u00a0allows defendants access to their civil liberties. But lawmakers said\u00a0they could point to successful reforms in Washington D.C., Kentucky and New Jersey.\u00a0And they have studied\u00a0jurisdictions within the state that have developed \u201crisk-assessment\u201d models, which allow\u00a0court and pretrial staff to use data and other evidence to determine whether a person should be released.\u00a0 Hertzberg\u00a0(D-Van Nuys) said Republicans are suggesting interest in reform. \u201cNow you have a whole host of groups on both sides of the aisle looking at the\u00a0cost and fairness of the system,\u201d he said. Modernization of the pretrial system is urgently needed in California, which relies on pretrial detention\u00a0at much higher rates than other states, according to the bills to be filed Monday. About 63% of people in state jails, or 46,000 inmates, had not been sentenced in 2015, according to the Board of State and Community Corrections.\u00a0 That comes at a housing cost to the state of roughly $100\u00a0per inmate per day in most counties, or roughly $4.6 million a day. It also placed an expensive burden on\u00a0families. When people cannot afford to pay for their release,\u00a0they can lose their housing, lawyers and reform advocates said. Even three days in jail can result in\u00a0a loss of wages, jobs\u00a0and family connections, leaving some defendants\u00a040% more likely to commit crime\u00a0in the future, studies show. \u201cThe problem we see with money bail is that it is a price tag on freedom,\u201d said Phil Telfeyan, executive director of Equal Justice Under Law, which filed the legal\u00a0challenges over bail reform in California. \u201cThose who are rich get to pay their way out and those who aren\u2019t have to languish in jail.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

    "text": "Italy\u2019s Premier, Matteo Renzi, Says He\u2019ll Resign After Reform Rejected By JASON HOROWITZ Continue reading the main story Photo A man casting his ballot in Rome on Sunday during a referendum on constitutional reforms. Credit Filippo Monteforte/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images ROME \u2014 Italy plunged into political and economic uncertainty early Monday as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign after voters decisively rejected constitutional changes, a step certain to reverberate across a European Union already buffeted by anti-establishment anger. \u201cThe \u2018no\u2019 won in an incredibly clear way,\u201d Mr. Renzi said, congratulating the winners from the Chigi Palace. Holding back tears as he spoke in front of Italian and European Union flags, the usually brash and confident 41-year-old said, \u201cI assume all the responsibility of the defeat,\u201d adding that he would go tomorrow to the country\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, and \u201ctender my resignation.\u201d Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat, and the instability his resignation is likely to cause, raised the prospect of punishment in the markets, but also a caretaker government staffed with technocrats appointed by the Italian president. Another possibility was the calling of early elections in 2017, though that, too, was unclear because Italy\u2019s new electoral law is itself under review by Italy\u2019s constitutional court. If early elections do occur next year, 2017 is shaping up to be a seminal year in the history of the European Union with founding members Germany, France and potentially Italy all going to the polls with strong Eurosceptic and populist candidates in the running. Continue reading the main story Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat came hours after voters in Austria, presented with a stark ideological choice for the largely ceremonial position of head of state, chose Alexander Van der Bellen, the former leader of the small Green Party, over Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom Party. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was but a brief reprieve for a European political establishment that has suffered populist jolts all year. The reaction to Mr. Renzi\u2019s loss illustrated the poisonous tone of the long campaign leading up to the referendum. Luigi Di Maio, the deputy leader of the lower house of Parliament and a likely candidate for prime minister from the Five Star Movement, spoke about a coming \u201cFive Star government.\u201d And Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, who campaigned vigorously against Mr. Renzi\u2019s proposal, called the result \u201cnot just a defeat for Renzi but also his servant, lackies, bankers, financiers.\u201d Ostensibly the vote was about arcane changes to Italy\u2019s Constitution that would have streamlined government. But opposition to the reforms came from the same anti-establishment sentiment \u2014 spiked with skepticism of globalization, open borders and the feasibility of an ever-closer European Union \u2014 that has transformed the politics of a growing list of European countries. Such movements have already smashed the traditional political structures in Greece and Spain, and Euro-skeptic forces led Britain to vote in June to leave the European Union. OPEN Graphic In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, once untouchable, now seems vulnerable in next year\u2019s elections. And far-right parties are also seeking power in France. In Austria, the Green Party stalled the advance of populist forces on Sunday by defeating the presidential candidate of the far-right Freedom Party, which was established by former Nazis. The result in Austria might have calmed some nerves, but it was the rejection of Mr. Renzi that most sent shivers through Europe and the world. In a strategic blunder that echoed David Cameron\u2019s call for a \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum, Mr. Renzi had tied his government\u2019s tenure to Sunday\u2019s vote when he was flying high in the polls. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But his support eroded, and world leaders anxiously watched the vote in Italy, the fourth-largest economy in Europe and a key player in the European Union, as a referendum on Mr. Renzi\u2019s centrist government and as a barometer on the strength of anti-establishment winds blowing across both sides of the Atlantic. Financial analysts have warned that instability caused by Mr. Renzi\u2019s premature departure could result in a renewed and possibly contagious financial crisis in Italy, where banks are saddled with bad loans, and where desperately needed investors are turned off by the return of Italian instability. Some world leaders, seeing in Mr. Renzi a critical defense against populism\u2019s rising tide, had urged him to stay. President Obama, speaking at the White House during Mr. Renzi\u2019s visit in October, said he hoped Mr. Renzi would \u201chang around for a while no matter what.\u201d The incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump was less eager to see him remain. Members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have closely watched, and rooted for, the surging populism in Europe. What was clear, said Stefano Stefanini, who served as a diplomatic adviser to Giorgio Napolitano, a former Italian president, was that the vote was \u201ca test of strength of the anti-Europe and anti-establishment forces in Italy.\u201d Mr. Stefanini said Mr. Renzi\u2019s departure could embolden parties feeding on economic frustration, loss of national identity, anger at Brussels and a desire to break with the post- World War II belief that Italy\u2019s economic and national security interests were better served within an alliance of liberal democracies. The vote showed that Italy \u201cis reverting to a willingness to go it alone as a nation-state,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said. The primary beneficiary of Mr. Renzi\u2019s defeat is Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which advocates a referendum to determine whether Italy should give up the euro. OPEN Interactive Feature \u201cWe have the Italian people behind us,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, 30, said in an interview this month. He is the deputy leader of Italy\u2019s lower house of Parliament and a member of the Five Star Movement who is often considered a rival to Mr. Renzi. \u201cAnd he is losing,\u201d he said of Mr. Renzi. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The party, which was born online, is led by Beppe Grillo, a comedian whom Mr. Renzi, in an interview over the summer, compared to Mr. Trump. \u201cPopulism is always the offspring of fear,\u201d Mr. Renzi said at the time. \u201cAnd in Italy, the answer to fear is the courage to not be defensive, to not be like all the others.\u201d But Italy instead became like a growing list of European countries, and Italians seemed most moved by the message of Mr. Grillo and other leaders of his party, who campaigned tirelessly against a reform proposal they said would put too much power in the Mr. Renzi\u2019s hands. In the end, heavy opposition in the south and other regions marred by high unemployment levels proved insurmountable, and Mr. Renzi could not persuade enough moderates to stick with him and his government\u2019s plan to modernize Italy through a series of labor and institutional changes. Ultimately, the substance of the reform mattered less than voters\u2019 opinions of Mr. Renzi. In the past, personalizing politics had helped Mr. Renzi, a charismatic Florentine who came to power as a result of an internal Democratic Party coup in 2014. This time, it hurt him. Mr. Renzi proved unable to keep walking the tightrope between outsider and insider that he had navigated so exquisitely during his rapid ascent to the apex of Italian government. On the one hand, Mr. Renzi presented himself as an anti-establishment demolition man determined to smash the gerontocracy in Italy and shock into action the out-of-touch bureaucracy in Brussels. On the other, he was the consummate insider, an ideology-allergic expert at working the levers of power within the system who built unlikely coalitions to get things done. Italy, long mocked as the chaotic home of 63 governments in 70 years, emerged as a safe port of stability, and its young leader took on a special aura as a bulwark against the anti-immigrant, right-wing and radical forces. Sunday\u2019s vote erased that halo. After casting his ballot against the reform on Sunday morning, Dario Cecchi, 37, said his vote had less to do with Mr. Renzi than the substance of the proposal. Mr. Cecchi added that he was upset that Mr. Renzi had tied his political fate to the referendum, because he did not want the prime minister to step down, as he had \u201cgotten Italy\u2019s motor running again.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said he understood that Mr. Renzi had re-established Italy as a force within Europe and that a yes vote would only increase his country\u2019s power inside the bureaucracy of the European Union. But, he said, the reform \u201cshouldn\u2019t just be good for Europe \u2014 it should be good for Italy.\u201d ",

(Photo: Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports) Tom Brady now stands alone as the winningest quarterback in NFL history. The two-time MVP and four-time Super Bowl champion took sole possession of the all-time QB win record on Sunday after the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26-10. Brady had been tied for the mark, which includes both regular-season and playoff victories, with longtime rival Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos. Brady completed 33 of 46\u00a0passes for 269\u00a0yards and a touchdown in Sunday's win. The victory also pushed New England to its 14th straight season with at least 10 wins, a streak that dates back to Brady's third season as a starter. PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 13 Posted!

By Brady Dennis and Steven Mufson December 4 at 7:50 PM Follow @brady_dennis Follow @StevenMufson Dan Nanamkin, of the Colville Nez Perce Native American tribe in Nespelem, Wash., right, drums after it was announced Sunday that the Army Corps won\u2019t grant an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline. (David Goldman/Associated Press) The Army said Sunday that it will not approve an easement necessary to permit the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, marking a monumental victory for the Native American tribes and thousands of others who have flocked in recent months to protest the oil pipeline. \u201cI\u2019m happy as heck,\u201d said Everett Iron Eyes, a retired director of natural resources for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and one of the organizers of a camp protesters set up near the pipeline site. \u201cAll our prayers have been answered.\u201d Officials in November had delayed the key decision, saying more discussion was necessary about the proposed crossing, given that it would pass very near the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose leaders have repeatedly expressed fears that a spill could threaten the water supplies of its people. \u201cAlthough we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s more work to do,\u201d Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army\u2019s assistant secretary for civil works, said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThe best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\u201d The decision averts a possible showdown on Monday, the date the Army Corps, which owns land on either side of the lake, had set for cutting off access to the protesters\u2019 camp. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, worried about violence, had sent mediators to the area over the weekend. The victory for the Standing Rock Sioux and its allies could be short-lived, though. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to support pipelines such as this one. And Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners, has been a major contributor to the Republican Party and Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump, who owned a $500,000 to $1 million stake in Energy Transfer Partners, has sold the shares, his spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. His most recent disclosure says he still owns a similar size stake in Phillips 66, which owns 25 percent of the Dakota Access line. Iron Eyes said that \u201cwe shall remain vigilant regardless. We have witnessed the power of being peaceful and prayerful.\u201d What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities and activists from around the country. It has involved heated confrontations \u2014 police have sometimes employed water cannons, pepper spray and rubber bullets \u2014 and has carried on through the swelter of summer into the snowy cold of winter. Hundreds of veterans arrived in recent days. [ Why Hollywood, environmentalists and Native Americans have converged on North Dakota ] On Sunday, news of the Army\u2019s decision triggered a wave of celebration and relief among those who have fought to stop the 1,170-mile-long pipeline\u2019s progress. A procession of tribe members and activists marched along the main dirt road at the Oceti Sakowin encampment set up by protesters. A crowd numbering in the thousands gathered around the camp\u2019s sacred fire, the hub of activity here, as tribal elders sang prayer songs and beat drums. Activists acknowledged that it was only one step forward in a larger fight over Native American rights. Denise McKay, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux standing by the sacred fire Sunday afternoon, said she expects Energy Transfer Partners to push back on the decision. \u201cIt is a temporary victory,\u201d said McKay, 54. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay put and stay united.\u201d McKay\u2019s daughter, Chelsea Summers, 25, chimed in, saying \u201ceverybody is still here for the long haul.\u201d Nearby, Bruce Gali took drags from a cigarette and watched the festivities. He made his second trip to the camp last week and said he would keep returning from his home in northeastern California until authorities left the area and the pipeline was shut down. \u201cUntil all the razor wire comes down, until the helicopters stop flying overhead, the spotlights turn off, the drill pad is dismantled, this isn\u2019t the end,\u201d said Gali, a 67-year-old member of the Pitt River Tribe. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about this pipeline.\u201d We \u201ccommend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing,\u201d Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement. \u201cWith this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families.\u201d \u00a0 Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the outcome was a reminder of the power of individuals to \u201cdemand environmental justice.\u201d She said, \u201cToday, the voices of indigenous people were heard.\u201d In the Dakota language, the word \u201coahe\u201d signifies \u201ca place to stand on.\u201d The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the $3.8\u00a0billion Dakota Access Pipeline. The steel pipeline, developed and majority owned by Energy Transfer Partners, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal and pipeline terminus in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470,000 to 570,000 barrels of oil per day. The company says the project, which traverses four states, is 92 percent complete overall and 99 percent complete in North Dakota. Army officials said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Ordinarily, the Army Corps, which has jurisdiction over domestic petroleum pipelines, does not require a detailed environmental-impact statement but it does require environmental assessments of the impact on water crossings. \u00a0 [ Voices from Standing Rock: A glimpse into both sides of the standoff ] North Dakota elected officials criticized the Army Corps. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time that a decision is made on the easement going under Lake Oahe,\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D). \u201cThis administration\u2019s delay in taking action \u2014 after I\u2019ve pushed the White House, Army Corps and other federal agencies for months to make a decision \u2014 means that today\u2019s move doesn\u2019t actually bring finality to the project. The pipeline still remains in limbo.\u201d Rep. Kevin Cramer (R) said Sunday\u2019s decision \u201csends a very chilling signal to others who want to build infrastructure in this country,\u201d arguing that Obama had stymied a perfectly legal pipeline project. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged we will restore law and order next month when we get a President who will not thumb his nose at the rule of law,\u201d Cramer said in a statement. \u201cI feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus.\u201d Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) called Sunday\u2019s decision a \u201cserious mistake\u201d that \u201cdoes nothing to resolve the issue.\u201d He said it would prolong a dangerous situation by having protesters camping out on federal land during the brutally cold winter. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, however, praised the Army\u2019s decision. \u201cThe thoughtful approach established by the Army today ensures that there will be an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts,\u201d she said Sunday. \u201cThe Army\u2019s announcement underscores that tribal rights reserved in treaties and federal law, as well as Nation-to-Nation consultation with tribal leaders, are essential components of the analysis to be undertaken in the environmental impact statement going forward.\u201d Derek Hawkins contributed to this report from a camp near Cannonball, N.D. business Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "Renzi Quits; Italian Populists Seek Quick Vote to Win Power By frances d'emilio, associated press ROME \u0097 Dec 4, 2016, 9:58 PM ET 0 Shares Email Italian voters dealt Premier Matteo Renzi a stinging defeat on his reforms referendum, triggering his resignation announcement and galvanizing the populist, opposition 5-Star Movement's determination to gain national power soon. \"I lost, and the post that gets eliminated is mine,\" Renzi said early Monday about an hour after the polls closed. \"The government's experience is over, and in the afternoon I'll go to the Quirinal Hill to hand in my resignation\" to President Sergio Mattarella. Besides the \"anti-establishment\" 5-Stars, the outcome energized another \"anti\" party, the anti-immigrant Northern League, an ally of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, a candidate in France's presidential race. In voting No, Italians also delivered a rebuke to Italy's industrialists, banks and other establishment institutions, which had staunchly backed the referendum. The anti-reform victory, which could spook investors, comes just as the government had made some inroads in cutting the staggering rate of youth employment and while Italy's banks have urgent need for recapitalization. During the campaign, the risk of political instability in Italy, Europe's fourth-largest economy, triggered market reaction, with bank stocks sinking and borrowing costs on sovereign debt rising. But some analysts predicted the political crisis sparked by Renzi's exit would be short-lived, as politicians focus on lining up support for a new electoral law they view as boosting their parties' chances for whenever elections are called. Wolfango Piccoli, a London-based analyst and co-president at Teneo Intelligence, said the main risk of Renzi's \"devastating defeat\" will lie in the medium term. That could see \"a prolonged muddle-through period, the emergence of an ineffective patched-up coalition government in the post-election phase and continuously poor economic performance,\" Piccoli said in an emailed comment. The 5-Star Movement, led by anti-euro comic Beppe Grillo, spearheaded the No camp on the constitutional reforms, a package aimed at updating Italy's post-war Constitution that Renzi had depicted as vital to modernizing Italy and reviving its economy. Characteristically confident -- detractors say arrogant -- Renzi, 41, and Italy's youngest premier, had bet his political future -- or at least his current premiership -- on a Yes vote win, and campaigned hard for a victory in recent weeks to confound opinion polls indicating that it would likely go down to defeat. With votes counted from nearly all the polling stations in Sunday's referendum, the No's were leading Yes votes by a 6-to-4 margin, Interior Ministry data indicated. The turnout of 67 percent was especially high for a referendum, and more in line for a vote for Parliament. Renzi had been hoping to beat off the rising populist forces that have gained traction across Europe, as well as with the U.S. presidential victory last month by billionaire political outsider Donald Trump. Earlier on Sunday, in Austria's presidential runoff, left-leaning candidate Alexander Van der Bellen prevailed over a right-wing populist. Leaders of the populist 5-Star Movement, which is led by Grillo, joined the chorus among opposition forces for early elections. The 5-Stars are the chief rivals of Renzi's Democrats and are anxious to achieve national power for the first time. \"Today the caste in power lost,\" said a 5-Star leader, Luigi Di Maio. It was a sharp retort to Renzi's characterizing the reforms as an opportunity to shrink the \"caste\" of elite, perk-enjoying politicians by reducing the numbers and powers of Senators. \"Arrogance lost, from which we'll learn many things in forming our team for government and our platform,\" Di Maio said. \"Starting tomorrow we'll be working on a government of the 5-Stars, we'll involve the energies and the free persons who want to participate.\" The 5-Stars' constituency is largely internet based, and bills itself as anti-establishment. \"The man alone at the command doesn't exist anymore, but the citizens who govern the institutions\" do, Di Maio told a news conference minutes after Renzi conceded. In Bologna, traditionally a left-leaning city, about 100 people rallied after the defeat to burn several Yes-vote flags and carried a banner saying \"Renzi go home.\" Mattarella, as head of state, would have to decide whether to accept Renzi's resignation. Renzi is widely expected to be asked to stay on at least until a budget bill can be passed later this month. Then he or some other figure, perhaps from his Democrats, Parliament's largest party, could be asked to lead a government focused electoral reform. The current electoral law would grant the biggest vote-getting a generous bonus of seats in Parliament. Renzi's Democrats and the center-right opposition of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi want the law changed to avoid risking that the bonus would go to the 5-Stars should they lead the vote-getting. Elections are due in spring 2018, but Renzi's resignation could prompt their being moved up a year. Another opposition leader, Matteo Salvini, of the anti-immigrant Northern League, hailed the referendum as a \"victory of the people against the strong powers of three-quarters of the world.\" He urged elections straightaway. Many had read the referendum as an outlet for growing anti-establishment, populist sentiment in Europe. When Renzi late last year promised to resign if the referendum was defeated, it was months before Britain's David Cameron had made his ill-fated bet that a referendum would cement the U.K.'s membership in the European Union . Cameron was forced to resign when Britons instead voted to leave the EU fold. In Italy, the referendum was required because the reforms were approved by less than two-thirds of Parliament. The reforms included steam-lining the Senate and giving the central government more powers at the cost of the regions. \"We didn't exit from Europe, but we didn't 'exit,' from the Constitution either,\" said former Premier Massimo D'Alema. A former Communist, D'Alema opposed fellow Democrat Renzi on the referendum issue, aggravating tensions within their bickering party. \u2014 Colleen Barry contributed from Milan. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Feds block controversial Dakota Access pipeline route Published               December 04, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 CANNON BALL, N.D. \u2013 \u00a0The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday that it won't grant an easement for the Dakota Access oil pipeline in southern North Dakota, handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters, who argued the project would threaten the tribe's water source and cultural sites. North Dakota's leaders criticized the decision, with Gov. Jack Dalrymple calling it a \"serious mistake\" that \"prolongs the dangerous situation\" of having several hundred protesters who are camped out on federal land during cold, wintry weather. U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer said it's a \"very chilling signal\" for the future of infrastructure in the United States. The four-state, $3.8 billion project is largely complete except for the now-blocked segment underneath Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir. Assistant Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy said in a news release that her decision was based on the need to \"explore alternate routes\" for the pipeline's crossing. Her full decision doesn't rule out that it could cross under the reservoir or north of Bismarck. \"Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more work to do,\" Darcy said. \"The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\" HUNDREDS OF VETERANS ARRIVE TO SUPPORT PIPELINE PROTESTERS The company constructing the pipeline, Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, had said it was unwilling to reroute the project. It had no immediate comment Sunday. The decision came a day before the government's deadline for the several hundred people at the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires, encampment to leave the federal land. But demonstrators say they're prepared to stay, and authorities say they won't forcibly remove them. As the news spread Sunday, cheers and cheers and chants of \"mni wichoni\" \u2014 \"water is life\" in Lakota Sioux \u2014 broke out among the protesters. Some in the crowd banged drums. Miles Allard, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, said he was pleased but remained cautious, saying, \"We don't know what Trump is going to do.\" \"The whole world is watching,\" Allard added. \"I'm telling all our people to stand up and not to leave until this is over.\" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Sunday that the Department of Justice will \"continue to monitor the situation\" and stands \"ready to provide resources to help all those who can play a constructive role in easing tensions.\" \"The safety of everyone in the area - law enforcement officers, residents and protesters alike - continues to be our foremost concern,\" she added. Carla Youngbear of the Meskwaki Potawatomi tribe made her third trip from central Kansas to be at the protest site. \"I have grandchildren, and I'm going to have great grandchildren,\" she said. \"They need water. Water is why I'm here.\" Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault didn't immediately respond to messages left seeking comment. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, whose department has done much of the policing for the protests, said that \"local law enforcement does not have an opinion\" on the easement and that his department will continue to \"enforce the law.\" U.S. Secretary for the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement that the Corps' \"thoughtful approach ... ensures that there will be an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts.\" Earlier Sunday, an organizer with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock said tribal elders had asked the military veterans not to have confrontations with law enforcement officials, adding the group is there to help out those who've dug in against the project. About 250 veterans gathered about a mile from the main camp for a meeting with organizer Wes Clark Jr., the son of former Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark. The group had said about 2,000 veterans were coming, but it wasn't clear how many actually arrived. \"We have been asked by the elders not to do direct action,\" Wes Clark Jr. said. He added that the National Guard and law enforcement have armored vehicles and are armed, warning: \"If we come forward, they will attack us.\" Instead, he told the veterans, \"If you see someone who needs help, help them out.\" Authorities moved a blockade from the north end of the Backwater Bridge with the conditions that protesters stay south of it and come there only if there is a prearranged meeting. Authorities also asked protesters not to remove barriers on the bridge, which they have said was damaged in the late October conflict that led to several people being hurt, including a serious arm injury. \"That heavy presence is gone now and I really hope in this de-escalation they'll see that, and in good faith . the leadership in those camps will start squashing the violent factions,\" Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said in a statement, reiterating that any violation will \"will result in their arrest.\" Veterans Stand for Standing Rock's GoFundMe.com page had raised more than $1 million of its $1.2 million goal by Sunday \u2014 money due to go toward food, transportation and supplies. Cars waiting to get into the camp Sunday afternoon were backed up for more than a half-mile. \"People are fighting for something, and I thought they could use my help,\" said Navy veteran and Harvard graduate student Art Grayson. The 29-year-old from Cambridge, Massachusetts, flew the first leg of the journey, then rode from Bismarck in the back of a pickup truck. He has finals this week, but told professors, \"I'll see you when I get back.\" Steven Perry, a 66-year-old Vietnam veteran who's a member of the Little Traverse Bay band of Odawa Indians in Michigan, spoke of one of the protesters' main concerns: that the pipeline could pollute drinking water. \"This is not just a native issue,\" he said, \"This is an issue for everyone.\" Art Woodson and two other veterans drove 17 hours straight from Flint, Michigan, a city whose lead-tainted water crisis parallels with the tribe's fight over water, he said. \"We know in Flint that water is in dire need,\" the 49-year-old disabled Gulf War Army veteran said. \"In North Dakota, they're trying to force pipes on people. We're trying to get pipes in Flint for safe water.\" Some veterans will take part in a prayer ceremony Monday, during which they'll apologize for historical detrimental conduct by the military toward Native Americans and ask for forgiveness, Clark said. He also called the veterans' presence \"about right and wrong and peace and love.\" Advertisement ",

Citizen-Times 8:27 p.m. EST December 4, 2016 x Share Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine black people at a South Carolina church last year, told the presiding judge on Sunday that he no longer wished to represent himself during the \"guilt\" phase of his murder trial. USA TODAY FILE - This June 18, 2015, file photo, provided by the Charleston County Sheriff's Office shows Dylann Roof. The Justice Department intends to seek the death penalty against Roof, the man charged with killing nine black parishioners last year in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday, May 24, 2016. (Charleston County Sheriff's Office via AP, file) (Photo: AP) CHARLESTON \u2013 The man accused of killing nine people at a Charleston church has in part reversed course on an earlier decision to represent himself at his death penalty trial, asking the judge to reinstate defense attorneys in the initial phase of trial. \u201cI would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only,\u201d Dylann Roof wrote in a motion filed early Sunday afternoon. \u201cCan you let me have them back for the guilt phase, and them let me represent myself for the sentencing phase of the trial? If you would allow that, then that is what I would like to do.\u201d Black Americans choose life for Dylann Roof: Ellis Cose The one-page document, addressed to U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel, is handwritten on notebook paper by Roof. Roof, 22, faces 33 federal charges stemming from the June 2015 shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church that left nine black parishioners dead in a Wednesday night Bible study. Officials later confirmed a four-page manifesto posted online before the attack \u2014 one detailing racist ideas against African Americans and other groups \u2014 was authored by Roof. Last week, before the questioning of prospective jurors began, Roof asked Gergel if he could represent himself, a motion the judge criticized as \u201cstrategically unwise,\u201d but allowed after determining the defendant was competent to make that decision. Dylann Roof's handwritten motion. \u00a0(Photo: U.S. District Court of South Carolina) Throughout the week of jury questioning, Gergel has repeatedly rebuked Roof\u2019s former defense attorneys, now in the role of standby counsel, for addressing the court both verbally and in filed motions. The judge has also urged Roof to reconsider his self-representation decision, indicating he would reinstate the defense team at the defendant\u2019s asking. Motions in the case are expected to be heard Monday, and it\u2019s unknown if Gergel would be friendly to allowing defense attorneys decision-making power in only one trial phase. Courtroom statements by Roof and documents in the case make clear that Roof and his former attorneys part ways on allowing the jury to hear at least one piece of evidence. The nature of the evidence has not been disclosed, but capital clients who insist on representing themselves often do not want to disclose a diagnosis of a mental illness, say death penalty defense attorneys and psychologists versed in capital litigation. Should a mental health condition be an issue in Roof\u2019s case, that information would come into play at sentencing, the phase Roof wants to retain control of, according to his motion. Posted!

Marriott International has recently decided that no religious materials should be offered at Moxy and Edition hotels, two of its newest millennial-oriented hotel brands. The Moxy Berlin Hotel opened in October. Marriott International has recently decided that no religious materials should be offered at Moxy and Edition hotels, two of its newest millennial-oriented hotel brands. (Matthias Nareyek / Getty Images) When the ultra-hip Moxy Hotel opens in San Diego next year, the rooms will be stocked with the usual amenities \u2014 an alarm clock, hair dryer, writing desk and flat-screen TV. But\u00a0you won\u2019t find a Bible in the bedside nightstand. Marriott International , the world\u2019s largest hotel company, supplies a Bible and the Book of Mormon in the rooms of every other hotel in the franchise. But the company has recently decided that no religious materials should be offered at two of its newest millennial-oriented hotel brands, Moxy and Edition hotels. \u201cIt\u2019s because the religious books don\u2019t fit the personality of the brands,\u201d said Marriott spokeswoman Felicia Farrar McLemore, explaining that the Moxy and Edition hotels are geared toward fun-loving millennials. Marriott\u2019s decision mirrors others in the industry who are quietly phasing out the long-held tradition of stocking\u00a0religious material in hotel rooms. It is difficult to gauge how many of the country\u2019s 53,000 hotels still put Bibles in the rooms because most major hotel franchise companies let individual hotel owners and managers decide whether to make the Scriptures a standard amenity. But a recent survey by STR, a hospitality analytics company, found that the percentage of hotels that offer religious materials in rooms has dropped significantly over the last decade, from 95% of hotels in 2006 to 48% this year. Among the\u00a0reasons for the change, according to industry experts, is a need to appeal to younger American travelers who are less devout than their parents or grandparents and\u00a0to avoid offending international travelers such as Muslims or Buddhists. And then there is this practical issue: Many newer hotel brands install shelves rather than nightstands with drawers\u00a0next to the bed, making it\u00a0difficult to be  discreet about offering a Bible. A copy of the Scriptures on a bedside shelf makes a more pronounced statement than a Bible slipped into a drawer. A hotel room Bible A hotel room Bible A hotel room Bible (Getty Images) \u201cIn an era of not offending anyone, I think hotels have a conundrum,\u201d said Carl Winston, director of San Diego State University\u2019s L. Robert Payne School of Hospitality and Tourism Management program. Hotels also have been under pressure lately from atheist groups. The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes separation of church and state, wrote to 15 major hotel companies last year, asking them to keep Bibles out of hotel rooms. The group succeeded in the last year in getting hotels operated by Arizona State University and Northern Illinois University to remove all Bibles from their rooms.\u00a0 The foundation also created a sticker that reads: \"Warning: Literal belief in this book may endanger your health and life.\" The group has encouraged its supporters to affix the stickers on any hotel room Bible they find. \u201cWe are trying to educate the hotel industry that a quarter of our population is not religious,\u201d said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the group. STR officials cautioned about reading too much into its\u00a0survey, noting that managers representing\u00a0only 2,600 of the\u00a0more than 8,000\u00a0hotels responding\u00a0to the survey answered the question about religious material in rooms. Still,\u00a0industry experts say the changing demographics in America and the surge of international travelers in the U.S. are creating more reasons to keep religious materials out of hotel rooms. \u201cA lot of international hotels are trying to reach a very diverse group of travelers, and religion now has become a really sensitive topic,\u201d said Linchi Kwok, an assistant professor at the Collins College of Hospitality Management at Cal Poly Pomona. Bibles started to become a hotel standard in the late 1800s when three traveling businessmen founded Gideons International with a plan to spread the Gospels by placing the Bible\u00a0in hotel rooms across the country. The nonprofit group now has about 270,000 members in 200 countries.\u00a0In its latest\u00a0fiscal year,\u00a0Gideon International spent about $100 million to distribute Bibles to\u00a0hotels, prisons, hospitals and\u00a0other locations, about the same amount as in 2015, according to the group\u2019s financial statements. Jeff Pack, Gideons International\u2019s director of communications, said he isn\u2019t\u00a0sure why the STR survey shows a decline in religious material in hotel rooms, considering that the distribution of Bibles by his group hasn\u2019t\u00a0dropped. \u201cThe decline of religious materials in hotels, as cited in the survey, is reflective of increasing secularism and independence in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has resulted in an erosion of spiritual awareness.\u201d Two years ago, Travelodge hotels in Britain removed Bibles from their rooms \u201cin order not to discriminate against any religion,\u201d the company said. Still, the hotels kept copies at the front desk where guests could borrow them upon request. The parent company of Travelodge, the Wyndham Hotel Group, said the company does not require Bibles in any of its 15 hotel brands worldwide.\u00a0 At Marriott International, which was founded by a devout Mormon, a decision was made this year\u00a0to keep Bibles and a Book of Mormon out of four new brands, AC, Moxy, Protea and Edition hotels, spokeswoman McLemore said. But company executives reconsidered, she said, and instead moved to keep religious materials out of only the Moxy and Edition hotels because the AC and Protea hotels are geared toward more traditional travelers. Marriott\u00a0has opened nine Moxy hotels, with at least 40 more hotels under construction or in the planning phase. Four Edition hotels are open\u00a0and nine others are set to open in the future. Intercontinental Hotel Group, the giant British company that operates the Holiday Inn brand, among others, doesn\u2019t\u00a0require managers of its more than 5,000 hotels in nearly 100 countries to put Bibles in each room. \u201cOur hotels have the flexibility to offer religious materials to their guests if they choose to do so,\u201d spokeswoman\u00a0Caroline Huston said. James McKnight, pastor at the Congregational Church of Christian Fellowship in Los Angeles, said he isn\u2019t\u00a0offended when he finds his hotel room doesn\u2019t\u00a0include a Bible. He said that travelers who regularly read the Bible probably already have one with them, either in book or digital form. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the owner of a hotel to have the responsibility to give me the sacred text,\u201d McKnight said.

    "text": "Austria elects a president on Sunday, and one candidate hopes to duplicate Donald Trump's win. Norbert Hofer's right wing Freedom Party, founded ... Early results released Sunday evening in Austria, just after the polls had closed, found Van der Bellen with a 7-point lead over Hofer \u2013 far higher than any pre-election polls had suggested. Hofer conceded the race shortly after the first results were released, thanking supporters in a Facebook post and calling for unity. \u201cI congratulate Alexander Van der Bellen on his success and ask all Austrians to stay together and work together,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are all Austrians, no matter who the voters have chosen.\u201d Had Austria chosen Hofer on Sunday, the country would have elected the first far-right head of state in Europe since World War II. Hofer, who campaigned on an \u201cAustria first\u201d platform, is staunchly anti-refugee and has suggested Austria could hold a referendum on European Union membership. At a time when voters distrust the political establishment and made it clear they were looking for a fresh face, Van der Bellen argued for making changes within the existing system, rather than trying to \u201cdestroy things\u201d outright. Unlike Hofer, he believes Austria should remain in the EU and has spoken about its importance. \u201cWe know that things need to change \u2013 but let\u2019s not destroy things,\u201d he said at his final rally on Friday. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to demolish the house because a couple of windows have become loose.\u201d Van der Bellen\u2019s election is still historic in its own right, and reflects Austrian voters\u2019 anti-establishment sentiment in a different way: this is the first time in more than 50 years that Austria\u2019s president did not come from the two major parties, the center-left Social Democrats or the center-right Austrian People\u2019s Party. Sunday\u2019s election brings to a close an unusually long election campaign in Austria, and confirms election results from earlier this year: Van der Bellen initially won a May election against Hofer by about 31,000 votes, but the country\u2019s constitutional court annulled the results after suggestions of voting irregularities. The court called for a re-vote which was ultimately not held until this weekend in early December, more than six months later. In order to overcome his critics, Hofer had repeatedly attempted to assure voters he was not as extreme as had been suggested. \u201cI am just a normal guy,\u201d he told reporters after his final rally in Vienna Friday. \u201cI am not far-right.\u201d \u00a0 Van der Bellen, however, had framed the election as Europe\u2019s first line of defense against the far-right. He called Mr. Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Austria and for Europe more broadly, calling on voters across the continent to look for common ground and band together. \u201cI don\u2019t want Austria to become the first western European nation where right-wing demagogues take power,\u201d he said at a November news conference. Defeating Hofer in Austria is only the first step in many for those who wish to keep the far-right out of power in Europe: several high-profile elections in 2017 will give similar forces an opportunity to increase their influence at the ballot box. In March, the Netherlands votes in parliamentary elections, where Dutch Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders has a chance at becoming the next prime minister. France votes for its next president in April and May, with the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen poised to make it to the final round against Republican candidate Francois Fillon. And in Germany, which votes next fall, Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for a fourth term but faces strong backlash over her policy on admitting refugees to Germany \u2013 an issue the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has capitalized on in an effort to win seats in the German parliament. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The former CIA director and retired general insisted Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that he has learned from what he called a \"serious mistake\" while seeking to place the scandal in the context of his career. \"Five years ago I made a serious mistake,\" Petraeus said. \"I acknowledged it, I apologized for it, I paid a very heavy price for it and I've learned from it. And again, they'll have to factor that in and also obviously 38 and a half years of otherwise fairly, in some cases, unique service to our country in uniform and at the CIA.\" CIA Director David Petraeus speaks to members of a Senate Intelligence hearing on \"World Wide Threats\" on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 31, 2012. KEVIN LAMARQUE / Reuters file CNN reported Friday that Republican senators had privately expressed concern that a political fallout could ensue if Petraeus was nominated to be secretary of state. One senator told reporters that a \"high level of angst\" was present over a potential confirmation battle in the first weeks of Trump's administration. Related: Trump Meets Petraeus as Battle Over Secretary of State Continues Petraeus was the country's most prominent general during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. However, it became known in 2012 that he shared classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. The scandal damaged Petraeus' reputation and wrought legal consequences as well. The general was sentenced to two years' probation and a $100,000 fine in 2015 for admitting to providing classified information to his mistress. Additionally, FBI Director James Comey testified over the summer that Petraeus lied to federal agents during the probe. \"Obviously I made a false statement,\" Petraeus said. \"At the time I didn't think it was false. And frankly, if they had, they might have pursued that more. ... The FBI in the agreement acknowledged that nothing that was in my journals that I shared, certainly improperly, ended up in the biography or made it out to the public. I think that's a fairly significant point.\" Related: Donald Trump's Cabinet Picks So Far On the subject of his Monday meeting, Petraeus said that he found Trump to be \"quite pragmatic\" and that they discussed how to place campaign rhetoric \"in a strategic context,\" specifically when it comes trade and the proposed Mexican border wall. The general also revealed that he did not vote. \"I don't vote,\" Petraeus said. \"I also did not support him nor did I oppose him, nor did I support or oppose any other candidate. I've truly tried to be apolitical, nonpolitical.\" Play ",

(picture courtesy of the State Department) An organized crime ring operated a \u201csham\u201d U.S. embassy in Ghana that issued illegally obtained visas for about a decade, the State Department confirmed Sunday. The building in Accra, Ghana, flew a U.S. flag every Monday, Tuesday and Friday morning. And inside the building was a picture of President Obama and signs suggesting visitors were indeed inside a real U.S. embassy, the agency said. The purported organizers obtained blank documents to doctor and forge. The fake embassy was staffed by imposter consular officers who were in fact Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch. The operation even advertised its services through fliers and billboards and charged customers as much as $6,000 -- with options to buy fake supporting documents such as phony birth certificates and bank records. The fake embassy remained opened so long because \u201cthe criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials,\u201d according to the State Department. The report states the elaborate scheme was run by Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney who practices immigration and criminal law.\u00a0 The State Department reported about the operation Nov. 2 on its website and wrote, \"This embassy was a sham.\" Two State Department officials confirmed to FoxNews.com on Sunday that the report was real, amid a proliferation of so-called \u201cfake news.\u201d However, the officials declined to provide additional information including details about how many bogus passports might have been issued or on how many people from the West African nation could be living illegally in other countries. They also declined to discuss why news outlets first started reporting the story this weekend, saying more details could be made available Monday. The operation was broken up this past summer by a team of law enforcement agencies that included the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, Canadian Embassy officials and local police. The embassy sting by the joint task force uncovered 150 passports from 10 countries as well as real and counterfeit visas from India, and the United States. A fake Netherlands embassy also was discovered in the sting. The operation also had two satellite locations -- an apartment building and a dress shop in which an industrial sewing machine could re-create the binding on fake passports. The operatives drove to remote parts of the country to find customers, instead of accepting walk-in visa appointments, the agency said. They next step would be to take customers to a hotel in Accra, then to the fake embassy. The U.S. maintains an official, fortified embassy in Ghana. The State Department said several Ghanaian suspects connected to the operation remain at large. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Fidel Castro Laid to Rest in Private Ceremony in East Cuba By christine armario, andrea rodriguez and michael weissenstein, associated press SANTIAGO, Cuba \u0097 Dec 4, 2016, 10:18 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press People wait for the start of a memorial honoring the late Fidel Castro at Plaza Antonio Maceo in Santiago, Cuba, Saturday, Dec. 3, 2016. After a four-day journey across the country through small towns and cities where his rebel army fought its way to power nearly 60 years ago, Castro's remains arrived to Santiago for burial. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) 0 Shares Email A wooden box containing Fidel Castro's ashes was placed by his brother and successor on Sunday into the side of a granite boulder that has become Cuba's only official monument to the charismatic bearded rebel who seized control of a U.S.-allied Caribbean island and transformed it into a western outpost of Soviet-style communism that he ruled with absolute power for nearly a half century. The private, early-morning ceremony was attended by members of Fidel Castro's family, the ruling Politburo of the single-party system he founded, and Latin American leaders who installed closely allied leftist governments in Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Brazil. After nine days of fervent national mourning and wall-to-wall homages to Castro on state-run media, the government barred independent coverage of the funeral, releasing a handful of photos and brief descriptions of the ceremony later in the day. The ceremony began at 6:39 a.m. when the military caravan bearing Castro's remains in a flag-draped cedar coffin left the Plaza of the Revolution in the eastern city of Santiago. Thousands of people lined the two-mile route to Santa Ifigenia cemetery, waving Cuban flags and shouting \"Long live Fidel!\" The ashes were delivered to Castro's younger brother and successor, President Raul Castro, who wore his olive general's uniform as he placed the remains into a niche in the enormous grey boulder that will serve as his tomb. The niche was sealed with a green marble plaque emblazed with the name \"Fidel\" in gold letters. The tomb stands to the side of a memorial to the rebel soldiers killed in an attack that Castro led on Santiago's Moncada barracks on July 26, 1953, and in front of the mausoleum of Cuban national hero Jose Marti. As the funeral ended, martial music could be heard outside the cemetery, where Ines de la Rosa was among the mourners gathered. She said she would have liked to watch the interment on television, but \"we understand how they as a family also need a bit of privacy.\" The decision to keep the final farewell private came the morning after Raul Castro announced that Cuba would prohibit the naming of streets and monuments after his brother, and bar the construction of statues of the former leader and revolutionary icon, in keeping with his desire to avoid a cult of personality. \"The leader of the revolution rejected any manifestation of a cult of personality and was consistent in that through the last hours of his life, insisting that, once dead, his name and likeness would never be used on institutions, streets, parks or other public sites, and that busts, statutes or other forms of tribute would never be erected,\" Raul Castro told a massive crowd gathered in the eastern city of Santiago. He said that Cuba's National Assembly would vote in its next session on the law fulfilling the wishes of his brother, who died last week at 90. The legislature generally holds a meeting in December and under Cuba's single-party system, parliament unanimously or near-unanimously approves every government proposal. Fidel Castro, who stepped down in 2006 after falling ill, kept his name off public sites during his near half-century in power because he said he wanted to avoid the development of a personality cult. In contrast, the images of his fellow revolutionary fighters Camilo Cienfuegos and Ernesto \" Che\" Guevara became common across Cuba in the decades since their deaths. Mourning for Castro has been fervent and intense across the country since his death, particularly in rural eastern Cuba, where huge crowds have been shouting Castro's name and lining the roads to salute the funeral procession carrying his ashes. \"All of us would like to put Fidel's name on everything but in the end, Fidel is all of Cuba,\" said Juan Antonio Gonzalez, a 70-year-old retired economist. \"It was a decision of Fidel's, not Raul's, and I think he has to be respected.\" Castro's reign over the island nation 90 miles (145 kilometers) from Florida was marked by the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Castro, who outlasted a crippling U.S. trade embargo as well as dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots, died 10 years after a life-threatening illness led him to turn over power to his brother. Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin America . For decades his defiance of the U.S. and dedication to social equality, free health care and universal education was a source of inspiration and support to revolutionaries from Latin America to Africa, even as Cubans who fled to exile loathed him with equal measure. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Michael Weissenstein reported from Havana.

The selection committee stayed with the same top four Sunday as it had going into championship weekend, leaving out No. 5 Penn State even though the Nittany Lions won the Big Ten title game and beat Ohio State earlier in the season. Full college football coverage at CBSSports.com The Buckeyes (11-1) are the first team to reach the playoff in its three-year history without winning their conference. The unbeaten Crimson Tide (13-0) is in the playoff for the third straight season and is the top seed for the second time. They will play the fourth-ranked Huskies (12-1) in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta on Dec. 31. Alabama has played Washington four times previously, twice in bowls and not since 1986. Huskies fans were holding up signs at games late in the season, proclaiming \u201cWe want Bama.\u201d \u201cSometimes you got to be careful what you wish for,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said on ESPN. \u201cI didn\u2019t hold up that sign.\u201d No. 2 Ohio State is making its second playoff appearance and No. 3 Clemson (12-1) is in for the second consecutive season. The Buckeyes and Tigers will meet at the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, on Dec. 31. Ohio State and Clemson have played twice before, both in bowl games. The last time was 2014. The one difference from last week\u2019s top four and the final one was Clemson and Ohio State switched spots.\u00a0 So the Tigers will wear the home jerseys in University of Phoenix stadium instead of the Buckeyes. Selection committee chairman Kirby Hocutt said the decision came down not to Penn State and Ohio State but the Nittany Lions (11-2) and Pac-12 champion Washington. The Huskies\u2019 only loss was to Southern California and its nonconference schedule featured FCS Portland State, Rutgers and Idaho. Penn State played Pitt, Temple and Kent State in the conference and lost to the Panthers. The Nittany Lions also were beaten by 39 at Michigan in their last loss. Penn State finished the season on a nine-game winning streak to make a strong closing statement. \u201cHad Washington had a stronger strength of schedule I do not think that conversation would have been as difficult,\u201d said Hocutt, who is also the Texas tech athletic director. The selection protocol does not require the committee to pick conference champions or the winner of head-to-head matchups. \u201cYou can make arguments for and against so many teams,\u201d Penn State coach James Franklin said on ESPN, adding his team was appreciative of the Rose Bowl bid it will receive. The rest of the New Year\u2019s Six bowls were set to be announced later in the day Sunday. The questions that remain: - Which Pac-12 team will be in the Rose Bowl? - Which Southeastern Conference team will play in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma? - Which Atlantic Coast Conference team will play in the Orange Bowl, likely against No. 6 Michigan? - Which teams will play in the Cotton Bowl? Unbeaten Western Michigan is likely to be the highest ranked Group of Five champion and get one spot. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "DEC. 4, 2016 By The New York Times Daniel Vega, 36, said he was \u201cinfuriated\u201d waiting to hear news about his 22-year-old brother, Alex Vega, who had not answered his phone Saturday. Mr. Vega said he had heard from a friend that his brother was at the party. \u201cGive me some gloves. I\u2019ve got work shoes. I\u2019m ready,\u201d Mr. Vega said. \u201cLet me find my brother, that\u2019s all I want.\u201d The structure had a permit to function as a warehouse, but not as a residence or for a party. Officials said they were investigating reports that the building had also been used as a living space. The building, known as the Ghost Ship, in the Fruitvale neighborhood, was the site of an event that was to feature a range of experimental and electronic music, performed by a synth musician drawing from the \u201cblack, queer diaspora\u201d and others, as well as a visual installation. On Saturday morning, the event\u2019s Facebook page said admission to the show was $10 for those who arrived before 11 p.m. and $15 after that. By the end of the day, the pricing had disappeared and the page had turned into an emergency message board, as dozens of friends and family members posted about missing loved ones. \u201cA lot of these people are young people,\u201d Sergeant Kelly said Saturday. \u201cThey are from all parts of our community.\u201d Some of the dead may be citizens of other countries, he said. Images from the building\u2019s website depict a wooden studio filled with antiques, sculptures and curios. Old lamps, musical instruments, suitcases and rugs decorated the ornate space. Photo Melinda Drayton, a battalion chief with the Oakland Fire Department, addressing the news media on Sunday. Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press Emergency workers said they arrived to find the building filled with heavy smoke and flames. Bodies were found on the second floor of the building, Chief Teresa Deloach Reed of the Oakland Fire Department said Saturday. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIn my career of 30 years, I haven\u2019t experienced something of this magnitude,\u201d she said. Even without a full accounting, the fire was one of the deadliest in the United States in many years. In 2003, 100 people were killed in a fire in a nightclub in Warwick, R.I. An explosion at a fertilizer plant in Texas in 2013 killed 15 people. \u2014         Oakland Firefighters (@OaklandFireLive) Dec. 3, 2016 Chief Deloach Reed said there were \u201cno reports of smoke alarms going off.\u201d At least two fire extinguishers were inside, she said. On the event\u2019s Facebook page, people distributed a spreadsheet that listed identifying information \u2014 age, height, weight, hair color, tattoos \u2014 and contact numbers for many of those who were unaccounted for. Oakland\u2019s music and art scene was already struggling with high rent prices. The city\u2019s underground bands and artists live a seminomadic existence in search of warehouses, homes and other spaces to show art, play music and dance into the early hours. Diego Aguilar-Canabal, 24, a blogger and freelance writer who lives in Berkeley and plays guitar in a band called the Noriegas, estimated he had been to three dozen house and warehouse parties over the past two years. \u201cThe basic idea is people want to do loud things late at night, and industrial space is really good for that because there aren\u2019t many neighbors to complain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety about income inequality and class warfare, and a lot of these artists are trying to do the best they can to have a community.\u201d Mr. Aguilar-Canabal has been to the Ghost Ship once, last summer, and remembered it as a dim and cluttered area with a \u201cmaze\u201d of furniture, canvas paintings on the walls and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hanging from the ceilings. \u201cThe reason we left was that it had only had one source of water, which was a sink, and the water tasted really gross,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe went to a corner store to get something to drink and were like, \u2018Let\u2019s just go home.\u2019\u201d Thomas Fuller and Conor Dougherty reported from Oakland, and Jonah Engel Bromwich from New York.

USA TODAY Sports Penn State Nittany Lions quarterback Trace McSorley (9) celebrates the victory with running back Saquon Barkley. (Photo: Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY Sports) Ohio State had been considered a lock for the College Football Playoff ever since it beat Michigan \u2014 then ranked No. 3 \u2014 in double overtime on Nov. 26. The Buckeyes\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was strong, with three top-10 wins and its only loss on the road to top-10 Penn State. But the committee\u2019s love for Ohio State extended into it passing the eye test overwhelmingly, despite a shaky and inconsistent passing game. And the fact that it was not and would not be a conference champion. What\u2019s frustrating about Sunday\u2019s Playoff semifinal pairings is that the Buckeyes\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 which had holes in it worth poking at and having a robust discussion about \u2014 did get compared head-to-head to that of Penn State, the team that beat them and finished just outside the top four at No. 5, but not as much as it should have. The fourth and final spot of the Playoff should have been between the Buckeyes and the Nittany Lions. CFP selection committee chairman Kirby Hocutt said those two teams were compared to one another \u2014 and the committee was \"incredibly impressed\u201d by Penn State \u2014 but that the committee has felt for a number of weeks that Ohio State was simply a better team that Penn State. Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, Washington picked for College Football Playoff \u201cI will say that Penn State significantly enhanced their position in our conversations after their victory over Wisconsin and the performance we saw last night as they won the Big Ten Championship,\u201d Hocutt said Sunday afternoon. Still, it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for both Nittany Lions fans and also those who believe in the value of conference championships. Penn State finished the season by reeling off nine consecutive wins and winning the Big Ten championship by beating Wisconsin in a thrilling come-from-behind win on Saturday night. The committee consists of 12 people; the human aspect and the subjectivity that comes along with it is part of the process. Committee members inherently value different parts of the CFP criteria differently, but they should be taking into consideration a team\u2019s growth through the season \u2014 even if a team suffered two September losses. They are charged with choosing the four best teams that will ideally set up two competitive semifinal games on Dec. 31. There\u2019s a reason to pick teams that appear to be peaking and healthy at the right time: They should play at their highest level in the postseason. Ranking reaction: It wouldn't be college football without controversy But what would have been the most fascinating decision \u2014 comparing Penn State to Ohio State, and allowing the tiebreaking criteria such as head-to-head results and conference titles to really come into play against a strong strength of schedule and the eye test \u2014 wasn\u2019t what the fourth and final spot came down to because it didn\u2019t have to. The CFP committee gave itself a buffer. That buffer came in the form of Washington. By (rightfully) docking and criticizing the Huskies for their weak nonconference schedule, the committee was able to separate\u00a0Ohio State from Washington, and emphasize how close the separation was between Washington and Michigan (last week) and Washington and Penn State (now). That meant that the question of Ohio State vs. Penn State never truly needed to be answered. Even though one was the conference champion of the league the committee felt was the strongest in college football \u2014 and beat the other when the two actually played. Which is too bad.

He defeated far-right candidate Norbert Hofer. (Photo: Roland Schlager, AFP/Getty Images) Austria's left-leaning Alexander Van der Bellen was elected president Sunday, beating far-right populist Norbert Hofer, according to preliminary results that showed Van der Bellen convincingly ahead. Hofer conceded in a Facebook \u00a0posting, congratulating\u00a0Van der Bellen and asking all Austrians to pull together.\u00a0\"I am infinitely sad that it didn't work out,\" he said. The results prompted congratulations by mainstream politicians in neighboring Germany and elsewhere who had feared that Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States and the Brexit vote in Britain could bolster populist sentiment across the continent. A\u00a0win for the Austrian far-right might have triggered a domino effect in\u00a0key elections next year in France, Germany and The Netherlands. German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who heads the center-left Social Democrats, told the Bild newspaper: \u201cA load has been taken off the mind of all of Europe.\u201d He called the result \u201ca clear victory for good sense against right-wing populism,\u201d the Associated Press reported. Partial results shortly after the polls closed Sunday showed Van der Bellen with 53.3%\u00a0of the vote and Hofer at 46.7%, according to the AP. Austrian officials said the percentages may change with the final tally, but the results gave Van der Bellen an unbeatable lead. \"Should this projection really be true, at which point we can be pleased, it is a good day for Austria,\" Van der Bellen's campaign manager Lothar Lockl told Austrian television network ORF, Reuters reported. The president's role in Austria is largely ceremonial, though a win by Hofer \u2014 whose Euro-skeptic and anti-immigration Freedom Party was founded by a former Nazi general \u2014 would have made him Europe's first far-right head of state since World War II. Austria was the first European Union nation to hold a presidential election since Trump's surprise victory last month in the U.S. Hofer opted for a soft tone as he voted Sunday.\u201cI want to commit myself to changing this union in a positive way,\" the AP reported.\u00a0\"And I don\u2019t want Austria to leave the European Union. ... Our strength is not to be an amorphous entity, our strength is diversity, a diverse European Union.\u201d Sunday\u2019s election was a rerun from May. Hofer narrowly lost to Van der Bellen in that vote, but the outcome was canceled after an Austrian court ruled there were ballot irregularities.

    "text": "Trump Faces Pushback From Base, Allies Over Romney Musings By jonathan lemire, associated press NEW YORK \u0097 Dec 4, 2016, 8:30 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump's Dinner With Mitt Romney 0 Shares Email As President-elect Donald Trump stood onstage during the debut night of his \"thank you\" tour and teased that he was about to announce a surprise Cabinet pick, some in the Ohio crowd bellowed: \"No Romney! No Romney!\" Trump's administration selections have largely been cheered by close allies and supporters. Many have deep ties to Washington and Wall Street that would seem contradictory to the populist, outsider campaign Trump ran with a promise to \"drain the swamp\" of corruption and elitism in government. But the possible selection of Romney, who has been on Trump's shortlist for secretary of state despite being a forceful critic throughout the campaign, has been met with trepidation from many of the working-class voters that propelled the Republican to his astonishing victory. Kim Doss loudly cheered Trump at the Cincinnati rally but will not forgive Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, for the \"witch hunt\" he held \"to make sure Trump wasn't the nominee.\" \"I think he went out of his way to make that happen, which totally backfired on him,\" said Doss, a 46-year-old accountant from Hebron, Kentucky. \"He obviously said some really ugly things about (Trump).\" Some of Trump's most prominent allies, including his campaign manager, have taken the unprecedented step of using national television interviews to bash Romney. And nearly a dozen Trump backers who attended the Ohio victory lap vehemently denounced Romney as a choice to be the nation's top diplomat. Then there's the Russia twist: Russian politicians are concerned about reports that Trump would even consider Romney as secretary of state because of Romney's harsh stance on Russia. Trump has said he would like to improve U.S.-Russian relations. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with the NTV channel that Trump's business accomplishments show him to be a \"smart man.\" He added that \"if he is a smart man, that means that he will fairly soon become aware of a different level of responsibility. We expect that he act with these considerations in mind.\" Rally-goer Josh Kanowitz said he was willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for some of his establishment-friendly picks \u2014 including former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary \u2014 but he visibly recoiled at the suggestion that Romney would be a team-of-rivals style selection from Trump. Romney, the GOP's 2012 president nominee, eviscerated Trump in a March speech, delivering broadsides against the New York businessman who he deemed \"a con man\" and \"a fake.\" \"His domestic policies would lead to recession,\" said Romney. \"His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.\" Unlike many establishment Republicans, Romney never wavered in his opposition to Trump during the campaign and did not reveal whether he voted for him. Despite that, Trump, who deeply prizes loyalty and rarely forgives foes, summoned him to his New Jersey golf club last month to interview for secretary of State. After the meeting, Trump was said to be taken by the way Romney \"looks the part\" of a globe-trotting diplomat, according to people close to the transition process. In nominating Romney, Trump would be signaling his willingness to heal campaign wounds and reach out to traditional Republicans who were deeply skeptical of his experience and temperament. The president-elect has added at least one other former critic to his team: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who attacked the businessman for being slow to denounce support from white supremacists, was Trump's pick to be ambassador to the United Nations. Trump's team last week named four contenders for secretary of State, including Romney. The other three are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and former CIA director David Petraeus . But on Sunday, the Trump camp said the president-elect had expanded the pool of potential candidates. Vice President-elect Mike Pence on ABC's \"This Week\" added a fresh reference to former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations \"John Bolton or others who may be added to the list\" of candidates. Trump met with Romney again last week over dinner, a remarkable moment of public courtship after which the 2012 nominee addressed reporters and did a stunning about-face on Trump, declaring that the evening with the president-elect was \"enlightening, and interesting, and engaging\" and that he was optimistic that \"America's best days are ahead of us.\" The reality TV-style auditions have stirred speculation that it could be a Trump-approved attempt to humiliate a prominent Republican who staunchly opposed him throughout the presidential campaign. \"People feel betrayed to think that Gov. Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump, now our president-elect, would be given the most significant cabinet post of all,\" said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide. She said Romney was \"nothing but awful\" to Trump for a year. Conway's opposition to Romney is also said to be shared by Steve Bannon, the controversial conservative media executive who will serve as Trump's White House senior adviser. And Newt Gingrich , the former Speaker of the House who was an outspoken Trump ally, has mocked Romney for \"sucking up\" to Trump and said he could \"think of 20 other people\" better suited to be secretary of State. Not all of the president-elect's supporters believe that Romney would be a hard sell to Trump's base. John James, a 55-year-old writer from Cincinnati, said Romney would be \"fantastic to represent America\" and suggested that \"sometimes you need people who don't agree with you 100 percent because they give a different perspective.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Lisa Cornwell contributed reporting from Cincinnati. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Dylann Roof to Judge: Let Lawyers Back on Death Penalty Case By meg kinnard, associated press COLUMBIA, S.C. \u0097 Dec 4, 2016, 2:46 PM ET 0 Shares Star Getty Images In this handout photo provided by the Charleston County Sheriff's Office Detention Center, Dylann Storm Roof is seen in his booking photo after he was apprehended as the main suspect in the mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church that killed nine people on June 18, 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina. 0 Shares Email The white man charged with the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church asked a judge on Sunday if he could have his defense team back, at least temporarily. In a handwritten request, Dylann Roof asked U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel to bring his defense team back on board for the guilt phase of his federal death penalty trial, which begins this week in Charleston. \"I would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only,\" Roof wrote. \"Can you let me have them back for the guilt phase, and then let me represent myself for the sentencing phase of the trial? If you would allow that, then that is what I would like to do.\" Death penalty cases are split into two parts: the guilt phase, and then a separate portion that focuses on whether or not the defendant will be sentenced to death or life in prison. Roof, 22, faces dozens of federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion, for the June 2015 slayings at the end of a Bible study at Emanuel AME Church. Police said he hurled racial slurs during the shooting and left three people alive so they could tell the world the killings were because he hated black people. The request comes a week after a federal judge allowed Roof to represent himself, a request that came as court convened last week to begin the process of qualifying a jury pool to hear Roof's case. Gergel, who had found Roof competent to stand trial a week earlier, said Roof had the constitutional right to act as his own attorney, a decision the judge called \"very unwise.\" Roof's former defense team has remained his legal advisers but has sought to play a larger role in his defense, expressing concern last week Roof may not present evidence that could sway a jury to spare his life \u2014 something that could violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The lawyers said they didn't know why Roof wanted to represent himself but added that other capital defendants have fired their lawyers to avoid having embarrassing evidence revealed, writing that the \"22-year-old ninth-grade dropout\" might deliberately sabotage his own defense in order to get the death penalty. There will be a hearing Monday for Roof and prosecutors to discuss pretrial motions, and opening statements are currently scheduled for Wednesday. If Roof's request isn't granted and he continues to represent himself, he'll be making those statements, as well as questioning witnesses at trial. That could include relatives of the shooting victims, some of whom said at Roof's initial court appearance that they forgave him and would pray for him. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Despite Trump's pro-Russian statements during the campaign, Russian politicians are concerned about reports that Trump is considering Mitt Romney , known for his harsh stance on Russia, to be his secretary of state. Putin said in an interview with the NTV channel to be broadcast later on Sunday that he is confident Trump will make responsible choices. Putin said in remarks released by NTV that Trump's business accomplishments show him to be a \"smart man.\" He added that \"if he is a smart man, that means that he will fairly soon become aware of a different level of responsibility. We expect that he act with these considerations in mind.\" 0 Shares ",

Back Story Photo Credit The Smithsonian Institution, via Associated Press The decision by the American air conditioner maker Carrier to keep some jobs from being relocated to Mexico comes as its industry faces scrutiny over pollution. A recent global accord will curb hydrofluorocarbons, a chemical common in most air-conditioners that contributes to global warming. So the race is on to find greener alternatives as demand for air conditioning rises around the world. At Santa Clara University in California, heating and cooling systems are fueled by rooftop solar panels. And hydrofluoroolefins , an HFC substitute that is more energy efficient, are becoming popular. These technologies probably weren\u2019t on the mind of the American engineer Willis Carrier , above, who paved the way for modern air conditioning . In 1902, with cold water and an ammonia compressor, he figured out a way to control air temperature and the moisture in it. Some of air conditioning\u2019s next steps might be a return to the more distant past. In parts of the Middle East, the medieval wind tower is making a comeback.

    "text": "Got it Authorities in Oakland, Calif., say dozens of people have died in a fire that broke out during a party at warehouse that served as an art and music venue. (Claritza Jimenez,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) By Michael Kranish , Tim Bontemps , Jasper Scherer and Kristine Guerra December 4 at 10:56 PM Follow @PostKranish Follow @TimBontemps Follow jaspscherer Follow @kristinegWP OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 One of the deadliest fires in recent U.S. history began amid a cluttered collective of artist studios known as the Ghost Ship and spread quickly through a two-story warehouse that did not have fire sprinklers, killing at least 33 people and possibly many more, officials said Sunday. \u201cHelp me!\u201d shouted partygoers who had gathered at the warehouse for a Friday evening of music and dancing in East Oakland\u2019s Fruitvale district, only to find themselves trapped in an inferno. Firetrucks arrived within three minutes, officials said, but nothing could be done to stop the fast-spreading flames soon enough. The sky was lit with a huge fireball, ignited by an array of artisan works, guitars, pianos, bookshelves, bowls and countless other tinderlike pieces. Bob Mule, a photographer who worked at the warehouse, told the local NBC affiliate that he saw the fire coming from the back left corner of the building. He heard a friend with a broken ankle calling for help. Mule said he raced to the friend, but \u201cthere was a lot of stuff in the way and the flames were too much. . . . I had to let him go.\u201d Standing outside the warehouse as flames continued to burn through the walls and the roof, with an arm bandaged from wounds suffered during his flight from the fire, Mule said he had not heard whether his friend had made it out. Firefighters work inside the burned warehouse following the fatal fire in Oakland, Calif. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) As the fire raged, city officials met with roomsful of families who had undertaken anguished searches for relatives. The rescue effort quickly turned into a salvage operation. By midafternoon Sunday, officials had searched about 35 percent of the building and discovered 33 bodies, many of them charred beyond recognition, and expected to find many more. One survivor estimated that at least 50 people had been in the building. The youngest victim identified as of Sunday afternoon was 17. That person\u2019s name was not being released. On Sunday, the coroner\u2019s office released the names of seven other victims: Cash Askew, 22, David Clines, 35, Travis Hough, 35, and Donna Kellogg, 32, all of Oakland; Nick Gomez-Hall, 25, of Coronado, Calif.; Sara Hoda, 30, of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Brandon Chase Wittenauer, 32, of Hayward, Calif. Firefighters moved slowly in the search, walking amid fallen beams and smoldering ruins looking for bodies. They undertook their mission at great risk, with ceilings and floors in danger of collapse. They doused flames by passing buckets down the line. The firefighters ranged in experience from a few months to 30 years, but all were affected by the intensity of the blaze and the piles of bodies they encountered along the way, officials said. [ Site of Oakland warehouse fire was jammed with flammable objects ] The warehouse had long been the subject of complaints. Local officials said they were alerted to possible code violations on Nov.\u00a013, but they could not get inside the structure when they visited four days later. Local news outlets reported that a number of artists used the building as their sleeping quarters as well as studios. Asked on Sunday about the inspection, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) said: \u201cThe complaint alleged there was blight and external trash and debris, not just around the building but in the adjacent lot that is owned by the same owner. They also alleged there was illegal or unpermitted construction inside, and possible residential use. . . . The inspector was able to document the external blight but was unable to gain access to the building. So that investigation had remained open and an initial notice of violation was issued to the owner with regard to the blight.\u201d Local officials said it was the deadliest fire they could recall in the city, and it ranked as one of the worst structural fires in recent U.S. history. The deadliest fire in recent years occurred in 2003, when 100 people died at a West Warwick, R.I., nightclub called the Station. A woman cries on Sunday near the site of a warehouse fire that started Friday night and killed dozens of people. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) The fire began about 11:30\u00a0p.m. Friday, as partygoers gathered on the second floor to listen to a music group called Golden Donna. The band played before a dance floor of about 2,500 square feet inside the roughly 10,000-square-foot warehouse. By the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the staircase had burned away, Mark Hoffmann, deputy chief of the Oakland Fire Department, said Saturday. [ Death toll rises to 13 in Tennessee wildfires ] Firefighters used special equipment to breach a wall and then deployed the most basic means to carefully make their way inside, clearing debris with shovels and other hand tools, and dousing flames with buckets passed from one person to another. \u201cWe had firefighters with basically coveralls and buckets and shovels, taking bits of debris out into the vacant lot, to be then loaded into dump trucks and removed to an off-site location,\u201d Melinda Drayton of the Oakland Fire Department said at a news conference near the scene. \u201cThis will be a long and arduous process, but we want to make sure we are respecting the victims, their families and our firefighters\u2019 safety to work slowly and carefully through the building.\u201d Drayton said she was inside the structure and watched \u201cthe somber approach that [firefighters] took to this search. It was quiet, it was heartbreaking.\u201d She said crews found 10 of the victims in the middle of the building. Four of them were close together, and the other six were within 10 feet. Three more were found on the east side of the building, Drayton said. Sgt. Ray Kelly, spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said the death toll will go up. \u201cWe will be here for days and days to come,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe anticipate that the number of victims will rise and will increase.\u201d Questions remain about whether electrical issues, pyrotechnics or errant candles or cigarettes had started the fire. Fire officials said the building did not have sprinklers. A criminal investigation team was sent to the site to preserve the option of a possible prosecution, officials said. The building\u2019s interior featured a tangled network of antique furniture, artwork, musical instruments, wooden lofts, tapestries and oddities, such as mannequin parts, according to a Tumblr blog that appears to show the building. Al Garcia, 62, said the warehouse across the street from his business was fully engulfed when he walked over about 12:30 a.m. Saturday. Officials say the fire broke out an hour earlier during a rave party that was attended by more than 50 people. Garcia said he saw two teenagers sitting on a sidewalk, crying. They were at the party, they told him, and were the last ones to get out. Garcia asked what happened. \u201cIt got dark, and smoke took us over,\u201d one of the teens told him, Garcia said. They couldn\u2019t see where they were going, they told Garcia, but they knew several people were behind them, also trying to get out. \u201cWhen we turned around, nobody came out behind us,\u201d one of the teens said, according to Garcia. The music event\u2019s Facebook page was filled with inquiries on Saturday from people looking for their loved ones or offering their assistance to families and friends of the victims. Michael Rosen, who had been at the party Friday night, said there were no more than 75 people in attendance. \u201cThis was a very intimate gathering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a wild, out-of-control party where things got out of hand.\u201d Carmen Brito and Nikki Kelber, who lived at the warehouse, spoke in an interview on Sunday about their emotions as they tried to process what had happened. They survived the fire but lost everything in the process except for the clothes on their backs, handouts from friends and, in Kelber\u2019s case, her cat, Mookie, which she managed to carry out of the burning building after escaping from her first-floor apartment. \u201cEmotionally, for everyone who was a resident there, we are going back and forth between feeling like \u2018Oh, my god, I almost died,\u2019 to \u2018Oh, my god, I lost everything,\u2019 to \u2018Oh, my god, these people died in our home,\u2019 \u201d Brito said. Kelber said about 23 people lived in the building. \u201cIt was one of the most amazing, beautiful spaces you could ever see. It was so creative and so inspiring as an artist,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was always somebody working on another project, always somebody to bounce ideas off of. Max would be tattooing or working on a piece of jewelry. . . . Anthony was sewing in the back, and Carmen was painting in the back and someone else is doing visual artistry. . . . These weren\u2019t just roommates, and these weren\u2019t just people who lived in a building that you didn\u2019t talk to. These people were part of your daily lives.\u201d Friends and family members of the concertgoers also cobbled together a list of missing people in a shared Google Docs spreadsheet. They included identifying features and contact numbers. Forty names were listed as of Saturday evening; seven were marked either safe or in the hospital. The list is now private. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa \u00adDeloach-Reed said fire officials will verify those names against the ones they have compiled. \u201cThis is pretty tragic for us,\u201d Deloach-Reed said. \u201cIt is hitting this community pretty hard. I don\u2019t even want to talk about how the families and friends are feeling. We have a community that\u2019s hurting.\u201d The building was considered to be an \u201cartist collective,\u201d as city officials put it, with spaces for artists to work. \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d said Pete Veilleux, a friend of several of the building\u2019s residents and the owner of a nearby native-plant nursery called East Bay Wilds. \u201cIt was like an art gallery, but people lived there.\u201d As darkness fell here, the makeshift memorial on the corners of East 12th Street and 31st Avenue continued to grow. Close to two dozen bouquets of flowers were laid on the sidewalk, and the same number of candles were lit in remembrance of victims of the tragedy. Several names \u2014 including Ara Jo, Draven and Johnny \u2014 were left on signs and postcards and Post-It notes as ways to remember them.

Well, outcome matters to each in NFL draft Halas Hall Pass: The return of cornerback Kyle Fuller to practice Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss the return of cornerback Kyle Fuller to practice and the official end to Kevin White's 2016 season. Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer discuss the return of cornerback Kyle Fuller to practice and the official end to Kevin White's 2016 season. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune We're a still a good two weeks or so from the true escalation of mock draft season. Which means we're five months from that annual reminder of how flawed those early prognostications always are. So at this stage, any talk about the 2017 NFL draft must come with an italic disclaimer: It's still early! Take any and all pre-draft analysis with a grain of salt! Still, there\u2019s no way to downplay looming draft intrigue on a weekend like this, with a Sunday snoozer at Soldier Field that will features the 2-9 Bears as two-point underdogs against the 1-10 49ers. If last weekend\u2019s apathy among Bears fans is any indication, plenty of good rows will be available for Sunday\u2019s noon kickoff near Lake Michigan. Particularly with the cold and snow closing in. The Bears and 49ers are two of only four teams yet to secure three victories. (The 0-12 Browns and 2-9 Jaguars are the others.) Thus, for better or worse in those NFL cities, December now has become so much about draft positioning, about shifting the focus to 2017. The argument can be made that this weekend's Bears-49ers loser actually will emerge as the real winner, inching a little closer to the top of the draft board. Which means Sunday's contest may feature as much peripheral chatter about Myles Garrett or Mitch Trubisky as it does about Pernell McPhee or Colin Kaepernick. Bears vs. 49ers: Tribune writers make their picks Open link With that in mind, we're offering an early primer on a few of the most important draft-related questions to start thinking about down the stretch of an otherwise dismal season. With the Bears in line to pick in the top five for the first time since 2005, what high-profile prospects figure to be in their sights? The silver lining amid the Bears' disheartening struggles is that they easily could justify using their top pick in 2017 to address just about any position on the roster. Either side of the ball. Garrett, an explosive edge rusher from Texas A&M, ultimately might become the most coveted difference maker in the draft, a productive presence with the power and burst to energize any defense he joins. Bears general manager Ryan Pace also may get a shot at nabbing Michigan's Jabrill Peppers, an athletic marvel whose versatility on defense makes him an interesting study. Alabama's Marlon Humphrey is a standout cornerback on one of the nation's best defenses, a bigger, physical defensive back whose potential fit within Vic Fangio's system will have to be studied as the Bears seek to add more playmakers. The Bears are host to the 49ers at Soldier Field on Sunday in a matchup of woebegone franchises jockeying for draft positioning. The 49ers played the Dolphins in Miami last Sunday, losing their franchise-record 10th straight game, before staying in Orlando to practice all week. With a 1-10 record,... The Bears are host to the 49ers at Soldier Field on Sunday in a matchup of woebegone franchises jockeying for draft positioning. The 49ers played the Dolphins in Miami last Sunday, losing their franchise-record 10th straight game, before staying in Orlando to practice all week. With a 1-10 record,... (Rich Campbell) Other top prospects to keep tabs on over the next five months include Alabama defensive end Jonathan Allen and inside linebacker Reuben Foster, North Carolina quarterback Trubisky, LSU safety Jamal Adams and running back Leonard Fournette and Ohio State cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Do the Bears have to consider drafting a quarterback with their first-round pick? Consider it? Sure. Force the issue? No. And that will be yet another big test of discipline for Pace, who certainly must understand the need for an infusion of new energy at his team's most important position. No task on Pace's 2017 to-do list will be more important than providing a sense of direction at quarterback. The presumption is the organization has readied itself to end its eight-season union with Jay Cutler, who's now lost for the season with a torn labrum in his right shoulder. But, as has been widely documented, this spring's quarterback class is considered mediocre at best, a complicating factor in the Bears' planning process. The lack of elite quarterback talent in the draft will make it paramount that the Bears stay true with their evaluations throughout the coming months, resisting the temptation to modify their grades based on the need at the position. At present, Trubisky has been the fastest riser. He's listed at 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds with good athleticism and a solid feel for the game. Among many draft pundits, he's being touted as the only quarterback worth a top-15 pick. The best of the rest is a fraternity that includes Clemson's Deshaun Watson, Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer, Texas Tech's Patrick Mahomes, Miami's Brad Kaaya and Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield, all players worth waiting on unless the supply-and-demand dynamics in the league suddenly go haywire in the coming months. If the Bears don't swing at a quarterback on the first night of the draft, what else can they do to address that need through the draft? Start first with a look at the 9-2 Raiders , one of this season's biggest surprises. They found their franchise quarterback in the second round of the 2014 draft, selecting Derek Carr at No. 36 overall. In the first round of that draft? GM Reggie McKenzie pounced at No. 5 on linebacker Khalil Mack, who has emerged as one of the league's most disruptive defensive forces. In another ordinary quarterback class that featured only three first-rounders \u2014 Blake Bortles , Johnny Manziel and Teddy Bridgewater \u2014 the Raiders let the draft come to them and ultimately hit on Carr. That's certainly not a foolproof formula but one the Bears will be wise to consider. The Bengals operated similarly in 2011 when they landed receiver A.J. Green with the fourth overall pick before nabbing Andy Dalton at the top of Round 2. If my teenage son had behaved like controversial 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick the last three months, the advice would come easily. Stand up for the national anthem and pay respect to the men and women who have risked their lives to preserve the freedoms you enjoy. Register to vote so your... If my teenage son had behaved like controversial 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick the last three months, the advice would come easily. Stand up for the national anthem and pay respect to the men and women who have risked their lives to preserve the freedoms you enjoy. Register to vote so your... (David Haugh) The Seahawks also can attest to the value of waiting on a quarterback. Russell Wilson was the sixth quarterback selected in the 2012 draft, taken in Round 3 (No. 75 overall) after the Seahawks previously had taken defensive end Bruce Irvin and linebacker Bobby Wagner with their first two picks. Seahawks GM John Schneider is certainly happy with how that turned out. And in that same draft, the Redskins found their quarterback of the future in a truly unorthodox fashion. They gave up a king's ransom in a trade with the Rams, surrendering three first-round picks and a second-rounder to move up to No. 2 overall to grab Robert Griffin III . That move will go down as one of the worst miscalculations in draft history. But two days after selecting Griffin, the Redskins doubled down on the position and took Kirk Cousins in the fourth round. Cousins led the Redskins to the playoffs last season and has his team in the wild-card chase again this year. That, at the very least, is an interesting case study with the Redskins having explained their motives to solidify the top two rungs on their depth chart at quarterback in that draft. After failing to take a quarterback in either of his first two drafts as Bears GM, Pace might consider rolling the dice on two quarterbacks this spring. It's probably a long shot. But crazier things have happened. With all the escalating chatter about draft positioning, is it truly better to have a higher pick? The simple answer is yes. The higher the Bears pick, obviously, the more options they will have. But the discussion of that topic must be more nuanced with an ongoing acknowledgment that picking higher doesn't guarantee greater draft success. Holding a top five pick may seem to have far greater worth than picking between 6 and 10. But it's always more complicated. A team's front office and talent evaluation staff still has to get things right, identifying players who fit their system and culture in a way early development is possible. Here's a quick sampling of picks made in the last 10 years \u2026 \u2022Home runs in the top five: Cam Newton (No. 1 in 2011); Ndamukong Suh (No. 2 in 2010); A.J. Green (No. 4 in 2011). \u2022Busts in the top five: JaMarcus Russell (No. 1 in 2007); Trent Richardson (No. 3, 2013); Dion Jordan (No. 3 in 2013); Aaron Curry (No. 5 in 2009). \u2022Home runs at Nos. 6-10: Julio Jones (No. 6 in 2011); Adrian Peterson (No. 7 in 2007); Luke Kuechly (No. 9 in 2012). \u2022Busts selected at Nos. 6-10: Barkevious Mingo (No. 6 in 2013); Sedrick Ellis (No. 7 in 2008); Jake Locker (No. 8, 2011). Translation: there almost always will be potential gold mines and land mines at just about any draft position in the top of the first round. Obsessing over draft slots often proves counterproductive. So as the final five games of this season unfold, with Sunday's formality at Soldier Field next, Pace already has begun preparing for a bigger proving ground: that 50-hour period in April where the direction of the franchise will be set one way or another. It may seem like a long way off, but for the talent-needy Bears, there's little time to waste. ",

    "text": "William Yardley and Sandy Tolan Contact Reporter The Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday denied permission for the Dakota Access pipeline to cross under a section of the Missouri River, handing at least a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters. The decision came after months of protests by thousands of self-proclaimed \u201cwater protectors\u201d \u2014 bolstered by the arrival of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans \u00a0\u2014 who have opposed the pipeline out of concern that it could rupture and contaminate the river, which they say provides drinking water to the tribe and 17 million other Americans. The pipeline is being built by Energy Transfer Partners, whose chief executive, Kelcy Warren, has said the company would not be willing to explore alternative routes. The pipeline was nearly completed, save for the\u00a0proposed section that would have passed underneath Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River. The Army Corps of Engineers\u00a0denied a permit necessary for that section to be built. Protesting the Dakota Access pipeline Protesting the Dakota Access pipeline (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Protesting the Dakota Access pipeline (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) See more videos The Corps said Sunday it would explore alternative routes and could initiate a more thorough and lengthy environmental analysis of potential risks posed by the $3.8-billion, 1,170-mile pipeline. \"Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more work to do,\" Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army's assistant secretary for civil works, said in a statement . \"The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\u201d In a related memo also released Sunday, Darcy expanded on the Corps\u2019\u00a0explanation for denying the permit. She cited policy by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, which has said in the past that concerns about tribal resources and environmental justice should, in some cases, \u201cheighten agency attention\u201d to exploring alternative solutions for projects. She said the increased analysis she announced Sunday for the Dakota Access pipeline reflected such heightened attention. Darcy also noted that some documents related to the planned pipeline, including studies examining the risk of an oil spill, had been withheld from the tribe in the past \u201cbecause of security concerns and sensitivities.\u201d The tribe has said repeatedly, including in court, that it was not properly consulted on the pipeline and that the pipeline\u2019s risk had\u00a0not been fully examined.\u00a0 In recent months, thousands of people have set up camp on the edge of North Dakota's Cannonball River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, vowing to place themselves in the way of the pipeline to block its construction.\u00a0Native Americans from across the country have joined the cause, as have environmental groups and celebrities. As the news broke Sunday, the main Seven Council Fires camp erupted in celebration.\u00a0Pipeline opponents joined hands in a giant human chain around the camp. Victory and honor songs rang out as children, not entirely clear what the fuss was about, sledded down hillsides slick with a recent snow. \u201cPretty darn good!\u201d said Kandi Mossett of the Indigenous Environmental Network, when asked for her reaction. \u201cThis\u00a0is really big news. My immediate reaction is, this is a victory. But we must remain vigilant.\u201d Pipeline opponents are pushing for a full environmental impact statement, a process Mossett said would take three years and would effectively kill the project. A range of environmental and indigenous rights groups celebrated the Army Corps of Engineers'\u00a0decision. \u201cToday, the voices of indigenous people were heard. The rights of a sovereign nation were respected,\u201d Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, said in a statement. \"The Standing Rock Sioux and the myriad of indigenous communities by their side remind us all of the power of individuals to stand up and stand together to demand environmental justice.\u201d Standing Rock Sioux tribal Chairman David Archambault, who broke the news to gleeful throngs at the main camp, cautioned vigilance. Opponents worry that President-elect Donald Trump , who recently reiterated his support for the pipeline project, could reverse the Corps\u2019 decision. \u00a0\u201cA denial only gets us to Jan. 20,\u201d Mossett said. Supporters of the pipeline attacked the decision. \u201cThis purely political decision flies in the face of common sense and the rule of law,\u201d Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the MAIN Coalition, an industry group, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not surprising that the president would, again, use executive fiat in an attempt to enhance his legacy among the extreme left.\u00a0That the president continues to believe that he is above the law is simply un-American, and it is this arrogance that working-class Americans soundly rejected on Nov. 8.\u00a0For millions of hard-working people across the heartland, Jan.\u00a020 cannot come soon enough.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Stevens added: \"With President-elect Trump set to take office in a 47 days, we are hopeful that this is not the final word on the Dakota Access pipeline.\u201d Jan Hasselman, a lawyer for Earthjustice who is representing the Standing Rock Sioux in court, said Sunday that the Corps was \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d by pursuing alternatives and more environmental analysis. He acknowledged that a Trump administration could try to undo the Corps\u2019 decision. But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not so simple as reversing it with the stroke of a pen. Any reversal would be subject to close judicial scrutiny, and we are fully prepared to bring that case.\u201d The news broke as thousands of veterans continued to stream in from across the country in charter buses and private vehicles.\u00a0Hundreds of them stood in a snowy field near Cannon Ball, where Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and tribal elders addressed them.\u00a0Many wore fatigues; others carried American flags. \u201cI honor you on behalf of my family, on behalf of the families and communities on Standing Rock,\u201d said tribal elder Phyllis Young. \u201cWe hold all of the veterans in very high regard and we have many who suffer PTSD.\u201d Choking back tears, Young said that her own daughter, a former Army captain, committed suicide two years ago.\u00a0\u201cI know that it was conditions of war,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cBut we have honored.\u00a0We have been good Americans. We have served courageously.\u00a0We have done our duty.\u201d\u00a0 Addressing the veterans, some of whom had tears streaming down their faces, Young added:\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t want any of you to have\u00a0flashbacks.\u00a0And that is the purpose of our peaceful venture.\u00a0So that you can take on our belief system of peace.\u00a0We care about you.\u00a0Care about your health.\u00a0Your conditions.\u00a0Your well-being, spiritually, emotionally, physically.\u00a0I thank you for being here.\u201d As she spoke, more buses and private cars were pulling up on the narrow paved road alongside the gathering.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOur numbers are vast,\u201d said Dex McLelland, 27, an former Army infantryman who led a team of North Carolina veterans in a black Ford transit van.\u00a0\u201cWe mobilized 2,500 people in four days.\u201d McLelland, a disabled veteran who served in Afghanistan, arrived wearing his dog tags and camouflage pants.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t allow big money to come in and rip up the Constitution in the faces of America\u2019s oldest citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the original Americans.\u00a0Don\u2019t you think they\u2019ve caught enough slack? About makes you cry when you think about it.\u201d By late afternoon, the thousands of Native Americans, environmental activists and veterans gathered in the Seven Council Fires camp were\u00a0taking the time to celebrate.

    "text": "An ugly first half morphed into a picturesque victory for the Bears. Jordan Howard ran for three touchdowns as the Bears overcame snowy conditions and the 49ers to record a 26-6 win and improve to 3-9 on the season before 46,622 at Soldier Field on Sunday. Neither team completed a pass in the first... (Chicago Tribune staff) Bryce Callahan fair-caught a punt at his 5. Seriously, dude? Like the offense doesn\u2019t stink enough, and now the punt returner can\u2019t let the ball perhaps bounce into the end zone for a touchback? That\u2019s something they teach in Pop Warner, but apparently not at Halas Hall. The Bears took a delay-of-game penalty on a punt because Ben Braunecker didn\u2019t know he was on that unit. Do they practice? And then Braunecker was beaten to the inside to allow the punt to be blocked. Do they practice? But wait. There\u2019s more. That play ended with the returner stepping out of bounds short of the goal line followed by former Bear Shaun Draughn drawing a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct for celebrating a TD that wasn\u2019t a TD. I\u2019m telling you, this game had to be challenging the NFL record for combined stupid. Good for Jordan Howard, but isn\u2019t that what a tough running back is expected to do against the worst rushing defense in the NFL? Even a running back from the second-worst scoring offense in the NFL? So, there you go: Josh Bellamy can\u2019t catch passes while wide open in good weather and bad. No, look, Bellamy caught a pass down the left sideline. It was a pass that highlighted Matt Barkley \u2019s lack of arm strength, but still, Bellamy caught a pass. And look at that: Loggains went back to the shovel pass at the goal line, only this time it worked. I guess there\u2019s at least something the Bears practice. Hold it. Bellamy dropped a potential 61-yard TD pass. Barkley should know better by now. John Timu got credit for a pass defended when the ball hit him in the helmet as he was beaten badly on a play that Kaepernick badly underthrew. It\u2019s insulting to the Patriots and Cowboys to call this football. Has it always taken Barkley a half to get into playing a game? The Bears defense was excellent in exposing Kaepernick. Either the defense or the snow. Or Chip Kelly's death-spiral leadership. The 49ers proved to be a joke, so before you think the Bears accomplished something, remember this: They leave the game with just two wins more than that joke. ",

However, 300 of those positions were never scheduled to leave. The Carrier deal included no tax penalty. Instead, it offered instead a mix of tax breaks and other \"financial incentives\" for Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, amounting to $7 million over 10 years. The absence of a tax penalty prompted former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders to attack the deal in a Washington Post op-ed as effectively rewarding the company. Play ",

(Photo: Christian Petersen, Getty Images) NASSAU, Bahamas \u2013 Rickie Fowler walked onto the range Sunday at Albany Golf Club and spoke for a majority of golf fans worldwide. \u201cNice to see the red shirt on Sunday again.\u201d Tiger Woods just smiled in his famous Sunday wardrobe. Get used to seeing it again. Woods is back \u2014 as long as his back holds up. His return to competitive golf after an absence of nearly 16 months \u2014 which included two surgeries to his troublesome back \u2014 was a success on nearly all counts as the positives far outweighed the negatives. This despite the final-round 76 and the final-hole double bogey as he finished 15th in the elite 17-man field, 14 shots behind Hideki Matsuyama, who won at 18 under and was two clear of Henrik Stenson. It was Matsuyama\u2019s fourth victory in five starts and he was a staggering 90 under during that stretch. Woods played 72 holes without issue and unleashed some max effort swings when he wanted to. The club twirls were back. His swing was \u201cawesome,\u201d as more than one player said, as they emphasized the speed and power and effortless action Woods presented. His haunting chipping woes are gone. He made 24 birdies \u2013 against six double bogeys and eight bogeys \u2013 and shot 73-65-70-76 to finish at 4 under. Tracking Tiger: Follow hole-by-hole look at Woods' Saturday round \u201cGetting back to this point is beyond anything that I've ever experienced in my lifetime,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThe pain issues that I had, it was rough. \u2026 Quite frankly there were some pretty dire times where I just couldn't move. \u201cSo big picture? It feels good. It feels good to be back out here playing again, competing and trying to beat the best players in the world. I missed it.\u201d While he gave every indication that good stuff is at hand, Woods knows there\u2019s plenty of work to do. He likely won\u2019t play again for at least seven weeks, perhaps making his 2017 debut in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines the last week of January. \"I felt like I did some really positive things, I really did,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI'm pleased about that and I just need to clean it up. I made a lot of silly mistakes. \u2026 I'm going to take two weeks off here, get my weight back up, get everything organized, then start the process of testing, training and getting a feel of what is best for me. It was nice to have my speed back, hit some balls out there with some aggression again and not have to worry about anything.\u201d Caddie Joey LaCava was excited to see his player get through the week. \u201cHe\u2019s upright No. 1. You laugh but that\u2019s good,\u201d LaCava said. \u201cI love the fact he was hitting a lot of shots that he was picturing in his mind, like right-to-left wind and hitting a little hold-up cut shot with mid-irons, and hitting the little low, semi-stinger with the longer irons. And when he were downwind, getting the ball up in the air and bombing it. \u201cThere were plenty of good shots, plenty of good things to take away from here. I wasn\u2019t going to compare him to the rest of the field \u2026 they\u2019ve been playing all year and they\u2019ve been playing great. Honestly my goal was to get him through five rounds (counting the pro-am) on his feet. That was big.\u201d And going forward? \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d LaCava said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen, but he looks good walking, looks good over the ball and looks good after he\u2019s done playing, and those are all positives.\u201d Woods\u2019 colleagues agreed. \u201cOnly Tiger,\u201d Matsuyama said through a translator, \u201ccould take a year and a half off and put up the numbers that he's putting up this week.\u201d \u201cHis swing looks great,\u201d Brandt Snedeker said. \u201cIt looks like he slowed the rhythm down a little bit. I\u2019ve been really impressed.\u201d Jordan Spieth said it once again was good to hear the roars Woods produced, great to see him swinging the club like he did this week. \u201cI just hope he\u2019s given time,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cHis swing looks awesome. It looks like he\u2019s going aggressively into the ball. If I was off that amount of time, I would be very tentative into the ball.\u201d When asked how much time should be given Woods, Spieth didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cA year,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be good for him (in 2017) to play two tournaments back-to-back weeks and see how he feels. Each week after a week off you make kind of a mental error you wouldn\u2019t have made if you were going back to back. I play my best golf when I play back-to-back weeks or three in a row, four sometimes. Just feeling like you get into a groove.\u00a0\u2026 \"Yes, a full year. How much time has he had off? Give him that much time on. The world we live in as fans, as spectators, it\u2019s a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world so I don\u2019t think it will happen. But he\u2019s been very patient with himself in his comeback.\u201d PHOTOS: TIGER WOODS' RETURN TO COMPETITION ",

    "text": "Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Joe Fox / @latimesgraphics Facilities continue to open in California. 2016: (up 4.7%) Automation makes companies more productive and richer, which is why machines now do the bulk of carmaking, Uber is developing self-driving cars and farmers now use robots to plant, harvest and pack crops. That math does not bode well for most humans, especially those who work with their hands. Warehouses have been a bright spot for lower-skilled Californians. But hiring leveled off in 2016, even though new warehouses kept coming online. There\u00a0were 2,800 more people working in warehouses\u00a0in October compared with 12 months earlier, a 3% increase. That compares with an increase of 12,200, or 14%, in the year that ended in October 2015, and 9,800, or 13%, in the 12 months that ended in October 2014. Meanwhile,\u00a081 new warehouse and storage locations have cropped up in California over the last year, an increase of 4.7%. Manual laborers were in short supply on a recent Monday at the giant Skechers distribution center on a vast\u00a0 stretch of land in Riverside. Two men stood in the middle of a shipping container filled with boxes of shoes, throwing the boxes onto a conveyor belt that stretched into the container. These cobalt conveyors are the main event at this warehouse. There are more than 11 miles of them in total, snaking through stacks of boxes, layered on top of each other like a roller coaster for shoes. Boxes first pass over a scale, beneath the belt, which weighs them, and then travel through camera scanners that record their dimensions.They then get scanned again so that a pop-up wheel can eventually shove each carton of, say, women\u2019s size 9 black sneakers, into the same chute. A person then loads those boxes onto a pallet, which later is transferred to storage. Shoes sit in chutes ready for shipping inside the automated Skechers warehouse. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) This entire process used to take 10 workers and several hours to complete. Now, it requires three people and takes less than an hour. \u201cYou have to become more efficient. It\u2019s the only way to upgrade. You can\u2019t always be looking for cheap labor,\u201d said David Weinberg, chief financial officer of Manhattan Beach-based Skechers. \u201cThere is some manual labor [at the facility], but there are certainly more skilled jobs, managing power equipment, handling traffic and on computers,\u201d he said. \u201c You have to become more efficient. It\u2019s the only way to upgrade. \u201d \u2014 David Weinberg, Sketchers\u2019 chief financial officer Share this quote Weinberg says Skechers has never been more productive. Far fewer employees\u00a0handle twice as many pairs of shoes as they once did, and salaries have gone up on average \u2014 mainly because there are fewer people earning the minimum wage, Weinberg says. Lourdes Gonzalez is a good example of how work, and compensation, have changed for the remaining warehouse employees. Gonzalez, 46, started in 1992 as a packer in an old Skechers facility in Compton, where she earned minimum wage\u00a0and walked through 50-plus aisles of shoes to fill orders written on pieces of paper. \u201cNow, everything we do is through the system,\u201d Gonzalez says, seated in front of several monitors packed into a small room above the floor of the warehouse. She spends her entire day overseeing the flow of orders through the building. One minute she is staring at a live map\u00a0showing traffic flow and any jams on the conveyor belts, and the next she is studying a spreadsheet that shows how far along workers are in processing orders on deck. Gonzalez earns more than $20 an hour for this work, and covers her three children on her company-provided health insurance. \u201cI love my job,\u201d Gonzalez said, sounding like she means it. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating.\u201d Of course, there are still hordes of Californians who spend days on the housewares floor,\u00a0putting in sweaty hours moving boxes around, unpacking them, and putting the stuff that was in them into new boxes. A worker tapes a box while packing items on Cyber Monday at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in San Bernardino, Calif. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Warehouse workers in California earn about $42,100 on average \u2013 about $20,000 less than the average pay in the state overall, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That includes pay for higher-level managers. Many of them get their paycheck from Amazon, a company that still depends on masses of manual laborers even though it owns the most advanced robots in the industry.\u00a0 In 2012, the company bought Kiva Systems, the maker of a 320-pound robot that automatically transports shelving units to workers when they need to retrieve items for an order. The robot scans a grid on the floor that contains hundreds of bar codes, which tell it where it is in relation to other bots, and where the product it needs to pick up is located. Two years ago, Amazon had 15,000 of the Kiva bots in its U.S. facilities. Today, it has more than 45,000, according to a company spokeswoman. ADVERTISEMENT Amazon has also put hulking robot arms in its facilities, which\u00a0lift up 3,000-pound pallets, loaded with goods, 24 feet onto a robotic driving unit, which eventually brings the product to associates to either store or send out. The influx of bots has started to affect hiring. Amazon has begun making room for more highly trained and well-paid technicians to ensure that the machines are charged up and connected to the network that controls them, and to fix any mechanical bugs. \u201cWe are able to create more technician-type roles in the [robotic] fulfillment centers that pay differently than an hourly associate,\u201d says Ashley Robinson, a spokeswoman for Amazon. \u201cThere is a level of technology and algorithms that people in those facilities would be working with.\u201d Somewhat paradoxically, though, Amazon\u2019s obsession with speedier delivery maintains its appetite for people who can do rote work. So, for now, Amazon is still hugely reliant on people such as Carlos Madrid, whose hand-eye coordination is indispensable. In a San Bernardino fulfillment center on Cyber Monday, Madrid, 27, furiously stuffed a Tommy Hilfiger watch, then breast pump accessories, then cleaning supplies into boxes, sealing them with baby blue tape and sending them to their new owners. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane; it\u2019s like Santa\u2019s workshop,\u201d said the Fontana resident, looking on as hundreds of co-workers swarmed the place. They picked ordered goods off shelves that were stacked like a haphazard library, hauling yellow bins from an inventory area to a conveyor belt, and tossing old boxes onto another conveyor belt that carries away trash. Watch how conveyor belts and machines process shoes at Sketchers Madrid, who never finished college, said he had a daily goal of how many boxes to process during his 10-hour shift. He gets help from a computer and a set of scanners that tell him how big of a box to use, a small machine that produces exactly as much tape as he needs, and equipment that automatically shoots the shipping label onto each box. For the moment, that is about the extent of machine involvement at this facility, which employs 2,500 people and was Amazon\u2019s first California warehouse when it opened in 2012. ",

    "text": "46 Claims Filed in 2 Months to Priest Abuse Victims Program By jennifer peltz, associated press NEW YORK \u0097 Dec 4, 2016, 1:57 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Oct. 6, 2016 file photo, Kenneth Feinberg, second from left, speaks while Camille Biros, left, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, second from right, and former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly listen during a news conference in New York announcing a new program intended to provide reconciliation and compensation for victims of sexual abuse by clergy. The new compensation process set up by the Archdiocese of New York itself, potentially the most extensive effort of its kind to date, lets people take claims, often too old for court, to a noted outside mediator while keeping painful details private. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) 0 Shares Email It took 30 years for a former student to be ready to report he'd been sexually abused by a respected Roman Catholic priest on high school trips. But it didn't take long to realize the priest wouldn't be held accountable in court. Though the church said investigators found the allegations credible, the accuser couldn't sue or press criminal charges, mainly because of the passage of time. Instead, he's looking to a new compensation process set up by the Archdiocese of New York, potentially the most extensive effort of its kind to date. Some 46 people have filed claims in under two months, and the total could at least triple. The program lets people take claims, often too old for court, to a noted outside mediator while keeping painful details private. Yet victims' advocates are wary, noting that the archdiocese hasn't given any estimate of the payouts or the total it will spend. Some activists see the program as a church tactic to shield information about the handling of problem priests and counter pressure to let decades-old child sexual abuse cases go to court. Still, the Philadelphia-area man with sharp, searing memories of those New York City school trips wants to see what the program offers. He declines to suggest a number, but money will never be enough. \"Ultimately, he's not going to have to be judged, and he's not going to spend any time in prison over this,\" said the man, a 50-year-old in law enforcement. The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they agree to be identified. U.S. Catholic leaders have been grappling with a clergy sexual abuse crisis that exploded in 2002, ignited by reporting by The Boston Globe. Nationwide, the church has paid nearly $4 billion in settlements since 1950, more than 6,500 clergy members have been accused of abuse and hundreds have been removed from church work. The Manhattan-based New York archdiocese \u2014 the nation's second-biggest after Los Angeles \u2014 stands to have the largest compensation program of its kind so far, said J. Michael Reck, a lawyer for some potential claimants. A similar Diocese of Albany program has paid out $2.4 million on 75 claims since 2004. The New York archdiocese already had fielded about 170 as-yet-unsettled allegations before announcing the program Oct. 6. All the claims filed so far cite abuse in the 1980s or earlier by priests who are now dead or out of clergy work, said Camille Biros, one of the program's administrators. She and Kenneth Feinberg , a lawyer known for overseeing the federal 9/11 victims' compensation fund, will decide whether claims are credible and how much to offer victims. Cardinal Timothy Dolan has portrayed the process as a \"tangible sign of the church's desire for healing and reconciliation\" inspired by Pope Francis ' designation of a Holy Year of Mercy. It also was a year of increasingly loud calls for New York state legislation \u2014 opposed by the church \u2014 that would temporarily let child sexual abuse victims bring decades-old claims to court. Some victims' advocates see the archdiocese compensation program as a calculating response. \"It's a way to get out in front and posture to the parishioners and the public that 'We care,' and to the lawmakers say, 'We're fixing it,'\" while avoiding the level of disclosure and payouts that lawsuits could force, says David Clohessy, the executive director of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. In California, Delaware and some other states that extended or temporarily suspended time limits for lawsuits, settlements cost dioceses tens of millions of dollars and led some to seek bankruptcy protection. In New York, archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling calls the program \"the best, most direct and most appropriate way\" for victims to get compensation. But victims' lawyer Mitchell Garabedian says it's tough to assess without knowing more, especially the scope of the payments. He has represented over 2,000 clergy sex abuse victims nationwide, including some pursuing the New York program and others who wish they could. The program doesn't cover abuse by members of religious orders, saying the orders are responsible for their monks and nuns. That rankles Cecilia Springer, who says the Sisters of St. Ursula were unresponsive to her account of abuse by a nun at a Manhattan high school in the mid-1940s. The archdiocese program's limits are \"another slap in the face,\" said Springer, 85, who agreed to be named. \"Everybody should be included, and either (Dolan) takes care of it all or makes the religious orders do it.\" The nun died in 2006, before Springer, a former nun herself, broached the allegations. The order and the school, now independent, didn't return multiple calls about Springer's allegations. The man who said he was molested on school trips did see a response: The priest, Monsignor John O'Keefe, was suspended from clergy work last year while the Vatican reviews the matter. O'Keefe has denied the allegations. \"I want to know what happens, at this point, to him,\" his accuser says. \"If I had it my way, part of the agreement would be that he would sit down and just say 'sorry' to me.\" 0 Shares ",

By REUTERS on Publish Date December 4, 2016. Photo by Leonhard Foeger/Reuters. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed VIENNA \u2014 Austria \u2019s voters rejected a far-right candidate for president on Sunday, the climax of a bitter yearlong campaign that was widely watched across Europe as a measure of how high fringe parties could climb in mainstream politics. The election, normally a sleepy, provincial contest for a largely ceremonial post, had Europeans on edge for its potential to send yet another jolt to political establishments in a year when far-right populist forces have advanced on both sides of the Atlantic. It was widely viewed as a test of the anti-migrant and anti-Muslim forces that have ridden a populist path to power in Hungary and Poland and have gained strength in France and even in Germany and the United States since the election of Donald J. Trump. But after early projections showed him clearly lagging, Norbert Hofer, a 45-year-old leader of the Freedom Party who was seeking to become the first far-right politician elected as a head of state in postwar Europe, conceded his defeat on his Facebook page. Photo Austrian far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) presidential candidate Norbert Hofer attends a TV debate in Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria, during the election evening on December 4, 2016. Credit Vladimir Simicek/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images \u201cDear friends,\u201d Mr. Hofer wrote, \u201cyou supported me so well and I am infinitely sad that it did not work out. I would gladly have taken care of our Austria.\u201d He congratulated his rival, a 72-year-old former leader of the Green Party, Alexander Van der Bellen, and asked \u201call Austrians to stick together and to work together.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story With 86 percent of the vote counted, Austrian state radio gave Mr. Bellen a lead of 6.6 percent. Mr. Van der Bellen\u2019s supporters were predictably jubilant. \u201cHe built a broad coalition,\u201d said Alexandra F\u00f6derl-Schmid, editor in chief of the liberal daily Der Standard. Now, she said, Austrians will expect Mr. Van der Bellen to mend the rifts that appeared during months of bitter campaigning. The election Sunday was a rerun of a vote this spring, when Mr. Hofer made the biggest advances of any populist in Europe, racking up almost 50 percent of the vote when he lost a presidential runoff in May by just 31,000 votes.

    "text": "advertisement Donald Trump wasn't the only one venting his frustrations on Twitter early Sunday morning. The president-elect once-again attacked the latest episode of Saturday Night Live , calling the comedy show \"unwatchable,\" despite appearing to set aside time each week to critique the show himself. Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 But one woman was not having any of it. Danielle Muscato \u2014 who describes herself as an atheist, civil rights activist, musician and trans woman \u2014 immediately launched into Trump via tweet replies, attacking the president-elect for tweeting about frivolities instead of focusing on the lives of the Americans he now represents. \"You are the president-elect,\" she tweeted. \"Pick your f---ing battles man. You are embarrassing yourself.\" Muscato's first tweet was liked more than 30,000 times \u2014 but she was nowhere close to finished. Over the course of two hours, Muscato unleashed a fiery tirade against Trump, with some 30 separate tweets in all. The rant immediately went viral. @realDonaldTrump Do you know how many trans people were murdered since Election Day? Do you know how many veterans killed themselves? \u2014 Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016 @realDonaldTrump You are not fooling anyone. You're scared, and overwhelmed, and you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. And it shows \u2014 Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016 @realDonaldTrump You think we're all too polite, too aghast, to call you out. I see through you, Donny. I'm calling you out. You're a joke. \u2014 Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016 Muscato has built a career on speaking out, but her rant late Saturday seemed to have earned her a wider audience \u2014 50,000 new followers, to be exact \u2014 to whom she tweeted \"Thank you all for your support. Let's use the platform for GOOD.\" Related: Donald Trump Threatens U.S. Companies in Latest Twitter Diatribe In all, her tweets were liked more than 200,000 times, but not everyone was amused by her venting at the president-to-be. \"This is how you get on a terrorist watch-list,\" one user posted. \"Just stop the crap and just grow the hell up,\" said another. Ultimately, Muscato called for decent Americans to take a stand against the racism, homophobia and bigotry that has flared since Trump's election. @realDonaldTrump but we know we will win. We will fight you every step, so be ready. You can't stop progress, no matter how hard you try. \u2014 Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016 Chelsea Bailey ",

In his ruling early Monday morning, Judge Mark Goldsmith rejected an effort by state officials to delay the hand-counting of about 4.8 million ballots. Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein argued that a law is unconstitutional that requires a break of at least two business days after the Board of Canvassers' final action on a recount request. Goldsmith found that Stein had \"shown the likelihood of irreparable harm\" if the count was delayed even by two days and rejected the state's arguments about the cost to taxpayers. Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes, or two-tenths of a percentage point, in Michigan. Stein received about 1 percent of the vote. Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, the Trump campaign and super PACs have filed separate lawsuits asking state courts to prevent the recount, arguing that Stein, as the fourth-place finisher, is not \"aggrieved\" because she has no chance of winning in a recount. The Green Party also wants recounts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the votes in all three states suggest that there could have been tampering with the vote, perhaps through a well-coordinated, highly complex cyberattack. Elections officials in the three states, all narrowly won by Trump, have expressed confidence in their results. Even if all three recounts happen, none were expected to give Clinton enough votes to emerge as the winner. 0 Shares ",

Now 24 bodies recovered in Oakland warehouse fire; 80% of building still to be searched At least nine people died when a fire raced through an Oakland warehouse crowded with people attending a Friday night concert, officials said. Paige St. John , Peter H. King and Soumya Karlamangla Contact Reporters The death toll from the fire that raced through an Oakland warehouse during a music concert rose to 24\u00a0as searchers continued to sift through the ruin of one of the deadliest fires in modern California history. The search for victims could take another two days, leaving friends and family members frantic to learn the fate of their loved ones. \u00a0About 80% of the building remains to be searched, officials say.\u00a0 At a morning news\u00a0conference, Alameda County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said the death toll rose from nine last night to 24; he emphasized that the number will probably rise as the search continues. Searchers painstakingly sifted through the rubble of the building through the night. They described it as a horrific scene of destruction, with many concertgoers unable to flee when the fire broke out. Kelly said the vast majority of the victims found have not been identified. (Tracey Lien, Paige St. John, Peter H. King and Joe Mozingo) The rising death toll makes the blaze\u00a0one of the worst in recent California history. It could eclipse the 1991 Oakland Hills fire, which killed 25 people. The fire\u2019s cause is not known.  Arson is not suspected, but Kelly said nothing had been ruled out. The\u00a0warehouse isn\u2019t currently considered a crime scene.\u00a0 City records cited allegations of at least three code violations at the building this year. In one complaint, city inspectors said there was complaint of an illegal building on the property as well as piles of trash. \u201cThis property is a storage [facility], but the owner turned it into a trash recycling\u00a0center. The yard became a trash collection site, and the main building was [remodeled] for residential,\u201d according to city records. City building and safety officials said Saturday afternoon that there was an open investigation into the warehouse and that inspectors had found evidence of blight. The building was permitted for use as a warehouse, not for housing. They said that a party or concert at the property would have required a permit, which had not been granted. They also said there was no evidence that the building had fire sprinklers or alarms. Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo, who represents the district where the fire broke out, said neighbors have regularly complained about the building \u2014\u00a0particularly the fact that it had piles of trash and debris outside. \u201cWe would complain to the manager that they had all that nonsense outside of his building, blocking sidewalks, blocking streets. And \u2026 \u00a0he always had an attitude,\u201d he said. Gallo said he did not know whether people were living inside the warehouse. Asked whether\u00a0the building had residential permits, he said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cThe reality is, there are many facilities being occupied without permits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re occurring on Oakland\u2019s streets, especially in neighborhoods like mine.\u201d The property is one of several owned by Chor N. Ng, according to her daughter, Eva Ng, 36.\u00a0She said\u00a0the warehouse was leased as studio space for an art collective and not used as a dwelling. \u201cNobody lived there,\u201d\u00a0she told The Times, adding,\u00a0\u201cIt was an art collective.\u201d She said she had asked her leaseholders about the issue and had been reassured that nobody lived in the building. \u201cThey confirmed multiple times. They said sometimes some people worked through the night, but that is all,\u201d\u00a0she said. It was a tinderbox. \u2014 Brooke Rollo The second floor had two exits, both wooden stairs, she said, adding that she believes the building also had smoke detectors.\u00a0She was not familiar with comments by fire officials that the makeshift stairs consisted of packing crates. Ng added that her mother felt terrible about the tragedy. Kevin Longton, who lives at the Vulcan Lofts, less than a mile from the site, \u00a0said the warehouse was well-known for holding rave-style dance parties. He went to one about a year ago, never saw any sprinklers and felt the place was an accident waiting to happen. Inside, he said, were two floors with a huge open space on the first floor with lots of nooks and crannies. People had cordoned off loft-style sections on the first floor and decorated them with fabric and curtains. More than two dozen old pianos were strewn about the floor.\u00a0 \u201cThere were people living there,\u201d Longton said. \u201cI\u2019m sure of that.\" People who previously lived there recalled\u00a0a building that lacked fire sprinklers and had a staircase partly made of wooden pallets. Partygoers recalled a rabbit warren of rooms crammed with belongings \u2014\u00a0pianos, organs, antique furniture, doors\u00a0and half-finished sculptures. \u201cIt was a tinderbox,\u201d said Brooke Rollo, 30, who lives less than a mile from the scene and had gone to parties there. Photos on the warehouse\u2019s Tumblr page show a maze of rooms, with walls and dividers made from\u00a0pianos, boxes, salvaged doors and other materials. Wooden rafters were adorned with\u00a0hanging lanterns, holiday lights, bicycles, stereo equipment and exposed wiring. Ben Brandrett, a\u00a0mental health researcher living in San Francisco, attended a performance at the warehouse and noticed that a staircase\u00a0didn\u2019t have a banister.\u00a0\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This seems sketchy.\u2019\u201d Firefighters who responded to Friday\u2019s\u00a0three-alarm blaze described the interior as a labyrinth. Officials said organizers of the warehouse concert\u00a0never obtained a permit for the event, so\u00a0 city workers did not inspect exits, fire extinguishers and other vital safety features. The concert\u00a0Friday night was the\u00a0 Golden Donna 100% Silk 2016 West Coast Tour , according to a concert Facebook page. Organizers of the concert\u00a0posted a statement describing the fire as an \u201cunbelievable tragedy, a nightmare scenario. ...\u00a0We are a very tight community of artists and we are all praying, sending love and condolences to everyone involved and their families.\u201d Read the story Witnesses said the warehouse, known locally as the Oakland Ghost Ship,\u00a0was a collective where artists lived and worked. Through the early-morning hours, people used the Facebook page to seek information about friends and loved ones who attended the concert. Some frantically listed the names of missing people and posted their photos, hoping to learn their fates. Al Garcia, who owns a store next to the warehouse, said he talked to two people\u00a0who said they were 17 and 18 years old who got out of the building. \u201cThey said that black, billowing smoke was coming down the stairs,\u201d said Garcia, 62. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see anything in front of them, anything behind them. The only reason they got out was they heard voices outside. The voices directed them to where they were going.\u201d The teens said they paid $10 to get into the warehouse party, which they found online, Garcia said. Seung Lee arrived to the warehouse about 11 p.m. to catch the concert with two friends. They walked through the building\u2019s maze-like first floor before heading upstairs where as many as 30 concertgoers were listening to live music, Lee said. One suggested they get some alcohol, so they headed to a nearby liquor store at about 11:15 p.m. Less than 10 minutes later, they returned to find thick, black smoke pouring out of the first floor windows of the warehouse and flames shooting out of the back of the building, he said. \u201cI froze in disbelief,\u201d said Lee, who immediately called 911. \u201cThe hardest thing I\u2019m having trouble processing are the people on the second floor. I saw them dancing and having a fun time, and 10 minutes later they are trapped in this inferno.\u201d Lee, a freelance journalist, said the only way up to the second floor was by climbing a wooden staircase. He said he didn\u2019t notice any other exits on the second floor. There were about 60 to 70 people in the warehouse, Lee said. Anyone with information about the missing \u00a0is urged to call the coroner\u2019s office at (510) 382-3000.

Mui December 4 at 10:22 AM Follow @ylanmui President-elect Donald Trump speaks at Carrier on Dec. 1 in Indianapolis. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press) President-elect Donald Trump fired another warning shot Sunday at U.S. companies considering moving their operations out of the country, threatening \u201cretributions or consequences\u201d such as a hefty border tax if they do. The pronouncements came in a string of early morning tweets. Trump said he intends to incentivize businesses to stay in America by lowering corporate taxes and slashing regulations, two key components of his economic agenda. But he also warned that companies with offshore factories would face a 35 percent tariff on goods sold back to the United States. The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. ...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ...... [ Trump says direct negotiation with Carrier was 'very presidential' ] Trump\u2019s comments follow his direct intervention in an Indiana factory owned by Carrier, which makes heating and air-conditioning units, where production was scheduled to shift to Mexico. Trump announced last week that he had negotiated a deal to keep the plant in the state. Indiana promised to provide Carrier about $7 million in incentives, while the company would invest $16 million in the factory over the next two years. Speaking at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Dec. 1, President-elect Donald Trump said he decided to call the company so it would not ship jobs abroad after watching a television news report about the factory. (The Washington Post) About 800 jobs that had been slated to move to Mexico will remain at the plant, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. About 300 to 600 Carrier positions \u2014 including 700 at one of the company\u2019s other factories in the state \u2014 will still be cut. [ Why Trump gets more hype out of 1,000 jobs than Obama did out of 16 million ] Trump's messages Sunday morning drew skepticism from some Republicans such as Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), who have generally favored a hands-off approach to the economy. Pres-Elect Trump means well. But won't his 35% tariff idea raise prices on American families? How would it not be a new 35% tax on families? \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) December 4, 2016 Still, Trump advisers said\u00a0he would be deeply involved in day-to-day corporate decisions like perhaps no other Republican before. . @mike_pence : Donald Trump will make decision to intervene with companies talking of moving jobs overseas \"on a day-by-day basis.\" #thisweek pic.twitter.com/sbxqI00VO9 \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) December 4, 2016 On the stump, Trump espoused an aggressively protectionist stance toward international trade, and his skepticism of the benefits of globalization resonated with many middle-class voters who bore the brunt of its downside. But since his election, his advisers have softened some of his most heated rhetoric. Trump\u2019s picks for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said that they would pursue bilateral trade agreements with other countries but remained wary of sweeping regional deals. Ross also said that blanket double-digit tariffs on goods from Mexico and China \u2014\u00a0which many economists warned could spark a damaging trade war \u2014 would only be used as a last resort. But Trump\u2019s comments Sunday indicate that he is not backing away from one key pledge: to punish companies that offshore jobs. \u201cWe're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world,\u201d Trump said last week. Trump celebrated the Carrier deal with a tour of the factory last week, followed by a rally in Cincinnati to kick off his \u201cthank you\u201d tour. On Capitol Hill, some conservatives criticized the deal as a government distortion of the free market, while liberal lawmakers called the tax breaks a corporate subsidy. But business groups generally welcomed the move. \u201cNow, hundreds of Indiana workers will now keep good jobs, preserving their place in the middle class,\u201d Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement Friday. \u201cWhile inducements and high-level interventions aren\u2019t the most efficient ways to keep jobs here, they\u2019re sometimes absolutely necessary.\u201d business ",

He loves the attention,\" Nash told NBC News. When Nash spotted a casting call for Carter's clothing for children, she submitted her son's head shots to a modeling agency in Atlanta. \"The agency actually emailed me back and [the agent] said that she had gotten his information, but she wasn't submitting him because the criteria didn't specify they were looking for a baby with special needs,\" Nash said. It never occurred to her that Asher's Down syndrome would prevent him from being considered. Meagan Nash feeds her 16-month-old son, Asher, at their home in Buford, Georgia. NBC News \"When I realized that this happens in the world with advertisement, I was hurt, because here is my little boy \u2014 I look at him, and nothing's wrong with him,\" she said. Unsure what to do, Nash posted about her experience on her Facebook profile with several snapshots of Asher. Before long, the post had gone viral. Advocates for people with disabilities say the enormous reaction shows that society's idea of beauty is evolving and that companies need to evolve with it. About 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is a genetic disorder in which children can have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which can cause mental and physical disabilities. \"When you see a kid like Asher Nash as the face of OshKosh, you're speaking to 1 in 5 American families out there that actually have a disability in their family,\" said Katie Driscoll, founder and president of Changing the Face of Beauty, a nonprofit advocacy group. \"It's about communicating to this large community \u2014 1.3 billion people globally have a disability,\" Driscoll said. Recently, more companies have employed models with disabilities, including Fisher-Price, Target and McDonald's. Play ",

Temperatures in the Dakotas this week will drop below zero. (Photo: David Goldman, AP) Here it comes, ready or not. After a warm November, the coldest weather of the season is forecast to roar across nearly the entire United States this week, bringing freezing temperatures as far south as Florida. This won't be normal December cold, either, as temperatures will be about 10 to 20 degrees colder than\u00a0typical is typical for this month. Also, once the chill\u00a0arrives, it will stick around well into next weekend and perhaps longer. Several rounds of light to moderate snow will accompany the cold in parts\u00a0of the northern tier of the U.S. this week, though a big blizzard is not expected. Snow fell in the upper Midwest on Sunday, which included Chicago's first accumulation of the season. The cold air will first move into the Northwest, northern Rockies and northern Plains on Monday and Tuesday.

As is typical, some of the coldest temperatures will be in the Dakotas. Minot, N.D., should see a high temperature of 4 degrees on Wednesday, and a low of 3 below zero early Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Howling winds will add to the misery. Dangerous wind chill values will develop, dropping as low as 30 below zero Tuesday night in the northern Plains, the weather service predicts. Another foot of snow forecast ... in Hawaii Afternoon high temperatures in cities such as Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago,\u00a0Kansas City and St. Louis will only be in the 20s\u00a0by mid-week, AccuWeather said. By the end of the week, the colder conditions will also reach the East Coast and Southeast, where high temperatures will only be in the 30s and 40s by Friday and Saturday.

Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Aquita Brown said police detained a 28-year-old man from Salisbury, North Carolina. The deputy mayor for public safety and justice said on Twitter the suspect has been identified as Edgar Maddison Welch. . @DCPoliceDept press release on arrest of Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, of Salisbury, NC for assault w/dangerous weapon at Comet restaurant. pic.twitter.com/IkSJUeHM2y \u2014 Deputy Mayor Donahue (@SafeDC) December 5, 2016 Police responded and arrested Welch without incident. They recovered an \u201cassault rifle,\u201d Brown said. Welch was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon. Two firearms were recovered inside the restaurant and an additional weapon was recovered from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, police said in a statement on Sunday evening.\u00a0 The suspect entered the location and pointed a firearm in the direction of an employee of the restaurant, the MPD said in a statement. The victim was able to flee and notify police. The suspect fired an undetermined number of shots inside of the restaurant, according to the MPD.\u00a0 During a post arrest interview, the suspect also revealed that he came to the establishment to self-investigate \u201cPizza Gate,\u201d the MPD said in a statement.\u00a0 As CBS affiliate WUSA reported previously , using the hashtag #PizzaGate, an imaginary story about the popular pizza shop was spread across social media and websites associated with the \u201calt-right\u201d movement, \u00a0accusing its proprietors of allowing Bill and Hillary Clinton and her former campaign manager to run a child sex slave ring from the business. As a result, the pizza place has been hammered by thousands of threats and bizarre, unsubstantiated tales about child sex trafficking online for weeks.\u00a0 WUSA reported that they found two women, who declined to give their names, banging on the patio at the pizza place in late November. The women were looking for the alleged tunnels used to traffic children.\u00a0 \u201cAll of this is an underground tunnel that helps take the kids and transport them back and forth so they can can do these rituals,\u201d said one of them. \u201cThey are putting a lot of curses and spells over the city. They are kidnapping the children who are missing. They were never missing because D.C. know where they are.\u201d Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis said then that the restaurant does not even have a basement. He said he suspected the story simply emerged because he and a friend supported the Clinton campaign. \u201cThese people are destroying their lives,\u201d said neighbor Maura Dougherty about the conspiracy theorists. \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201d Before the latest incident, Comet Ping Pong\u2019s owner told WUSA that the PizzaGate conspirators have also harassed and abused his staff. The manager got so many threats and vulgar messages, his wife asked him to quit his job. And the online bullies have gone after other businesses on the block as well. ",

    "text": "33 Bodies Recovered in Oakland Warehouse Fire; Search Continues By Michael Edison Hayden Dec 4, 2016, 6:54 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Authorities Search for Victims, Cause of Oakland Warehouse Fire 0 Shares Email Searchers have recovered 33 bodies -- some of them teens 17 years old or possibly younger -- from a fire-ravaged warehouse in Oakland, California, that housed artist studios and was hosting a dance party when the deadly blaze broke out, officials said today. Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office warned that he anticipates that \"the number of victims will rise\" from a fire officials say may be the deadliest ever in Oakland. The search effort is expected to last for days, he said. Kelly called the number of deaths \"astronomical.\" Among the victims was the son of an Alameda County sheriff's deputy, officials said. Authorities are also asking families with missing loved ones to preserve DNA samples as a way of confirming the identities of those who died in the horrific blaze. The District Attorney's Office has criminal investigation teams actively looking at the fire with the other law enforcement agencies involved in investigating the fire, according to a statement from the City of Oakland. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf told ABC News that she has ordered an investigation into the building's troubled history, including a complete review of all records of complaints. Libby also told ABC that she ordered an independent analysis into the city\u2019s handling of this building and others like it. The Oakland Fire Department responded to reports of a structure fire at the warehouse known as the \"Ghost Ship\" on 31st Avenue at around 11:32 p.m. on Friday night. Oakland Fire Chief Teresa Deloach Reed said Ghost Ship appeared to function as a residential building that hosted a makeshift artists' studio, as well as parties like the one that took place on Friday night. It's unclear if the building was equipped with smoke alarms, the fire chief added. Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Firefighters work on the scene following an overnight fire that claimed the lives of at least nine people at a warehouse in the Fruitvale neighborhood, Dec. 3, 2016 in Oakland, California. Fire Department Battalion Chief Melinda Drayton told ABC News that firefighters have been impacted emotionally by bodies found. She described the precarious scene firefighters have encountered inside of what is left of the warehouse, where the second floor is hanging just above the heads of search crews, with pianos, appliances and other materials dangling from above. Preliminary indications suggest the blaze was not caused by arson, but rather an electrical fire. The power went out inside the building when the fire began and the flames blocked the building's only exit, making it difficult for people inside to escape, an official briefed on the ongoing investigation told ABC News. According to The Associated Press, Oakland officials said they had opened an investigation into the warehouse last month, after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building, which was zoned as a warehouse. Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department, told the AP the city opened an investigation Nov. 13 and an investigator went to the premises on Nov. 17 but could not get inside. ABC Bay Area affiliate KGO-TV reported that Derick Ion, founded the Ghost Ship Artist Collective and ran it at the warehouse. ABC News reached out to Ion but did not immediately receive a response. Ion appeared to address the fire in a Facebook post early on Saturday morning by saying that \"everything I worked for is gone.\" \"Confirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound... it's as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope.... to be standing now in poverty of self worth,\" he wrote. Oakland's warehouses have become hubs for artists and musicians in recent years. The Oakland-based weekly newspaper Eastbay Express has attributed gentrification and rising rents in the Bay Area as putting the Northern California region's counter-cultural arts scene in a crisis of space and money. The Oakland Fire Department confirmed to the press that they are currently working with a variety of agencies in the aftermath of the tragedy, including the Alameda County Sheriff's Department, the Oakland Police Department, the Alameda County Search and Rescue, and the American Red Cross , among others. Kelly asked the public to be patient as authorities look into the cause of the blaze, and continue to search for the missing and the dead. \"We will be here for days and days to come,\" Kelly said.

    "text": "Hawaii braces for another foot of snow Published               December 04, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print This webcam image shows the CFHT telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island covered in snow on Dec. 1, 2016. \u00a0(Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope via AP) Hawaii is bracing Sunday for another foot of snow, in addition to the 2 feet that landed on the island\u2019s highest mountain peaks since Thursday, The Weather Channel reported. The snow is falling on the peaks of the Big Island of Hawaii, including Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, and the National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for the area through late Sunday night. \"The snow level almost never gets below 9,000 feet in Hawaii during the winter, but since these mountains are taller than 13,600 feet, 13,700 feet and 10,000 feet, respectively, they get dusted with snow a few times a year,\" said Ken Rubin of the University of Hawaii. \"It rarely stays on the ground for more than a few days though.\" The storm warning stated that an extra 6 to 12 inches of the white stuff may land above 11,000 feet, and winds could reach 15 to 30 mph. The snow, which has been falling since late last week on the Big Island\u2019s volcanic summits, forced officials to close a section of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Fog, heavy snow and icy conditions also forced the closing of the road up to the Mauna Kea visitor station. A flood watch has been issued through Sunday afternoon for the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaii snow brings out the adventurous, but skiing is not for the faint of heart. The Hawaii Ski Club advises potential skiers and snowboarders to be careful because \u201cthere are no lifts, no grooming, no resort, but a road goes to the summit to serve the dozen or so world-class observatories located at the summit. You must have a 4-wheel drive vehicle to get to the summit, which serves as your 'lift.'\" Skiers can take turns driving, picking up other skiers at the bottom of the runs and transporting them back up to the summit. There has been 30 to 36 inches in recent winters, according to Ryan Lyman, forecast meteorologist with the Mauna Kea Weather Center. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "AP December 4, 2016, 7:05 PM Italian premier announces resignation after defeat of reforms referendum Italian Premier Matteo Renzi casts his ballot at a polling station in Pontassieve, Italy, Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016. Antonio Calanni, AP Email Last Updated Dec 4, 2016 7:40 PM EST ROME -- - Italian Premier Matteo Renzi announced he will resign Monday after suffering a stinging loss in a reforms referendum, triggering immediate calls from a populist party and other opposition forces for elections to be held soon.\u00a0 \u201cThe \u2018No\u2019s\u2019 have won in an extraordinary clear-cut way,\u201d Renzi told reporters in Rome about an hour after polls had closed in Sunday\u2019s balloting. \u201cI lost and the post that gets eliminated is mine,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cThe government\u2019s experience is over, and in the afternoon I\u2019ll go to the Quirinal Hill to hand in my resignation\u201d to President Sergio Mattarella. Leaders of the populist 5-Star Movement, which is led by comic Beppe Grillo, joined the chorus for early elections. The 5-Stars are the chief rivals of Renzi\u2019s Democrats and are anxious to achieve national power for the first time. With ballots counted from nearly half of the polling stations, the \u201cNo\u201d votes were running at nearly 60 percent to 40 percent for the \u201cYes\u201d votes on reforms Renzi claimed were vital to modernize Italy. Mattarella as head of state would have to decide whether to accept any resignation. Renzi is expected to be asked to stay on at least until a budget bill can be passed later this month and to shepherd a months-long electoral reform process. Opposition leader Matteo Salvini, of the anti-immigrant Northern League, hailed the referendum as a \u201cvictory of the people against the strong powers of three-quarters of the world.\u201d Many had read the referendum as an outlet for growing anti-establishment, populist sentiment in Europe. The self-assured Renzi late last year pledged to offer his resignation if the referendum on overhauling a good part of the 1948 Constitution went down to defeat. That was months before Britain\u2019s David Cameron had made his ill-fated bet on the referendum on whether the U.K. should stay in the European Union. He lost that bet. In Italy, the referendum was required because the reforms were approved by less than two-thirds of Parliament. But Renzi raised the stakes, turning the referendum into a virtual plebiscite on himself, when he pledged to quit if Italians turned their back on reforms to streamline the Senate and give the central government more powers at the cost of the regions. Some opposition leaders started clamoring for early elections after Renzi\u2019s reform measure went down to defeat. \u201cWe are ready to vote as soon as possible,\u201d Salvini told reporters. Renzi had been hoping to survive the rising populist forces that have gained traction across Europe. Some of Renzi\u2019s political opponents were hoping to tap into the populist sentiment that has been gaining ground with the U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union and the U.S. presidential victory last month by billionaire political outsider Donald Trump. A \u201cYes\u201d vote would have strengthened Renzi\u2019s 2 \u00bd-year-old government, giving it impetus to complete its five-year term and time to prepare for elections in 2018, while a \u201cNo\u201d vote favored early elections sometime next year. During the referendum campaign, the risk of political instability in Italy, Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy, triggered market reaction, with bank stocks sinking and borrowing costs on sovereign debt rising. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

Last month, Oakland investigated the warehouse after complaints from neighbors. (Dec. 3) AP Genevieve Griseau cries as she attends a memorial for victims of a warehouse fire at Chapel of the Chimes Saturday, Dec. 3, 2016, in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP) OAKLAND\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The death toll rose to 30 Sunday and could still climb after\u00a0a\u00a0massive weekend fire roared through this city's \"Ghost Ship,\"\u00a0a\u00a0warehouse-turned-artist\u00a0collective and popular party space. Alameda County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ray Kelly said\u00a0only 20% of the building had been searched since Friday night's blaze, so a final death toll could be days away. \"The number will go up,\" Kelly said Sunday. \"Firefighters are tired, exhausted. This is very emotional.\" The fire broke out during an electronic music party\u00a0at the warehouse, part of\u00a0which had been converted to makeshift\u00a0art studios and living areas. The party apparently took place in a large\u00a0open space on the second floor accessible by a single wooden staircase. Melinda Drayton, Oakland Fire Department battalion chief, said firefighters breached a wall overnight and were attempting to systematically and safely remove debris \"bucket by bucket\"\u00a0from the battered building. She said firefighters had not yet reached the location where the fire began, and investigators were far from determining the cause of the blaze. Oakland's 'Ghost Ship' warehouse had known safety concerns \"This will be a long and arduous process,\" she said. \"We want to make sure we are respecting the victims and their families and ensuring our firefighters' safety.\" The building sits in\u00a0Fruitvale, a\u00a0neighborhood\u00a0with a large Latino population a few miles southeast of downtown. Yellow police tape a block from the building kept the public away. The charred remains of the top of the building were visible, and work crews could be seen dragging out debris. Chris Nechodom, 30, a photographer and filmmaker from Richmond, Calif., was visiting a friend on the first floor of the warehouse when the fire started. He told USA TODAY he thought at first\u00a0it might be coming from a fog machine at the party above.\u00a0But soon he was shouting so people fleeing the fire could follow his voice toward the exit. Finally, he had inhaled so much smoke he had to go outside. \"I'm just praying and thanking the higher power that I made it out,\" he said. Several therapy dogs and their handlers were in the area Sunday to comfort families and first responders.\u00a0Constance Barich, 61, visited with Rosie, a 2-year-old\u00a0English Labrador.\u00a0Barich, an artist in the neighborhood for 30 years, said she\u00a0has lived in some of the warehouses. \"There are hundreds and hundreds of artists in this neighborhood,\" she told USA TODAY. \"If it looks like someone is living there, they are.\" Posted!
