    "text": "Why it may not matter if  President Trump keeps his promises Rick Hampson , USA TODAY 6:37 p.m. EST November 17, 2016 x Share Trump made a lot of big promises on the campaign trail, as President-elect many of those  declarations are starting to look less and less possible. USA TODAY, Collin Brennan President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally in New York. CEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the November 2016 U.S. election. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) President-elect Donald Trump is backing off of some of his more dramatic campaign promises, but \u2013 and don\u2019t breathe a word of this to George H.W. Bush \u2013 neither his supporters nor his opponents seem very upset. Studies show that most presidential candidates have honored most of their campaign promises. Once elected, however, everyone compromises, backtracks or fudges to some extent. Critics: Donald Trump's tough lobbying rule could slow hiring Trump will be no exception, judging from his comments during the past week. He\u2019s said he wouldn\u2019t necessarily build a wall along every inch of the Mexican border; would focus deportation efforts not on all illegal immigrants, but on those with criminal records; and try to retain some redeeming facets of Obamacare. For a variety reasons \u2013 including his supporters\u2019 love of him, his opponents\u2019 hatred of his proposals and a general acknowledgement that Trump is best taken seriously but not literally \u2013 this president may prove more immune than most to the political cost of broken promises. x Share Only 3 in 10 Americans surveyed said he has a mandate to fulfill his campaign promises. Video provided by Newsy Newslook John McGlennon teaches government at the College of William & Mary: \u201cBoth sides are willing to give him more flexibility than a conventional candidate would be allowed.\u2019\u2019 More, certainly, than the 41st president. Bush failed to win re-election in 1992 after campaigning in 1988 on a promise \u2014 \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes!\u2019\u2019 \u2013 he later felt compelled to break. Possibly because few major candidates have run for president with such drastic proposals, many Trump opponents are relieved that he apparently won\u2019t try to do everything he said he\u2019d do. And many Trump supporters say they never really expected him to do everything he said he\u2019d do. First, some Trump opponents. \u201cI prayed that he would have a change of heart, that he\u2019d realize that some things he said he\u2019d do he cannot do,\u2019\u2019 such as vaporize the Affordable Care Act, says Angelina Iles, a retired school employee who lives in Pineville, La., and voted for Hillary Clinton. With that prayer seemingly answered, she has another: \u201cThat he\u2019s backing off because he\u2019s learned that the bullying attitude he had in the campaign won\u2019t work once he\u2019s in office.\u2019\u2019 After Trump passed 270 electoral votes on Election Night, David Bugh of Lancaster, Ohio, a pastor and small business owner, says he was afraid. But given signs of what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201cmoderation,\u2019\u2019 says \u201cI\u2019m a little less pessimistic now.\u2019\u2019 Even a diehard Never-Trumper like Democrat Rich Langan of Ashwaubenon, Wis., a retired police officer, says he\u2019s trying to keep an open mind: \u201cI\u2019ll give him six months.\u2019\u2019 As for the Trump supporters. Despite some fiery campaign rhetoric, \u201conce he\u2019s in office he\u2019ll soften up on pretty much everything,\u2019\u2019 says Barry Fixler, who last year opened his own local Trump headquarters in Bardonia, N.Y. And that\u2019s fine with Fixler, a jeweler. \u201cIn his heart, Trump loves people. He won\u2019t do anything to drastically affect people,\u2019\u2019 such as non-criminal illegal immigrants. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to throw out children (of illegal immigrants). He\u2019s just going after the criminals and ISIS.\u2019\u2019 Many Trump voters say their man\u2019s opponents were spooked by his campaign promises because they didn\u2019t understand how he works. Gene Dunn is a longtime Trump admirer who took his son out of school to attend Trump\u2019s presidential campaign announcement at Trump Tower. Trump\u2019s campaign promises were \u201cstandard\u00a0The Art of the Deal practice,\u2019\u2019 he says, referring to Trump\u2019s 1987 best seller. \u201cAsking for the whole\u00a0enchilada, but settling for what\u2019s reasonable. And all sides can claim victory.\u2019\u2019 A. D. Amar, an Indian immigrant and business professor who lives in Warren, N.J., agrees that many of Trump\u2019s campaign promises were really opening gambits: \u201cThat is Trump\u2019s style as a negotiator. He throws the extreme negative outcome at his opponents. This\u00a0brings them to the table, and then whatever they get after the negotiation is better than what Trump originally threw at them.\u2019\u2019 Here\u2019s how President-elect Trump has been rewriting candidate Trump: Some elements of the Affordable Care Act, which he\u2019d promised to repeal and replace, are worth keeping. He cited provisions requiring coverage of pre-existing medical conditions and allowing children to remain on parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26. \"I like those very much,\" Trump told The Wall Street Journal. Some illegal immigrants are \u201cterrific people,\u201d and his priorities are 1) securing the border and 2) deporting criminals. The number of all illegal immigrants is around 11 million; criminals in that group number anywhere between 800,000 and several million. \u00a0 Some sections of the \u201cbig beautiful wall\u2019\u2019 he\u2019s vowed to build along the border might actually look more like fencing. If and when Americans try to pin candidate Trump\u2019s promises to President Trump, they will have their work cut out for them, says John Baick, who teaches American political history at Western New England University in Springfield, Mass. One problem is sheer volume \u2013 the \u201cmany, many promises made on the campaign trail,\u2019\u2019 says Baick. \u201cThere is almost certainly no candidate who has produced more verbiage, in person and in digital form, than Donald Trump.\u2019\u2019 Another is the lack of specifics. Trump, Baick says, \u201ccan claim that he has kept many simply by taking symbolic steps.\u2019\u2019 For instance, it may be enough if Trump starts to build the wall, just as John F. Kennedy gets credit for starting a man-on-the-moon program that was not scheduled for completion until after what would have been his second term. Posted!

    "text": "(Tribune news services) The two began mending fences after Trump's victory when Romney called with congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss Trump's schedule publicly. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they were still \"working on\" the meeting. Trump's actions Thursday aimed to show that he could soften his rhetoric, offer pragmatism in the White House and reaffirm longstanding American alliances. Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton last week, Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone. Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also visited the Trump Tower and called the billionaire businessman \"a true friend of Israel.\" He specifically cited as another \"friend\" Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Bannon's news website has peddled conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism. \"We look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,\" Dermer said.

Coordination had been on hold until Trump's team submitted documents including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday, meaning agencies could start providing briefings and written materials to Trump's team. Conway said she expected announcements of Cabinet choices to come \"before or right after Thanksgiving,\" telling reporters Trump was \"loving\" the transition. \"He's a transactional guy. He's somebody who's used to delivering results and producing.\" Associated Press ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Democrats need someone \u201clike me, who has constituents and friends who are steelworkers or work in construction,\u201d Mr. Ryan told The Youngstown Vindicator. \u201cThe economy and blue-collar jobs are important for us as a party. We need leaders who can go into these Great Lakes districts.\u201d The struggle to stitch together a winning coalition will play out in the competing policy ideas that Democrats are offering. In a speech this week to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Executive Council, Ms. Warren, who sparred in viciously personal terms with Mr. Trump during the campaign, noted the many ways she agreed with the president-elect. \u201cHe spoke of the need to reform our trade deals so they aren\u2019t raw deals for the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he will not cut Social Security benefits. He talked about the need to address the rising cost of college and about helping working parents struggling with the high cost of child care. He spoke of the urgency of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and putting people back to work. He spoke to the very real sense of millions of Americans that their government and their economy has abandoned them. And he promised to rebuild our economy for working people.\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, long a critic of trade deals, said in an interview that he had spoken extensively with Mr. Trump\u2019s trade adviser and would work with him on issues concerning steel workers. \u201cWe can work with him on things we agree on,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cOn Bannon, no.\u201d Mr. Brown sent a letter to Mr. Trump urging him to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, make changes to the trade relationship with China and fight currency manipulation, which is also a pet issue of Mr. Schumer. Mr. Sanders put out a statement after the election saying he too would work with Mr. Trump on areas of populist agreement. At the same time, they remain his adversary on other matters. For example, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, now the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe committee will pay very close attention to proposed nominees to ensure the fundamental constitutional rights of Americans are protected.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans will not like many of these proposals, but they have been fulsome in their praise of Mr. Trump since his election. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for instance, has repeatedly said that he expects Mr. Trump to work with Republicans on their agenda of rolling back the Affordable Care Act and making large-scale changes to the tax code and entitlements. While Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are one matter, his nominations to his cabinet and other senior positions are another, and there, Senate Republicans who will vote on their confirmations are in a quandary. Just as they were asked to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s more incendiary statements during the campaign, they are now being asked to weigh in on contentious names being floated for high positions. Republican senators like John McCain of Arizona also have been implicitly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s cozy views toward Russia. On one area, though, Democrats and Republicans agree: Most of them strongly oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for congressional term limits. Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting.

Oct. 19, 2016. \u00a0(CBS Chicago)\u00a0 Jurors in Los Angeles cleared Derrick Rose and two friends in a $21.5 million lawsuit accusing them of gang raping his ex-girlfriend. Oct. 19, 2016. \u00a0(CBS Chicago)\u00a0 Tribune news services Contact Reporter The ex-girlfriend who lost her lawsuit accusing NBA star Derrick Rose and two friends of rape has appealed. The appeal filed Thursday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says pertinent evidence was excluded and jury instructions were tainted. Jurors cleared the Knicks player and his friends last month in Los Angeles federal court after the men testified that the woman willingly had sex with them. The woman was seeking $21.5 million in the suit that claimed the men gang raped her while she was incapacitated from booze or drugs and unable to consent to sex. Jurors said they found the woman's account hard to believe and didn't think there was enough evidence to support her claims. Rose is seeking $70,000 in expenses from the woman. Associated Press ",

WXIA Nick Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown in August 2012 in Hollywood. (Photo: Frazer Harrison) ATLANTA \u2014 After months of ignoring a civil lawsuit filed against him by Bobbi Kristina Brown's family, her ex-boyfriend Nick Gordon was ordered Thursday by a Fulton County judge to pay the family $36 million for her wrongful death. In September, Gordon was deemed \u201clegally responsible\u201d for Bobbi Kristina's\u00a0death after he failed to appear in court. Bobbi Kristina, the daughter of the late Whitney Houston and singer Bobby Brown, died in July 2015, six months after she was found unresponsive face down in a bath tub at her suburban Atlanta townhouse in January 2015. She was 22. Her death was eerily similar to the way her mother died three years earlier, and drew worldwide headlines and frenzied attention of the tabloids. She is buried at a cemetery in New Jersey next to her mother. Bobbi Kristina never regained consciousness to explain what had happened to her. Gordon, who also lived in the townhouse, was among the people listed on the police report as being in the home when investigators arrived there. Lawsuit start of big trouble for Nick Gordon Her family, both the Houston relatives and later the Brown relatives,\u00a0and the court-appointed conservator for her estate\u00a0filed a civil suit accusing\u00a0Gordon of playing a role in her death by giving her a \"toxic cocktail.\" The lawsuit accused him of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and transferring money from Brown\u2019s account into his own without authorization as causes. Bobby Brown holds up a picture of his daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, while testifying in wrongful death case against Nick Gordon, in Atlanta, Nov. 17, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: David Goldman, AP) Fulton County Superior Court Judge T. Jackson Bedford ruled that because Gordon failed to appear twice to answer the suit,\u00a0anything alleged by the plaintiffs was admitted through omission.\u00a0The lawsuit sought $50 million in damages. Following the series of testimonials from Bobby Brown, and friends of Bobbi Kristina Thursday , Bedford assessed the damages and losses related to the January incident\u00a0to determine the value of Bobbi Kristina\u2019s life. \u201cTo determine the value of a life is pretty difficult. So the court has been back there primarily struggling with that particular issue,\u201d Bedford said. The judge awarded more than $36 million, broken down as: $1.575 million for money taken from the account, including alleged stolen rings $250,000 in punitive damages\u00a0 $1.37 million for assault and battery $13.8 million for pain and suffering as a result of assault $4.2 million in punitive damages $15 million for present value of life David Ware, who represented the Brown estate along with Glenda Hatchett, issued a statement saying there was an \"urgent need\u00a0to get justice for Bobbi Kristina Brown.\" \"We intend to pursue, with all vigor, the full collection of the judgment,\" Ware said in the statement. \"The defendant will not escape justice nor ever profit from his misdeeds. We hope that in some small way this will allow Krissy\u2019s family to continue their quest for peace.\u201d \u201cDomestic violence is a horrible reality in our society and Bobbi suffered such horrific pain and degradation at the hands of Nick Gordon, the man she loved and trusted,\" Hatchett added. \"No one should suffer the way she did and the judge sent a strong message in the award of punitive damages that this despicable behavior is inexcusable and will not be tolerated.\u201d LaPrincia Brown, the half-sister of Bobbi Kristina Brown, wipes a tear while testifying in a wrongful death case against Nick Gordon, in Atlanta, Nov. 17, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: David Goldman, AP) Bobby Brown and his oldest daughter, La'Princia Brown, Bobbi Kristina's\u00a0half-sister, were among the emotional witnesses who testified at Thursday's hearing. \u201cI just miss her,\u201d said La'Princia, recalling\u00a0one of the final moments she saw her sister in hospice care. \u00a0\u201cI played music to her a lot. I could see her eyes looking around the room. She would cough. She would yawn. It didn\u2019t seem right that she couldn\u2019t communicate. She\u2019d blink and more tears could come. I feel like she could see me but couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Gordon wasn't in court Thursday and did not have an attorney in the civil case, but his criminal defense attorneys, Joe Habachy and Jose Baez, had said in August 2015 that the allegations were baseless. They also said that Gordon is \"heartbroken\" and called the suit a \"fictitious assault.\" Bobbi Kristina Brown autopsy unsealed, months after her death Autopsy results released in March 2016\u00a0 indicated\u00a0multiple drugs were involved in Brown's death by drowning, including marijuana, alcohol (ethanol),\u00a0benzoylecgonine\u00a0(a cocaine-related substance), benzodiazepines (medications used for sedation or to treat anxiety) and morphine.\u00a0But the medical examiner couldn't determine if she killed herself, if someone else killed her or if her death was accidental. Earlier this year, Gordon talked about the death on\u00a0 Dr. Phil\u00a0show . After that interview aired, Bobby Brown joined the wrongful death lawsuit against Gordon. Nick Gordon falls apart on 'Dr. Phil' Although the police and district attorney's office have been investigating Bobbi Kristina's death since January 2015, no one, including Gordon, has been charged with a crime. Dontaye Carter, a spokesman for Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, said in an email Thursday that Brown's death is still under investigation. Gordon has been living in Florida close to his mother and almost certainly does not have $36 million. Contributing: The Associated Press ",

Donald Trump may be planning to create a registry for Muslim immigrants, and according to one Trump supporter, there's already a precedent for such a thing. Rong-Gong Lin II Contact Reporter A prominent supporter of President-elect Donald Trump cited the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II as a legal justification for creating a national registration list \u201cfor immigrants from Muslim countries.\u201d Speaking to anchor Megyn Kelly on Fox News on Wednesday night, Carl Higbie, author of \u201cEnemies, Foreign and Domestic: A SEAL\u2019s Story,\u201d defended the idea of creating a registry for such immigrants. During the segment on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d the anchor referred to a Reuters story \u00a0that quoted Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hardliner who has helped write some of the nation\u2019s strictest immigration laws and is\u00a0one of Trump\u2019s policy advisors. He said\u00a0that Trump\u2019s advisors were discussing drafting a proposal to register immigrants from Muslim countries. \u201cIt is legal. They say it\u2019ll hold constitutional muster. I know the ACLU is going to challenge it, but I think it\u2019ll pass,\u201d Higbie said. \u201c\u2026 We did it during World War II with Japanese, which, you know, call it what you will, maybe \u2014\u201d Kelly interjected: \u201cCome on. You\u2019re not \u2014 you\u2019re not proposing we go back to the days of internment camps, I hope.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m not proposing that at all, Megyn, but what I am saying is we need to protect America first,\u201d Higbie said, citing an anti-Semitic\u00a0slogan used by isolationists in the 1940s that Trump reappropriated. \u201cYou know better than to suggest that,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the kind of stuff that gets people scared, Carl.\u201d \u201cRight, but it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m just saying there is precedent for it, and I\u2019m not saying I agree with it, but in this case I absolutely believe that a regional-based \u2014\u201d Higbie said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be citing Japanese internment camps as precedent for anything the president-elect is going to do,\u201d Kelly reiterated. Answered Higbie: \u201cLook, the president needs to protect America first, and if that means having people that are not protected under our Constitution have some sort of registry so we can understand, until we can identify the true threat and where it\u2019s coming from, I support it.\u201d In one of the darkest chapters in U.S. history, more than 120,000 Japanese Americans from West Coast states were ordered to evacuate their homes and businesses between 1942 and 1945 and were relocated to internment camps in remote, desolate areas, surrounded by barbed wire and guards in watchtowers. Interned Japanese Americans lost their livelihoods and property. Supreme Court decisions upheld the use of racial criteria in the curfew order and the constitutionality of the military detention process. An order in 1944 ruled that the War Relocation Authority could not detain U.S. citizens shown to be loyal, effectively ending incarceration. In 1988, President Reagan signed legislation that issued a formal government apology and reparations for the internment. \"We admit a wrong,\" Reagan said. \"Here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\" Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) called \u201cabhorrent\u201d any proposal to force Muslims to register with the federal government\u00a0and using Japanese American imprisonment as precedent.\u00a0 \u201cThese ideas are based on tactics of fear, division and hate that we must condemn,\u201d Chu said in a statement. \u201cLike Japanese incarceration, imposing a registry upon American Muslims goes against our constitutional values and our very principles as a nation.\u201d Trump\u2019s immigration advisors have reportedly begun drafting orders he can issue on his first day in office to increase the number of deportation officers.\u00a0Asked last week whether he would work with lawmakers to ban Muslim immigrants, Trump walked away without answering. Kobach, who helped draft the Arizona statute\u00a0that once required police officers to check immigration status during routine traffic stops, also worked in the Department of Justice under President George W. Bush. He\u00a0helped design an immigration program after the 9/11 attacks that came under fire for a requirement that new visitors to the U.S. from countries where terrorism was a concern be interviewed, photographed and fingerprinted.\u00a0 The program roiled the Iranian exile community in Los Angeles in 2002, after hundreds of men and teenagers were arrested on immigration violations when they reported to authorities. Many of the exiles are foes of Iran\u2019s Islamic theocracy. The Department of Homeland Security ended the program in 2011.

    "text": "Hundreds of O'Hare Airport Workers Vote to Strike By The Associated Press CHICAGO \u0097 Nov 17, 2016, 4:32 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 29, 2015, file photo, travelers line up at a security checkpoint area in Terminal 3 at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Hundreds of O'Hare International Airport workers that are trying to unionize have voted to go on strike ahead of the 2016 Thanksgiving holiday. Officials with the Service Employees International Union Local 1 said Thursday Nov. 17, 2016, that about 500 workers have committed to strike. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File) 0 Shares Email Hundreds of O'Hare International Airport workers have voted to go on strike ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Service Employees International Union Local 1 officials said Thursday that about 500 workers have committed to strike. Union spokeswoman Izabela Miltko-Ivkovich said the strike \"will definitely take place in the coming days,\" though she didn't specify which day it will start. The workers involved have been trying to organize with the union's help. They work mainly for private contractors at the airport. \"They don't expect to shut the airport down,\" SEIU Local 1 President Tom Balanoff said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times ( http://bit.ly/2g0mq1X ). \"That's not what they're trying to do. Oh, there will be disruption.\" Balanoff said a walk out could slow but not shut down airport operations. He said what workers are trying to do \"is get the powers that be to hear their voice.\" The workers who plan to strike include baggage handlers, cabin cleaners, janitors and wheelchair attendants. They are seeking a $15 per hour wage. It wasn't immediately clear how such a strike would affect operations at O'Hare, which is one of the nation's busiest airports. The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that it doesn't anticipate any disruption in service. Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst and former airline executive, said much depends on what types of jobs are affected, whether airlines or the private contractors can assign other employees to fill in and on how many workers will be willing to cross a picket line. Workers have taken similar actions at other airports, including LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports in New York, creating disruptions that \"ranged from noticeable to marginal,\" he said. Joseph Schwieterman, a transportation expert and economics professor at DePaul University in Chicago, noted the city has a few days to try to come up with a \"plan B.\" \"This will be a mass headache, but a crisis it is not,\" he said. O'Hare has about 190 gates and is a hub airport for both American and United airlines, which hold the majority of those gates. Auto club AAA predicts it will be an especially busy Thanksgiving weekend of traveling. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Reena Flores CBS News November 17, 2016, 2:12 PM Would it be legal for Trump to hire Jared Kushner for a White House job? Email As President-elect Donald Trump considers staffing his administration, the consideration of one person in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle is already presenting some potential legal obstacles: Jared Kushner , husband to Ivanka Trump and the president-elect\u2019s son-in-law. The 35-year-old Kushner -- who, like his father-in-law, is a New York real estate developer -- has taken on an outsize role in Mr. Trump\u2019s tight-knit circle of advisers, first during the campaign and now on the president-elect\u2019s White House transition team. And Kushner\u2019s role could expand. There has already been some implication that he could be privy to the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) -- in order to receive it, Kushner would need a \u201ctop secret/SCI\u201d clearance, a former top CIA official told CBS News. Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked by reporters Wednesday whether it would be appropriate for Kushner to get a security clearance. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate for whoever\u2019s going to get the presidential daily briefing to have a security clearance,\u201d said Conway. \u201cIt\u2019s not just appropriate, necessary.\u201d But an appointment for Kushner in the Trump White House could run afoul of federal anti-nepotism laws. A 1967 statute explicitly forbids the president from appointing relations -- the law was written to include a son-in-law -- to any executive agency. Donald Trump's son-in-law is a real estate mogul and owner of the New York Observer newspaper. He was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, and ha... Here\u2019s what the statute says: \u201cA public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\u201d This would seem to bar Kushner from taking a role within the White House -- though, as CBS News legal reporter Paula Reid points out, there are some exceptions. The law allows for waivers in the event of a national disaster or other unforeseen circumstances. But it\u2019s hard to argue that transitioning to the presidency could be considered an unforeseen circumstance. In any case, such a waiver would only allow for a temporary appointment. Lawyers for Mr. Trump could try to argue that the part of the law which prohibits relatives from getting paid means an unpaid role would be legal.\u00a0 \u201cAn individual appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in violation of this section is not entitled to pay, and money may not be paid from the Treasury as pay to an individual so appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced,\u201d the statute reads. Kushner himself has floated the possibility of advising the White House without pay, according to the Wall Street Journal. It is not clear whether the statute would apply to the White House, which, it could be argued, might not be technically considered a government agency. The original statute was written as a response to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother, Bobby Kennedy, to head the Justice Department as attorney general. And despite the existence of the law, there\u2019s no clear penalty or repercussion if an individual -- much less the president -- violates the statute. For now, top Trump officials are saying little about whether or not Kushner will have a defined role in the White House. \u201cHe obviously is incredibly important to his father-in-law President-Elect Trump and was [a] big part of our election victory, frankly,\u201d Conway told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m sure that he and his wife and her brothers will continue to be very supportive. But time will tell in terms of the positions that different people fill.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Paula Reid contributed to this report. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist November 17 at 4:09 PM Follow @sulliview Well, it\u2019s official \u2014 the new word of 2016, according to Oxford Dictionaries, is \u201cpost-truth.\u201d In this post-truth universe, where established facts often don\u2019t matter as much as appeals to emotion and partisan ideology, we also hear another word a lot: \u201cnormalize.\u201d The question behind the word is this: In covering President-elect Trump and his presidency, should the traditional news media treat this like any other transition, and like any other run-of-the-mill administration? People magazine embraced normalizing when it quickly put a glamorous, backlighted shot of Donald Trump on its cover last week. There was no reference on the cover to the fact that a People reporter had been one of the women who came forward in recent weeks to allege that Trump had sexually assaulted her years ago. On the other side are those such as media consultant Ken Doctor, who wrote : \u201cGiven the vast lying, misogyny, racism and anti-Semitism that have been hallmarks of this campaign, the press\u2019 response must be one of memory and of mission.\u201d Given journalistic failures during the campaign \u2014 smugness and willful blindness, among others \u2014 how should the traditional press go forward now? I\u2019ll offer three suggestions: 1. Emphasize the watchdog role. More than ever, journalists must hold politicians \u2014 of all stripes \u2014 accountable. \u201cDo your job,\u201d urges Tom Rosenstiel, author and executive director of American Press Institute. \u201cThat means catch the bad guys, watch the cookie jar, ferret out chicanery.\u201d The public may be fed up with the media\u2019s endless analyzing, opining and punditry, but people do appreciate the investigating that the best reporters can do. And we can be sure that the Breitbarts of the world \u2014 the fringe-right media company that is closely tied to the Trump administration \u2014 won\u2019t do it. This is an equal-opportunity, nonpartisan mission. (Just a reminder: It was the New York Times that broke the Hillary Clinton private-email story and dug into it. It was The Washington Post that dived deep into the \u201cBill Clinton Inc.\u201d story about the former president benefiting financially from Clinton Foundation ties.) \u201cThe average person cannot \u2018follow the money,\u2019 \u201d Rosenstiel noted. That\u2019s why journalists must do so better than ever. 2. Represent the interests of all citizens. Chris Arnade, an independent photographer who spent the campaign in pro-Trump country , developed deep empathy for his subjects but fears they will not be well served. \u201cI feel bad for the people \u2014 broadly, the poor, frustrated whites \u2014 who voted for him because he\u2019s not going to deliver what they think he\u2019s going to deliver,\u201d he told the Columbia Journalism Review. Part of the new journalistic imperative is recognizing that those Trump voters who felt angry, humiliated or invisible may be among those who need our advocacy most. Toward that end, journalists should stop licking their wounds and do something with the lessons they\u2019ve learned. \u201cLet\u2019s put our boots back on and understand that this is a job that has a mission attached to it,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Brien, the Trump biographer and executive editor of Bloomberg View. The collective lapse in judgment \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean everything we did was a failure.\u201d 3. Be scrupulously fair and relentlessly tough. If fairness is the idea, how do we go about it now? \u201cLegacy media can distinguish itself through factual authority,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. Just so. And that means accurately describing what\u2019s going on, and using the right words to do so. Should, for example, the label alt-right be applied over and over again to describe Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s new strategic adviser? That\u2019s the kind of normalizing that ought to be abandoned because it\u2019s close to meaningless, even misleading. (It\u2019s kind of like \u201calt-country,\u201d right? No, actually, it\u2019s an extremist movement associated with white supremacists.) At the same time, know that campaign rhetoric and presidential governing aren\u2019t the same thing. We don\u2019t know yet how Trump will govern, although we\u2019re beginning to get a sense of it, based on his troubling first week . One formulation I\u2019ve been hearing recently, from many quarters, is \u201cscrutinize, don\u2019t normalize.\u201d That\u2019s definitively the right direction in navigating this post-truth world. An open mind is a fine idea for journalists. Amnesia isn\u2019t. For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan lifestyle ",

A source close to Trump told NBC News that Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, is being considered for secretary of state. The two men feuded throughout Trump's 2016 run, with Romney actively calling on Republicans to reject the candidate he called \"a phony\" and \"a fraud.\" The frosty relationship seemed to thaw a bit last week after Trump tweeted that Romney called him to congratulate him on his victory. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who served as a top surrogate to Trump, confirmed to NBC News he will not be in the president-elect's cabinet. \"I want to focus on strategic planning for the emerging Republican majority from local government through the executive branch,\" Gingrich said. Also on Thursday, Trump's transition team on Thursday launched teams of staffers to begin the transition process in a handful of key national security agencies: The Department of Defense, Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Department of Justice. The \"landing teams\" will liaise with staffers designated by the President Barack Obama's administration to \"facilitate transition\" throughout the government as Republican National Committee Chief Strategist Sean Spicer explained on a conference call with reporters. More teams, handling economic and domestic departments, will be launched over the next few days. It's only one piece of what was a busy day for the president-elect as he continues to build out plans for his administration, with about two months to go until Inauguration. Trump adviser Jason Miller told reporters Trump had at least nine meetings planned with a handful of prominent figures in Republican politics and policy, many of whom have been floated as potential cabinet secretaries. Those include South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has emerged as a potential Secretary of State; Texas Representative Jeb Hensarling, who's been named a possible Treasury Secretary; FedEx Corp. CEO Fred Smith; Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz; former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; Florida Gov. Rick Scott; retired General Jack Keane; Navy Admiral Mike Rogers; and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell. Trump himself tweeted that his \"transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today.\" My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2016 Trump had a private meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Thursday. Abe in brief remarks to reporters said the atmosphere or the meeting was \"cordial\" and said \"I am convinced that Mr. Trump is a leader with whom I can have great confidence.\" He did not go into details about what they discussed, because Trump has not yet taken office.

    "text": "Nov 17 2016, 4:30 pm ET 78 People Die a Day From Opioid Overdose, Surgeon General Says in Landmark Report by Elizabeth Chuck and Erika Edwards Share Surgeon General: 20 Million Americans Struggling with Drug Addiction 2:43 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161118021124if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/811836995597\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Addiction is taking a stunning toll on America and must not be thought of as a \"character flaw,\" the U.S. surgeon general said in a landmark report published Thursday. Seventy-eight people die each day from opioid overdose, and another 20.8 million have a substance use disorder, but just 10 percent of those 20.8 million receive treatment, Dr. Vivek Murthy wrote in the report, \"Facing Addiction in America.\" \"Substance use disorders represent one of the most pressing public health crises of our time,\" the report says. \"For far too long, too many in our country have viewed addiction as a moral failing. This unfortunate stigma has created an added burden of shame that has made people with substance use disorders less likely to come forward and seek help.\" 90% of people with a substance use disorder are not getting treatment. That has to change. #FacingAddiction pic.twitter.com/mFYfx6dv3A \u2014 U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) November 17, 2016 It's the first publication from a surgeon general that has addressed drug and alcohol addiction, though other federal agencies have reported the same findings. The goal of the 400-plus-page report, Murthy said, is to change public attitude toward addiction the way the 1964 surgeon general's landmark report on the dangers of smoking did more than 50 years ago. \"That really helped to focus us as a culture and as a medical profession,\" Dr. Eric Strain, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and Research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told NBC News. \"This is a report that likewise hopefully will galvanize us to say, 'Hey, these are conditions that are medical problems, we have a database and approaches that can help. It's not hopeless and we can make a difference in the lives of people.'\" Surgeon General of the United States Dr. Vivek Murthy delivers remarks following the announcement of his appointment as Co-Chair of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, May 12, 2015. Will Kim The report was personal for Murthy: Before he became surgeon general two years ago, nurses he worked with as a doctor in Boston begged him to address the drug crisis in America. The problem has been exacerbated by the stigma that surrounds it, he said. \"I've seen the pain that it causes not only [addicts], but also their families,\" he told NBC News. \"Millions of our brothers and sisters have been forced to live in the shadows because they don't feel comfortable coming forward.\" \"I have people who come up to me all the time ... telling me that they are worried they'll be fired from their job, that they'll be ostracized,\" he added. The report comes as America wrestles with a growing heroin epidemic, which has been captured in heartbreaking photos of adults slumped over from overdoses in the presence of young children. Among the key findings of the report: Overdoses kill more people than car accidents do. Approximately 50,000 people died from an alcohol, opioid or other drug overdose in 2014, compared with 32,744 who died from car accidents that year. And the number of people currently struggling with a substance use disorder is more than the number of people suffering from any kind of cancer. The approach to treating addiction can't be different than treating any other chronic illness, Murthy writes in a preface to his report. \"We must help everyone see that addiction is not a character flaw \u2014 it is a chronic illness that we must approach with the same skill and compassion with which we approach heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.\" Prevention is just as important as treatment. It's up to entire communities \u2014 teachers and principals, parents, doctors \u2014 to keep children from falling through the cracks, Murthy told NBC News. According to his report, individuals who start drinking before age 15 are four times more likely to become addicted later on than those who start at age 20 or later. \"I'm calling the country to action,\" he said. \"We are going to need everybody to address addiction in America.\" Surprise interventions, like those on TV, don't work. Springing a staged confrontation on an addict \"may backfire by heightening resistance and diminishing self-esteem on the part of the targeted individual,\" the report says. Professional clinical programs or services can lead to remission or even full recovery, particularly when supplemented by social services and monitoring after the addict leaves treatment. \"There's reason to be hopeful. We have evidenced-based treatment plans that work,\" Murthy told NBC News. More than 25 million people who once had a problem with alcohol or drugs no longer do, according to a national survey cited in the report. The report also commends group recovery programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous, which can help individuals stay on track after a treatment program. Obamacare has helped. The Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare, which President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to repeal \u2014 has given 20 million people access to health insurance who wouldn't otherwise have it. Paired with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which makes addiction treatment an essential health benefit, treatment is now possible for millions. Murthy urged Americans and insurance providers to treat addicts \"with the same compassion and care that we give other illnesses.\" \"I want you to imagine only one in ten people with diabetes or cancer getting treatment,\" he told NBC News. \"We wouldn't tolerate it. It's absolutely imperative that we invest in treatment to get people the help they need.\" While the surgeon general's report was lauded by experts, some felt it didn't go far enough. William Maixner, a professor of anesthesiology at Duke University School of Medicine and director of Duke's Center for Translational Pain Medicine and Innovative Pain Therapies, told NBC News he had hoped the report would propose alternatives to opioids for pain management. \"There's very little language regarding the need for discovery of new treatments, discovery of new therapies for chronic pain \u2014 which is another epidemic,\" he said. \"One of the reasons we have this hidden epidemic in chronic pain is the fact that we don't have good therapies, and many physicians rely on the use of opioids.\" \"We find, unfortunately, that a large number of these individuals are treated by opioids by well-intended individuals who have very little option but opioids to go to,\" he added.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Shelley Duvall in May 1977 in Cannes. (Photo: Jean Jacques Levy, AP) LOS ANGELES \u00a0\u2014 Shelley Duvall, the actress who was so memorable in The Shining, has resurfaced after years on Dr. Phil, where she tells a TV audience that she is struggling with mental illness. \"I\u2019m very sick, I need help,\"\u00a0she says in an interview airing Friday. A clip of the interview shows her shockingly changed, even given the passage of decades since she was in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror classic\u00a0The Shining. Besides that film, Duvall, 67, is best known for her turns in Robert Altman's\u00a0Nashville\u00a0in 1975,\u00a0and for playing Olive Oyl\u00a0opposite Robin Williams' in Popeye, the 1980\u00a0film version of the comic strip. In the clip of Duvall's interview with Phil McGraw, her delusions and distorted perceptions are on display. She claims Williams, who died in 2014,\u00a0is alive and \"shapeshifting.\" She also talks about the alien \"implants\" in her leg and her fear of \"the Sheriff of Nottingham.\" The clip has drawn criticism from some on\u00a0social media, including Kubrick's daughter Vivian, who said on Twitter that Duvall's appearance on the show\u00a0is a form of \"lurid and exploitive entertainment\" and \"appallingly cruel.\" Kubrick called for a boycott of the show.

    "text": "Chicago cop who shot 2 mistakenly returned to street duties Robert Rialmo Chicago Police officer Robert Rialmo in 2013. Chicago Police officer Robert Rialmo in 2013. (Rachael Levy / Chicago Tribune) Dan Hinkel Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago police Officer Robert Rialmo was supposed to remain on desk duty this summer as the city investigated his fatal shooting of two people, one of them an innocent bystander. Rialmo had raised further questions about his fitness for duty by filing an unusual lawsuit against the city, alleging that he shot Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones late last year in part because he was poorly trained. He also alleged that the fatal shooting had caused him severe distress and permanent emotional trauma. Yet just after Rialmo's unorthodox lawsuit drew widespread attention, the Police Department put him back on the street in July, the Chicago Tribune has learned. He didn't just return to routine patrol duty but was detailed to a citywide unit that intervened in potentially dangerous incidents during the most violent summer Chicago has seen in years. Rialmo made or assisted in 10 arrests during his four months back on the street, said Anthony Guglielmi, the department's chief spokesman. Police officials blamed his redeployment on an administrative error at his Northwest Side police district. The mistake wasn't caught until late last month, Guglielmi said, and Rialmo was placed back on paid desk duty. The department plans to discipline a command officer at the district, Guglielmi said. The revelation comes during one of the rockiest times in the Police Department's history. The release a year ago of a video showing an officer shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times sparked public outrage and an ongoing probe by the U.S. Justice Department into whether the department systematically violated people's rights. Chicago police fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and Bettie Jones, 55,\u00a0as officers responded to a domestic disturbance at a West Garfield Park residence Dec. 26, 2015, authorities said. The department made the blunder even as top officials were trying to convince Chicagoans of their new commitment to rigorously investigate shootings before clearing officers to return to duty. Given his own admissions in court filings that he was inadequately trained, Rialmo's return to street duties exposed the city to potentially significant legal liabilities, experts said. While court records show no new lawsuits had been filed against Rialmo, his redeployment put people at risk, said attorneys for the families of LeGrier and Jones. \"Bottom line is, this guy shouldn't be on the force anymore, let alone on the streets dealing with high-stress situations, given that he claims he's suffering extreme emotional distress and has not been properly trained to do his job,\" said Basileios Foutris, a lawyer for LeGrier's family. Rialmo declined to comment Thursday, but his attorney, Joel Brodsky, said the department pulled Rialmo off the street to retaliate against him for hiring his own attorney, suing the city and \"not falling in line with the blue wall of silence that they're trying to put up.\" Tribune coverage: The Quintonio LeGrier, Bettie Jones shootings Read more stories The incident involving Rialmo the day after Christmas last year marked the first fatal police shooting after the release of the disturbing McDonald video. Rialmo said he shot LeGrier outside the family's West Side home after the 19-year-old swung an aluminum baseball bat at him. But bystander Jones, 55, standing behind LeGrier, was also mortally wounded. Under a policy enacted amid the outrage over McDonald's shooting, Rialmo was placed on desk duty for 30 days \u2014 now standard in all police shootings. Once 30 days passed, he was put on indefinite desk duty as the city continued to investigate the shooting, Guglielmi said. Rialmo remained sidelined until July, when he was detailed to the citywide summer mobile unit created by Superintendent Eddie Johnson to defuse violence at parks and beaches as well as gang conflicts on the South and West sides. Guglielmi blamed \"careless administrative oversight\" at the Jefferson Park police district. Officers for the unit were drawn from the city's 22 districts, Guglielmi said, and Rialmo, who was hired in 2012, was picked for the assignment because of his low seniority. Notifications of the move did not go up the chain of command, Guglielmi said. Guglielmi declined to name the command officer who could face discipline, but he said the incident was being taken \"very seriously.\" Department officials transferred Rialmo back to desk duty in late October after discovering he was on the street because of paperwork documenting an arrest he helped make, Guglielmi said. As a result, department officials have adopted a policy that the internal affairs bureau must sign off on personnel transfers in addition to the patrol division. A search of state and federal court records turned up no lawsuits against Rialmo while he was back on the street, but such litigation is often filed months after an incident. During his time off desk duty, Rialmo filed no use of force reports, and no citizen complaints were filed against him, department officials said. He was the primary officer in two arrests and assisted in eight more, Guglielmi said. Information on those arrests was not immediately available. Brodsky, Rialmo's lawyer, disputed the department's explanation, saying command officers beyond the district were aware of Rialmo's return to the street, though he declined to identify any officers who knew. Before Rialmo went back to full duty, he completed classroom work and was cleared by a psychologist, he said. Though scarred by the shooting, Brodsky said, Rialmo is not \"falling to pieces\" and belongs back on the street. Furthermore, his lack of training doesn't differentiate him from most officers in a department that has offered little training to officers after the academy, he said. \"He's got the same training every other officer on the street has,\" Brodsky said. \"It's not like he's inadequately trained and everybody else is (well-trained).\" Rialmo was thrilled to go back to the street and disappointed to be again relegated to a desk, Brodsky said. \"He doesn't like being on the desk. It's boring,\" he said. Brodsky noted that the department is trying to beef up the department in the face of rising violence by hiring hundreds of officers over the next two years. \"Here we have a fully trained officer who could be patrolling and protecting people \u2026 and they're putting him behind a desk for no reason other than he won't toe the line,\" he said. Lawyers for the LeGrier and Jones families also voiced skepticism that Rialmo's return to street duties was simply an administrative error at the district. The shooting drew wide attention, and the lawyers said they would have expected Rialmo's redeployment to gain broader notice within the department. Putting Rialmo back on the street while his shooting was still under investigation was an insult to the victims' families, said Larry Rogers Jr., a lawyer for Jones' family. The episode \"shows the level of dysfunction that's occurring in the department,\" he said. The revelation comes as Mayor Rahm Emanuel continues to work on an overhaul of policing spurred by the release nearly a year ago of the video of white Officer Jason Van Dyke fatally shooting McDonald, a black teen. Van Dyke is awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges. With the Justice Department investigation still underway, Emanuel has announced changes designed to get in front of reforms that federal authorities could seek to enforce. Two of City Hall 's focuses have been on changing use-of-force policies to limit controversial shootings and revamping a disciplinary system that has long been slow, disorganized and prone to clearing officers, even when evidence indicated wrongdoing. A recent Tribune investigation showed that one consequence of the city's halting approach to discipline is that some Chicago police on desk duty have been sidelined for years or even a decade as they wait on disciplinary proceedings. About 75 officers are now on desk duty, creating a financial and manpower burden for a department strapped for cash and looking to add more police. Rialmo responded about 4:30 a.m. Dec. 26 to LeGrier's father's home in the West Garfield Park neighborhood after calls about a fight between the teen and his father. According to the initial account Rialmo gave detectives, Jones, a neighbor, answered the door and pointed officers to the upstairs apartment. As Jones turned to walk back to her unit, LeGrier, a Northern Illinois University student who had behaved erratically for months, emerged from a doorway and waved a bat over his head, Rialmo reported. Rialmo said he backed down the front porch stairs and drew his gun while ordering LeGrier to drop the bat. He opened fire, shooting LeGrier six times and Jones once in the chest. When Rialmo was re-interviewed days after the shooting, he added further details. Though he'd first said LeGrier only raised the bat, he said in the later interview that the 19-year-old twice tried to hit him with it, records show. But lawyers for the survivors of LeGrier and Jones allege that Rialmo was far from LeGrier and in no immediate danger when he fired. Rialmo, now 27, filed the unusual countersuit in June against the victims' families, accusing LeGrier of forcing him to shoot the two dead by waving the bat at him. Rialmo also sued the city, claiming he shot the two in part because he was inadequately trained in handling people with mental health issues. Emanuel, indeed, has recently sought to give officers more training on defusing violent situations and handling the mentally ill. Experts say Rialmo's countersuit would put him and the city in a difficult position if he were sued again. But that doesn't appear to have happened thus far. \"It's no harm, no foul, but if you have a foul, then you've got a problem,\" said James Kearns, an Urbana attorney who teaches pretrial litigation at the University of Illinois College of Law. The policy of keeping officers off the street after shootings is new to Chicago, and Foutris, the LeGrier family lawyer, said Rialmo's redeployment shows that reality in the department still lags behind rhetoric and policy. \"They say something's gonna change ...\" he said. \"Then nothing changes.\" Chicago Tribune's Jeremy Gorner and Steve Schmadeke contributed.

Richard Spencer, the chairman of the National Policy Institute, a prominent alt-right organization. (Joshua Roberts / For The Times) Jaweed Kaleem Contact Reporter As he watched the news of the presidential election in the last week, Kory Duquette became increasingly agitated. Pundits were blaming a \u201cwhitelash\u201d for Donald Trump \u2019s win\u00a0and called it\u00a0a massive exercise of angry white ballot power. Civil rights groups said the president-elect\u2019s victory has\u00a0inspired dozens of attacks on blacks, Latinos and Muslims by people who shared Trump\u2019s suspicions about immigrants.\u00a0Commentators\u00a0said that in his quest for a win, Trump pandered to America\u2019s darkest racist impulses. Duquette, a 37-year-old Trump supporter from Alabama, was ready to fight back. \u201c#Whiteshaming doesn\u2019t work anymore! you label me? you wonder why Trump won?\u201d Duquette, who is white, posted this week on Twitter. \u201cTired of being classified with untruths.\u201d Donald Trump cited the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II as a legal justification for creating a national registration list \u201cfor immigrants from Muslim countries.\u201d Speaking to anchor Megyn Kelly on Fox News on Wednesday night, Carl Higbie,...

(Rong-Gong Lin II) Duquette\u00a0voted for President Obama eight years ago\u00a0and would never call himself a racist. Like many Americans, he was sold on Trump\u2019s promises to create jobs and fight terrorism. But there was also something else that attracted him. Trump has eliminated \u201cthat uncomfortable feeling of being afraid to speak your mind as a white man,\u201d said the 37-year-old prison guard. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with being white.\u201d Much has been said about the rise of white nationalists who have felt emboldened by Trump\u00a0and his association with\u00a0people and groups known to espouse anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic views. One of the more widespread effects of the Nov. 8\u00a0election may be the emergence of a broad array of everyday Americans who insist they're not white nationalists but say the president-elect has made them\u00a0more comfortable in their white\u00a0skin. In an era of dueling \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and \u201call lives matter\u201d campaigns and regular debates over free speech and political correctness, Duquette, who says he has\u00a0heard the phrase \u201cwhite privilege\u201d one too many times, said he now feels vindicated. Kory Duquette Kory Duquette Kory Duquette (handout photo) \u201cWe were, I felt, backed into a corner and \u2026 told, \u2018You white people had your day, it's our turn now,\u2019\u201d he said this week from his home in Arab, Ala.\u00a0\u201cI feel Trump broke that P.C. barrier, \u2026 made me feel comfortable again to speak out.\u201d Trump\u2019s election has thrust race even more squarely into the simmering national debate over justice and American identity. Protesters have blocked streets in dozens of cities over a vote they see as affirming\u00a0racism and xenophobia. There has been widespread alarm over a wave of hate incidents directed at minorities across the country, the largest number seen since the period after Obama\u2019s election, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center . Some Trump supporters have been beaten in public as well. This week, the mayor of Clay, W.Va.,\u00a0 resigned after praising a friend\u2019s Facebook comment that called First Lady Michelle Obama an \u201cape in heels\u201d and celebrated her imminent departure from the White House.

The Ku Klux Klan announced it would hold a Trump victory parade in North Carolina next month. One of the catalysts for controversy has been Trump\u2019s naming of Breitbart News\u00a0executive chairman, Stephen K.\u00a0Bannon, as a senior advisor . Bannon once called his website the \u201cplatform of the alt-right,\u201d a movement broadly associated with white nationalism . He has been accused of making anti-Asian and anti-Semitic remarks, and both critics and supporters say his influence will allow his self-described \u201cvirulently anti-establishment\u201d ideas about women, gays\u00a0and others to permeate the next U.S. administration. Since the election, Bannon\u00a0has said he doesn\u2019t agree with \u201cethno-nationalist\u201d parts of the alt-right, though critics say that such views are a central part of the movement. Already, there are signs that many of those on the fringes of U.S. conservatism are angling to position themselves closer to the centers of power. Richard Spencer, the chairman of a small alt-right policy institute in Montana who has spoken\u00a0about \u201cpeaceful ethnic cleansing\u201d and a \u201cproxy war\u201d on immigration, is now scouting for office space in Washington. Trump\u2019s win \u201cwas white Americans of all classes revolting against political correctness,\u201d said Spencer,\u00a0whose National Policy Institute\u00a0has been described by the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist hate group. Whites are \u201cexpressing a desire for identity politics, or at least the beginning of it,\u201d he said. Spencer has long argued that politicians and the media have falsely convinced whites they should feel \u201cguilty\u201d while encouraging racial pride among blacks, Asians and Latinos.

Already, there is push-back. On Wednesday, Twitter suspended five accounts that Spencer used \u2014\u00a0with about 100,000 followers in total \u2014\u00a0as well as those of dozens of other alt-right handles. Still, variations on alt-right ideas are capturing attention. \u201cWe're coming to the realization that white self-hatred is a sickness,\u201d said\u00a0Timothy\u00a0Murdock, a 46-year-old alt-right podcaster from Dearborn, Mich. He said he considers himself \u201cpro-white,\u201d but feels the alt-right\u00a0movement could get better traction by going to battle against \u201cdiversity.\u201d \"There is great attention to the term 'diversity,' that it means 'too white,' coupled with open borders,\" said Murdock, whose podcasts frequently talk about \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d ",

The director of national intelligence coordinates the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies. The White House has instructed presidential appointees to submit their letters of resignation by early December, including the date they plan to leave office. CBS News\u2019 Mark Knoller notes that Obama appointees will serve until noon on Jan. 20, unless invited to stay longer by Trump. Clapper, 75, has served as President Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence since August 2010. He previously served during the George W. Bush administration as under secretary of defense for intelligence and director of the national geospatial intelligence agency. Under President George H.W. Bush, Clapper served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. His announcement is not completely unexpected as a number of Obama\u2019s appointees are also expected to resign by Jan. 20 of next year before Donald Trump is inaugurated.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Ohio Rep. Ryan announces Pelosi challenge, as Dem unrest grows Published               November 17, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan on Thursday became the first lawmaker to formally challenge House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for her post, a move that comes as the California power-broker faces growing unrest inside the Democratic caucus in the wake of last week\u2019s election. Ryan, who had been publicly considering mounting a leadership bid for days, announced his decision in a letter to colleagues. He said he was \u201cdisheartened\u201d by the election results and Democrats \u201cmust not let this opportunity for change pass by without a fight.\u201d Ryan wrote: \u201cOver the last 18 years, Democrats have only been in the majority of the House of Representatives for two terms and last week\u2019s election results set us back even further. We have lost over 60 seats since 2010. We have the fewest Democrats in state and federal offices since Reconstruction.\u00a0At this time of fear and disillusionment, we owe it to our constituencies to listen and bring a new voice into leadership.\u201d Pelosi last faced a challenge in 2010 after the party\u2019s midterm clobbering that cost them the House. Then-Rep. Heath Shuler, D-N.C., ran and only got 43 votes.\u00a0 But Pelosi is dealing with a fluid and unpredictable situation on Capitol Hill.\u00a0Democrats earlier this week delayed leadership elections until Nov. 30, amid consternation over the party\u2019s failure to win control of either chamber of Congress on Election Day.\u00a0 Angry Democratic lawmakers expressed their frustration in a closed-door session Thursday, and some grew angrier after Pelosi left the room to hold her weekly news conference, according to those who attended the session. Some also were offended she handed out a legislative plan for next year, suggesting she should be listening to members rather than forging ahead and flexing her muscle. \u201cSome of her supporters are tone-deaf,\u201d one Democratic member groused. Pelosi has remained confident of her support within the caucus, saying at a press conference Thursday she has support of at least two-thirds of the Democratic members -- and that\u2019s \u201cwithout having asked for their vote yet.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \"When somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out, both internally in the caucus and in the country,\" Pelosi said. Ryan, in his letter, called for creating \u201cAmerica 2.0 --- a multicultural, progressive, and innovative country that fights every day for ordinary people.\u201d Before making it official, Ryan told Fox News it was time \u201cfor a new direction, a new way of doing business, a new Democratic Party.\u201d \u201cWe have to talk to those people who take a shower after work, not those who just take a shower before work,\u201d Ryan said. Overall, the math still appears to favor Pelosi. Democrats will have about 198 members in their caucus, meaning the successful candidate for leader needs 100 votes. It\u2019s unclear whether any other candidates may emerge to challenge Pelosi. Earlier, Fox News was told some House Democrats were pushing House Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., to run. Crowley, who is from working-class Queens and has broad support inside the caucus, was seen as a possible choice to topple Pelosi. However, Crowley announced late Thursday he\u2019s running for chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. On Wednesday, Pelosi; House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md.; and Assistant Minority Leader Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., all announced bids for their old positions.

Soldiers from the California Army National Guard have been ordered to return enlistment bonuses they received a decade ago when the Pentagon needed troops for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. (California Army National Guard) David S. Cloud California lawmakers in the House and Senate offered legislative proposals Thursday that would allow nearly 10,000 California\u00a0National Guard soldiers to keep improper enlistment bonuses they were paid during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago. In a rare sign of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill,\u00a0 Democrats and Republicans argued that congressional action is needed to make sure the Pentagon forgives the soldiers\u2019 debts and closes out an episode that has hurt thousands of veterans, roiled the Pentagon and embarrassed members of Congress. A version of the bill could be approved as part of a defense authorization package as early as next week, when Congress leaves on Thanksgiving recess, congressional leaders said. If approved, the legislation would make it likely that most or all of the roughly 9,700 California Guard soldiers who received inflated enlistment bonuses and student loan\u00a0payments between 2004 and 2010 would have those debts waived, lawmakers said. After he fought for the country, the U.S. is asking him to give back his enlistment bonus Short of troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago, the California National Guard enticed thousands of soldiers with bonuses.\u00a0Now the Pentagon is demanding the money back. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Short of troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago, the California National Guard enticed thousands of soldiers with bonuses.\u00a0Now the Pentagon is demanding the money back. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) See more videos Under the Democrats\u2019 version of the bill, the approximately 1,700 California Guard soldiers who already have repaid all or part of their bonuses to the Pentagon would be given the money back with interest. The proposed legislation also orders the Pentagon to inform credit agencies that the debt was never valid, meeting a key complaint from soldiers unable to get mortgages or car loans because of poor credit scores. Credit agencies would be barred from including references to the soldiers\u2019 debts in credit reports. The Times reported last month that the Pentagon was demanding repayment of enlistment bonuses that were given to about 9,700 California Guard soldiers to help fill enlistment quotas for the wars. Many of the soldiers served in combat and some returned with severe injuries. Many of the soldiers were told to repay bonuses of more than $15,000 years after they had completed their military service. (David S. Cloud) In response to a public outcry, and at the urging of the White House, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter ordered a suspension of the repayment program on Oct. 26 and set up an internal appeals process to review the debts by next July. But Pentagon officials emphasized that they could not fully forgive all the soldiers\u2019 debts, which totaled in the tens of millions of dollars. Some of the bonuses were awarded as part of an illegal scheme that saw several recruiters convicted of fraud and other crimes in 2011, they noted. Pentagon officials also warned that forgiving all the debts could hurt future efforts to stem waste, fraud and abuse in the military. Congress appears likely to sweep\u00a0away those concerns, however, arguing that soldiers who agreed to enlist or reenlist in return for a financial bonus should not be forced to repay the money years after they had gone to war. On the Democrats\u2019 side,\u00a0Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California and Rep. Adam B. Schiff of Burbank introduced a bill Thursday that would require the Pentagon to waive repayments even for soldiers who were ineligible for the bonuses as long as the individual did not knowingly\u00a0commit fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s still not clear to me that even those who accepted the bonuses in good faith will have their debts forgiven\u201d under the plan Carter announced, Schiff\u00a0said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want there\u00a0to be any doubts.\u201d Schiff said he expected the proposal would be added to the defense authorization bill expected to pass Congress this year. \u201cAnd if not, we\u2019ll push to pass it early next year,\u201d he said. Feinstein said she wanted to ensure\u00a0that the effort by Congress to forgive the soldiers\u2019 debt \u201cwon\u2019t lapse\u201d after Donald Trump is inaugurated as president in January and a new administration is in place. \u201cWe want to reassure the affected service members that our government stands by its commitments and they will not be punished for the actions of others,\u201d she said. The Democrats\u2019 bill has 15 co-sponsors in the Senate and 27 in the House. On the Republican side, Rep. Jeff Denham of Turlock, who was involved in an abortive effort to provide debt relief to the affected soldiers in 2014, and Rep. Ken Calvert of Corona introduced legislation similar to the Feinstein-Schiff proposal. (David S. Cloud) \u201cWhile the [Defense Department] has stopped the harassment, much more needs to be done, and it is important that we resolve this issue under the current administration where it all started,\u201d Denham said in a statement. \u201cOur veterans deserve a secure financial future.\u201d The bills would bar the Pentagon from ordering soldiers to repay their bonuses because the military had lost their enlistment contracts or because other paperwork errors had occurred, a problem for many California Guard veterans. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services committees, respectively, both have vowed to address\u00a0the repayment\u00a0issue in their committees.\u00a0 If Congress approves a waiver measure, it may be attached to a bill authorizing Pentagon programs that has passed the House and Senate. The final version of the bill is being decided in a House-Senate conference. McCain told reporters Wednesday that he hopes to have the bill finished before Congress leaves for its\u00a0Thanksgiving recess next week. Another option would be for the House and\u00a0Senate to pass a separate bill, aides said, though several said that doing so in the lame duck session is not a certainty. The Pentagon has said it doesn\u2019t need Congress to intervene. The authorization bill already contains a provision that would establish a 10-year statute of limitations on the military's ability to recover overpayments. That offers little immediate help to California Guard members, however, since it would not take effect until 2027. The Pentagon began ordering California Guard soldiers to repay enlistment bonuses after the Sacramento Bee reported in 2010 that a federal investigation had found that thousands of ineligible soldiers were given enlistment bonuses and student loan payments, or were approved despite incomplete paperwork. Army Master Sgt.\u00a0Toni Jaffe, the California Guard\u2019s incentive manager, pleaded guilty in 2011 to filing false claims of $15.2 million and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. Three officers also pleaded guilty to fraud and were put on probation after paying restitution. Recoupment of the bonuses has been under way ever since, with little attention until recently. Soldiers identified by California Guard audits as having received improper payments were told to repay the money and threatened with wage garnishments, tax liens and interest payments if they did not. An appeals process that allowed them to contest the debts was lengthy and difficult, officials acknowledged. Full Coverage: Pentagon pushes to make California veterans pay back bonuses \u00bb The proposed legislative fix in Congress comes at least two years after the California Guard first warned members that \u201cthousands of soldiers have inadvertently incurred debt, through no fault of their own because of faulty Army recruiting or accounting practices.\u201d But lawmakers in Washington said the notice, part of a list of legislative priorities the California Guard sent to Capitol Hill, did not alert them to the scale of the problem. Soldiers involved in the dispute responded warily Thursday to news of a potential solution in Washington. One of them was retired California Guard Master Sgt. Bill McLain, who served four tours of duty\u00a0in Iraq and Afghanistan and was wounded in the jaw. In 2013, McLain was ordered to repay $30,000 in reenlistment bonuses because the California Guard determined he already had served too many years in the Army to qualify. The Pentagon has not contacted him or withdrawn its repayment demands despite Carter\u2019s announcement of a suspension last month. So McLain sent a $100 check this month, the token amount he sends each month on a debt he denies owing. \u201cI would be more than pleased if they would do the honorable thing and say anybody who didn\u2019t knowingly commit fraud can keep their bonus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to our government, you never know.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Northern Californians who voted for Trump feel forgotten by the state , Megyn Kelly's new book took a new turn due to the elections , Twitter is trying to clean up , and the Crystal Cathederal is getting a new look.

    "text": "Nov 17 2016, 11:29 am ET Minnesota Mom Sues Her Trans Child Over Gender Reassignment by Mary Emily O'Hara A Minnesota mom filed a lawsuit Wednesday against her 17-year-old transgender daughter, along with county health boards, a school district and local health care nonprofits. Minnesota mother Anmarie Calgaro Emily Gruenhagen via Facebook \"It was brought to my knowledge that my son (sic) began receiving hormone replacement treatments from Park Nicollet Health Services to transition from male to female, with medical assistance paying for this,\" Anmarie Calgaro told reporters in a St. Paul, Minnesota court. \"I was not consulted or informed about this in any way.\" In a video of the press conference posted to Facebook, Calgaro and attorney Erick Kaardal repeatedly refer to the teen in question as male\u2014despite a doctor's letter included in the complaint that states the teen \"has had appropriate, permanent clinical treatment for transition to the new female gender.\" Calgaro's lawsuit challenges a Minnesota law that allows minors to access medical care and procedures without the consent of their parents. \"Medical service providers determine whether a teenage child is emancipated,\" Kaardal said at Wednesday's press conference, adding that this allows minors to receive \"elective, non-emergency medical procedure(s).\" Minnesota does not have a legal process for the emancipation of minors. But the law makes it clear that minors who aren't living at home are essentially considered adults when it comes to medical care: \"Any minor who is living separate and apart from parents ... and who is managing personal financial affairs, regardless of the source or extent of the minor's income, may give effective consent to personal medical, dental, mental and other health services, and the consent of no other person is required.\" NBC OUT was not able to track down the minor for comment. But notably, the emancipation statement included in the complaint \u2014which the teen created along with Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid in June 2015\u2014states that \"mother has made it known to him that she no longer wishes to have any contact with him,\" \"knows where he is and has made no attempts to bring him home,\" and \"has taken no actions to report him as a runaway or taken legal action to keep him in her home.\" The emancipation notice was filed in Stearns County District Court in October 2015. But Calgaro disputed the claims about her relationship with her child, and expressed frustration that she was left out of the teen's subsequent health care decisions. Also included in the complaint was a doctor's letter dated January 2016 that stated the teen had undergone gender transition treatment and should be issued new identity documents with female gender markers. \"The news that county agencies and health service providers, the school and other county and state offices were completely bypassing me came as a total shock,\" Calgaro said while beginning to cry. \"Why wasn't I even notified?\" Potential Impact on Abortion Law Kaardal is not the only attorney on the case. Calgaro is also being represented by an anti-abortion law firm called the Thomas More Society. The firm is also currently defending David Daleiden , the anti-abortion activist who was indicted by a Texas grand jury in January for buying and selling human organs in an attempt to frame Planned Parenthood. While Thomas More Society's other cases include fights against insurance coverage of birth control and trying to block an Illinois transgender high school student from accessing the girls bathroom at school, the majority of the firm's cases are geared toward fighting abortion. Minnesota's statute that allows minors to make their own medical decisions is echoed in the state's parental notification law regarding abortion. According to Minnesota statute 144.343, no non-emancipated minor may access an abortion procedure until 48 hours after parents have been notified that the procedure will take place. It is unclear whether the Thomas More Society is using Calgaro's case as a backdoor fight against the abortion law\u2014after all, a minor could ostensibly declare herself emancipated in order to get around the parental notification\u2014nonetheless, the legislative connection is impossible to ignore. Transgender Teen Healthcare While the Thomas More Society's press release refers to a \"life-changing operation\" undergone by the teen, the vast majority of transgender people don't have surgery until after age 18\u2014if they have surgery at all. \"Surgery is highly unlikely before 18,\" said Jamison Green, a former president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the standard bearer for transgender health care policy. Green noted that the teen in question has likely only been on hormone therapy for a year or less. And, he said, \"In most cases, it's best to be on hormones for at least a year before surgery.\" \"Doctors are going to monitor the effects of the hormones and the psychological development the patient goes through,\" Green said. \"And at a certain point, the doctors will determine when surgery is an option. In the case of male-to-female transition, you want to see how much breast growth occurs before you do anything to modify the chest.\" For most trans youth, the process of gender-affirming treatment begins with psychological care. Green told NBC OUT that with most transgender teens being at higher risk for self-harm and suicide, receiving support for the identified gender is the first step. \"The clinic may just be doing harm reduction: getting them started in a way that supports their identity,\" Green added. \"If the teen is presenting as female, name-change documents are very important. They reduce anxiety and exposure to certain kinds of violence that are preventable when you show people your ID.\" Green doesn't live in Minnesota, so he couldn't speak with authority on local law and policy. But Phil Duran, the Legal Director at OutFront Minnesota, told NBC OUT the lawsuit's allegations were perplexing at best. \"At 17 years old, a trans girl is at best going to get access to counseling and hormones,\" Duran said. \"There's reference in the press release to a surgery or operation. It would be incredibly unlikely\u2014vanishingly unlikely\u2014that a minor would get access to surgery.\" Emancipation The lawsuit's references to emancipation also struck OutFront's Duran as confusing\u2014especially because the state law does not employ the term at all. Instead, it simply allows for minors who are living on their own to make their own medical decisions. \"There's no evidence that this kid is legally emancipated,\" Duran said. \"It's a head scratcher as to what [Calgaro] expects the court to do to reverse a decision that was never made.\" The lawsuit asserts that Calgaro's parental rights are stripped by the law, and also that her constitutional right to due process is violated. \"If there had been a court order of emancipation, then Anmarie would have received notice and an opportunity to be heard,\" attorney Kaardal said at the Wednesday press conference. But if Calgaro's lawsuit\u2014which again, names her own teenage daughter as a defendant\u2014is successful, approximately 6,580 transgender and gender non-conforming (GNC) high school students in the state of Minnesota could encounter more obstacles to the care that experts say they desperately need. Minnesota's Trans and Gender Non-Conforming Youth The estimate of 6,580 trans and GNC teens attending high school comes from the Minnesota Department of Education's 2016 Minnesota Student Survey \u2014which this year included questions about gender identity for the first time. Responding to a question about whether they identify as \"transgender, genderqueer, genderfluid, or unsure about your gender identity,\" 2.5 percent of high school students answered 'yes.' With the state's Department of Education data offering a total of 263,238 9-12 graders, that means nearly 7,000 fall somewhere on the gender non-conforming spectrum. David Edwards has encountered quite a few of those teens in his leadership role with Transforming Families, a community-led group that \"supports parents of gender-diverse kids.\" Edwards also knows firsthand what it's like to grapple with the challenges of raising a transgender child: He and his wife filed a complaint with the St. Paul Human Rights Department after other parents protested their trans child's attendance at a local kindergarten. At Transforming Families, Edwards said, \"Our families come from a wide variety of backgrounds and come into our group from vastly different places in terms of acceptance and support for their kids.\" Parents are often resistant at first, but Edwards said that when they learn about the mental health risks faced by transgender youth, \"they usually end up making the choice to do what's best for their kid.\" At the press conference on Wednesday, Calgaro\u2014along with attorneys\u2014repeatedly referred to her child as \"my son,\" using male pronouns exclusively to describe the teen despite the lawsuit including a doctor's statement asserting the teen's legal status as female. That raised Edwards' hackles. \"Purposefully mis-gendering a transgender person is an act of violence. To continually do that to your child is not only insensitive but also really harmful,\" said Edwards, who added that 38 percent of the trans and GNC teen survey respondents said they had attempted suicide. Parenting Through the Courts At the press conference, Calgaro told reporters that \"The transitioning thing isn't even the issue, the issue is that he's able to make these [medical] decisions.\" What Calgaro said she wants is for parents to be notified and included in their minor children's medical decisions. But OutFront's Duran said that independently accessed transition-related care hasn't been an issue for most Minnesota parents, and \"making medical decisions on your own is not the same as emancipation.\" \"I think mom is grasping at straws,\" Duran told NBC OUT, \"and trying to construe the kid's decision as a state-imposed violation of her constitutional rights.\" According to documents included in the lawsuit, Calgaro's daughter turns 18 next July, meaning that the case will not be relevant to the family for long. But it could inspire more parents to try to oppose their transgender children in court\u2014a terrifying prospect for LGBTQ youth, many of whom already struggle with acceptance at home. \"It's unfortunate that this mom is choosing to parent through the legal system,\" Edwards said. \"That doesn't seem productive at all.\" But Calgaro, talking to reporters on Wednesday, suggested that her case is bigger than her family alone: \"I'm also taking this action for the benefit of all parents and families, who may be facing the same violation of their rights\u2014so that they and others in the future may be spared from the same tragic events.\" Follow NBC OUT on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .

USA TODAY Exterior of the John Weld Peck Federal Building in downtown Cincinnati, home of the local IRS office at the heart of the tea party scandal, (Photo: Enquirer file) CINCINNATI \u2014 A federal judge ruled this month in a lawsuit in the ongoing IRS Tea Party saga that there was \"a strong showing\" that the agency had discriminated against conservative groups because of their political stances. And U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett wrote in a decision that a group suing the IRS \"has made a strong showing of a likelihood of success\" on its claim that its free speech rights were violated by the delay in processing the application. He ordered the IRS to continue processing the application from the group, called the Texas Patriots Tea Party, even as the IRS fights the group\u2019s lawsuit. \"The Government appears not to see the forest through the trees when it uses the existence of this lawsuit as grounds to continue the delay that is the subject of this lawsuit,\" Barrett wrote in his Nov. 4 decision. \"The evidence strongly suggests that the IRS initiated the delay\" because the Texas group was affiliated with the Tea Party. House leaders avert vote to impeach IRS chief with last-minute deal A Cincinnati native, Barrett was appointed to the federal bench in 2006 by then-President George W. Bush following a stint as chairman of the Hamilton County Republican Party. The latest ruling could set a precedent in the ongoing saga over alleged unfair treatment of such organizations and make it easier for them to go through the non-profit application process, lawyers in the case say. That's because it could force the IRS to speed up and reconfigure how it determines whether such groups can get nonprofit status throughout its system, and not just for the Texas group. \"We are suing in part for what we think is a violation of our First Amendment right to free speech, and we feel this ruling gives us that,\" said Kansas City-based lawyer Eddie Greim who is one of the lead lawyers for the Tea Party groups in the case. \"If it holds up, this could establish the basic principle that the IRS will be judged on in the future.\" In a statement, the IRS said that it had told Congress in August and several times since then that it had started processing the remaining cases that had been on hold \u201cdue to litigation in the courts.\u201d \u201cThe IRS is committed to resolving these cases as quickly as possible under our procedures, which reflect changes made since 2013,\" the agency said. IRS scandal won't go away The Texas Patriots lawsuit reached class action status in January and now includes several other conservative groups. A total of four lawsuits against the IRS are still alive nationally, including two filed in Washington, D.C. The latest ruling involves the Texas organization alone. All the suits were filed shortly after IRS officials in 2013 acknowledged they had singled out conservative-leaning \"public interest\" groups for extra attention while reviewing their applications for nonprofit status. Such a designation allows people to donate with no tax penalty, and such groups can conduct some political activity as long as it is not \"the majority\" of their actions. Conservative groups claimed that the slow process put a chill on such contributions during the 2012 election cycle, raising the possibility that the scrutiny was a way to slow down fundraising and campaigning by conservatives by the Obama administration. That led to a major scandal and several investigations by Congress, the Justice Department and even with the IRS itself. It also caused the resignations or firings of several top IRS officials, including then-Commissioner Steven Miller as well as other administrators tied to the targeting. IRS official retires after Tea Party controversy An FBI and Justice Department investigation found in 2015 that the IRS's nonprofit approval system was rife with mismanagement and poor judgment, but that there wasn't enough evidence to prove that IRS agents acted in political ways or should be criminally prosecuted. But the IRS completely stopped processing the Texas group's nonprofit application that was originally filed in 2012 once the suit was filed, saying it had lost jurisdiction because of the ongoing case. Barrett ruled that process should continue, but also that the IRS could not use either its previous process it used for such conservative groups nor the expedited replacement system the agency offered after the scandal broke. \"That replacement was dangled to us ... but instead was even more onerous than the original system because it asked us to pledge things that were improper or illegal,\" Greim said, saying that groups had to promise not to exceed 40% of their time on political activities. Barrett wrote that the IRS's review of Texas group's application should be part of \"the regular business practices\" of the IRS, Barrett wrote, and not the way it was previously done for Tea Party groups or the expedited process. Do documents show bias/targeting? It's unclear how these cases will be handled by the incoming Trump administration, although one conservative watchdog group is asking investigations into the scandal be resumed once President-elect Trump takes office. \"Inertia is always on the side of bureaucracy, and the IRS really only has two political appointees, so they need to get someone in there that show concern over what happened and are committed to finding out what exactly did happen,\" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. Judicial Watch this week released more than a thousand new documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that show officials in Cincinnati and Washington knew IRS agents in Cincinnati were targeting conservative groups by their party affiliations and by \"guilt by association.\" Tea Party group files suit against IRS over targeting The documents include handwritten notes from meetings that indicate IRS official Holly Paz knew conservative groups were being targeted by agency employees in Cincinnati for extra questioning. Paz was based in Washington but traveled to Cincinnati frequently. \"They think they know what the org is really doing, rather than looking at actual activities ... Q\u2019s were not activity based, but guilt by association questions \u2014\u00a0like q\u2019s asking party affiliations,\" according to a handwritten note taken by an unnamed IRS official during a meeting with Paz obtained by Judicial Watch. Paz, who reported to a key figure in the scandal, Lois Lerner, said in a meeting that the Cincinnati office was paralyzed by how to process the influx of applications from conservative groups. Lerner, whose emails also showed some controversial decisions, resigned over the scandal. Paz was put on administrative leave after the scandal broke. and later transferred to another division. \"We're getting document after document showing the IRS both in Washington and Cincinnati knew that people were doing things outside the rules,\" said Judicial Watch's Finton. \"If they were asking inappropriate questions based on guilt by association or party affiliations, then I don't know what more you need to show that something inappropriate was going on, if not illegal.\" 161 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 112 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fAW0FB ",

Since his visit to Washington, D.C., last week, Trump has remained in his Manhattan headquarters and residence, with no public events, holding multiple meetings with top transition aides and various contenders for his Cabinet. The meetings today were likely to focus on foreign policy and national security , including a mix of people who are providing counsel and those whose names are reportedly in the mix for Cabinet positions in the Trump administration. Among those who visited or were expected to head to Trump Tower today: Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a contender for attorney general; South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley , a possible secretary of state; and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . The Donald Gets Realpolitik: Trump to Meet Foreign Policy Bigwig Henry Kissinger Sessions, a close Trump ally and foreign policy adviser, has been spotted multiple times this week in Trump Tower for meetings and received the firmest indication yet from the president-elect's office that he is a strong contender for attorney general after today's meeting. \"While nothing has been finalized and he is still talking with others as he forms his Cabinet, the president-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Sen. Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's attorney general and U.S. attorney,\" a statement from Trump's transition team read. \"It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.\" Haley, a late endorser of Trump, originally threw her support behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio before the South Carolina primary in February. \"Marco Rubio is the only one that can defeat Donald Trump, and Marco Rubio can beat Hillary Clinton and will win in November,\" Haley said on ABC News' \"This Week\" in February. Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., voiced his support for Haley today, telling CNN, \"She's talented, she's capable and could do a good job in any assignment given. I don't know her foreign policy. I haven't talked to her. Her husband was in the South Carolina National Guard. He deployed to Afghanistan. I think she's a traditional Republican when it comes to foreign policy. I certainly would support Nikki Haley. I like her a lot.\" \"Gov. Haley was pleased to meet with President-elect Trump,\" her deputy chief of staff Rob Godfrey said in a statement to ABC News after the meeting. \"They had a good discussion, and she is very encouraged about the coming administration and the new direction it will bring to Washington.\" This is not Trump's first meeting with Kissinger. The two met in May at Kissinger's home at a time when Trump was seeking support from Republicans and featuring foreign policy issues more prominently in his campaign. A secretary of state for Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, Kissinger, 92, has remained active in politics in the decades since and has taken on a respected-elder role for some Republicans. \"President-elect Trump and Dr. Kissinger have known each other for years and had a great meeting,\" the presidential transition team said in a statement. \"They discussed China, Russia, Iran, the EU and other events and issues around the world.\" Trump said he has \"tremendous respect for Dr. Kissinger and appreciates him sharing his thoughts with me.\" Additionally, Trump is scheduled to meet with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today \u2014 his first face-to-face meeting with a head of state since becoming president-elect. Trump will also hold meetings with Florida Gov. Rick Scott , Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Navy Adm. Mike Rogers. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Ohio Democrat Announces Challenge to Nancy Pelosi for House Minority Leader By MARYALICE PARKS Nov 17, 2016, 3:52 PM ET 0 Shares Email Representative Tim Ryan , D-Ohio, will challenge Nancy Pelosi , D-California, for House minority leader. After weighing the possibility all week, he announced his decision in a letter to colleagues this afternoon. \u201cI have spent countless hours meeting and talking to Members of our Caucus, and the consensus is clear. What we are doing right now is not working,\u201d he wrote. Ryan has represented Ohio's 13th district since he took office in 2003. (The district was previously numbered the 17th district.) \u201cWhile having a position in Democratic Leadership has never been my life\u2019s ambition, after this election I believe we all need to re-evaluate our roles within the Caucus, the Democratic Party , and our country. That is why I am announcing my run for Minority Leader of the Democratic Caucus and humbly request your support,\u201d his letter continued. Pelosi has served as the Democrats' leader in the House for 12 years and yesterday formally announced that she would seek the post again. In her letter, she boasted of enjoying the support of two-thirds of her caucus. As Homeowners Complained, Donald Trump Slammed 'Frivolous' Lawsuits \u201cI've regularly had some opponents,\u201d Pelosi said during a press conference today, ahead of Ryan\u2019s final announcement. She added, \"House Democrats must be unified, strategic, and unwavering.\" During an interview with ABC News Wednesday, Ryan said he did not blame Pelosi for the last week\u2019s election results, but that the focus moving forward, he believed, should be on picking up red districts and reconnecting with blue-collar workers. \" Donald Trump is the president, that is how bad we are out of touch, that the backbone of our party went and voted for Donald Trump, and I say that\u2019s out fault,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly we have got to do something much different,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cWe have to connect to these working-class voters and we have a broad coalition.\u201d \"My family and friends work in steel mills, they work in auto plants they work in factories.... We need to stop talking to these people like we are better than them,\u201d he went on. \"If we want to resurrect that blue wall that we thought we had in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, we've got to get back to those people and connect with them in a very deep and intimidate way,\u201d Ryan said. Aides in the more political wing of the party had been preparing for the likelihood that someone would issue a formal challenge to Pelosi. There was an understanding that younger members of the caucus wanted someone to run. Still, the move is politically risky. As one DNC staffer put it: \u201cIf you aim for the king, you best not miss.\u201d 0 Shares ",

His past convictions raised a red flag for the federal government, resulting in his deportation order. Crapser is now preparing to be sent back to South Korea. He speaks no Korean. The New York Times tracked down his birth mother and learned that she's preparing for her son's arrival \u2014 trying to learn his language and thinking ahead to what she'll feed him. Kwon Pil-ju, who is partially paralyzed, told the newspaper that she gave Crapser and his sister to an orphanage, and another child to a childless family, after their father left her and she couldn't provide for them. Article continues after sponsorship She said she always believed that they had a better life than she could have given them \u2014 \"I have never imagined that he was having this hard life of his,\" she told the paper through tears. \"I should have kept him even if we starved together.

Supporters Aim To Protect Adult Adoptees From Deportation May 19, 2015 Crapser's story has made headlines but, as the Times notes, he is far from the only adoptee in his situation. Other individuals adopted by U.S. parents have been deported back to South Korea \u2014 including one, Monte Haines, who served in the U.S. military before he was deported in the '90s. And thousands of other adoptees lack U.S. citizenship and are vulnerable to deportation. The U.S. government passed a law in 2000 to make children adopted by U.S. citizens automatically citizens themselves. But the law did not apply retroactively \u2014 it covered children under 18 and future adoptees only. Adoption rights advocates have petitioned Congress to grant citizenship to adult adoptees left out by the 2000 law. But the legislation faces \"long odds,\" as NPR's Alexandra Starr put it last year . Updated at 7:30 a.m. Friday with the news of Crapser's deportation. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Campaign promises are easy. Governing is hard. It is a truism that Donald J. Trump and his team will soon learn. And a fascinating example has emerged since the election, courtesy of global currency markets. It is a study in the kind of complex trade-offs that Mr. Trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the Oval Office. A centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was the United States\u2019 trade deficits. He pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in American manufacturing. He has also pledged tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. That set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years. That, in turn, is driving the value of the dollar higher on currency markets. Since Election Day, the dollar is up 2.6 percent against an index of six other major currencies. The value of the Mexican peso has fallen 10 percent against the dollar, a remarkable swing for the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner. You don\u2019t need to be an economist to see what that means: A pricier dollar makes it harder for American manufacturers to compete overseas; it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations elsewhere; and it will, all else being equal, tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower. This is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for American manufacturers and other exporters (though those that ship their goods to Mexico will feel the brunt of it). There was a bigger rise in the dollar in 2014 and 2015 that damaged export sectors even more. Photo A board displaying the exchange rate for the Mexican peso and the dollar in a bank in Mexico City this week. Credit Henry Romero/Reuters But let\u2019s imagine that Mr. Trump follows through on the policy mix he\u2019s hinted at so far: a combination of loose fiscal policy (think more spending on defense and infrastructure, and tax cuts) and tighter monetary policy (the Federal Reserve raising interest rates faster than had seemed likely before the election). At that point, the dollar could move more decisively higher, creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other. As a rule of thumb, said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a 10 percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit (a broader concept than trade deficit, but closely related) by 1 to 1.5 percent of G.D.P. in the ensuing two to three years. Advertisement In that scenario, Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to eliminate the $500 billion United States trade deficit would have just become $180 billion to $270 billion harder.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook A makeshift memorial for Harambe, the lowland gorilla killed at the Cincinnati Zoo, sits outside the gorilla exhibit. (Photo: Enquirer file/Liz Dufour) CINCINNATI \u2014 The barrier separating primates and humans inside the Cincinnati Zoo was just fine \u2014 right up until the moment a child fell into the gorilla exhibit May 28. That's the takeaway of a new federal report that concluded the zoo's barrier was not in compliance with standards for housing primates when a 3-year-old boy made international news by scaling a fence and falling 15 feet into a moat. That fall allowed Harambe, a 17-year-old gorilla, to reach the child and drag him around, ultimately forcing zoo officials to fatally shoot the primate. The report, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, issued a critical citation because the barrier failed and caused an animal to be harmed. Before the child fell into the exhibit, however, the zoo had not been cited for shortcomings with that exhibit's barrier during previous inspections. In short, it's a complicated way of saying that everything would have been fine at the zoo had a child not fallen into the gorilla exhibit, but because one did, the barrier failed. Cincinnati Zoo returns to Twitter after Harambe outrage \"Up until May 28, there hadn't been any issues, so they were in compliance,\" USDA spokeswoman Tanya Espinosa said. \"It's ultimately their responsibility to make sure that their barrier restricts contact between the public and non-human primates.\" The zoo so far doesn't face fines or penalties, but an investigation is still ongoing. Espinosa said zoo officials \"swiftly and comprehensively\" updated the barrier following the gorilla's death, which meant it was once again in compliance with federal standards. x Share How a 4-year-old boy dropped into the Gorilla World exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. Deciding that the injured boy's life was in danger, zoo officials decided to kill Harambe, the 450-pound silverback gorilla. The federal standards for primate barriers are vague. They don't specify height, materials or other physical characteristics. The only requirement is that they keep humans and animals apart. The report goes on to state that the zoo's dangerous-animal response team\u00a0followed proper procedures after zoo visitors called 911 to report a child in the gorilla enclosure. A team member concluded that the child was in \"life-threatening danger,\" and Harambe was killed. June USDA inspection by Bob Strickley on Scribd Gail Myers, a spokeswomen for the family of the boy who entered the enclosure, said that the family has never wanted to pursue legal action against the zoo. \"These findings do not change anything for us. We are thankful to the Lord that our child is safe and well,\" the family said in a statement Thursday. \"It was a tragic accident. We very much appreciate the quick actions by the Cincinnati Zoo staff, and mourn with them the loss of Harambe.\" According to Enquirer\u00a0reporting in June, the USDA has issued 10 citations in the last three years during inspections at the zoo. But most were minor, and none were at Gorilla World. The USDA is tasked with enforcing the Animal Welfare Act, a portion of which governs the humane care and treatment of animals that are exhibited to the public. Facilities that exhibit regulated animals must be licensed by the USDA. In response to the report, Cincinnati Zoo officials reiterated that about 43 million visitors in the past 40 years have gone through Gorilla World without coming into contact with gorillas. Zoo gorilla Harambe shot and killed after boy falls into his enclosure \"The Cincinnati Zoo reaffirms its long-standing commitment to the well-being of the resident animals and the safety of those inspired to view and conserve them,\" a statement from the zoo said Thursday. \"In its 38-year history, the barrier system at Gorilla World has always been found compliant during USDA inspections, including one conducted in April of 2016. Following the incident this May, we modified the barrier to reassure the public and our visitors.\" Gorilla World was closed for 10 days following the incident in May. During that time, the zoo installed a new barrier railing. It is 42 inches high, with solid wood beams at the top and on the bottom, as well as knotted rope netting.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook President Obama speaks at a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Chancellery on Thursday in Berlin. (Photo: Carsten Koall, Getty Images) BERLIN\u00a0\u2014 President Obama weighed in on the growing furor over fake news on the Internet on Thursday, cautioning against \"active misinformation\" that he said may threaten democracy itself. Obama's remarks came during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in which he called on Americans \u2014 and especially young people \u2014 to avoid complacency as citizens. Active misinformation is \"packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,\" he said. Some television networks have picked up on deliberately faked online stories, as when Fox News reported that Obama had deleted messages of support for Hillary Clinton on his Twitter account. Fox later apologized. Trump's new tone needs to be reflected in staff picks, Obama says \"If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not \u2014 and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones \u2014 if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,\" he said.\u00a0\"If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect.\u00a0We won\u2019t know what to fight for.\u00a0And we can lose so much of what we\u2019ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we\u2019ve come to take for granted.\" An analysis by Buzzfeed News found that fake news stories\u00a0\u2014 including one that said Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 spread more quickly on social media during the last three months of the election campaign than real news from outlets like the New York Times and USA TODAY. Report: Fake election news performed better than real news on Facebook But even as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he has made unspecified efforts to crack down on fake news,\u00a0he said it's \"pretty crazy\" to think it affected the outcome of the race. It's not the first time Obama has spoken about the role that technology has played in helping to foster the populist movements that led to the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and now Trump's victory in the United States. In Greece earlier this week, he said the \"unprecedented exchange of information\" has created a \"volatile politics\" in Western countries, as people begin to question their national identities. ",

Donald Trump's son-in-law could play a key role 2:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161118051332if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/811251779503\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The abrupt changes to onetime transition chief Christie's plans came only after Election Night, when the dawning realization of Trump's coming installation in the Oval Office surprised even the real estate mogul's most loyal fans. The Trump family had paid little attention to the transition efforts underway before the election, with Christie's team operating largely in its own orbit. But in the wake of the Republican's stunning victory last Tuesday, the attention of Trump's most intimate team members lurched towards the task of building the new administration, installing Kushner as the chief architect of the effort. Insiders say that is where long-simmering tensions between the two men boiled over. The history between Christie, Trump's earliest big-name endorser, and Kushner, who has fast become the most powerful gatekeeper to the president-elect, dates back more than a decade. In 2005, Christie, then U.S. attorney, prosecuted Jared Kushner's father, billionaire real estate developer Charles Kushner, for 18 counts of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering. The elder Kushner served two years in prison. At that time, Christie and Donald Trump were already friends. Years later, Ivanka Trump would meet and marry Jared. In the days since Christie's ouster from his transition post, rumors have bloomed about Kushner's grudge against the man whose work imprisoned his father. Some transition sources have pushed back on those reports, saying that Christie's ouster was related to dissatisfaction with his team's work and complaints about competency. (Other, however, suggest that it's worth noting that Sessions' influence does not appear to have waned along with Christie's.) Another source told NBC News the Christie fallout largely stemmed from a perception he wasn't actively and vocally loyal enough during Trump's Access Hollywood tape controversy, and is now facing fallout from the perception he stayed on the sidelines. Christie, once viewed as a possible VP pick, had also faced concerns during the summer's vice presidential search from Trump's children, who worried about his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal and believed that the GOP ticket needed geographic balance. When asked about the Kushner- Christie dynamic, Trump transition officials responded that they would \"not comment on specific relationships.\" But a spokesperson dismissed reports of internal friction as \"ludicrous\" and 'inside nonsense.\" Still, perceptions about a personal grudge between the two men persist, even at the highest levels of Trump's team. Last week, when asked about Christie getting a role in the administration, one senior Trump official merely laughed. Kushner would never let it happen, the person said. Not after Christie's prosecution of Jared's father. Kelly O'Donnell ",

But once Trump becomes president, can he still be subject to civil lawsuits over something he did before he was elected? Would he have to give testimony if the judge ordered it? The answers are clearly yes.

Clinton's lawyers had argued that he was essentially immune and that the case should be delayed until after he was out of office. Related: Donald Trump's Lawyers Ask for Delay of Trump U Trial But the court ruled that despite the demands of the office, time could be made to take a deposition. Jones, they said, \"has a right to an orderly disposition of her claims,\" just like any other citizen. The court dodged the question of whether a president can be compelled to testify in court, but it said testimony could be taken at the White House \"at a time that will accommodate his busy schedule.\" In the current case, former students of Trump University say the school fraudulently misrepresented what students would be taught and falsely claimed that instructors were handpicked by Trump. The trial is scheduled to start Nov. 28. Trump's lawyers last week asked the judge to delay the trial, including the taking of further testimony from Trump, until after the inauguration. The 69 days of transition, they said, \"are critical and all-consuming.\" Lawyers for the students countered that they don't need any more testimony from Trump and that there's no reason to delay the trial. Donald Trump listens as Michael Sexton introduces him at a news conference announcing the establishment of Trump University in New York in May 2005. Bebeto Matthews / AP \"He has submitted 510 pages of briefing and exhibits without identifying a single admissible fact that his testimony could establish that is not already in the record here,\" they said. No sitting president has ever testified in open court. President James Monroe responded to written questions as a witness in a military trial in the first quarter of the 19th century. President Gerald Ford gave a deposition in 1975 in the criminal trial of the woman who aimed a gun at him in San Francisco. President Clinton twice gave videotaped testimony in criminal cases. And after the Supreme Court ruling, he gave a four-hour videotaped statement in the Paula Jones lawsuit. That was the first time a sitting president ever gave testimony in a civil case in which he was a defendant. The federal judge in the San Diego case, Gonzalo Curiel, is the judge who Trump said during the campaign was hostile to him. \"I believe he happens to be Spanish, which is fine. He is Hispanic, which is fine. And we haven't asked for recusal, which we may do,\" Trump said in May . \"But we have a judge who is very hostile. Should've been thrown out. Wasn't thrown out.\" Pete Williams ",

USA TODAY Sports Kris Bryant led the NL in WAR (7.7), ripped 39 home runs and drove in 102. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports) With the Chicago Cubs\u2019 overwhelming success this season and Kris Bryant\u2019s central role in it, the main question in the National League MVP race was not whether he would win the award but by how much. The answer: near unanimously. The versatile third baseman added an MVP to the rookie of the year award he won in 2015 when he overwhelming outpolled Washington Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy, 415 points to 245. Bryant was named first in 29 of the 30 ballots by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, with Murphy collecting the other one. Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager, who on Monday was named rookie of the year, finished third with 240 points. Bryant, 24, is only the fourth player ever to earn top rookie and MVP honors in consecutive seasons, following Cal Ripken Jr., Ryan Howard and Dustin Pedroia. Angels' Mike Trout wins second AL MVP, out points Red Sox's Mookie Betts Bryant contributed considerably more than one of the league\u2019s most potent bats to the Cubs\u2019 major league-best 103-58 record, which paved the way for their first World Series championship since 1908. Besides playing high-caliber defense at third, Bryant logged at least 55 innings at three other positions \u2013 left field, right field and first base \u2013 facilitating manager Joe Maddon\u2019s pursuit of matchup advantages. At 6-5, 230 pounds, Bryant also proved to be a super baserunner, finishing second in Fangraphs.com\u2019s rankings in the NL. And of course, he was also one of the league\u2019s most feared sluggers, batting .292 with 39 homers, 102 RBI and a .939 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. Bryant made remarkable strikes from his outstanding debut season, reducing his strikeouts from 199 to 154 and raising his OPS by 81 points. Murphy made a solid case for MVP honors himself after joining the Nationals as a free agent following his postseason breakout with the New York Mets in October 2015. Long regarded as a fine hitter, Murphy built on his power surge from 2015 by putting up career highs in home runs (25), RBI (104), slugging percentage (.595) and OPS (.985). The last two figures led the league. He also finished second in batting average at .347. Murphy\u2019s chances to win the award took a hit when he had to sit out most of the last two weeks of the season with an injury, but he was a major factor in the Nationals overcoming a down season by reigning MVP Bryce Harper and running away with the NL East title. Seager, 22, provided a steady presence in both the field and the lineup for the Dodgers, who claimed their fourth consecutive NL West crown. He was ranked among the league\u2019s top four defenders at shortstop while hitting 26 homers and registering an .877 OPS. *** ",

If Trump is willing to actually offer Romney the secretary of state job and Romney is actually willing to take it, it would represent a major coup for the president-elect. Why? 1) Romney is a serious and highly respected, card-carrying member of the Republican establishment. 2) Per above, Romney has made no secret of his disagreements \u2014 both personally and on policy matters \u2014 with Trump. 3) It would settle the nerves of the millions of people who didn\u2019t vote for Trump as to what sort of president he might be. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) told reporters that the transition for President-elect Donald Trump was \"working well together\" and praised his decision to meet with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He also said he would be \"honored\" to be considered for an appointment in Trump's new administration. (Video: Reuters / Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The biggest question \u2014 for all of official Washington \u2014 is whether Trump can get beyond his own personal grievances and loyalty pledges to focus on doing what is best for the country over the next four years. Who he picks for his key Cabinet posts \u2014 and secretary of state is one of the most critical \u2014 is a key early indicator of where Trump\u2019s mind is. Picking Romney \u2014 or even South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, another prominent critic with whom Trump met Thursday \u2014 would show something that was sorely lacking in Donald Trump the candidate: magnanimity. A willingness to pick the person he thinks is best for the job, not just someone who was unfailingly loyal to him during the campaign. Someone who might challenge his assumptions or opinions from time to time. An equal, not a lackey. Again, this would, largely, run counter to how Trump ran his presidential campaign. But that would also make picking Romney all the more powerful a symbol. Campaigns are one thing, it would be Trump saying, but being president is another. I want to be surrounded by the best people for the job \u2014 no matter what we said about each other in the past. This is, of course, the whole \u201cTeam of Rivals\u201d concept that garnered President Obama so much good press in his own transition period back in late 2008. Trump has further to go \u2014 a lot further to go \u2014 than Obama did to heal the rifts within his own party and answer doubts about his readiness to do the job to which he was elected. But the Romney meeting is a step in the right direction. Getting Romney to sign on would be an even bigger one. In Donald Trump's Washington, there are many people vying for the President-elect's attention. The Washington Post's Robert Costa explains how Trump will seek advice during the transition.

Sign up to follow, and we\u2019ll e-mail you free updates as they\u2019re published. You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Manuel Roig-Franzia November 17 at 2:29 PM Follow @RoigFranzia Alex Jones was a powerful underground voice for the alternative conservative media, but he became a more mainstream figure in December 2015, when Donald Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, spent 30 minutes on Jones's radio program, \"Info Wars.\" (Erin Patrick O'Connor,Manuel Roig-Franzia/The Washington Post) Last December, amid the jumbled Republican presidential nomination scrum, Donald Trump carved out a half an hour for a live video interview with a volcanic Austin radio and web-streaming host who broadcasts from a semi-secret location dubbed \u201cThe Central Texas Command Center and the Heart of the Resistance.\u201d Alex Jones, America\u2019s foremost purveyor of outlandish conspiracy theories, was in a buoyant mood that day. He\u2019d had Matt Drudge, the influential conservative news aggregator, on recently. But this was much bigger. Trump wasted no time signaling that his mind-set aligned with the host\u2019s. Trump said he wouldn\u2019t apologize for asserting that large numbers of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the collapse of the twin towers in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a claim that fact-checkers have repeatedly refuted. \u201cPeople like you and I can\u2019t do that so easily,\u201d the New York developer, speaking from his office in Trump Tower, said. He would later call Jones \u201ca nice guy.\u201d The December interview would reverberate into the general election as Hillary Clinton tried to use it to paint Trump as an irresponsible crackpot associating with an irresponsible crackpot. It also pushed Jones, who operates the websites Infowars.com and Prisonplanet.com, from the realm of niche showman into the mainstream national dialogue. The man who said that the Newtown, Conn., school shooting was a \u201choax\u201d involving child actors and claimed that elements of the U.S. government were responsible for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building and for the 9/11 attacks had been granted an enormous new audience. \u201cI think Alex Jones may be the single most important voice in the alternative conservative media,\u201d says Roger Stone, the Nixon-era political trickster who orchestrated Trump\u2019s appearance on the show. On Monday, Trump seemed to confirm Jones\u2019s status. Jones says Trump called to promise he would return to the program to thank the Infowars audience, an extraordinary gesture for an incoming president whose schedule is packed with calls from world leaders and the enormous task of overseeing the transition. The president-elect\u2019s team hasn\u2019t confirmed that the conversation took place. Stone, who takes credit for persuading Jones to support Trump, envisions the Web impresario as a potent force during the new administration, a bridge between the presidency and a restless, skeptical slice of the population. \u201cHe\u2019s a valuable asset \u2014 somebody has to rally the people around President Trump\u2019s legislative program,\u201d Stone says. [ Alex Jones celebrates Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP ] Jones, who did not respond to interview requests, got his start hosting a public-access television program in Austin, where he grew up, the son of a dentist. He speaks cryptically about his family, fostering an aura of mystique when he says that his father\u2019s patients included CIA officials who were so important that they had to be guarded while under anesthesia. \u201cI had some family that did some things for the CIA,\u201d he once said. In Austin, a city with a distinct embrace of quirky characters, Jones\u2019s histrionics could sometimes be a source of college-keg-party amusement. He became pals with the Austin-based filmmaker Richard Linklater, who cast him in small roles in the 2001 film \u201c Waking Life \u201d and in \u201c A Scanner Darkly \u201d in 2006. \u201cHe\u2019s really smart. . . . I like the way he thinks,\u201d Linklater said with a smile during a Huffington Post Live interview to promote his 2013 film, \u201c Before Midnight .\u201d But Linklater added that he didn\u2019t share some of his friend\u2019s more controversial views: \u201cI don\u2019t agree 9/11 was an inside job.\u201d On the couch next to Linklater, a shocked look crossed the face of the film\u2019s co-star, Julie Delpy. (Linklater declined to be interviewed for this article.) Jones is a thickly constructed 42-year-old with bright piercing eyes and a retreating hairline. His Facebook bio describes him as \u201cruggedly handsome.\u201d His rhetorical style resembles an avalanche \u2014 of words. He makes assertions with the scantiest of proof, but delivered with utter certainty. His monologues explode with emotion. Some days he appears to be sobbing, holding his face in his hands. Then he\u2019s making deep, guttural growling noises. Then he\u2019s howling. The Internet is thick with video clips labeled \u201cAlex Jones Epic RANT!!\u201d or \u201cAlex Jones unleashed!\u201d or \u201cEpic meltdown.\u201d The more he screams, the more they listen. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s one-upping himself in real time. During one show he went off on Hillary Clinton, calling her \u201ca witch.\u201d But he didn\u2019t stop there. She is \u201cevil,\u201d he said, \u201ca whore of Babylon drunk on the blood of the saints.\u201d He stuck out his tongue and unloosed a menacing yowl. \u201cSo demonic,\u201d he said. Alex Jones speaks during a rally in support near the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS) Jones is also a filmmaker, having produced a stream of long, densely scripted, often thinly supported documentaries with titles such as \u201c Terrorstorm: A History of Government-Sponsored Terrorism ,\u201d \u201c 9/11: The Road to Tyranny ,\u201d and \u201c Fall of the Republic: The Presidency of Barack H. Obama .\u201d In his films, as well as his hours-long radio and Web broadcasts, Jones frequently returns to his core theme of the threat posed by shadowy, malevolent, elite \u201cglobalists\u201d bent on worldwide domination. The United Nations, he claims, intends to release plagues that will kill off 80 percent of the people in the world. The remaining population, he says, will be herded into crowded cities where they will be enslaved by the elite, turning the Earth into a \u201cprison planet.\u201d A smaller population would mean the elite would have less competition for mysterious \u201clife extension technologies.\u201d The recurrent message is that these powerful interests foment insecurity to then foist policy changes on an addled public. Hence, the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, in Jones\u2019s telling, was confected to thrust gun control on America. \u201cSandy Hook is a completely fake, with actors, in my view, manufactured. I couldn\u2019t believe it at first,\u201d Jones said on one program. \u201cI know they had actors there clearly. But I thought they killed some real kids.\u201d Other tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing, he says, were \u201cfalse flags\u201d employing CIA-manipulated dupes who take the blame. The raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound was faked because the terrorist leader was a CIA asset. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was behind the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. It goes on. And on. And on. In the mid-1990s, at the outset of Jones\u2019s career, he was befriended by Ted Anderson, the owner of Midas Resources, a Minnesota gold coins and precious metals firm that sponsored his show. In an interview, Anderson recalls the young Jones as having \u201ca lot of drive. Not a terribly big audience. At that time it was just raw energy. He\u2019s more refined now.\u201d Anderson was the founder of \u201cThe Ron Paul Air Corps,\u201d a group of pilots who flew planes pulling banners promoting the \u201cRon Paul Revolution\u201d during the former congressman\u2019s 2008 presidential run. Paul, who has appeared frequently on Jones\u2019s program, did not respond to an interview request. Now, another Anderson company, Genesis Communications Network , syndicates the Alex Jones program to 129 radio stations, many of them in small markets. It\u2019s difficult to confirm Jones\u2019s audience size, but the host has said he has 5\u00a0million daily radio listeners and recently topped 80\u00a0million video views in a single month. He claims to have a bigger audience than Rush Limbaugh. Jones is able to multiply his audience by simulcasting his radio programming via his website and further spreading its reach on his YouTube channel. The costs are minuscule in comparison to running, say, a cable television network, and it\u2019s conceivable he could be generating millions in profits. One of the engines for his media fiefdom is the sale of Infowars-branded products, including T-shirts and Infowars-branded dietary supplements and cleansers. He touts the company\u2019s detoxifiers, including one made from the green hulls of black walnuts, the bark of a South American tree (the quassia) and the buds of organic cloves. For the survivalists in his audience, he offers a $1,797 \u201cInfowars Life Select\u201d one-year food supply. Jones has always had flair for the dramatic, as he displayed during this year\u2019s Republican National convention when he stormed onto the set of the liberal program, \u201cThe Young Turks,\u201d and got into shoving match with the hosts that looked like it could have come straight out of the erstwhile Jerry Springer show. Alex Jones in Cleveland. (Brian Blanco/EPA) Jones was largely ignored by the mainstream media. But in 2006, he drew substantial attention from cable news programs when the actor Charlie Sheen, then the star of the popular TV show \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d appeared on his show and agreed with Jones that the government might be covering up the true story of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Suddenly, Jones had a perch as a guest on CNN. On the network, he boasted that he had \u201cintel\u201d two months before Sept. 11 that \u201celements of the military industrial complex were going to carry out the attacks. I said they\u2019ll use bin Laden. . . . That is their patsy to take blame for attacking the towers.\u201d The excitement about the Sheen comments would die down, but Jones never relented, returning to the allegations over and over. His claims about \u201cglobalists\u201d were interpreted by some critics as a veiled anti-Semitic code. Jones appeared eager to address the suggestion during a program in which he turned his attention to the Emanuel brothers: Rahm, Zeke and Ari. \u201cThey\u2019re always trying to claim that if I talk about world government and corruption, I\u2019m anti-Semitic,\u201d Jones told his audience. \u201cThe Emanuels are Jewish mafia. It\u2019s not that Jews are bad. It\u2019s just that they are the head of the Jewish mafia in the United States.\u201d Jones\u2019s remarks have put him in the crosshairs of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has labeled him an \u201cextremist.\u201d In an interview, the center\u2019s Heidi Beirich called Jones a \u201cgateway drug for people who end up in harder aspects of the movement,\u201d such as neo-Nazi groups. She pointed to the case of Jerad and Amanda Miller, a couple who died in a shootout after the ambush killing of two police officers and the murder of one civilian in Las Vegas. Citing the pair\u2019s Internet postings, Beirich described the couple as \u201cAlex Jones superfans,\u201d who moved on to other groups and eventually violence. After the shooting, Jones said on his program that \u201cmy gut tells me that the coldblooded, degenerate, evil killing . . . is absolutely staged, ladies and gentlemen. . . . There is so much proof that this was staged that my mind exploded with hundreds of data points, and quite frankly it\u2019s conclusive.\u201d Anderson, Jones\u2019s radio syndicator, doesn\u2019t mind the criticisms of his star host: \u201cAs long as they spell Alex Jones correctly, they can think of him anyway they want,\u201d he says. Jones gained an important ally in 2013 when he met Roger Stone in Dallas. Stone was there to promote a book he\u2019d written suggesting that Lyndon Johnson was behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy. A couple years later, Stone says, a Jones employee reconnected them. \u201cWe really kind of hit it off,\u201d Stone says. \u201cHe\u2019s fearless. A showman. He likes a drink. A cigar. Bawdy stories. Hunting and fishing. He\u2019s a man\u2019s man.\u201d Stone says he had spent nearly three decades trying to figure out how to make Donald Trump president. He thought his new friend, Jones, could help. He particularly liked the idea of Trump appearing on the Jones shows, because \u201cthey are reaching the Trump constituencies,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThey are reaching the people who knock on the doors.\u201d Trump, according to Stone, wasn\u2019t difficult to persuade. The president-elect is \u201can inveterate watcher of television. He has watched Infowars, Stone says. \u201cThey hit it off.\u201d During his wide-ranging interview with Trump in December, Jones hit on themes at the center of the mogul\u2019s candidacy, such as radical Islamists allegedly flooding into the country and a reevaluation of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. \u201cWhy are we starting a fight with Russia when they\u2019re not doing anything to us?\u201d Jones asked. Trump responded that Putin is \u201ctough and he\u2019s smart. He\u2019s a difficult cookie. I will probably get along well with him.\u201d As the campaign progressed, Jones became more and more of a presence. He marketed \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d T-shirts, and they became wildly popular. Stone recalls Trump remarking to him that he liked seeing so many of the shirts in the audience at his rallies. Clinton took notice. In late August, during a stump speech in Reno, Nev., Clinton called out Trump\u2019s attacks on her health as \u201cfever dreams.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs,\u201d Clinton told her audience. She noted that Trump had told the radio host: \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d Jones was now, officially, a campaign issue. Jones, in response, does what Jones does: He went ballistic, blasting Clinton for months. In October, he wondered aloud to his audience, \u201cI\u2019m told there\u2019s a rotten smell around Hillary. . . . Folks, I\u2019ve been told this by high-up folks. Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.\u201d The president took the bait. During a campaign appearance for Clinton, less than a month before the election, Obama said that \u201ca guy on the radio\u201d had been calling him and Clinton \u201cdemons\u201d who \u201csmelled like sulfur.\u201d To illustrate his point, the president sniffed his hand. \u201cI mean, c\u2019mon,\u201d Obama said with a big smile. It all seemed meant to make Jones and Trump look like jokes. But Stone was loving it. \u201cThey\u2019re merely making him bigger,\u201d Stone says, looking back. \u201cThey\u2019re only making him more important. I think it had the reverse effect.\u201d On election night, Stone joined Jones at his friend\u2019s Austin studio. They popped open champagne. Jones had much to celebrate. But he was worried, he told his audience. He\u2019s been warning about it for a long time: Elites will try to assassinate Trump. Jones can feel it in his gut. lifestyle ",

Bernie Sanders laid out his vision for where his progressive wing wants to take the Democratic Party. Here's Sanders' plan. In a conversation with reporters on Nov. 17, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders laid out his vision for where his progressive wing wants to take the Democratic Party. Here's Sanders' plan. Evan Halper Contact Reporter With the Democratic Party lost in the post-election wilderness, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is aggressively reasserting himself, offering his vision for the path out as he takes on a leadership role in his caucus as the chair of outreach.\u00a0 In a wide-ranging conversation Thursday with reporters, Sanders \u2014\u00a0who plans to continue to serve as an independent, not a Democrat \u2014\u00a0offered a preview for where his progressive wing wants to take the Democratic Party. He also had some choice words about President-elect Donald Trump , particularly when the conversation turned to his threat to prosecute Hillary Clinton . \u201cIt would be almost beyond comprehension,\u201d Sanders said at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cThis is the United States of America. We do not prosecute our political opponents and try to throw them in jail. It would completely divide this country. It would be an outrage.\u201d The Sanders plan for a Democratic comeback, though, doesn\u2019t involve battling every Trump initiative. His colleagues, he said, would be better served by picking their fights selectively. Trump co-opted the Democratic agenda with a populist pitch. Here\u2019s where Sanders wants Democrats to go now: Work with Trump on trade Although Sanders finds many of Trump\u2019s campaign promises deeply disturbing,\u00a0he warned that\u00a0Democrats would be foolish to resist an argument at the core of Trump\u2019s economic agenda: that international trade deals should be renegotiated. As other lawmakers bristle at Trump\u2019s vows to tear apart the North American Free Trade Agreement and smack tariffs on American companies that move their factories abroad, Sanders wants to hold Trump to those promises. Doing so, he said, will send a clear signal to the displaced Rust Belt workers who voted for Trump that the Democratic Party can deliver for them. \u00a0 \u201cIt is high time corporate America understands they cannot get the benefits of being American corporations while at the same time turning their backs on the American working class,\u201d Sanders said. This is America's state of mind on election day Open link Though he\u00a0doubts that Trump will crack down on companies as promised, Sanders argued that Democrats should work with him \u201cto tell corporate America you cannot keep running all over the world \u2026 searching for cheap labor while you destroy the working class of this country.\u201d Don\u2019t sugarcoat the Obama years Democrats talk often about how much the economy has improved under President Obama, and Sanders said it\u2019s a fair point considering what a mess the president inherited. But the Vermonter said that the pressing that case overlooks the reality that the middle class is shrinking rapidly. Displaced workers who once earned good livings in now-shuttered factories and mines are only going to be repelled by the argument that everything was bad before and it is good now. \u00a0 \u201cDemocrats too often have ignored that over a 40-year period \u2026 the middle class of this country has been shrinking,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cReal wages for American workers have gone down. Inequality has gone up. Those are real issues, and the Democratic Party has got to address them.\u201d Keep racial justice front and center Hundreds of callers have flooded Sanders\u2019 office phone lines, urging him to keep pressuring for the dismissal of Stephen Bannon, the right-wing media executive and white-nationalist favorite recently named Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist. It\u2019s a reflection, Sanders said, of how far outside the mainstream of American opinion Trump is when he delivers his rants on Mexican immigrants, Muslims and the state of African American communities. \u201cI will not compromise with racism. And I will not compromise with sexism. And I will not compromise\u00a0with homophobia. And I will not compromise with Islamophobia,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThere are areas I would have hoped that in 2016 we would have put behind us.\u201d To that effect, Sanders, the newly minted chairman of outreach\u00a0for the Senate Democratic leadership said Democrats need to redouble their efforts to forge ties with the minority groups that have traditionally supported them but just are not coming out to vote in the numbers Democrats need to win. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to build on the current base,\u201d he said. Hit climate change hard Democrats regularly call climate change an existential crisis,\u00a0yet they hardly discussed it in the general election. Sanders suggested that is a mistake. Now the White House will be inhabited by a president who has labeled climate change a hoax and who wants to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cWe have got to focus much more attention on this,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe future of this planet is at stake. We have got to bring together people to demand Mr. Trump listen to the scientists.\u201d ",

(Del Quentin Wilber) Sending Pence to Capitol Hill served as a reminder of one the reasons Trump chose the even-tempered conservative\u00a0for his team. Not since Dick Cheney has a vice president been expected to play such a leading role in an administration led by a newcomer to Washington. \u201cEspecially with his experience in the House and Senate, the friends he has, the new president not having served\u2026\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to be a different vice presidential role,\u201d said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). Pence attended the morning huddle of House Republicans and later conferred with Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. He also met privately\u00a0with Democratic leaders Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. Pelosi made it clear that House Democrats have \u201cdeep concerns\u201d with the appointment of chief strategist Stephen Bannon, the former Brietbart News chief who has been accused of making anti-Semitic remarks and giving a platform to white nationalists. She asked Pence to urge Trump to reconsider the appointment,\u00a0according to Pelosi\u2019s spokesman. In an apparent gesture of support for Bannon, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer told reporters at Trump Tower on Thursday that Israel looks \"forward to working with the Trump administration, with all of the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, and making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\" He declined to say why he singled out Bannon. Like Republicans on Capitol Hill, Pelosi also seemed to view Pence as a figure in the Trump administration that Democrats could work with more easily. \"You're going to be a very valued player in all of this because you know the territory,\" she told Pence, adding that she meant no \u201cdisrespect for the sensitivity and knowledge of the president-elect\u2026.So in that territory, we will try to find our common ground where we can. And of course, stand our ground when we can't. \" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already invited Pence to join the weekly Republican lunches \u2014 much the way Cheney did \u2014 to provide a conduit between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the administration. Even doubters of the president-elect came away feeling more at ease with Pence\u2019s presence. \u201cHe made it clear that he and the president-elect want to work with all of us, no matter what position we took during the presidential campaign,\u201d said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), an outspoken opponent of Trump. \u201cI\u2019m very encouraged. He\u2019s going to be very engaged \u2014 perhaps in recent history the vice president that will most be engaged in the Congress.\u201d Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

Democrat & Chronicle 7:21 p.m. EST November 17, 2016 x Share New York City Hasidic Jewish residents raised about $25,000 to travel to Perinton to search for religious artifacts that accidentally ended up in the trash. Sarah Taddeo Jewish community members and High Acres employees sort through containers of trash in search of lost Jewish artifacts. (Photo: Provided, Waste Management) ROCHESTER, N.Y. \u2014 The search for two sets of sacred Jewish prayer boxes in a Perinton landfill was called off on Thursday afternoon. At least 20 men from a Jewish community near New York City \u00a0traveled to the area this week to search for the tefillin, which are sacred prayer boxes containing scrolls of Jewish scripture\u00a0worn on the heads of\u00a0observant Jewish men during daily prayers. The tefillin\u00a0accidentally fell into a trash bin at a New York City area synagogue in a moment caught on surveillance video. After contacting various garbage handling agencies between Rochester and New York City, the community found out that the tefillin were most likely in 32 rail containers of garbage that made their way to High Acres Landfill in Perinton, managed by Waste Management. Volunteers traveled to Perinton, donned\u00a0Tyvek suits and searched through 1.2 million pounds of trash before the search was halted. High Acres workers\u00a0helped spread refuse from the containers in thin layers on the ground, while the Jewish community members combed through it with rakes, said Nicole Fornof of Waste Management. But because the tefillin are such\u00a0precious items to the individual who owns them and to\u00a0the community as a whole, community members felt strongly about returning to Rochester to find them as soon as possible, said Rabbi David Niederman of the United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn, who helped coordinate the search. \"The people and the community are so anxious and heartbroken about this, \u200eso they decided to return today to resume the search,\" Niederman said via email Thursday. Jewish community members have raised about $25,000 so far to pay for hotels, suits and travel to assist the effort. Isaac Neuwirth, of Brooklyn, said Jewish community has called off search for two sets of tefillin at High Acres Landfill in Perinton. @DandC pic.twitter.com/mE6WmstU3G \u2014 Will Cleveland (@WillCleveland13) November 17, 2016 A man typically obtains his tefillin around the time of bar mitzah, or age 13, when he begins to pray with the sacred items each day, said Niederman. The tefillin may be bought for him or passed down through a family. The boxes\u00a0contain verses from four chapters of the Torah, the Jewish holy law\u00a0that comprises the first five books of the Bible. While the man who lost his tefillin in the garbage would like his original items back, the bigger issue for the Jewish community is the potential for the scripture scrolls to be soiled in any way, said Niederman. \"I\u2019m so grateful that Waste Management\u00a0is going out of the way to respect the holy scripture and the community trying to search for it,\" said\u00a0Niederman. Calls have been pouring in from churches, hotels and local individuals offering their help, said Jeff Richardson of Waste Management. All callers\u00a0have been directed to contact Niederman and his team. The landfill\u2019s been involved with unusual\u00a0searches like this over the years,\u00a0said Fornof, with businesses, law enforcement or residents searching for items such as lost rings or criminal evidence. 40 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g3ilue ",

John Conyers Jr., D-Michigan, who has been missing since he left his Houston home earlier this week, relatives and investigators told NBC News on Thursday. Conyers, 21, a sophomore at the University of Houston, was last seen Tuesday afternoon by the roommate with whom he shared an apartment, Houston police said. Police said he'd shaved off his beard shortly before he went missing. Carl Conyers was last seen Tuesday in his Houston apartment. Daisha Lewis Daisha Lewis, Conyers' girlfriend, told NBC News that she found a packed bag in Conyers' room, along with his wallet and phone, when she went to see him Tuesday night, but Conyers wasn't there. Lewis said she got a message from Conyers on Wednesday asking her to meet him, but he didn't show up. When she went back to his home later in the day, Conyers' clothes and wallet were missing, Lewis said. The Houston office of the FBI confirmed to NBC News on Thursday that it is assisting Houston police, who described Conyers as 6 feet tall, weighing 145 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair. Shadawn Reddick-Smith, a spokeswoman for John Conyers Jr., the longest-serving member of the U.S. House, told NBC News that the family learned of Carl Conyers' disappearance on Wednesday. The congressman and his family \"ask for privacy as they work through this situation of uncertainty and ask that anyone with knowledge of their son's whereabouts contact the Houston Police Department immediately,\" she said.

(Reuters) What do the Amish lobby , gay wedding vans \u00a0and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they\u2019re all make-believe \u2014 and invented by the same man. Paul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years . He\u00a0has twice convinced the Internet that he\u2019s British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. \u201cSouth Park\u201d lawsuit last year. But in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski , even tweeted links to one of Horner\u2019s faux-articles. His stories have also appeared\u00a0as news on Google. (Paul Horner) In light of concerns that stories like Horner\u2019s may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets , Intersect called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. This transcript has been edited for clarity, length and \u2014 ahem \u2014 bad language. [ The only true winners of this election are trolls ] You\u2019ve been writing fake news for a while now \u2014 you\u2019re kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I\u2019d call it hoaxing or fake news. You\u2019d call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn\u2019t care because they\u2019d already accepted it. It\u2019s real scary. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You mentioned Trump, and you\u2019ve probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don\u2019t fact-check anything \u2014 they\u2019ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist. (Twitter via Mediaite) Why? I mean \u2014 why would you even write that? Just \u2019cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that\u2019s just insane. I\u2019ve gone to Trump protests \u2014 trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. I thought they\u2019d fact-check it, and it\u2019d make them look worse. I mean that\u2019s how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it\u2019s false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters \u2014 they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he\u2019s in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels [bad]. You think you personally helped elect Trump? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I did or not. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) I guess I\u2019m curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election \u2014 especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs \u2014 why didn\u2019t you stop? Why keep writing? I didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn\u2019t messing them up as much as I wanted \u2014 but I never thought he\u2019d actually get elected. I didn\u2019t even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should\u2019ve seen this coming \u2014 everyone assumed Hillary [Clinton] would just get in. But she didn\u2019t, and Trump is president. Speaking of Clinton\u00a0\u2014 did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson\u2019s, for that matter? (Horner\u2019s Facebook picture shows him\u00a0at a rally for Johnson.)\u00a0 No. I hate Trump. Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that \u201cno joke . . . in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it\u2019s the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans.\u201d That makes it sound like you\u2019ve found targeting conservatives is more profitable. Yeah, it is. They don\u2019t fact-check. But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? It\u2019s great for anybody who does anything with satire \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t write about now that people won\u2019t believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff \u2014 like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line \u2014 and people went along with it! Facebook and Google recently announced that they\u2019d no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense \u2014 like, you wouldn\u2019t believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense. [ Google\u2019s top news link for \u2018final election results\u2019 goes to a fake news site with false numbers ] I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I\u2019ll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I\u2019d be okay. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from [advertising on fake news sites] for them to just get rid of it. They\u2019d lose a lot of money. But if it did really go away, that would suck. I don\u2019t know what I would do. Thinking about this less selfishly, though \u2014 it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you\u2019re describing are pretty scary. Yeah, I mean \u2014 a lot of the sites people are talking about, they\u2019re just total BS sites. There\u2019s no creativity or purpose behind them. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting rid of them. I don\u2019t like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do \u2014 I spend more time on it. There\u2019s purpose and meaning behind it. I don\u2019t just write fake news just to write it. So, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they\u2019re listing, and I\u2019m like \u2014 good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don\u2019t get rid of mine, too. 1 of 8 ",

An unidentified Chicago Public Schools employee distributed confidential student information to the Noble Network of Charter Schools for use in a mail advertising campaign. (Anthony Souffle, Chicago Tribune) Juan Perez Jr. Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago Public Schools has notified the families of about 30,000 students that a district employee improperly distributed confidential student information to a charter school operator for use in a mail advertising campaign. The Chicago Board of Education had received complaints from parents who had received unsolicited postcards from the Noble Network of Charter Schools. Noble officials acknowledged the situation last month, saying an internal probe concluded one of its employees \"was provided with improperly sourced student and family names and addresses\" by an unnamed CPS employee. That information was used when Noble mailed postcards to families. Noble officials said the list of student information was removed from databases and computers accessible to the network's employees, and employees who were involved with the data breach were disciplined. In a letter to district families this week, a senior CPS technology official said the breach was \"a clear violation\" of district policy. The information included students' names, addresses, grade levels and their current elementary schools, the letter said. \"CPS is deeply troubled by any violation of students' privacy,\" district spokesman Michael Passman said in a statement Thursday. \"Upon learning of the origin of this breach, CPS immediately shut down the employee's access to student data systems and began the process of notifying families whose directory information was breached,\" Passman said. According to the CPS spokesman, tens of thousands of notices were \"sent out of an abundance of caution to all students whose information could have potentially been provided based on our current knowledge of the situation.\" The district said it is reviewing its security procedures and is in the process of moving to a new student information system. CPS said it contacted the school system's inspector general, who is investigating the breach. ",

Fadel Senna /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Fadel Senna /AFP/Getty Images A man walks past the logo of the COP22 international climate conference on Nov. 9 in Marrakech, Morocco. Fadel Senna /AFP/Getty Images Hundreds of businesses such as Starbucks, General Mills and Hewlett Packard are asking President-elect Donald Trump to follow through on U.S. commitments to combat climate change. They argue it's good for business. More than 360 companies and investors made their plea in an open letter to Trump, President Obama and members of Congress. They called on Trump to \"continue U.S. participation in the Paris agreement,\" which he has threatened to scrap, and invest in the \"low carbon economy at home and abroad.\" The signatories also include DuPont, eBay, Nike, Unilever, Levi Strauss & Co. and Hilton. They issued the letter Wednesday during a major U.N. climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco, where representatives of nearly 200 countries were gathered to hash out the details of the Paris climate deal. Trump Has A Chance To Pull U.S. Out Of Climate Accord As members of the U.S. business and investor community, they emphasized their \"deep commitment to addressing climate change\" and pledged to do their part, \"in our operations and beyond,\" to meet the goals of the agreement to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. \"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost US competitiveness,\" the letter states. \"Implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all.\" The U.S. commitments to the Paris accord are voluntary, as NPR's Christopher Joyce has reported . He added that experts are concerned that the U.S. could walk away from the deal and gut Obama's domestic climate change strategy. This could also discourage other countries from working to lower their own emissions. Article continues after sponsorship Climate Conference Aims To Put Paris Agreement Into Action \"The new administration has created a huge amount of uncertainty, and that's bad for business,\" MIT management professor John Sterman told Marketplace . \"So staying the course on the U.S. commitments to reduce emissions, to follow through on our Paris commitment is essential to lower that uncertainty, give businesses the confidence to develop and implement strategies that are going to build advantage, lower risk, and lower their costs.\" Trump has previously labeled climate change a hoax. In 2012, he tweeted that it was a concept \"created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 As NPR has reported , Trump has appointed Myron Ebell to lead the Environmental Protection Agency transition team. Ebell \"directs environmental and energy policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and is a leading climate change skeptic. He opposes the Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions, calling it illegal. He heads a group called the 'Cooler Heads Coalition' that questions 'global warming alarmism.' \" The letter's overall message suggests that in the business community, environmental groups might have what would seem to be an unlikely ally. \"Environmental groups have been left with the daunting prospect that, with a climate skeptic in the White House, they will need to look directly to corporations to assume the mantle of leading the country's response to climate change,\" as The New York Times reported . \"But without strict regulatory standards or oversight, companies will be left freer to pick and choose which climate-friendly policies to pursue, and which they will choose to ignore or abandon.\" ",

    "text": "Barack Obama is on his final trip to Europe as president before handing over the White House to President-elect Donald Trump They wrote that both the U.S. and Germany work hard to ensure international law and norms are respected around the world and they underscored their commitments to NATO. \u201cOur countries are committed to collective defense within the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) because we want to preserve the security of the Euro-Atlantic area as a whole,\u201d they wrote. During the presidential campaign, Trump suggested that European nations must take a more active role in NATO without the U.S. After meeting with the president-elect last week, however, Mr. Obama said Tuesday that Trump is committed to NATO. In the op-ed, Mr. Obama and Merkel said that both the U.S. and Germany should cooperate on fighting terrorist threats, like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In what seemed to be a rebuke of Trump, they said their efforts to provide humanitarian relief and aid for millions of refugees is crucial \u201cbecause we know it is our treatment of those most vulnerable that determines the true strength of our values.\u201d They also credited their partnership with helping to produce the Paris agreement to respond to climate change. They added that economic relations between their two countries are \u201cflourishing\u201d but that they must keep working together. \u201cSimply put: we are stronger when we work together,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAt a time when the global economy is evolving more quickly than at any point in human history, and the scope of global challenges has never had higher stakes, such cooperation is now more urgent than ever.\u201d During his presidential campaign, Trump was critical of the German leader\u2019s decision to open Germany\u2019s borders to let in hundreds of thousands of refugees. Over the summer he said, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be America\u2019s Angela Merkel, and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany.\u201d But in September, he praised the German leader and said he admires her . \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Email After Jon Stewart left \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d last summer, much of the presidential campaign went on without his unique and satirical point of view. He spoke with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Charlie Rose Wednesday to discuss his new book about the more than 16 years he spent at the Comedy Central program, but he was also quick to give his post-election analysis. \u201cWe just went through an election,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWhat?\u201d Stewart joked, laughing. \u201cYes. Your reaction to this election? Surprise?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cIn surprise\u2026 I mean it,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cFear?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cIt all ties together... Here\u2019s what I would honestly say. I don\u2019t believe we are a fundamentally different country today than we were two weeks ago,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe same country with all its grace and flaws, and volatility, and insecurity, and strength, and resilience exists today as existed two weeks ago. The same country that elected Donald Trump elected Barack Obama. I feel badly for the people for whom this election will mean more uncertainty and insecurity. But I also feel like this fight has never been easy. And the ultimate irony of this election is the cynical strategy of the Republicans, which is: \u2018Our position as government doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019re going to make sure\u2026 that it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d \u201cDraining the swamp,\u201d Rose said.\u00a0 \u201cBut they\u2019re not draining the swamp. McConnell and Ryan, those guys are the swamp. And what they decided to do was, \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure government doesn\u2019t work and then I\u2019m going to use its lack of working as evidence of it,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cDonald Trump is a reaction not just to Democrats, to Republicans.\u201d Stewart said Donald Trump is \u201cnot a Republican,\u201d but a \u201crepudiation of Republicans.\u201d \u201cBut they will reap the benefit of his victory, in all of their cynicism and all of their -- I will guarantee you Republicans are going to come to Jesus now about the power of government,\u201d Stewart said. What struck him most about this election, Stewart said, was that no one challenged Trump\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cMake America great again.\u201d \u201cHe wants to make America great again\u2026 But nobody said to him, \u2018Well, what is it that makes America great?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWhat is it you want to do that we\u2019re not doing now?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cWhat are the metrics? Because it seems like from listening to him, the metrics are that it\u2019s a competition. And I think what many would say is what makes us great is -- America is an anomaly in the world,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cNobody -- there are a lot of people, and I think\u2026 his candidacy has animated that thought -- that a multi-ethnic democracy, a multicultural democracy is impossible. And that is what America by its founding, and constitutionally is -- unlike every other state.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s becoming more and more,\u201d Rose added. \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cYear by year,\u201d Rose said. \u201cCorrect,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut do you think, it\u2019s healthy that we have this now, that in fact this battle, this real sense of finding out\u2026 who we are?\u201d Rose asked. \u201cYes, but I also don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Stewart began before Rose added to his question, \u201cAnd whether we have gone off track in some way?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. You know... I would rather have this conversation openly and honestly than in dog whistles. You know, somebody was saying there might be an anti-Semite that\u2019s working the White House.\u201d And I was like, \u2018Have you listened to the Nixon tapes?\u2019\u201d Stewart said, laughing. \u201cLike, forget about advising the president, the president. Like, have you read LBJ? Do you know our history?\u201d Stewart added that we must \u201ccaution ourselves to the complexity of that history.\u201d \u201cI thought Donald Trump disqualified himself at numerous points. But there is now this idea that anyone who voted for him is -- has to be defined by the worst of his rhetoric,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cLike, there are guys in my neighborhood that I love, that I respect, that I think have incredible qualities who are not afraid of Mexicans, and not afraid of Muslims, and not afraid of blacks. They\u2019re afraid of their insurance premiums. In the liberal community, you hate this idea of creating people as a monolith. Don\u2019t look as Muslims as a monolith. They are the individuals and it would be ignorance. But everybody who voted for Trump is a monolith, is a racist. That hypocrisy is also real in our country.\u201d Stewart said America wages a fight \u201cagainst ourselves\u201d because it is not \u201cnatural.\u201d \u201cNatural is tribal. We\u2019re fighting against thousands of years of human behavior and history to create something that no one\u2019s ever-- that\u2019s what\u2019s exceptional about America and that\u2019s what\u2019s, like, this ain\u2019t easy,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible thing.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Nov. 17, 2016. (WGN-TV) Tom Balanoff,\u00a0president of SEIU Local 1, speaks at a press conference at the union's headquarters. Nov. 17, 2016. (WGN-TV) Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Workers at O'Hare International Airport are threatening to strike during the busy Thanksgiving travel week to draw attention to their fight for a $15 hourly wage and what they feel are shoddy working conditions. Airplane cabin cleaners, baggage handlers, janitors and wheelchair attendants, who are not in a union but are being organized by Service Employees International Union Local 1, took a strike vote over the past two days. Of the 500 votes cast, all but one were in favor of the strike, said union spokeswoman Izabela Miltko-Ivkovich. There are 2,000 workers in those positions at O'Hare, she said. Details of the potential strike were few, but union officials said they expect \"hundreds\" of workers to participate and that they expect a strike to happen \"in the coming days.\" Tom Balanoff , president of SEIU Local 1, said the workers, who plan to picket outside the airport and walk through the terminals, don't expect to shut down the airport, though \"it will cause some disruption, no doubt.\" \"Workers are really frustrated because they've been fighting and they've been trying to get the powers to be to hear their voice,\" Balanoff said. \"So they're hoping that with this strike, the powers that be \u2014 the city, the Department of Aviation, American, United and other airlines \u2014 that they'll listen and come to a rational way so that these workers have the right to be recognized, and they have a right to bargain over their working conditions.\" The striking workers are employees of subcontractors hired by the airlines to clean planes and airports, haul bags and transport people with disabilities. The subcontractors named by the union as employers of the workers \u2014 Scrub, Prospect Airport Services and AirServ \u2014 either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Kisha Rivera John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune Kisha Rivera, an airplane cabin cleaner, is among the group of airport workers based at O'Hare International Airport who have agreed to strike.

Rivera is photographed Nov. 17, 2016, at the Service Employees International Union office in Chicago. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Organizers expect this strike to be larger than the last O'Hare worker strike in March, when they estimated nearly 100 workers walked off the job or didn't show up for shifts. Airport officials said at the time that there was no disruption to operations. The Thanksgiving travel period is among the busiest of the year, and last year some 1.5 million passengers were expected to travel through O'Hare during the eight days around the holiday, up 6 percent from 2014, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. Estimates for this year have not been released. United spokesman Luke Punzenberger said his company is working with its vendor partners to ensure travelers don't notice a difference. \"We're taking all the necessary steps to ensure a safe and on-time operation for our customers,\" Punzenberger said. In a statement, the Chicago Department of Aviation said it does not anticipate any disruption at the airport and encourages passengers to contact airlines for information regarding specific flights. The agency also said it \"held discussions with the airlines and legislators to ensure service delivery at the airports puts customers first\" and \"expects every contractor to follow the law, and will aid the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) and the Illinois Department of Labor to take whatever action is necessary.\" The strike vote was meant to show consensus for a large-scale walkout, but was not a formal step like the votes legally required of unionized workers in official bargaining units, Miltko-Ivkovich said. It will be the first strike for Kisha Rivera, 41, a mother of four who lives in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood and earns $10.50 an hour working full-time as a cabin cleaner for Scrub. Rivera moved to Chicago this year from Puerto Rico, where she had been working as a cook for $7.25 an hour, in hopes of finding better pay and opportunity. \"But once you're here you realize how expensive it is to live here,\" said Rivera, whose paycheck has to cover her two younger daughters, aged 16 and 19, as well as herself. She doesn't get health benefits or paid sick days and relies on public assistance through Illinois' Link program. Beyond the pay, Rivera is concerned she is inadequately trained and equipped to do her job. She said she has never been taught how to clean vomit, blood and other bodily fluids she routinely finds on planes and is not given proper cleaning supplies for those substances. Cabin cleaners, working in teams of four, typically are given only seven minutes to clean a plane, which Rivera says is not enough time given the cracker crumbs and spilled drinks they find caked in the carpet. \"I don't know what is wrong with passengers nowadays,\" Rivera said of the conditions she finds on planes. The airport workers were joined at a press conference Thursday by several aldermen as well as fast-food workers who have been at the forefront of the Fight for $15 campaign. Ald. Ameya Pawar, 47th, said the workers were asking for \"basic dignities ... afforded to most workers outside of the service industries\" and that other cities are working with airlines to ensure workers \"get their fair share.\" \"Here in Chicago, it seems like we are never on the leading edge of progressive policies that protect workers, we're always lagging,\" Pawar told the cameras. \"My ask of the airlines is that it's no longer enough to say, 'It's not our problem, it's our contractors' problem.' And it's no longer enough that the city, the airport, all of us that are elected, to say, 'Let's let the airlines figure this out and let's hope for the best.'\" The union alleges several airport workers have been fired as a result of their organizing activities. Marcie Barnett, 62, who worked as a security officer with Universal Security for two years, was let go in April after she made comments to the media that her employer said revealed sensitive security information. She continues to advocate for higher pay for her former colleagues, saying, \"Anything less than $15 is an insult.\" Barnett, who lives in the South Shore neighborhood, said she had been receiving unemployment until it was exhausted last week. She has been applying for security jobs but nothing has come through yet. She drove for Uber for a while but got nervous because \"you never know who will get in the car.\" \"I don't know what I'm going to do now,\" Barnett said. \"I have to do something quickly.\" ",

Melissa Kurtz, 48, was driving her daughter Harper to a beauty pageant when the 13-year-old became bored and started taking snaps of herself. However the mum-of-two claims she later spotted the ghostly face of a young boy lurking behind Harper \u00a0\u2013 despite insisting there was one else in the car with them. Researching the stretch of road they were travelling on, Melissa discovered that the spooky selfie coincided with the anniversary of a deadly road accident which she thinks could have involved the same little lad. 'GHOST SHIP' VIDEO GOES VIRAL Multiple paranormal investigators analysed the image with\u00a0one claiming the ghost\u2019s hand appeared to be reaching for Harper. But Melissa says she was not scared by the suspected haunting as she claims Harper is a magnet for paranormal activity. Related Image Expand / Contract PIC FROM MERCURY PRESS (Image license supplied to Caters from source) Melissa, from Florida, said: \u201cWhere the picture was taken there was an automobile accident one year ago exactly. When I looked into it, someone had been medevacked away in a helicopter. \u201cHowever they would not tell me any specific details when I enquired, which leads me to believe that it was a child, as that might be why they couldn\u2019t provide the information. NEW MEXICO POLICE CATCH A 'GHOST' ON CAMERA \u201cI didn\u2019t notice it until about a month later when I was going through my camera when taking pictures for something else. \u201cIt was a real \u2018Oh my god\u2019 moment. I was really shocked by it, incredibly shocked. I ran into the other room and said to friends who were staying with me \u2018you have to see this\u2019. Everyone was awestruck. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to the world to see that picture because I know it\u2019s genuine and real and we were the only two in the car. \u201cSo many people have hope for the afterlife and this proves it \u2013 to me anyway. People [who have seen it] have taken comfort in that. \u201cHarper didn\u2019t have her seatbelt on and one of the investigators who analysed the photo called Greg Pocha thought [the ghost] could be trying to warn her. \u201c[Her seatbelt] is something I yell at her about all the time. I\u2019ve had 13 traffic tickets in two years due to her not wearing one.

Melissa was so shocked by the image she submitted it to Greg Pocha, who is director of parapsychology, afterlife and paranormal studies at Eidolon Project Canada. He claims that using an image analysis program, also used by the FBI and CIA, shows the boy has no colour or 'temperature' in the picture, which he says adds 'to the possibility that the photo may be authentic as a ghost photo'.

    "text": "WATCH Fed Chair Defends Dodd-Frank Act, Pledges to Serve Full Term 0 Shares Email In an appearance before a top congressional economic committee today, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen defended the Dodd-Frank Act and pledged to serve out her term despite criticism from Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. The Dodd-Frank Act was passed into law in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis and is believed to be an early target for modification or repeal by the incoming Trump administration, with the transition website pledging to \u201cdismantle\u201d the legislation, which proposed sweeping changes to the regulation of the financial industry. Asked about the act, Yellen, the United States\u2019 top monetary official, who is notoriously careful with her words, said that she \u201ccertainly would not want to see all the improvements that we have put in place -- I would not want to see the clock turned back on those, because I do think they\u2019re important in diminishing the odds of another financial crisis.\u201d \"We lived through a devastating financial crisis. And a high priority, I think, for all Americans should be that we want to see put in place safeguards through supervision and regulation that result in a safer and sounder financial system,\" she said. At various points during the campaign, Trump took aim at Yellen and her actions while at the top of the Federal Reserve. In September, Trump told CNBC that the chairwoman was keeping interest rates low in an effort to boost the stock market and burnish the appearance of Obama\u2019s economic record. The interest rate is \"staying at zero because she's obviously political and she's doing what Obama wants her to do,\" Trump said in the Sept. 13 interview with CNBC. In response, while not mentioning Trump by name, Yellen told a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting that, \u201cI can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\" Despite the public war of words, Yellen pledged today to serve out the rest of her term. \u201cI was confirmed by the Senate to a four-year term, which ends at the end of January of 2018, and it is fully my intention to serve out that term,\u201d she said when asked by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D-N.Y., whether she envisioned \u201cany circumstances\u201d where she would not serve out her term. But what if President-elect Trump and Yellen don\u2019t get along? Could Trump tell her, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d when he takes office? No. Once appointed, Federal Reserve Board Governors \u201cmay not be removed from office for their policy views,\u201d according to the institution\u2019s website. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Nov 17 2016, 3:34 pm ET How a Rarely Used Law Could Help GOP Dial Back Obama Administration Regulations by Alex Moe advertisement House Republicans are preparing to undo dozens of regulations enacted by the Obama administration over the past several months \u2014 potentially ranging from overtime pay to paid sick leave \u2014 with the help of a rarely used law. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is currently working with the committee chairmen to determine all the regulations that could be rolled back under the Congressional Review Act. The measure, passed in 1996, gives Congress the power to override, and retroactively negate, regulations enacted by federal agencies within the previous 60 legislative days. Related: How Trump Could Erase Key Parts of Obama's Legacy Republican House members discussed using this law during a closed-door conference meeting Thursday morning with former congressman and Vice President-Elect Mike Pence. The president would need to sign to sign off, which President-Elect Donald Trump has signaled he would quickly do after he takes office on January 20, 2017. Mike Pence and other Republicans gather for a selfie. @HouseGOP Lawmakers would like to \"chop off the last week of the current congressional schedule so we break December 8th or 9th,\" Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, told reporters on Thursday. Congressional aides say House GOP leadership is eyeing those dates so lawmakers can undo President Obama's May 18 rule expanding the number of people who qualify for overtime pay. Other regulations that could be impacted deal with environmental issues and student debt. Republicans in the Senate would also be on board with rolling back as many regulations as possible. \"We love CRA. It's a great way for Congress to have oversight over the administration,\" a Senate leadership aide told NBC News. But a House Democratic leadership aide tells NBC News: \"Democrats will strongly oppose the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo Obama administration regulations that protect workers, our environment, and address a range of critical issues.\" Related: Where Trump Could Make Major Policy Shifts \u2014 Even Without Congress Because of the long congressional breaks during 2016, regulations implemented by Obama from as far back as May could be rolled back , according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service . President Barack Obama has vetoed five attempts by Republicans to use the Congressional Review Act against his regulations during this congressional session alone. There has only been one regulation overturned in the past 20 years using the Congressional Review Act \u2014 a 2000 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule related to workplace ergonomics standards. Congress can adjourn as soon as they vote on funding the government. Money currently runs out December 9. Leadership decided after hearing from the incoming Trump administration to push ahead with another short-term continuing resolution which would stretch funding to March 31, 2017. \"I think the new incoming government would like to have a say so on how spending is to be allocated in 2017,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, also called the move \"a deference to the Trump administration\" and expressed optimism that Republicans would have the votes to push through the bill before the deadline.

But like it or not, President Barack Obama has become an unofficial ambassador of sorts for President-Elect Donald Trump . Over the course of his final foreign trip as president, Obama has had the task of reassuring a worried Europe about one thing: NATO isn\u2019t going anywhere. Throughout the week, Obama has spoken at nearly every opportunity about the United States\u2019 \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to the alliance as one that transcends politics. \u201cNATO, the world\u2019s greatest alliance, is as strong and as ready as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Obama said in an address to the Greek people Wednesday. \u201cAnd I am confident that just as America\u2019s commitment to the transatlantic alliance has endured for seven decades -- whether it\u2019s been under a Democratic or Republican administration -- that commitment will continue, including our pledge and our treaty obligation to defend every ally.\u201d It\u2019s a point he\u2019s made like a broken record, first in Greece and now in Germany, where he remains until heading to the APEC Summit in Peru this weekend. And he\u2019s making sure everyone in Europe hears that the president-elect specifically offered him assurances that the strength of the U.S.'s commitment will remain unchanged under a Trump administration, though it's unclear what assurances Trump did, in fact, offer the current commander-in-chief in their Oval Office meeting following the election last week, if any. \u201cI am encouraged by the president-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change, and his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for international security, I think is very important,\u201d the president said during a joint press conference today with German Chancellor Angela Merkel . During the campaign, Trump criticized NATO as \u201cobsolete\u201d and suggested a Trump administration wouldn\u2019t automatically rush to the defense of a NATO member from a hypothetical Russian attack if that member hadn\u2019t lived up to its financial obligations under the alliance. But in the final weeks before election, Trump struck a very different note on NATO -- expressing commitment to the alliance and even arguing that it would be bolstered on his watch. \"When I am president, we will strengthen NATO,\" Trump said during a speech in late September. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump 'Absolutely' Open to Naming Former Rivals, Opponents to Cabinet, Adviser Says By ALANA ABRAMSON Nov 17, 2016, 8:17 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump Meets With Former Enemies in Bid to Fill Cabinet Posts 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump is \"absolutely\" open to selecting former rivals -- some of whom he branded as liars and not smart -- to serve in top posts in his cabinet, his transition team Communications Director Jason Miller said. Trump, who is known for prizing loyalty, surrounds himself with a small, tight-knit group of advisers. However, people who opposed him during the campaign season, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , are now reportedly contenders for secretary of state. \"I think the president-elect is going to select the people that he thinks will do the best job. That's what I've been most impressed about following the election, acknowledging the gravity of the job in front of him and the challenges our country faces and he wants to get the best people in there,\" Miller said on the ABC News' \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast. \"I think that's something people have a lot of respect for...when he said 'Hey, these guys may have been political rivals, maybe we've butted heads before, but you know what, now we're on the same team and we got to go and lead the country,'\" Miller added. Trump has been holding meetings with various figures since he became president-elect, including Haley, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , and former Texas Sen. (and former rival) Ted Cruz . He is expected to meet with Romney this weekend. Haley drew Trump's ire during the campaign when she blasted him in February for not immediately disavowing the support of KKK former grand wizard David Duke. Trump, who later disavowed, tweeted: The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2016 Cruz and Trump had numerous public battles, with Trump repeatedly calling him \"Lyin' Ted.\" \"This man is a pathological liar,\" Cruz said of Trump in May. \"He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.\" Trump also took his shot at Cruz during an interview with ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"As far as Ted Cruz, he's one of the greatest liars and biggest liars I've ever known. He lies about so much,\" he said. \"He lies about things that he shouldn't be lying about. He lies about things that don't matter.\u201d Romney called Trump \"a phony\" and \"a fraud\" whose \"promises were as worthless as a degree from Trump University ,\" referring to the now-shuttered Trump enterprise that is the subject of litigation. \"His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill,\" he said in March. Later that month, Trump said: \"I don't think Mitt Romney is a smart person. I never have thought he was a smart person.\" He also questioned Romney's faith. Miller called Trump's upcoming meeting with Romney \"a great opportunity.\" \"I think it's a great opportunity to learn from someone who's been very successful in business himself and who's seen the world stage,\" Miller said. \"Governor Romney definitely has some good ideas to share.\" Although Trump has only appointed Reince Preibus as chief of staff and Steve Bannon as chief strategist, Miller said other announcements could come \"pretty quickly.\" \"I think the president-elect is very close to knowing who he wants to go with,\" he said, \"When the president-elect feels he got it right he will be the one making the decision and we will take it from there.\" When asked if Trump would enter office with a fully formed cabinet, Miller responded, \"I think he's gonna get it right.\" Miller also addressed reports that the Trump children, who are expected to take over the family businesses from their father when he is sworn in, will have official roles in the White House, calling them \"overblown.\" \"They are a support structure,\" Miller explained. \"Obviously they're gonna be available if he calls.\" 0 Shares ",

Alex Wong/Getty Images Saying that \"it felt really good\" to step down, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, 75, says he has submitted his letter of resignation. Clapper revealed the news as he testified Thursday before the House Select Committee on Intelligence. YouTube Clapper's resignation \"was expected and does not today appear to indicate that Clapper is in any trouble or is being forced out,\" NPR National Security Editor Philip Ewing says. Clapper has told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly that he keeps a calendar counting down the days until he is out of government service. Clapper has nearly two months left in his term; he was sworn in as director of national intelligence in August 2010. \"Everybody needs to take a deep breath,\" a DNI spokesperson tells NPR. \"Clapper is resigning effective Jan. 20. He will finish out his term.\" Following a military career that ended with his retirement as an Air Force lieutenant general and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Clapper initially retired from service in 1995. He was drawn back into government following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, working for a range of defense and intelligence agencies before becoming the director of national intelligence.

(Photo: Steven Senne, AP) 10747 CONNECT TWEET 28 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON - Long-term U.S. mortgage rates climbed this week, reflecting deep declines in U.S. government bond prices in the days after Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 3.94% from 3.57% last week. That put the benchmark rate close to its year-ago level of 3.97%. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, advanced to 3.14% from 2.88%. The rate rise was powered by a sustained decline in U.S. government bond prices in the days after Trump\u2019s victory became known early Nov. 9. Bond investors looked toward tax cuts and beefed-up spending on infrastructure under a Trump administration, which could fuel inflation and erode Treasury bond prices. The selling wave dubbed the \u201cTrump Dump\u201d lifted bond yields, which move opposite to prices and influence long-term mortgage rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond jumped to 2.06% \u00a0last Wednesday from 1.87% on Election Day Tuesday. Thursday it rose to 2.28%. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, citing an improving economy, said again Thursday that the Fed is more likely to raise interest rates soon. Yellen: Trump plan may stoke inflation, debt To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesn\u2019t include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from last week at 0.5 point. The fee for a 15-year loan also held steady at 0.5 point. Rates on adjustable five-year mortgages averaged 3.07%, up sharply from 2.88% last week. The fee remained at 0.4 point ",

By Ariana Eunjung Cha and Amy Goldstein November 17 at 10:00 AM Follow @arianaeunjung Follow @goldsteinamy Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) While it's\u00a0pretty much a given that the Affordable Care Act won't survive a\u00a0Trump presidency and Republican Congress in its current form, there are sweeping implications of reversing\u00a0a law\u00a0that has reached in so many ways\u00a0into our health care system. The government has never undone a major benefits program after it has taken effect \u2014 and neither the incoming administration nor GOP lawmakers know exactly how they'll replace it. If your head is spinning because of the politics and lingo that's being thrown around, here's a primer on what we know about the president-elect's plans so far and what they might mean for the ACA marketplaces and for you personally. Let's start at the beginning. What did Donald Trump promise on the campaign trail? As a candidate,\u00a0Trump released a plan, \u201cHealthcare Reform to Make America Great Again,\u201d which\u00a0called for\u00a0a full repeal of Obama's signature domestic achievement\u00a0on \u201cday one\u201d of the new administration.\u00a0You can read the original text here . He later said he would call Congress into special session to repeal the law. Now that he has been elected president, Trump's\u00a0timeline is unclear. Most of what he wants to do requires\u00a0an act of Congress. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say that ending the ACA is a priority for them, too. But lawmakers' aides have not yet begun to compare notes with the president-elect and his transition team on substance or strategy. What has he said on the subject since the election? Last week Trump created a stir by saying he might \u201camend\u201d the ACA instead of repealing and replacing it. But his views on the substance of the law didn't change. As he'd said during his campaign, he mentioned keeping the provision that forbids insurers to deny coverage to people with preexisting medical problems. He also said he'd like to continue letting young adults stay on their parents' insurance policies until they are 26\u00a0\u2014 an idea that has been part of House Republicans' health-care plan. (Excerpt from The Wall Street Journal interview with President-elect Donald Trump.) On Sunday, Trump talked about the ACA during\u00a0 an interview\u00a0on CBS's \"60 Minutes\u201d with\u00a0reporter Lesley Stahl. Repealing and replacing the law would be done \u201csimultaneously,\u201d he explained, so that people would not face a limbo period with no insurance. \u201cIt\u2019ll be better health care, much better, for less money,\u201d he promised. \u201cNot a bad combination.\u201d Trump has revised other health-care positions to\u00a0conform more closely to the heart of Republican thinking in recent decades. On his\u00a0presidential transition site, GreatAgain.gov , he has added antiabortion statements and several policy positions that were not part of his campaign\u2019s platform as well as deleted a few proposals. A\u00a0 Washington Post story that ran several days after the election detailed some of the changes. If Congress and the Trump White House repeal the ACA, how soon would my marketplace health plan go away? It's hard to know, but there are some clues.\u00a0Early this year, when lawmakers sent Obama an ACA-repeal bill, which they knew he wouldn't sign, they included in the legislation a two-year period before the marketplaces and other parts of the law ceased. Right now, the fourth year's open enrollment for marketplace health plans is underway. The plans that consumers can buy until Jan. 31 have pledged to participate through 2017. More than eight in 10 ACA customers receive federal subsidies to help pay for their premiums, and it is unlikely that those will\u00a0go away as soon as Trump takes office. According to the Health and Human Services Department, just over 1 million people chose ACA health plans during the first 12 days of this month, about 50,000 more than the same period a year ago. That puts enrollment roughly on pace to match the 1.6 million who signed up during the first three weeks of the last enrollment period. HHS officials said that sign-ups increased during the three days after the election. I have a 23-year-old son without a full-time job. Will he lose his coverage through my insurance plan? This is unclear \u2014 but might not change. After the election, Trump began to say that he likes the ACA provision that lets\u00a0young adults stay on\u00a0their parents' policy until they are 26. House Republicans support this idea, too. I'm being bombarded with messages on social media urging me to get an IUD before coverage for birth control disappears. How seriously should I take this?\u00a0Will I lose really lose that\u00a0benefit? I have truly never been more shocked in my life. Hug your friends a little tighter, promise to protect each other, & everyone go get an IUD \u2014 Rachel Varina (@rachelvarina) November 9, 2016 In the 24 to 48 hours following the election, it was hard to ignore panic about birth control. Cosmo magazine reported that \u201cWomen Are Urging Each Other to Get IUDs Now \u2014 Before It's Too Late,\u201d and Quartz warned that \u201ca Trump presidency will threaten women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d Many commentators raised the idea of women getting an IUD, a intrauterine device type of birth control that is reversible but long-lasting, noting that it could get them through an entire presidential\u00a0term. For the past six years under the ACA, women have had access to free birth control through their insurance plans because of a provision requiring coverage for preventive health benefits. Trump hasn't addressed this issue,\u00a0but fears have been stoked because he became more clearly opposed to abortion as the campaign went on. And Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a strong social conservative who opposes abortion in almost all circumstances. Technically speaking, Trump might not even have to rely on\u00a0Congress to get rid of these benefits. HHS\u00a0could redefine what types of services must be included among the\u00a0preventive care the law requires insurers to\u00a0provide. For more details on this, check out Vox 's explainer. That's not very reassuring. What\u00a0about coverage for other benefits we have now? Should I stock up on the medicine I have to take regularly for diabetes, arthritis or other chronic diseases or conditions? Feeling anxious about the upcoming changes is understandable because they will likely be pretty big. But doctors recommend against\u00a0hoarding prescription drugs. Even if the law or federal rules change, it may take a little time to figure out exactly what has happened.\u00a0When the ACA was passed, patient groups months combed through the documentation for months before figuring out that HIV drugs, for example, weren't covered adequately in some cases. Marketplace guide Jim Prim works on Healthcare.gov as he helps a Delaware resident sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2014. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Will the ACA insurance exchanges go away? If so, where would people who don\u2019t get insurance through an employer obtain coverage?\u00a0 Trump has not provided a lot of details. Again, Congress's last attempt to repeal the ACA would have had a two-year transition period. And remember, for all the attention they get, marketplace health plans are covering about 11 million people \u2014 a small fraction of the approximately 214 million people with any kind of private health insurance at last count by the U.S. Census. What will happen to health insurance prices? This is a big debate\u00a0among economists. To understand why this question is so difficult to answer, you have to look at the recent history of health plan prices before and after the ACA. Before, premiums purchased by individuals were rising about 10 percent per year \u2014 but because insurers were able to deny coverage to sick people, they were able to keep overall costs down. That changed\u00a0when the law required companies to insure everyone. In 2014, the first year of the insurance exchanges, analyses showed that prices for certain benchmark plans were 10 to 20 percent cheaper than before the law took effect. Prices have climbed since then, but liberal and conservative economists have argued over whether the increases were more or less than what would have happened without the ACA. An important point to keep in mind is that most people who buy in an ACA market get subsidies. Trump has not detailed whether he would offer similar assistance or whether his tax proposals would end up saving people more than under Obamacare. I\u2019m getting a monthly subsidy that lowers the premium of my ACA plan. What will happen to this subsidy? The law's subsidies might go away. Under some Republican thinking, you and other consumers might be able to\u00a0make up part of the money\u00a0by deducting the premiums from your taxes. But critics say that would not help lower-income people, who do not pay much, if any, in taxes. I\u2019m finishing college and deciding where to move. Which states are most likely to have affordable health care for people with low-paying jobs in the next few years \u2014 and which are least likely? This is a tough one as we're still in the early stages of postelection discussion on what will replace the ACA. If you need to make an immediate decision, it's worth looking at how certain states have historically dealt with the issue of health insurance. Massachusetts has been at the forefront of offering universal access to health care for years and would probably still be a good bet. The state implemented its own version of the ACA several years before the federal law took effect nationally; that will remain in place even if the ACA goes away. It might also be\u00a0helpful to look at states that set up their own insurance exchanges and expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA. While your\u00a0low-paying job may or may\u00a0not meet the\u00a0Medicaid threshold, the overall trend in these states is toward more\u00a0people being covered (though it is uncertain if those states would continue to get extra federal money for their Medicaid beneficiaries). Below is a map of the\u00a019\u00a0states that opted against Medicaid expansion. The list, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, was current as of October. \u00a0 Since Trump keeps saying he wants to replace the ACA, what are his main ideas and where do they come from? Have they ever been tried before? Taking away health insurance from about 20 million people \u2014 which would happen if the ACA were repealed with no replacement \u2014 would be wildly unpopular, and\u00a0Trump has outlined several parts of a possible successor plan. Some of the ideas come from legislation that was introduced in recent years by congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, but has never become law. The major changes\u00a0Trump\u00a0has endorsed, often without details, include: changing the tax code to allow individuals to fully deduct all health insurance premiums; allowing insurance plans to be sold across state lines, presumably increasing competition; ensuring price transparency for medical\u00a0procedures and other health care costs; expanding access to health savings accounts that are tax free; turning Medicaid into block grants to states; allowing medications to be imported, creating more competition in drug pricing. (This shows up on Trump's campaign page but not on his transition page.) Give me the high-level numbers. What would be the impact of Trump's positions on insurance marketplaces and the economy? Most analyses agree that many more people would be uninsured but differ on how the federal deficit would be affected. According to Rand Corp. , in the first full year of the new administration, Trump\u2019s proposals would result in about 20 million previously insured Americans going without health coverage and would add nearly $6 billion to the deficit. (Rand Corp.) In contrast, the\u00a0 Center for Health and Economy , which is nonpartisan and includes both liberal and conservative experts, estimates that 18 million people \u2014 mostly low-income adults \u2014 would become uninsured in the first year and that Trump's changes would decrease the deficit by $583 billion between 2017 and 2026. Previously, the\u00a0 Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , which\u00a0promotes fiscal constraint and is\u00a0anti-deficit,\u00a0calculated that repealing the ACA would double the number of uninsured, leading to more than 21 million people losing coverage, and would cost $550 billion over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office in\u00a02015 estimated 22 million fewer people would have coverage in 2017 if a repeal bill were enacted. Tell me more about making Medicaid a block-grant program for states. What does that mean, and what difference would that probably make? Since it began in the mid-1960s, Medicaid has been an entitlement program, which means that it is an open-ended commitment to cover everyone who qualifies for it. In return, states must cover certain groups of people and certain benefits, though they have some freedom to include or exclude some discretionary benefits and to set eligibility rules.\u00a0The\u00a0result is that federal spending on Medicaid varies from year to year, depending on how many people are in the program and how much care they use.\u00a0In contrast, under a block grant,\u00a0the government would give states a lump sum of money.\u00a0 Kaiser Health News has a good explanation of how this would work. Critics say that, over time, a lot of money would be cut from Medicaid if the federal grants fail to keep pace with the program's costs, inevitably eroding eligibility and benefits. Yet supporters say block grants would encourage states to reduce waste, save the federal government billions of dollars and give states more freedom to choose how to implement the program. Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, block grants can be done in a way that would satisfy both sides. Speaking to Politico , Cass said that savings from implementing the grants could then be used for other anti-poverty programs. Another looming question is what will happen with the part of the ACA intended to expand Medicaid eligibility to people with slightly higher incomes\u00a0\u2014 up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which this year is about $16,000 for an individual and $33,000 for a family of four. Thirty-one states and the District did expansion. It is unclear whether, in making other changes to Medicaid, Trump would let them keep the extra federal money they received for enrolling newly eligible people. Lena H.

Around the nation, students are turning to the tools of toddlers as a bizarre form of therapy in the wake of Donald Trump's election last week. Colleges and universities are encouraging students to cry, cuddle with puppies and sip hot chocolate to soothe their fragile psyches, an approach some critics say would be funny if it weren't so alarming. \u201cThis is an extreme reaction from millennials who are being forced to come to terms with the fact that we have a president that they don\u2019t like \u2013this is what losing feels like,\u201d Kristin Tate, the 24-year-old author of \"Government Gone Wild,\" told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe are grooming our students to be sensitive crybabies when we need to be showing students how to deal with world situations and how to be adults \u2013there are no \u2018safe spaces\u2019 in the real world.\u201d Among the top-notch schools sending devastated students back to their early childhood: Cornell University recently hosted a \u201ccry-in,\u201d complete with hot chocolate and tissues for disappointed Hillary Clinton supporters. University of Pennsylvania brought in a puppy and a kitten for therapeutic cuddling. Tufts University held arts and crafts sessions for students. University of Michigan Law School scheduled an event for this Friday called \u201cPost-Election Self-Care With Food and Play\u201d with \u201cstress-busting self-care activities\u201d including coloring, blowing bubbles, sculpting with Play-Doh and \u201cpositive card making.\u201d University of Michigan spokesperson Kim Broekhuizen told FoxNews.com the law school was providing these programs based on requests from the students on campus. But on Thursday, following media scrutiny, the event was scrubbed from the school\u2019s website and replaced with a more age-appropriate discussion of the \u201climitations of executive power.\u201d In an email, Broekhuizen declined to say why the original event was scrapped, and said the Ann Arbor school often faciilitates similar stress-battling activities. \u201cThese kinds of events are scheduled throughout the year including during high-stress times such as finals, mid-terms and presidential elections,\u201d Broekhuizen wrote. \u201cThe event was scheduled before the outcome of the presidential election was known.\u201d At University of Michigan-Flint, students are able to visit \u201csafe spaces\u201d and receive counseling for their post-election needs, a program that Business Professor Mark Perry called \u201cdisturbing.\u201d \u201cInstitutions of higher learning have gone from being places that might be described as \u2018intellectual boot-camps,\u2019 where [students] are challenged with a diversity of new ideas, to being places that might now be, more accurately, described as \u2018kindergartens\u2019 for adults where they are no longer challenged, but instead treated as fragile, intellectual children and coddled with a \u2018safe place\u2019 response to anything challenging or unsettling,\u201d Perry, who also is a scholar at The American Enterprise Institute, told FoxNews.com. Boston University skipped the hot chocolate and therapy animals, but scheduled a set of post-election discussions aimed at helping students process a democratic election that didn't go their way. \u201cBecause the results of this election differed so dramatically from pre-election polls and the expectations gleaned from national media coverage, many people had difficulty comprehending how it came about,\u201d Boston University spokesman Colin Riley told FoxNews.com. \u201cThese programs are helping students and others to sort through the results \u2013it is more than how to deal with one\u2019s feelings.\u201d Discussion and debate is certainly more in keeping with academic tradition than coloring books. But one BU student told FoxNews.com that a Nov. 9 email from the University, titled \u201cTips for engaging in self-care,\u201d sent the wrong message. \u201cIt is crazy that the school is handling the outcome of an election more than a serious terror attack,\u201d the student told FoxNews.com. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a \u2018self-care\u2019 guide during any of them \u2013not even after Paris last November while I was studying abroad.\u201d Cornell Psychology Professor Katherine Kinzler said not all students at the Ithaca, N.Y., Ivy League school are handling the prospect of President Trump like babies. \u201cMy students tell me they are having conversations about their role as young adults in driving civic engagement, and the implications of the election for their nation and for their futures,\u201d\u00a0 Kinzler wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. \u201cStudents thinking through the issues and coming together can help us create productive solutions for the many critical problems of our times.\u201d Advertisement ",

Seth Wenig/AP hide caption toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP U.S. officials say JPMorgan Chase has been cooperating with American investigators looking into the bank's hiring practices in Asia. Seth Wenig/AP JPMorgan Chase and its Hong Kong affiliate have agreed to pay a total of $264 million in fines to settle allegations that the bank hired the friends and relatives of Chinese government officials in exchange for business. The bank isn't being formally charged with wrongdoing, but by agreeing to pay the fines, it brings a three-year investigation by the U.S. government to a close. \"Creating a barter system in which jobs are awarded to applicants in exchange for lucrative business deals is a corrupt scheme in and of itself,\" William F. Sweeney Jr., assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, said in a statement . \"But when foreign officials are among those involved in the bribe, the international free market system and our national security are among the major threats we face.\" U.S. officials say that beginning in 2006, senior bank officials based in Hong Kong set up a program known as \"sons and daughters\" to hire people referred by clients and government officials. Those hired had to have a \"directly attributable linkage to a business opportunity,\" the statement said. In 2009, it added, a Chinese government official told a senior banker at JPMorgan that hiring a certain candidate would significantly influence the role that the bank played in an upcoming stock offering for a Chinese government-owned company. Article continues after sponsorship The senior banker then asked colleagues in New York to find a position for the candidate, even though the person was not qualified for an investment banking job and there was \"no expected benefit from the hire.\" After being hired, the candidate was given light duties such as proofreading, U.S. officials said. The bank was then given a lead role in the stock offering, they added. In 2011, a JPMorgan employee asked that a candidate be given a permanent position despite \"undeniable underperformance,\" because the \"deal is large enough [and] we are pregnant enough with this person, that we'd be crazy not to accommodate her father's wants,\" according to a statement released by the Justice Department. Another candidate was described as having an \"attitude issue,\" while another was said to have \"not very impressive, poor GPA.\" Still another was dismissed as a \"photocopier.\" JPMorgan Chase has been cooperating with the U.S. government. It \"took significant employment action\" against six people involved in the program and disciplined an additional 23 people who failed to detect the wrongdoing. U.S. officials are also said to be investigating the hiring practices of several other large banks that do business in Asia, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and UBS. Under the 1977 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, companies are barred from paying bribes to foreign companies. Mike Koehler, a professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law, says that by pursuing the banks, the U.S. government is interpreting the act in a broader way than it typically has. \"This enforcement action really reeks of a double standard. It's a well known fact that here in the United States, the friends and relatives of U.S. officials are sometimes hired into internships and job opportunities where they may not be the most qualified individual, where they may not have followed the normal hiring process,\" said Koehler, who publishes the blog fcpaprofessor.com The money will be divided between the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve ",

By Aaron Blake November 17 at 3:11 PM Follow @aaronblake A Muslim woman reads a newspaper in Lagos, Nigeria. The Nov. 10 headline declares, \u201cTrump shocks the world.\" (Sunday Alamba/Associated Press) The idea of a so-called Muslim registry or Muslim database has been back in the news in recent days after a pair of high-profile Donald Trump supporters \u00a0rekindled it. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach \u2014 a rumored potential pick for Trump's attorney general \u2014 talked to Reuters on Tuesday about the Trump administration implementing one. By Wednesday, Trump surrogate Carl Higbie cited Japanese American internment camps during World War II \u00a0as \u201cprecedent\u201d for doing such a thing. Questions over the idea of creating a database of Muslim immigrants are coming up as President-elect Donald Trump forms his new administration. A Trump surrogate defended the idea on Fox News, saying the treatment of Japanese Americans during WWII was \"precedent.\" (The Washington Post) But it's worth noting how\u00a0this idea evolved over the course of Trump's campaign. What Kobach and Higbie are talking about is actually less far-reaching than the Muslim database that Trump suggested he might support as a candidate. Although they are talking about a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries \u2014 similar to one Kobach helped implement as a staff member in the George W. Bush Justice Department that was scrapped in 2011 \u2014 Trump at times expressed an openness to a database for all Muslims in the United States. [ Just so you know: The government already has a list of Muslims in the U.S. ] The idea for both versions is basically that radical Islam poses such a threat that Muslims \u2014 irrespective of their potential ties to extremism \u2014 should be on some kind of registry so they can be tracked. Trump has not stated clearly exactly what he favors, and he has even disputed reports that he supports the broader version of the Muslim database. But he has also pointedly declined to rule it out. In other words, as with many policies he might push as president, we just don't know exactly what he'll do \u2014 until he steps forward and says it himself. And he has offered plenty of conflicting signals. So how did we get to this point? And what exactly has Trump said? Let's recap. A noncommittal start Almost exactly one year ago, on Nov. 19, 2015, Trump was asked by a Yahoo News reporter what measures he might take when it came to his stated proposal to increase surveillance of Muslims in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,\u201d Trump said. Asked about registering Muslims in a database or noting their religion on IDs, Trump responded:\u00a0\u201c We\u2019re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely . We\u2019re going to have to look at the mosques. We\u2019re going to have to look very, very carefully.\u201d Asked the following day again whether he supported a Muslim database, Trump was again oblique: \u201cThere should be a lot of systems \u2014 beyond databases. I mean, we should have a lot of systems.\u201d Trump then began talking about a border wall. Leaning in Trump responded: \u201c I would certainly implement that. Absolutely. \u201d It wasn't clear whether the \u201cthat\u201d he was referring to was a database or \u201ca lot of systems\u201d or a border wall. But the reporter then asked how he would register people, and Trump's responses suggested that he supported a database. \u201cIt would just be good management,\u201d he said. When asked whether they would be required to register, he responded:\u00a0\u201cThey have to be \u2014 they have to be.\u00a0Let me just tell you: The key is people can come to the country, but they have to come legally.\u201d Trump disputes it \u2014 somewhat Later that same day, Trump disputed the reports saying he had endorsed\u00a0a Muslim database, but he still didn't say he disagreed with it. I didn't suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015 Still later that day, though, Trump again left open the possibility. Asked on Fox News Channel whether he would support a \u201cfull Muslim database,\u201d he said, \u201cBasically the suggestion was made and [is] certainly something we should start thinking about . \u2026 But certainly I would want to have a database for the refugees \u2014 for the Syrian refugees that are coming in, because nobody knows where they're coming from.\u201d The database is 'all right' and 'okay' The following day in Alabama, Trump seemed to lean in more toward some kind of a database, saying it would be \u201call right\u201d and \u201cokay\u201d but again quibbled with the idea that it was a big deal. \u201cSo the database \u2014 I said yeah, that\u2019s all right, fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also said the wall, and I said the wall, and I was referring to the wall. But database is okay, and watch list is okay, and surveillance is okay. ... And the biggest story yesterday \u2014 the biggest \u2014 was 'Trump wants database on Muslims.\u2019 I said, 'What's all happening here?' \u201d A day later, Trump again left open the possibility. Asked by ABC News if he would rule out a database on all Muslims, he said no, but then shifted to talking about a database just of refugees. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a database for the refugees that \u2014 if they come into the country. We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don't know if they're ISIS, we don't know if it's a Trojan horse. \u201cAnd I definitely want a database and other checks and balances. We want to go with watch lists. We want to go with databases. And we have no choice.\u201d The issue was soon overshadowed by Trump's proposal in December to ban all Muslim immigration \u2014 which he may or may not have walked back since then. And in an anti-terrorism speech in June , he made no mention of a database or registry. But judging\u00a0from these comments, it's little surprise that the Trump transition team is looking at some kind of database involving Muslims or Muslim countries. The real question from here is how far they take the idea. politics ",

    "text": "By Rebecca Shabad CBS News November 17, 2016, 1:42 PM Obama warns Donald Trump on Russia, maintaining international commitments Email President Obama on Thursday warned Donald Trump that he should be willing to stand up to Russia as president, and he talked about his expectations for the president-elect\u2019s actions concerning key U.S. policies and international commitments. Speaking from Berlin at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during his final trip abroad as president, Mr. Obama said that while he doesn\u2019t expect Trump to follow his administration\u2019s blueprint, he expects him to act in U.S. interests. \u201cMy hope is that the president-elect, coming in, takes a similarly constructive approach -- finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align -- but that the president-elect is also willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms,\u201d Mr. Obama said. President Obama will bring a message of solidarity when he meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. Merkel is concerned about Presid... The president suggested it would be harmful if Trump takes a \u201crealpolitik approach\u201d where the U.S. cuts deals with Russia \u201ceven if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves countries vulnerable.\u201d Mr. Obama reiterated that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cinsistence\u201d he won\u2019t change the U.S. commitment to NATO, which the president said Trump made clear to him during a 90-minute meeting at the White House last week. \u201cHis full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security is, I think, very important,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama is on his last foreign trip, which also includes stops in Greece and Peru. While both leaders met privately, Mr. Obama said they discussed efforts to keep the U.S. and Germany economically competitive , negotiations resulting from Brexit -- the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the threat of climate change and implementing the Paris agreement , ensuring Iran continues to abide by its nuclear deal, countering cyber threats and the importance of maintaining sanctions against Russia. Responding to Trump\u2019s previous remarks about stopping the flow of Syrian refugees to the U.S. , Mr. Obama said that the global refugee problem is not an issue any one country should bear, and said he hopes robust support for an international response \u201ccontinues beyond my administration.\u201d The president warned that \u201cpolitics everywhere\u201d will now experience a \u201cbumpy phase.\u201d \u201cAs long as we stay true to our democratic principles, as long as elections have integrity, as along as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well the government is serving them, but changing government if the government is not serving them well, then I have confidence that over the long-term, progress will continue,\u201d the president said during his sixth visit to Germany.

Got it In Donald Trump's Washington, there are many people vying for the President-elect's attention. The Washington Post's Robert Costa explains how Trump will seek advice during the transition. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) By David Nakamura , Jerry Markon and Karen DeYoung November 17 at 5:26 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @karendeyoung1 President-elect Donald Trump plans to meet this weekend with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a fierce critic during the campaign, to discuss his transition operation and a potential role as secretary of state, people close to the transition said Thursday. Trump\u2019s outreach to Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, could help bridge the divide between the president-elect\u2019s advisers and the GOP establishment, and send a signal to foreign capitals that Trump is interested in a more conventional figure as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Also Thursday, Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, said in an interview with McClatchy News Service that he would not have an official role in Trump\u2019s administration, despite having previously been identified as a potential secretary of state. Gingrich confirmed the report in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cI think it\u2019s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who also is being considered for Trump\u2019s Cabinet, told reporters outside Trump Tower in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s meeting with a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with. I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things, but he\u2019ll be one of those I\u2019m sure that\u2019s reviewed, and Mr. Trump will make that decision.\u201d The disclosure of their meeting came as something of a surprise. Romney had been one of the earliest and most vocal critics of Trump among the GOP leadership, ripping the real estate mogul last March after squelching speculation that he would mount a late primary challenge to Trump. Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u201cIf we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,\u201d Romney said, adding that \u201cdishonesty is Trump\u2019s hallmark.\u201d Romney also criticized Trump for racially charged campaign rhetoric, prompting Trump to write on Twitter that \u201cMitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist \u2014 but I am least racist person there is.\u201d Romney took a more tempered tone after Trump\u2019s general election triumph last week, and called him to offer his congratulations. The news came as Trump\u2019s transition to power kicked into higher gear. Transition officials were expected to fan out across federal agencies, and Trump prepared for an important meeting with Japan\u2019s prime minister. The 5 p.m. session with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump\u2019s first with a foreign leader since the election, has raised questions among some in Washington\u2019s foreign policy community because Trump has apparently not been briefed by the State Department. Officials said Wednesday that the transition team has not reached out to State. A former State Department official said such a meeting with a foreign leader would normally be preceded by numerous briefings from key diplomats, which is considered especially important here because the Japanese are concerned about comments Trump made on the campaign trail. The president-elect repeatedly said that Japan should pay more for its own defense and be less reliant on the United States. [ Japan\u2019s prime minister hopes to start building \u2018trusting relationship\u2019 with Trump ] \u201cThe world does not stop for the transition,\u2019\u2019 said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely. Trump \u201cwould want an intelligence briefing. You\u2019d probably want to get briefed on what\u2019s what happening in the region.\u2019\u2019 1 of 8 Here\u2019s what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House. Nov. 11, 2016\u00a0 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/\u201d60 Minutes\u201d via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. But Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Thursday that the session at Trump Tower, which Vice President-elect Mike Pence will attend, will be \u201cmuch less formal\u201d than in the future because Trump has yet to assume office. \u201cWe are very sensitive to the fact that President Obama is still in office for the next two months,\u2019\u2019 Conway said. As Trump remained ensconced with close aides in his Manhattan office tower, his transition team appeared to signal Thursday that Sessions is a leading candidate to be attorney general. \u201cThe President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama\u2019s Attorney General and U.S. Attorney,\u2019\u2019 the team said in a statement about Trump\u2019s meeting with Sesisons on Wednesday. While the statement cautioned that \u201cnothing has been finalized,\u2019\u2019 Sessions\u2019s 14-year stint in those two posts in the 1980s and 1990s would be his primary qualifications to lead the Justice Department. Sessions\u2019s former staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is also helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump\u2019s team, lawyers familiar with the matter have said. Sessions, a top Trump adviser known for his hardline views on immigration, has been a rising force in the transition team and is also under consideration for defense secretary. His nomination for Justice would likely bring a re-examination of his failed nomination by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to be a federal judge. A bipartisan panel of senators on the Judiciary Committee declined to send his nomination to the Senate floor that year amid allegations that he had made what some characterized as racist remarks. Sessions, who has been a senator for 20 years, has vehemently denied holding any racist views and has said he supported civil rights in Alabama, where he grew up outside of Selma. [ In Trump\u2019s Washington, rival powers and whispers in the president\u2019s ear ] Trump\u2019s meeting with Abe arose from a phone conversation between the Japanese leader and Trump. When Abe called to congratulate Trump shortly after his victory, he mentioned that he would be passing through New York this week and suggested a meeting. \u201cThat would be awesome,\u201d Trump immediately responded, according to people briefed on the conversation. The two leaders have much to discuss. Trump has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that Abe recently pushed through his parliament. And the president-elect caused jitters in both Japan and South Korea during the campaign by saying both nations were not paying enough for their defense and that he would make them pay more \u2014 perhaps even all \u2014 of the costs of hosting U.S. military bases. Since Trump\u2019s victory, the Japanese government has been taking a wait-and-see approach. \u201cTrump said various things during his campaign, but I will not presuppose what he will do as president,\u201d Tomomi Inada, Japan\u2019s defense minister, said late last week. She added, however, that Japan is paying its fair share toward base costs. In a new development Thursday, Trump\u2019s transition team announced that anyone serving in the new administration would be banned for life from lobbying for any foreign government. Trump had proposed such a ban in an ethics plan he unveiled last month, but it is unclear how the ban would be implemented. There is no current law that imposes a lifetime ban on post-government employment for administration officials, with one exception \u2014 there is a lifetime ban on certain members of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office from representing foreign governments after leaving the agency. The reasoning is to prevent them from essentially \u201cswitching sides\u201d and using the knowledge they gained while representing U.S. interests to weaken or amend the agreement to the benefit a foreign country. A lifetime ban like the one Trump proposed raises constitutional issues, and would have to be more narrowly tailored to pass muster in the courts \u2014 for example, if the ban was limited to certain State Department or Defense Department officials whose jobs involved working closely with foreign governments. But a blanket lifetime ban could be unconstitutional. \u201cLifetime bans are really problematic from a legal standpoint because it prevents people from making a living,\u201d said Brett Kappel, a political law and government ethics attorney. \u201cA lifetime ban on anybody in the administration ever becoming a representative of a foreign government? I don\u2019t see how that would hold up in court.\u201d It is also unclear whether the ban would be implemented by legislation or executive order. Meanwhile, the pace of the transition appeared to quicken. Offices prepared for Trump\u2019s teams in departments and agencies across the government had remained empty Wednesday. But the White House said that it received paperwork, signed Tuesday evening by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, necessary for the teams to move into the department offices and begin to receive briefings from current officials. The names of people on the \u201clanding teams\u201d for the State Department, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and the National Security Council will be submitted to the White House on Thursday and announced Friday, the transition team said Thursday in a conference call with reporters. Economic policy landing teams will be announced Monday, followed by teams devoted to domestic policy and independent federal agencies. The transition released a list of 29 presidents and prime ministers with whom it said Trump and Pence have spoken since the election. And transition communications director Jason Miller said that reports of turmoil within the transition following the ouster of several senior team members in recent days came largely from \u201cfolks on the outside\u201d and those who feared that Trump was preparing to \u201cdrain the swamp, as he\u2019s promised.\u201d Miller declined to speculate on the timing of appointment announcements, saying that \u201cthe president-elect is going to get this right\u201d and that names would be put forward when Trump was ready. He also denied reports that Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, had been instrumental in purging members of the transition seen as close to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom Pence replaced as the head of the team last week. Miller said Trump met with several advisers and candidates for administration positions Wednesday, including Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), investor Steve Feinberg, Success Academy Charter Schools chief executive Eva Moskowitz and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). Miller did not elaborate on which people on the list are candidates to join the administration. Price is considered a candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump will meet Thursday with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), Florida Gov. Rick Scott, former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and retired Gen. Jack Keane, among others, Miller said. Attention continued to be mainly focused on potential national security picks. Trump campaign surrogates said former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani remained at the top of the rumored list for secretary of state, along with former State Department official John Bolton. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who visited Trump on Tuesday in Manhattan, emerged as a defense secretary candidate. Farther down the defense list were George W. Bush national security adviser Stephen V. Hadley and former senator James M. Talent (R-Mo.). Frank Gaffney, a far-right conspiracy theorist who was described in some media reports as a Trump transition adviser and possible pick for a national security job, said Wednesday that he had \u201cnot been contacted by anyone from the team.\u201d His statement followed one by Miller, the transition communication chief, that Gaffney is \u201ca nice guy, but he\u2019s not part of the transition team\u201d and was not advising it. Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn was still being mentioned as national security adviser, although some with transition connections said his stock appeared to be falling as others questioned his potential effectiveness in the job. Retired Gen. David H. Petraeus, whose name was also mentioned, is close to Keith Kellogg and Michael Meese, transition team members and former military colleagues. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), mentioned as a possible CIA director after the leading candidate, former chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan, was among those purged early this week, is a transition adviser but is \u201cnot interested in a post,\u201d a congressional aide said. Former congressman Pete Hoekstra, also a Michigan Republican and a former committee chairman, said in an interview that he\u2019d told the transition \u201cif they have a role for me, I\u2019d be more than happy to discuss it with them.\u201d Hoekstra said the Trump team was \u201cgoing to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they\u2019re going to do it in a methodical way.\u201d Despite intense media scrutiny and swirling rumors in Washington, Trump\u2019s timetable was still well within the bounds of his immediate predecessors. Obama did not announce his first Cabinet pick until nearly a month after the 2008 election; he presented his national security team en masse Dec. 1 that year. Confirmation of George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 victory did not come until a Supreme Court decision more than a month after the Nov. 7 election.

A Dangerous Animal Response Team (DART) member at the scene determined the boy's life \"to be in imminent, life threatening danger\" and fatally shot Harambe, according to the report. The inspection report also found that zoo keeper immediately initiated the facility's emergency response and security responded promptly to the incident. \"All standard operating procedures relating to the Dangerous Animal Response Team were properly followed,\" the report said. The boy was safely recovered and sustained no major injuries during the incident, the USDA said.

Cincinnati Zookeepers have revealed a new enclosure for the Gorilla World exhibit before reopening the section on June 7. Cincinnati Zoo Three surveillance cameras were also added to the enclosure, the USDA said. The exhibit reopened on June 7. The zoo cited a letter to its board of directors from Dr. Elizabeth Goldentyer, a regional director of the USDA's Animal Care program under its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) division in its statement following the USDA report. \"Animal Care recognizes and appreciates the swift and comprehensive actions taken in response to this incident, both the immediate response during the incident and the overall review of barrier systems throughout the facility,\" Goldentyer said in the letter, according to the zoo. \"We also acknowledge that the barrier system at Gorilla World was considered to be in compliance with Section 3.78(e) of the Animal Welfare Act Regulations during inspections prior to the incident in question and had been performing admirably for many years.\" Cincinnati Zoo Director Thane Maynard said in a statement that the zoo remained \"committed to visitor and animal safety\" and would continue to work \"to ensure that our exhibits meet or exceed standards.\" Play ",

    "text": "Dems Move to Leverage Bernie Sanders' Popularity as Party Regroups By MaryAlice Parks Nov 17, 2016, 3:14 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Bernie Sanders In A Minute 0 Shares Email As much as his supporters might disagree, Bernie Sanders is now officially part of the establishment -- and he has his old Brooklyn friend to thank for it. It happened Wednesday, when incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave the Vermont senator, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, a promotion and an official spot on his leadership team this week. The official title: \u201coutreach chair,\u201d a role Sanders said he will take very seriously even if he isn\u2019t sure what it entails. \u201cIf anyone has any ideas let me know,\u201d Sanders joked with reporters this morning when asked what exactly he would do in the new position. \u201cI just got this title yesterday.\u201d Although they hardly come from the same ideological background (Schumer is known for being close to Sanders\u2019 Enemy No. 1, Wall Street, especially for a Democrat), the two men have had nothing but compliments for each other as of late. Donald Trump Holds Meetings With SC Gov. Nikki Haley and Henry Kissinger They have been described as \u201cpals\u201d and \u201cD.C.\u201d friends. Staff members are quick to point out that they have worked well together in the past. They share a Brooklyn rough-and-tumble attitude and even went to the same high school. They speak on the phone regularly. Now the Democrat Party leader-in-waiting not only wants to defend the independent, but also bring him into the fold. The job title of outreach chair is a new one, having been broken out of its previous umbrella organization, the Steering and Outreach Committee, headed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who will continue as the steering chair. Schumer and his team know that Sanders\u2019 ability to move crowds and gin up signatures will help Democrats at the negotiating table. \u201cHe has developed such a reputation, deservedly so, of working with people across the nation. He inspired people to come out, and that kind of outreach is really important,\u201d Klobuchar said of the role. Sanders\u2019 popularity was on display Wednesday night. Students packed a theater in downtown Washington, D.C., and erupted in excitement and cheers when he was introduced as a newly appointed member of Democrats\u2019 leadership team in the Senate . (They also hooted and hollered when the moderator read about how the senator had run a mile in 4 minutes, 37 seconds in high school. They wanted to celebrate him, the man, as much as any policy idea.) Sanders himself put his new role this way: \u201cOne the goals of that position is to bring people into politics and make people aware that politics is not just Election Day .\u201d \u201cThe real action to transform America is not going to take place on Capitol Hill , it is going to take place in grassroots America,\u201d he continued. \u201cI initially understand my role to be to bring those people into the political process, to demand that the United States Congress, the United States government and president represent the needs of all the people.\u201d Staff for Senate leadership agreed there were not specific plans or ideas yet for what the role for Sanders looks like day to day, but that the announcement was about securing him a \u201cseat at the table\u201d on all big picture strategy and planning from the top. One staff member described Sanders as a needed bridge between the same young, far left progressives and grassroots organizers who helped elect President Barack Obama twice and the blue-collar workers who are eager for a steadfast voice that speaks their language. When exactly to harness Sanders\u2019 organizing or messaging power is yet to be determined -- it\u2019s a wait-and-see attitude with Democrats on the Capitol Hill. Which Donald Trump will show up? What exactly will they need to respond to? They aren\u2019t sure. \u201cThis is the debate we are going to have to have in the Democratic Party, that debate is: Which side are you on?\u201d Sanders said, calling for major changes in the party. \u201cCan you go out and raise substantial sums of money from the wealthy and Wall Street and other special interest [groups] and then convince the American people that you are on the side of workers and the middle class?\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Nov. 17, 2016, 4:59 p.m. Reporting from Washington Sarah D. Wire Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Downey) joined other lawmakers in asking President Obama to protect young immigrants who gave their information to the government under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. (Bill Clark / CQ Roll Call) The members of\u00a0Congress who persuaded President Obama to grant temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought into the country illegally as children\u00a0are now asking him to use a pardon to prevent\u00a0those immigrants\u00a0from being deported by President-elect Donald Trump. The White House, however, promptly batted down the idea. Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Downey) and Luis Guti\u00e9rrez\u00a0(D-Ill.) sent a letter to Obama on Thursday asking him to use his pardon authority to forgive the past and future civil immigration offenses of the nearly 750,000 people granted deportation deferrals under the\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. They believe that would keep those people from being deported, and even though it would leave them in\u00a0legal limbo without work permits or visas, they could more easily apply for\u00a0legal status from within the U.S. without\u00a0immigration offenses on their records. \"They wouldn't have a piece of paper, they wouldn't have work authorization, but they wouldn't have to be living in fear every moment of their lives about deportation,\" Lofgren said after a news conference Thursday. Lofgren, a former immigration attorney, said the pardons\u00a0would probably be applied to the civil offenses related to entering and remaining in the country\u00a0without authorization. But\u00a0whether a\u00a0pardon would actually be applicable in the so-called Dreamers'\u00a0situation is unclear.\u00a0Lawyers disagree over whether the immigrants\u00a0could be pardoned for civil crimes they haven't been formally accused of, and whether such a pardon\u00a0would actually prevent them from being deported while they seek legal status. A White House official signaled\u00a0late Thursday that\u00a0the administration was not considering a pardon for those registered under DACA because it believes a pardon would not allow them\u00a0legal status. \"We note that the clemency power could not give legal status to any undocumented individual. As we have repeatedly said for years, only Congress can create legal status for undocumented individuals,\" an administration official said. After\u00a0immigration reform efforts\u00a0stalled in Congress during Obama's first term, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pressured Obama to\u00a0act\u00a0independently\u00a0to protect from deportation certain immigrants brought into the country illegally when they were children. He then used an executive order to create the\u00a0DACA\u00a0program in 2012. The Dreamers, one in three of whom are estimated to live in California, gave the Department of Homeland Security their fingerprints, home addresses and other information to undergo background checks that allowed them to defer deportation under DACA. At the time, advocates and the administration emphasized that providing the information would protect the Dreamers\u00a0and was worth the risk. But with Trump vowing to deport millions of people who are in the country illegally and many fearing he may let the DACA program expire, Dreamers are worried the information they provided will be used to deport them. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), whose\u00a0husband is an immigration attorney, said at the news\u00a0conference she has been\u00a0getting a flood of messages from frightened Dreamers. On Tuesday she sent a letter to Obama asking him to keep their information from the Trump administration . \"We promised these recipients security, and now they are facing a nightmare,\" she said. Roybal-Allard said those who pushed Obama to create the program\u00a0and persuaded people to come out of the shadows to register with the government have an obligation to protect them. \"These are kids. We feel a sense of responsibility. We went out into our districts and we talked to the Dreamers, and they asked us, 'Is it really OK\u00a0for us to do this?'\" Roybal-Allard said. \"And we said, 'No, don't worry, you need to come forward.' Now we are in a situation where all that we said, in fact, could possibly be reversed.\" Although the president's pardon power is normally used for individual cases, there is some precedent for the chief executive\u00a0to pardon a large group of people. President Jimmy Carter pardoned half a million Vietnam War draft evaders in 1977, and at least seven other presidents have issued broad pardons. Congress and the Supreme Court cannot undo a presidential pardon, nor can a new president. Lofgren said if Obama doesn't pardon the Dreamers, she hopes he\u00a0responds with his own idea to help them. \"These young people are not alone, they are not going to be abandoned by us,\" she said.

    "text": "By Jenna Johnson November 17 Follow @wpjenna On his eighth day as the president-elect, Donald Trump met with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, flashed a thumbs-up in a photo with boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and got some foreign policy advice from pro skateboarder Billy Rohan, who says the United States could bring about peace by building skate parks around the world. The next morning, Trump had a 15-minute phone call with Piers Morgan, the British journalist who once hosted major television programs, and was visited by Jeanine Pirro, a prosecutor turned minor celebrity who has a Saturday night Fox News show called \u201cJustice With Judge Jeanine.\u201d Welcome to the variety show that has become Trump\u2019s informal kitchen cabinet \u2014 now webcast daily by C-SPAN. The president-elect \u2014 who has long been entranced by celebrities and cleared his schedule to meet them \u2014 campaigned on the promise to do things differently than presidents before him. That pledge is clear in his log of visitors and callers. They include potential Cabinet nominees, longtime supporters, prominent Republicans, more than two dozen foreign leaders and Alex Jones of Infowars, the conspiracy website that claims that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job. The presence of so many nontraditional visitors and advisers raises a question: Is this really the best use of the president-elect\u2019s time, especially when his transition team has just undergone a leadership purge and is only now reaching out to many major federal agencies? Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, arrives at Trump Tower on Nov. 16. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) [ Trump Tower: Home to a reality show, a campaign and now a transition ] \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly purposeful, is it?\u201d said Paul Light, a professor at New York University who has studied presidential transitions. Light and other transition experts said Thursday that they have learned to accept that Trump\u2019s approach to everything is likely to be dramatically different from his predecessors\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s a major reason many voters selected him. And there are things that Trump could learn from a football team owner, a boxer, a skateboarder and television commentators that could help prepare him for the presidency. But such contacts are not helpful unless Trump has an express purpose, Light said. Trump\u2019s team did not respond to a request Thursday to detail what Trump discussed with each of the guests. \u201cIf it\u2019s a bunch of people coming by to give him flowers and take a photo, that\u2019s just going to make him feel invincible,\u201d Light said. \u201cWhat he needs is a dose of reality right now.\u201d For example: Light suggested that Trump could meet with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and ask how he runs a \u00adtwo-minute drill in the final minutes of a tied game, taking advantage of every second left on the clock. That\u2019s the sort of strategic concentration Trump will need to push tax restructuring and other priorities through Congress early in his term to avoid letting down his voters and losing congressional seats in 2018. [ Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump\u2019s Cabinet ] Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service \u2014 which helps guide candidates and agencies through transitions \u2014 deemed Trump\u2019s guest list \u201cmore eclectic than you would see in years past\u201d and offered additional types of people the president-elect might want to consult. At the top of his list: those who can explain \u201chow the government actually works\u201d and those who have tried to change it in the past. To gain a full understanding of the government he wants to change, Trump should reach out to a former White House chief of staff, someone such as Joshua B. Bolten, who worked for President George W. Bush, Stier said. To learn to transition from private businessman to elected leader beholden to the people, Stier suggested that Trump talk to former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. And, Stier said, Trump should talk with a former world leader who tried to impose major change, such as ex-British prime minister Tony Blair. Stier said Trump\u2019s list of formal and informal advisers should display a clear objective \u2014 a sense of the direction he wants to take the government. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re really sure yet,\u201d he said. Martha Joynt Kumar, a retired Towson University political science professor who has studied presidential transitions, said there are no rules for whom a president-elect can or cannot meet or talk with. She also said it\u2019s fine for the president-elect to have fun during the transition, as long as he\u2019s moving ahead on selecting White House staffers, settling on rules for picking appointees, starting the transfer of information at the agencies and setting on a clear narrative for his presidency. [ How conspiracy theorist Alex Jones got Donald Trump\u2019s ear ] One rule of order that Trump broke in his first week as incoming president was to carefully choreograph his communications with other nations. Instead, Trump appeared to take calls as they came in without placing importance on the order. While this stunned many lifelong foreign policy experts, Kumar wondered whether the formality really mattered. \u201cAfter all, what was he saying his whole campaign was about?\u201d she said. \u201cShaking things up and changing the way government does things.\u201d Late Wednesday, Rohan \u2014 the pro skateboarder \u2014 came down the elevators at Trump Tower and yelled at reporters: \u201cTrump loves Muslims, too! As-salaam alaikum! Peace be upon you!\u201d He then explained how world peace could be achieved by building more skate parks. He told reporters that he was impressed with Trump. \u201cIt was the opposite of what I expected,\u201d Rohan said. \u201cYou know how you hear about Freemasons and then you meet one and it is the opposite of what you expected? It was like that.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

On Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) 0 Shares Email JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. \"Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple,\" Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this program had to have a \"directly attributable linked to business opportunity\" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35 million in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the \"Sons and Daughters Program,\" was \"nothing more than bribery by another name.\" Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. \"We're pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations,\" said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony in a statement. \"The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved.\" According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

They are not racist. They did not vote for the Democrats this time.\u201d Social media users may have noticed that Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama memes have inundated Facebook and Twitter the last few days... Globalization, Biden said, has fundamentally altered the economic outlook for these voters -- especially blue-collar white American men -- who are feeling left behind by the political process. \u201cFor the first time in recent memory, this is one section of American population where the life expectancy has gone down,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is white American men between the age of 40 and 55. They have the highest suicide rate in America. Because they do not know how to deal with this new incredible change that is taking place in the world.\u201d \u201cRemember, we won these same people,\u201d Biden continued. The vice president\u2019s assessment \u00a0came after he had spent part of the day with his successor, Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Despite campaigning heavily against the Trump-Pence ticket, Biden and his wife, Jill, warmly welcomed Pence and his wife, whom the vice president described as \u201creally fine people.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop him from later bringing up the unpopularity of the top of the GOP ticket -- and he acknowledged Hillary Clinton\u2019s unpopularity. \u201c[Trump] is the most unpopular elected president in American history,\u201d Biden said. \u201cJust as Hillary was very unpopular.

    "text": "Fanatic Studio/Getty Images Fanatic Studio/Getty Images The number of doctors who each prescribe millions of dollars of medications annually in Medicare's drug program has soared, driven by expensive hepatitis C treatments and rising drug prices overall, federal data obtained by ProPublica show. The number of providers who topped the $5 million mark for prescriptions increased more than tenfold, from 41 in 2011 to 514 in 2015. The number of prescribers \u2014 mostly physicians but also nurse practitioners \u2014 exceeding $10 million in drug costs jumped from two to 70 over the same time period, according to the data. Most of the doctors atop the spending list prescribed Harvoni or Sovaldi, relatively new drugs that cure hepatitis C. Other providers on the list prescribed pricey drugs to treat cancer, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Medicare's drug program, known as Part D, covers more than 41 million seniors and disabled people. In 2015, it accounted for $137.4 billion in drug spending , before factoring in rebates from drug companies. That was up from $121.5 billion a year earlier. \"The trends in this space are troubling and don't show any signs of abating,\" said Tim Gronniger, deputy chief of staff at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicare. \"It's going to be a pressure point for patients and the program for the foreseeable future.\" Article continues after sponsorship During the recent presidential campaign, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump pledged to tackle the rising costs of prescription drugs. Since his election, however, President-elect Trump's transition agenda for health care hasn't featured the topic, a shift The Los Angeles Times reported . Medicare has released top-level data on drug spending for 2015, including the number of doctors who prescribed medications worth more than $1 million. But the agency has only published data on individual doctors up to 2014. Multiple Sclerosis Patients Stressed Out By Soaring Drug Costs Dr. Ben Thrower , medical director of the Multiple Sclerosis Institute at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, was near the top of the list in 2014. He prescribed medications costing $11.5 million that year, mostly for multiple sclerosis drugs. \"We get that it's very expensive,\" Thrower said. \"I think all the MS providers working in the U.S. would like to see the costs go down.\" But prices have climbed steadily in recent years for drugs used to treat the neurological condition , including medicines that have been on the market for quite a while. Most of the spending on Thrower's prescriptions \u2014 $8.5 million \u2014 was for MS drugs Tecfidera and Copaxone, which can slow progression of the neurological disease and reduce the chance of relapse. Thrower has received payments from the makers of those and other MS drugs, but said he cut ties with the companies in January of this year. \"It was kind of exciting when the first one came out,\" Thrower said. \"The problem we've seen is the cost for these drugs has just gone up and up and up.\" Thrower said he no longer prescribes Tecfidera to new patients because it can lower white blood cell counts, putting them at risk for infections. Just because a doctor prescribes costly drugs doesn't mean he or she has done anything wrong, Gronniger said. \"It's much more about drug pricing ... than it is about the behavior of any individual physician, many of whom are equally concerned about the price of these products as we are.\" Today, ProPublica is updating its Prescriber Checkup online tool, which allows you to look up your doctor and see how his or her prescribing in Medicare Part D compares to others in the same specialty and state. Our tool covers the year 2014. You can compare the percentage of each doctor's prescriptions that were for brand-name medications, the average cost per prescription and the average number of prescriptions per patient, among other things. Allyson Funk, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, said Medicare's figures leave out important context. \"It is important to note physicians' prescribing patterns are dynamic and based on individual patient needs,\" she said in a statement. \"When looking at Medicare Part D, government data on spending at the point of sale does not include the substantial rebates for brand name medicines negotiated between manufacturers and plans and therefore does not accurately reflect actual prescribing dollars or program spending.\" These rebates are confidential by law, but Medicare said this week that the average rebate for brand-name drugs in 2014 was 17.5 percent. The new data on high-spending prescribers is the latest indication of the burden of drug prices on government health programs. In the past couple years, Medicare's drug tab has surged, in large part because it picks up the vast majority of the cost of drugs once enrollees exceed a certain threshold each year. In 2015, beneficiaries over the limit, which was $4,700, spent $51.3 billion on drugs. In 2013, the figure was $27.7 billion, government data shows. (Taxpayers, through Medicare, pick up 80 percent of the cost of this so-called catastrophic benefit.) The Associated Press first reported the ballooning cost in July. Another sign could be seen in a drug dashboard released by Medicare this week. It showed that 1 percent of drugs prescribed in the Part D program accounted for more than one-third of the program's cost in 2015 (before rebates). Some drugs were incredibly expensive. The drug H.P. Acthar Gel, used to treat several conditions, such as multiple sclerosis relapses and a rare kidney disease, cost an average of $162,371 for each of its 3,104 users\u2014a higher per-user cost than any other drug in the program. That's up significantly from several years ago, when ProPublica flagged the drug's expense . Gilead Sciences' Harvoni can cure hepatitis C, but the drug costs a fortune. Lloyd Fox/Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Lloyd Fox/Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images Gilead Sciences' Harvoni can cure hepatitis C, but the drug costs a fortune. Lloyd Fox/Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images Harvoni, used by more than 75,000 people, cost an average of $92,847 per person, for a total cost of $7 billion (also before any rebates). Michael Chernew, a professor of health care policy and director of the Healthcare Markets and Regulation Lab at Harvard Medical School, said the number of high-dollar prescribers in Medicare doesn't surprise him. Given the increased cost of prescription drugs and the latest treatment advances, \"the entire distribution is shifting to the right.\" Chernew said that, in the long term, Medicare and insurance companies have to examine the total cost of caring for patients with certain diseases, taking into account drugs, hospital visits, medical tests and more. Only then can anyone tell if certain expenses, such as a pricey new drug, are justified. For now, he said, \"How do we know what's good or bad?\" Physicians say their top priority must be the patients in front of them, not the costs to the system. Dr. Bruce Bacon , a liver specialist at St. Louis University, had the highest total Part D drug costs in 2014, $22.7 million. He was a frequent prescriber of Sovaldi and Olysio, another expensive hepatitis C medication. California Pays Insurers Millions More For Hepatitis C Drugs Bacon didn't return a call for comment for this story. In a 2015 interview, he said he did not realize his prescriptions were so costly to Medicare. \"I really don't think about the cost,\" he said. \"I think about taking care of the patients. Should I not take care of the patients because the cost is expensive?\" Thrower, the multiple sclerosis specialist, said the high cost of drugs frustrates him and his colleagues, but ultimately the successful treatment of patients comes first. \"On one hand, we get that,\" he said. \"On the other hand, when you're sitting in the exam room and looking someone in the eye, you can't say, 'I'm not going to treat you because of the cost.' \" ProPublica is a nonprofit investigative reporting newsroom based in New York.

    "text": "Addiction to opioids and heroin is a major public health problem, but so is alcohol abuse. Toby Talbot/AP hide caption toggle caption Toby Talbot/AP Addiction to opioids and heroin is a major public health problem, but so is alcohol abuse. Toby Talbot/AP In 1964, the U.S. surgeon general released a report on the health impacts of smoking, and it shaped the public and government's attitudes toward tobacco for years to come . On Thursday, another surgeon general's report was issued, this time tackling a much broader issue: addiction and the misuse and abuse of chemical substances. The focus isn't just one drug, but all of them. Though little in the report is new, it puts impressive numbers to the problem, and some surprising context: More people use prescription opioids than use tobacco. There are more people with substance abuse disorders than people with cancer. One in five Americans binge drink. And substance abuse disorders cost the U.S. more than $420 billion a year. Dr. Vivek Murthy, who is closing in on his second year as surgeon general, told NPR's Steve Inskeep Thursday on Morning Edition that he hopes putting all the data together will help Americans understand that these problems share a common solution. And it starts with kids. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Article continues after sponsorship Interview Highlights On the prevalence of substance abuse in the United States U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy says there is evidence for what works to prevent substance abuse, but it's often not applied. Charles Dharapak/AP hide caption toggle caption Charles Dharapak/AP An estimated 20.8 million people in our country are living with a substance use disorder. This is similar to the number of people who have diabetes, and 1.5 times the number of people who have all cancers combined. This number does not include the millions of people who are misusing substances but may not yet have a full-fledged disorder. We don't invest nearly the same amount of attention or resources in addressing substance use disorders that we do in addressing diabetes or cancer, despite the fact that a similar number of people are impacted. That has to change. We now know from solid data that substance abuse disorders don't discriminate. They affect the rich and the poor, all socioeconomic groups and ethnic groups. They affect people in urban areas and rural ones. Far more people than we realize are affected. It's important for us to bring people out from the shadows, and get them the help that they need. On the economic impact of substance use disorders The impact this is having on the health and well being of our country, as well as our economy, is quite staggering. These substance use disorders cost over $420 billion a year in the form of health care costs, lost economic productivity, and cost to the criminal justice system. We measure numbers like this for other illnesses, too, and the cost for substance abuse disorders far exceeds the cost of diabetes. On shifting views of substance disorders For far too long people have thought about substance abuse disorders as a disease of choice, a character flaw or a moral failing. We underestimated how exposure to addictive substances can lead to full blown addiction. Opioids are a good example. Now we understand that these disorders actually change the circuitry in your brain. They affect your ability to make decisions, and change your reward system and your stress response. That tells us that addiction is a chronic disease of the brain, and we need to treat it with the same urgency and compassion that we do with any other illness. The opioid crisis has certainly received a lot of attention , and it is certainly tearing apart families and costing us in terms of lives lost and health care dollars. But in terms of actual cost, we lose the most lives and suffer the most costs from alcohol related disorders and alcohol related addiction. In 2015, about 66 million people reported that they'd engaged in at least one episode of binge drinking in the previous month. That's a pretty astounding number. And in 2015, roughly 28 million people reported that they had driven under the influence of drugs and alcohol. On what we can do to curb the addiction epidemic There are prevention strategies and treatment strategies that can address multiple substance use disorders. Some of these programs are school-based , college-campus-based, and community-based, some online and some in person. Many \u2014 particularly the school-based programs \u2014 teach children how to manage stress in a healthy way, because stress is one of the reasons people turn to substances like alcohol, illicit drugs and prescription painkillers. The programs also teach them about substances of misuse, and teach them how to refuse tobacco and alcohol and other illicit substances when they're offered. The problem that we have right now is that we're not implementing many of these evidence-based interventions. While we're calling people's attention to some pretty stark statistics, I also want to recognize that there are reasons to be hopeful. All across our country we have examples of communities that are starting to step up and implement prevention programs and treatment programs. And peoples' lives are changing as a result of that. We've been dealing with substance disorders for centuries. What's different now is that we have solutions that work. On continuing this work under the Trump administration People on both sides of the aisle state clearly and in unequivocal terms that substance use disorders are a problem that we have to address now, because they are tearing apart our communities. So I am hopeful that we are all on the same page when it comes to addressing this crisis \u2014 and addressing it urgently. I'm looking forward to working with the next administration to do so. ",

    "text": "Sports Sports Columnists Kris Bryant's MVP award another step on his way to Cooperstown Photos of Kris Bryant, the 2016 National League MVP and the Cubs' 2nd overall pick in the 2013 draft. About 10 years ago at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas, Frank Thomas met Mike Bryant through a mutual friend who also lived in Sin City. Thomas recalled Bryant started bragging about his teenage son, Kris, from their first conversation. \"I'd run into Mike and he kept telling me: 'My kid is special, Frank. He's big, powerful and fast,'\" the White Sox Hall of Famer recalled Thursday. \"You don't think anything of it because you hear that kind of stuff all the time.\" But not everything that happens in Vegas stays there. Some things are too big \u2014 like the Bryant kid who was the worst-kept baseball secret in town and grew up to be the Cubs star named Thursday as the National League 's most valuable player. Bryant earned 29 of 30 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy and Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager and fulfilling the promise his father never was shy about sharing. Time passed after Thomas' first meeting with Mike Bryant. Kris matured into a menacing hitter, and Thomas never saw the Bryants again until the 2015 Home Run Derby at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati. Kris Bryant has two All-Star selections, a Rookie of the Year award and a World Series championship to his name. On Thursday, the 24-year-old Cubs star added another major honor to the list \u2013 National League MVP . Bryant topped Nationals second baseman Daniel... Two seasons into his major-league career, Kris Bryant has two All-Star selections, a Rookie of the Year award and a World Series championship to his name. On Thursday, the 24-year-old Cubs star added another major honor to the list \u2013 National League MVP . Bryant topped Nationals second baseman Daniel... (Colleen Kane) Mike was warming up as his son's chosen pitcher. The proud father of the All-Star third baseman broke out in a big smile when he saw Thomas, in his role as a Fox Sports analyst, near the batting cage. \"We were both laughing, and Mike said, 'See, I told you my kid was good,'\" Thomas said. \"Great\" now more accurately describes Bryant, the deserving, runaway winner of the MVP award. Not since Sammy Sosa in 1998 has a Cub been so honored, and this one comes with an exclamation point instead of an asterisk. The only whispers about Bryant are people wondering whether he is too good to be true. With a textbook swing perfected in the batting cage Mike built in the family's backyard, Bryant blasted 39 home runs, drove in 102 runs, scored 121 runs and led the NL with 7.7 wins above replacement. He enhanced his value by playing five positions \u2014 third base (104 games), left field (50), right field (14), first base (eight) and center field (one) \u2014 which let Joe Maddon manage as if he had a de facto 27-man roster. Nor did Chicago hold a parade for the 2006 White Sox , whose championship path started changing when they traded Aaron Rowand 28 days after winning the 2005 World Series . And Chicago only remembers the 2004 Cubs , Sports Illustrated's preseason prediction to win the... Nobody honors the 1986 Bears . Nor did Chicago hold a parade for the 2006 White Sox , whose championship path started changing when they traded Aaron Rowand 28 days after winning the 2005 World Series . And Chicago only remembers the 2004 Cubs , Sports Illustrated's preseason prediction to win the... (David Haugh) And Bryant brought the same upbeat attitude to every position, brimming with enthusiasm that helps make him one of baseball's brightest and most approachable stars. That humility defines Bryant as much as any home run. It's not an act. Anybody who has spent more than 15 minutes with Bryant understands that. Ask Jimmy Kimmel, Ellen or the clubhouse guys at Wrigley Field. He is the rare player to whom the game always has come easy, yet he takes nothing and nobody for granted. Never have the Cubs drafted a more impactful player than the No. 2 selection in 2013 out of the University of San Diego. Older buddy Anthony Rizzo leads more naturally than Bryant, and more experienced teammates such as Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta command loads of respect. But winning the MVP confirms the face of the Cubs has sparkling blue eyes and a thin, scruffy beard. The Cubs could lose Dexter Fowler and Aroldis Chapman to free agency and still enter next season as World Series favorites. Take away Bryant, hypothetically, and it's a different story. \"You can't really put into words what this feels like ... an unbelievable year,\" said Bryant, 24. Nobody can relate to what Bryant felt when he received Thursday's news better than Thomas, who was 25 when he won his first of two consecutive American League MVP awards in 1993. Thomas chuckled when asked if Bryant's life ever will be the same now that he forever can be referred to as \"National League MVP Kris Bryant.\" This dynasty thing the Cubs are hoping to build isn't going to be easy, even if winning their first World Series since 1908 is a good first step. Only four days after the Cubs' parade, baseball's general managers met at a local hotel Tuesday to begin to try to end their reign at one year. \"I haven't... This dynasty thing the Cubs are hoping to build isn't going to be easy, even if winning their first World Series since 1908 is a good first step. Only four days after the Cubs' parade, baseball's general managers met at a local hotel Tuesday to begin to try to end their reign at one year. \"I haven't... (Paul Sullivan) \"It will change Kris because he's a soft-spoken guy,\" Thomas said. \"The expectations will be higher. The pressure will be different. There will be built-in distractions. I know he can handle them. It couldn't happen to a better guy. It's not going to change Kris Bryant the person, but he'll have to adjust a little.\" For Thomas, that meant taking on a more vocal role. Bryant handles the glare with more ease than Thomas did, but it will intensify. As that happens, handling success might challenge the Cubs as much as achieving it, testing even the most patient of superstars. \"He's the league MVP now, so he'll have to talk more,\" Thomas said. \"There were times I wanted to go away from it all. I'm sure you remember that. But you've got to face all you (media) guys now because there's a responsibility that comes with being MVP. He's ready for that.\" According to Thomas, Bryant is ready for anything \u2014 winning back-to-back MVPs as Thomas did, leading the Cubs to another World Series and one day even following Thomas' path to Cooperstown, N.Y. \"He's got that kind of ability, that temperament,\" Thomas said. \"And once you become MVP, a lot of confidence comes with that too. \"It's very early, but this kid could get into the Hall of Fame. All the positions he plays, how he runs so well for a big guy. He's the most unique player in baseball, something we haven't seen in a long time. ... What a special talent.\" At least Thomas was warned. dhaugh@chicagotribune.com ",

Higher alcohol taxes Alcohol tax policies get a nod in a section on evidence-based prevention: \u201cHigher alcohol taxes have also been shown to reduce alcohol consumption.\u201d Other policies suggested by research include limiting the density of stores selling alcohol, banning Sunday sales and holding bars liable for serving minors. What about marijuana? The report suggests learning from alcohol and tobacco policies to find out what works to minimize harm as marijuana becomes legal. Voters in eight states have approved adult use of recreational marijuana and more than two dozen states have medical marijuana laws. The report cites \u201ca growing body of research\u201d suggesting marijuana\u2019s chemicals can help with \u201cpain, nausea, epilepsy, obesity, wasting disease, addiction, autoimmune disorders, and other conditions.\u201d Murthy supports easing existing barriers to marijuana studies, but said Wednesday that he\u2019s worried the legalization movement is moving faster than research. \u201cMarijuana is in fact addictive,\u201d he said. Not a moral failing Addiction is a chronic illness, not a character flaw or a moral failing, the report says. Stigma and shame have kept people from seeking help and weakened public investment. Murthy issues a call to action in the preface: \u201cHow we respond to this crisis is a moral test for America. Are we a nation willing to take on an epidemic that is causing great human suffering and economic loss?\u201d Red state-blue state issue Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation passed this year that creates grants to expand treatment programs, said he hopes the report raises awareness. \u201cWe have to change the way we talk about addiction and break the stigma to help more Americans suffering from this disease get the treatment and recovery they need,\u201d Portman said. Addiction should be a bipartisan issue, said Democratic former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, an addiction treatment advocate. \u201cThis affects all of America, but it really affects the Trump voter,\u201d Kennedy said. Red states such as West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky have the highest overdose rates, Kennedy said. Enforcing laws that require insurers to cover addiction treatment will be a test of Trump\u2019s \u201cpromise to put average Americans ahead of corporate interests,\u201d said Kennedy. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The protesters walked from Trump's newly opened hotel at the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue and past the Capitol. (Nov. 15) AP Harrisonburg High School students, joined by members of the community, cross the street into Court Square to stage a demonstration against President-elect Donald Trump in Harrisonburg, Va., on Nov. 14, 2016. (Photo: Daniel Lin, AP) More than a week after the election of Donald Trump, educators are\u00a0struggling to contain\u00a0a cauldron of tensions bubbling up at many schools in the form of racial incidents and bullying. Just as the 2016 presidential election emboldened aggressive and sometimes hate-filled displays among adults, teachers\u00a0say\u00a0students have shown\u00a0some of the same behaviors. \"Those kids are terrified,\" \u00a0says Maureen Costello, director of the\u00a0 Teaching Tolerance \u00a0project at the\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\u00a0\"There's something very, very ugly, and it is erupting at schools, which are places where we just can't afford to let that happen.\" In Silverton, Ore., south of Portland, a high school suspended two students on Tuesday\u00a0who allegedly shouted\u00a0at Hispanic students, \"Pack your bags, you're leaving tomorrow!\" In Silver Spring, Md., near Washington, D.C.,\u00a0vandals late last week wrote \u201cKILL KILL KILL BLACKS\u201d on a bathroom wall at Sligo Creek Elementary School.\u00a0Maintenance personnel scrubbed the words off. In Georgia's Gwinnett County, a Muslim high school teacher posted to her Facebook page last\u00a0Friday that an anonymous student wrote, \"Your headscarf isn't allowed anymore. Why don't you tie it around your neck ... and hang yourself with it ... on your neck instead of your head!\" Costello said the\u00a0SPLC has been tracking the uptick in intolerance\u00a0at schools. \"We've been reporting for six or seven months now a rise in prejudice and bigotry being expressed in school, and teachers having a very, very hard time dealing with it,\" she\u00a0said. Though Trump's campaign has said he disavows hateful rhetoric, his victory on Nov. 8 has been a \"B12 shot\" to white students who share hateful or intolerant views, Costello said.\u00a0\"They are feeling energized and emboldened.\" The incidents put educators into a difficult position, she said. They must remind students that there are \"norms of decency\" in school, despite what students might be hearing at home or on TV. \"We're in uncharted territory.\" A few critics say\u00a0the reports may be overblown. In one case, a student at the\u00a0University of Louisiana in Lafayette, La., on Nov. 9 said two men, one of them wearing a white \u201cTrump\u201d hat, beat her and\u00a0ripped off her hijab. She later admitted she'd\u00a0fabricated the story. Elsewhere, the fact-checking website Snopes.com \u00a0pointed out last week that a widely circulated photo depicting a so-called Nov. 9 Ku Klux Klan victory celebration on a North Carolina highway overpass had no KKK affiliation. Snopes noted, however, that the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan had scheduled \"a separate victory parade\" for Dec. 3 in North Carolina. In the Georgia incident, teacher Mairah Teli said she shared the note on her Facebook page as a way to \u201craise awareness about the reality and climate of our community,\u201d\u00a0 WXIA-TV reported .\u00a0In a statement, the school district said,\u00a0\u201cA threat against a staff member is a serious matter and we are investigating this incident.\u201d In Lowell, Ind., about 50 miles southwest of Chicago, one parent\u00a0said\u00a0students at a local middle school chanted\u00a0\u201cBuild a wall!\u201d\u00a0in the cafeteria the day after the election. Throughout their lunch break, white students told Hispanic classmates that they had to sit at the other end of the cafeteria, parent Ashby Gurgon told the education news site The 74 Million . Gurgon said she heard about the incident during\u00a0\u201cemergency\" training with the district superintendent, Debra Howe. In a districtwide email to parents, Howe wrote that school officials observed \u201cdivisiveness and comments made that are making others fearful.\u201d Administrators in Columbus, Ind., Vice President-elect Mike Pence's hometown, called for respect this week after reports of Hispanic students being taunted with similar chants\u00a0recently, including on Election Day, the\u00a0 Chicago Tribune reported. The incidents have included several at\u00a0a Catholic high school in New York City, where teachers reported to\u00a0SPLC that: An African-American student was spat on the day after the election while\u00a0talking about the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement; \u00a0A\u00a0gay student was told, \"You better turn back straight if you want to survive in America.\" Reports like these have spurred\u00a0action by\u00a0some state officials. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf said Thursday that a rash of \"intolerant, racist incidents\" prompted him to create a \"safe schools response plan\" in which education and law enforcement officials will aid schools in addressing bad behavior. State Education Secretary Pedro Rivera said\u00a0schools \"must be safe and welcoming for all students, and no student should ever be made to feel that they are not a valued member of the school community.\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday\u00a0\u00a0created a statewide hotline to report hate incidents.\u00a0Cuomo said the increase\u00a0in\u00a0reports of discrimination, bias-motivated threats, harassment and violence prompted him to write to the state Education Department requesting that schools hold trainings \"to combat intolerance and safeguard New York\u2019s students.\" Post-election misbehavior has also claimed a few teachers.\u00a0In Tuscaloosa, Ala., the school district suspended a high school math teacher after he used a projector to show students an\u00a0image of Trump mocking President Obama,\u00a0 The Washington Post \u00a0reported. Following racist incidents at Pennsylvania schools, the Wolf Admin. has developed a safe schools response plan: https://t.co/O4SdqtdHbE pic.twitter.com/tcajMLpvRD \u2014 Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) November 17, 2016 The image copied the style and format of\u00a0Obama\u2019s \u201cHope\u201d posters: Beneath Trump\u2019s smiling face, the word \u201cHope\u201d was changed to \u201cObama, You\u2019re Fired!\" The incidents are befalling colleges as well, authoritees said.\u00a0Police in New York City this week were trying to find out who scrawled swastikas and profanity on a dorm room door at The New School in lower Manhattan.\u00a0Police\u00a0received the report around midnight Saturday;\u00a0the city's Hate Crimes Task Force was investigating. Student\u00a0Sam Lichtenstein said she broke down in tears when she discovered anti-Semitic symbols on her door's whiteboard. We opened up a statewide hotline number to report incidents of bias, because this state celebrates our differences. https://t.co/tFtSGKKu9Z \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 15, 2016 In a statement, New School President David Van Zandt said he'd \"take appropriate action to ensure the security and safety\" of all of its students. High school students across the country, many too young to vote, have also been taking to the streets to\u00a0protest Trump's policies. On Monday, hundreds of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District staged a walkout. \u201cAlthough it has been nearly a week since the presidential election, many students remain concerned about the outcome and want their voices to be heard,\u201d the district's Superintendent Michelle King said in a statement at the time.\u00a0\u201cThese are important conversations that need to take place. We want our students to know they are not alone.\u201d Stephanie Lowe, an art teacher at \u00c1nimo College Prep Academy , a charter high school in Los Angeles\u2019 Watts neighborhood,\u00a0said students there have displayed a range of emotions, from anger to fear to indifference, since Election Day. Riots devastated Watts in 1965, and presidents, she said, have come and gone, making promises for 50 years. For many African-American families, she said, \u201cnothing\u2019s changed here since 1965 \u2014 and the kids are uniquely aware of that. While this is a really important election, sometimes they\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re all worked up. It\u2019s really not going to matter to all of us.\u2019\u201d But talking to her Latino students, she said, \u201cThey\u2019re terrified. They\u2019re scared. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever been scared like that before.\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, 18, a senior, said she hasn\u2019t gotten harassed at school \u2014 the campus is focused on social justice and enrolls virtually 100% African-American and Latino students. But she has stopped posting on Instagram because \u201cI didn\u2019t really want that abuse from other people. I feel targeted just by posting, \u2018Viva Mexico\u2019 or \u2018I love Mexico.\u2019\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s younger sister Patricia, 16, a junior at \u00c1nimo, agreed. \u201cPeople do come at me if I post anything about, \u2018United We Stand\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019re going to be proud of where we come from.\u2019\" she said. \"I do get a lot of that thrown at me and it\u2019s sad.\u201d The pair have helped organize rallies since the election, including an eight-mile march to downtown Los Angeles this week protesting Trump's election. \u201cIt\u2019s for him to know: 'You know what? We\u2019re here, and be wise on what you\u2019re going to say, because we\u2019re going to fight,'\u201d Patricia said. Reflecting on the abuse she and others have experienced on social media, she pleaded with young people: \u201cBe a little bit smarter about what you say.\u201d Follow Anne Godlasky on Twitter: @annieisi ; Follow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo 12987 CONNECT TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 79 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g38m8b ",

(AP/John Minchillo) Former House speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday he will not serve in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cI want to be free to network across the whole system and look at what we have to do to succeed,\u201d Gingrich said when briefly reached by phone. Holding a Cabinet post would have been \u201cnot physically doable,\u201d he said. The remarks from the former GOP presidential candidate, 73, came after he told McClatchy he intends to focus on \u201cstrategic planning\u201d during the Trump administration rather than run a federal department. The former House speaker said he does not plan to hold any official role under Trump. Gingrich\u2019s name had been mentioned for health and human services secretary and secretary of state. An active surrogate for Trump during the campaign, the former Georgia Republican lawmaker was long expected to take a role in the administration. \u201cNew Gingrich is going to be involved in our government,\u201d Trump said on the campaign trail in July. \u00a0 ",

By Greg Jaffe November 17 at 5:50 PM Follow @GregJaffe In the days after President-elect Donald Trump appointed a far-right senior adviser to his White House staff, the Anti-Defamation League sent out a searing condemnation. The appointment of Stephen K. Bannon to a top White House job was an act \u201chostile to core American values,\u201d the group said. The more conservative Zionist Organization of America also mounted an attack. But its target was the ADL, which it accused of engaging in \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d It has invited Bannon to speak at its annual gala in New York on Sunday. Most of the rest of the major Jewish groups in Washington, eager to maintain influence with a Trump administration and unsure about the extent of Bannon\u2019s ties to the white nationalist movement, have stayed silent. Among the country\u2019s leading Jewish organizations, Trump\u2019s election has provoked an unusual level of angst and uncertainty, widening the rifts among groups that have largely tried to stay out of partisan political fights. The debate has divided those who believe the Jewish community\u2019s support for Israel requires leaders to build good relations with the new president from those who argue that Jewish groups should speak out against views they see as anti-Semitic. \u201cIt has been disappointing to watch organizations in the American Jewish community avoid comment,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, a former member of the U.S. team working on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Obama. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of building political influence if not for a situation like this?\u201d Before Stephen K. Bannon became a close adviser to Donald Trump, he hosted \u201cBreitbart News Daily,\u201d a radio show, on which he interviewed Trump nine times. The Washington Post\u2019s David A. Fahrenthold discusses what those interviews tell us about their relationship. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) For the moment, most Jewish groups \u2014 especially those focused on the security of Israel \u2014 are asking a different question. They are wondering at what point, if any, they will feel compelled to take a stand against Trump\u2019s connections to the alt-right movement, a far-right ideology that includes opposition to immigration and globalism. Those views have found a home in the Breitbart News empire, which was led by Bannon before he joined Trump\u2019s campaign. The movement has attracted support from white nationalists, although Bannon has said it is not racist. \u201cThere are lots of questions and concerns and a lot I would like to say,\u201d said a senior executive of a group focused on the U.S.-Israeli relationship, who like some other Jewish organizational leaders, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \u201cBut I have a mission and a job to do, and I can\u2019t blow it up.\u201d Other groups have taken a slightly more forward-leaning posture. The Israel Policy Forum, which has advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about Bannon, describing him as \u201csomeone who has purveyed ugly and divisive rhetoric.\u201d \u201cAt what point do you set aside the mission?\u201d asked David Halperin, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe challenge is: How do we balance our desire to wait and be a positive influence [on a Trump administration] versus expressing our concern when it is absolutely necessary?\u201d The uncertainty among Jewish groups reflects the contradictions of Trump, a 70-year-old political neophyte with little experience in foreign affairs and virtually no policy record. Some Jewish leaders, pointing to painful lessons of history, expressed discomfort with the rise of a populist figure who seemed to embrace authoritarian tendencies. Others objected to Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States as an unconstitutional religious test and decried as anti-Semitic a Trump campaign tweet that portrayed a red Star of David shape over a stack of $100 bills, an image that had origins in the online white-supremacist movement. But Trump has won accolades from some groups for his consistently strong support for Israel\u2019s security. Some of those views \u201cwould seem to outflank even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\u201d the Forward, a Jewish newspaper, recently opined. And many American Jewish leaders are heartened that Trump takes close counsel from Jared Kushner, his Orthodox Jewish son-in-law, and from his daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism. \u201cTrump is pretty clearly not an anti-Semite \u2014 look at his family, for goodness sake,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a senior official in the George W. Bush administration who is an outspoken Trump critic and an Orthodox Jew. Some more politically conservative Jews were attracted to Trump\u2019s stances on social issues, such as school choice and freedom of religion. Many also were drawn to Trump for his fierce opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The agreement was strongly opposed by the Israeli prime minister, who argued that it did not do enough to constrain Iranian aggression in the region or permanently dismantle Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump also has suggested that he would not pressure Netanyahu to halt West Bank settlement construction, a major point of contention between Israel and the Obama administration. Many of these supporters will judge Trump primarily through the lens of how he manages the relationship with Israel, said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center. \u201cThey will be looking for Trump and his administration to follow through,\u201d Diament said. But, as with many Trump policies, even the president-elect\u2019s staunch professions of support for Israel come with questions and contradictions. Trump\u2019s courtship of Russia, his intimations of support for the Syrian regime, and his suggestions that the United States should play a less-prominent role in the Middle East all could run counter to Israeli interests. \u201cIsrael wants a strong United States in the region, not [an America] disengaged from it,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a senior adviser on the Middle East to Republican and Democratic administrations. In other instances, Trump has suggested that his policies regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and settlements might be negotiable. \u201cHe talks about this being the ultimate deal,\u201d Ross said. The general confusion about Trump is straining relationships within the Jewish community. Some of the breakdowns are taking place along normal political lines, which have grown more pronounced as the country has become more polarized. In other instances, differences have sprung up between groups focused on the defense of Israel and those focused on combating anti-Semitism. The Republican Jewish Coalition has slammed the Anti-Defamation League as going too far in its criticism of Bannon and some of the Trump campaign\u2019s rhetoric, which the ADL said relied on classic anti-Semitic tropes. The ADL has defended its actions and vowed to call out anti-Semitism and racism. The controversy also has exposed the increasingly divergent worldviews and priorities of American and Israeli Jews. Many Israeli Jews view a Trump presidency through a \u201cpragmatic policy\u201d lens, focused on the security of the Jewish state, Halperin said. American Jews, meanwhile, are more worried about civil liberties and the people representing their country, he added. Chief among those groups counseling patience has been the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has declined to comment on the Bannon appointment. So far, most other Jewish groups with influence in Washington have taken the same stance as AIPAC. That has left the ADL and its new leader, Jonathan Greenblatt, as the most outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s selection of Bannon. \u201cIt is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the \u2018alt-right\u2019 \u2014 a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists \u2014 is slated to be a senior staff member in the \u2018peoples\u2019 house,\u201d Greenblatt said in a statement. Greenblatt, a former Obama administration official, has said that his stance is nothing new for a group that in earlier decades fought for civil rights in the South and took on the anti-communist crusader Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare in the 1950s. Greenblatt took over the ADL from Abraham Foxman, whose view of the ADL\u2019s work was defined by his own history as a Holocaust survivor. Greenblatt, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, is aiming to update the group without fundamentally altering its core mission. One view into how a Trump presidency might shape the group could come this week in New York when the ADL holds its \u201cNever Is Now\u201d summit on anti-Semitism. The two-day conference is to include several panels with topics drawn directly from the contentious election campaign, including a \u201cConversation on Hate Online\u201d with prominent political journalists and a discussion of \u201cPepe the Frog,\u201d an Internet meme popular with some white nationalists and some Trump supporters. One more sign of the times: The conference is expected to draw more than 1,000 people. \u201cWe are turning people away,\u201d said Todd Gutnick, an ADL spokesman. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "By Shanika Gunaratna CBS News November 17, 2016, 1:06 PM Facebook fake news creator claims he put Trump in White House President-elect Donald Trump during his election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. John Locher, AP Email Paul Horner \u2014 the 38-year-old self-made titan of a fake news empire on Facebook \u2014 is claiming responsibility for pushing Donald Trump to the White House, and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news.\u00a0 In an interview with\u00a0 The Washington Post , Horner attributed his success to Trumps\u2019 particular base of supporters. He is the man behind such viral headlines as \u201cThe Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cPresident Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwide\u201d \u2014 neither of which were true. \u201cMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don\u2019t fact-check anything \u2014 they\u2019ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist,\u201d he told The Washington Post. Google and Facebook are taking aim at fake news stories by banning fake news sites from using ad platforms. Editor from the NewYorker.com Nick Th... Horner\u2019s fake news articles \u2014 published on sites designed to mimic the look and feel of well-known, legitimate news outlets \u2014 had enormous impact this election cycle. Even members of Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle, including Trump\u2019s son Eric and then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, shared links to Horner\u2019s content. Horner\u2019s stories also made their way to Google News, known to feature stories from reputable news sources.\u00a0 \u201cHonestly, people are definitely dumber,\u201d Horner told The Post to explain the popularity of his content, which he suggested he sees as satire akin to The Onion. \u201cNobody fact-checks anything anymore \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn\u2019t care because they\u2019d already accepted it. It\u2019s real scary.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t do it for ideological reasons. \u201cI hate Trump,\u201d he told The Post.\u00a0\u201cI thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn\u2019t messing them up as much as I wanted \u2014 but I never thought he\u2019d actually get elected.\u201d In a new analysis of the last three months of campaign coverage, BuzzFeed News concluded that top fake election news stories generated more engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined, including the New York Times, Fox News and CBS News.\u00a0 A fake news story about Megyn Kelly's relationship with Fox News was one of the top trending stories on Facebook. CNET's Dan Ackerman explains ho... According to BuzzFeed, among the top 20 fake election-related articles on Facebook, most had a political bent that favored the Trump campaign; all but three were anti-Clinton or pro-Trump. Facebook users engaged with them more than 8.7 million times. The news media and several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have been grappling with what to do about the rise of fake news for months, but the crisis  has come to a head in the wake of the election.\u00a0 This week, Google announced it will withhold digital ads from appearing on sites that \u201cmisrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.\u201d Meanwhile, Facebook released new language for its ad policies that govern third-party mobile apps and sites: \u201cWe do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal,\u00a0 misleading or deceptive , which includes fake news,\u201d the company said. Fake news was not explicitly  spelled out in Facebook\u2019s policies before.\u00a0 Asked whether the potential crackdown could hurt his business, Horner suggested he will find ways to keep publishing. \u201cI have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I\u2019ll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I\u2019d be okay,\u201d he told The Post. On Twitter, several journalists suggested the proliferation of fake news is simply taking advantage of a much larger issue \u2014 a challenge to reporters and readers alike.\u00a0 Fake news is just a symptom. The disease is the atrophying of due diligence, skepticism, and critical thinking. https://t.co/Lq3FMrW02v ",

    "text": "Nov 17 2016, 11:24 am ET Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Resigns by Ken Dilanian and Corky Siemaszko Share James Clapper Announces Resignation at House Hearing 0:51 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161117232709if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/811367491577\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Director of National Intelligence James Clapper delivered some reassurance Thursday to Americans worried about the Trump transition \u2014 along with his resignation. \"I know a lot of people have been feeling uncertain about what will happen with this Presidential transition,\" Clapper said. \"There has been a lot of catastrophizing, if I can use that term, in the 24-hour news cycle and social media. So, I'm here with a message: It will be okay.\" The exit of Clapper, who submitted his resignation Wednesday evening, is not a surprise. As required of all appointed Administration officials, DNI Clapper has signed a letter of resignation effective at noon on Jan 20, 2017. \u2014 Office of the DNI (@ODNIgov) November 17, 2016 In interviews with NBC News over the last year, Clapper said he was counting down the days to stepping down at the end of Obama's final term in office. He started as a young intelligence officer reporting to his father during the Vietnam War and said that after than 50 years of service it was time to go. Clapper's resignation, which is effective Jan. 17, comes as the Trump team has been struggling to put together a cabinet and mulling what's likely to be a change in national securit y direction once Obama departs. In testimony to the House Select Intelligence Committee, Clapper said submitting the resignation \"felt pretty good.\" But soon it was back to politics. And Clapper found himself fielding a question from Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, about FBI director James Comey's sudden announcement \u2014 in the final days of the presidential campaign \u2014 that he was reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Calling Comey's move an \"unprecedented intrusion by a director within our own intelligence community in our democratic process,\" Castro asked Clapper if \"you believe that Director Comey breached any protocol.\" \"I have no reason to question Director Comey,\" Clapper replied. \"I think extremely highly of him so whatever actions he took he did so what he felt was best and I have no basis for questioning him.\" Clapper's job is to oversee Comey's FBI and 16 other intelligence agencies, including the CIA, NSA (National Security Agency) and the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency). Appointed by Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2010, Clapper's tenure in office was marked by high profile showdowns over the government's desire to protect its Americans and citizens' civil liberties. During a tense March 2013 exchange with Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden over whether the NSA gathers \"any type of data at all on millions of Americans,\" Clapper responded \"no\" and \"not wittingly.\" Then in June of that year, The Guardian published documents leaked by whistle blower Edward Snowden, including a top secret court order showing that the NSA had collected phone records from over 120 million subscribers. Snowden later told Wired magazine that it was Clapper's testimony that prompted him to leak the documents. In a 2013 interview with Andrea Mitchell, Clapper said he gave the \" least untruthful \" response to a complicated question. But Wyden, a Democrat, accused Clapper of \"not giving a straight answer.\" And Rep. Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican, flat-out accused Clapper of committing perjury. Clapper later suffered the indignity of having his own personal accounts hacked by a hacker named \"Cracka.\" In October, Clapper's office released a statement claiming Russia was directly involved in a cyber campaign designed to disrupt the presidential election. It said the operation was likely approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite having been personally briefed by U.S. officials on Russia's role in the hacks, Trump during one of the debates said he didn't know if Moscow was behind the hacking and insisted it \"could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds , OK?\" In a statement, Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) praised Clapper's leadership, saying he \"provided steady leadership for the Intelligence Community and wise counsel to the President and the Congress.\" Ken Dilanian ",

    "text": "Email BERLIN, Ala. \u2014\u00a0An Alabama man has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for killing his daughter\u2019s sexual abuser. The Cullman Times reports that the 43-year-old man was sentenced Monday in a Cullman County courtroom after pleading guilty to murder in the June 2014 slaying of 59-year-old Raymond Earl Brooks. Brooks pleaded guilty in 2002 to sexually abusing the man\u2019s young daughter. The daughter, now 24 and a mother of three, was 8 when Brooks was arrested and accused of sexually abusing her repeatedly over the course of several years. He served 27 months of a five-year sentence and paid restitution.\u00a0 Authorities say the father shot at a man who had been dating his stepdaughter, but the man was able to hide inside a convenience store. The father then drove to Brooks\u2019 home, where he killed him. He will serve a separate 20-year sentence concurrently for the first shooting. AL.com reports that the father agreed to the plea deal and 40-year sentence to protect his daughter from having to testify at trial.\u00a0 CBS News typically does not name victims of sexual assault and is not using the father\u2019s name to protect his daughter\u2019s identity.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
