    "text": "CBS News Nov 11, 2016 5:52 PM EST Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is pushing back against charges that the proliferation of fake news on Facebook was one of the factors that contributed to Donald Trump\u2019s meteoric rise to the White House.\u00a0 \u201cTo think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\u201d Zuckerberg said Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. He insisted only a \u201csmall amount\u201d of fake news circulated on Facebook during this campaign, an unprecedented race that unfolded on social media as much as it unfolded on the physical campaign trail.\u00a0 Zuckerberg\u2019s strongly worded dismissal is unlikely to end the controversy over fake news on Facebook. Nearly half of Americans get their news from the social network, according to the Pew Research Center. His comments add another layer to the increasingly complicated and consequential conversation about the role that fake news plays in today\u2019s divided media landscape. Zuckerberg argued the focus on fake news stories planted by groups seeking to profit from page views or sway public opinion just distracts people from examining the real reasons Donald Trump won enough support to pull off a historic election upset.\u00a0 \u201cI do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is they saw some fake news,\u201d Zuckerberg said, according to USA Today. \u201cIf you believe that, then I don\u2019t think you have internalized the message the Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.\u201d In a statement, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, struck a different tone, and acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s so much more\u201d the company needs to do to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform. Facebook apologizes for \"trending\" fake news story For some in Silicon Valley, the criticism of Facebook feels more than appropriate. \u201cIt is a very good thing if people in Silicon Valley are contemplating the consequences of the inventions they delivered to an unsuspecting world,\u201d Silicon Valley forecaster Paul Saffo told USA Today . \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s any reflection going on at all is a very good sign. There has long been this naive view that technology is neutral and there\u2019s nothing neutral about technology. The problem is we can never figure out which way it\u2019s going to cut until it arrives.\u201d President Obama himself called out Facebook at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton on the eve of the election. \u201cPeople, if they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it\u2019s on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it\u2019s on social media, people start believing it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.\u201d Fake stories have long run rampant on Facebook \u2014 both on users\u2019 News Feeds , as users share content from inauthentic news sites to their personal networks, and on Trending Topics , the homepage module on Facebook\u2019s desktop site that presents viral stories of the moment. (Speaking of misinformation: Just today, Facebook was rocked by an apparent bug that led to numerous users being told, mistakenly, that their friends were dead via memorial banners on their profiles.)\u00a0 Facebook has little control over what users themselves share to their own networks. Its algorithm promotes content based on engagement levels, and Facebook doesn\u2019t make any kind of \u201cvalue judgment\u201d on the nature of the content that\u2019s being shared, CNET editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News.\u00a0 Mark Zuckerberg tops Fortune's Businessperson of the Year But recent investigative pieces have pulled back the curtain on the vast landscape of highly partisan operations that live only on Facebook and gained extraordinary momentum this campaign season. These hundreds of pages, from Occupy Democrats to Fed-Up Americans to RightAlerts to Addicting Info, represent the \u201cmost disruptive, least understood force in media,\u201d The New York Times wrote in August. \u00a0 Facebook has somewhat clearer control over Trending Topics, a feature that has been under fire in recent months for showcasing both conspiracy theories and false news reports. Facebook, which once employed a team of news curators to monitor and edit the Trending Topics section, laid off that team after an ex-staffer made anonymous claims that the section showed a\u00a0 consistent bias against conservative-interest news stories . Since August, Trending Topics has been controlled by algorithm rather than human curators. That move, however, did not mean the end to Facebook\u2019s headaches.\u00a0 In August, Facebook apologized after Trending Topics promoted a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose critical coverage of Donald Trump led the GOP nominee to launch a targeted campaign against her. The story, which falsely claimed that the cable channel had fired Kelly for being \u201ca closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win,\u201d was from the right-wing website End The Fed.\u00a0 In September, news organizations and social media users sounded the alarm after Facebook\u2019s Trending section promoted a so-called \u201c9/11 truther\u201d circulating the false claim that bombs and not terrorist-piloted planes brought down the Twin Towers in Manhattan. Under fire, Facebook removed the story from its Trending section. Social media\u2019s impact in shaping public perception and civic engagement is undeniable. Twenty percent of people surveyed say they have modified a personal stance because of content they saw on social media, according to the Pew Research Center. President-Elect Donald Trump\u2019s largest megaphone this campaign was his Twitter account . Facebook seems to be trying to have it both ways, Ackerman told CBS News. \u201cThe paradox for Facebook and Zuckerberg is this: They want to claim very loudly that Facebook is very influential when it comes to choosing what car you\u2019re going to buy, what phone you\u2019re going to buy, what movie you\u2019re going to go see,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cAnd then they want to say they\u2019re not really influential when it comes to these news stories affecting people\u2019s election choices.\u201d\u00a0 Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, issued a call for Facebook to take more responsibility for the proliferation of obvious propaganda on its platform. \u201cFacebook, now the most influential and powerful publisher in the world, is becoming the \u201cI didn\u2019t do it\u201d boy of global media,\u201d she wrote. \u201cClinton supporters and Trump detractors are searching for reasons why a candidate who lied so frequently and so flagrantly could have made it to the highest office in the land. News organizations, particularly cable news, are shouldering part of the blame for failing to report these lies for what they were. But a largely hidden sphere of propagandistic pages that target and populate the outer reaches of political Facebook are arguably even more responsible.\u201d With more than one billion active daily users, Facebook is the world\u2019s biggest distributor of information. \u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story The show was a self-aware parody of Ian Fleming\u2019s creation James Bond, who had been played by Sean Connery in two hit movies by the time \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d made its debut. (Fleming served as an adviser to the show, and is widely credited with coining the name Napoleon Solo.) \u201cThe whole show is a joke. It\u2019s an extension of the Bond joke into a gigantic cartoon in prime time,\u201d Mr. Vaughn told The Saturday Evening Post in an 1965 interview, to which, the magazine noted, he arrived wearing a custom-tailored Italian suit and a black silk tie. Photo No character Mr. Vaughn played was as popular as Napoleon Solo. From 1964 to 1968, millions of Americas tuned in weekly to \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d Credit Associated Press Joke or not, the show was wildly popular and catapulted Mr. Vaughn into overnight fame. It was also a platform for many other acting careers, most notably that of David McCallum, the Scottish actor who played Illya Kuryakin, the enigmatic Russian spy and Solo sidekick who developed a big fan following of his own. Kurt Russell (at age 10), Leslie Nielsen and Joan Collins all appeared on the show. In the first season, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, who would co-star on \u201cStar Trek\u201d two years later, had roles in the same episode. Despite his acclaim, Mr. Vaughn could be a little disdainful about his vocation. \u201cActing has always been very boring to me,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cAnyone not in television to become a millionaire is a simpleton.\u201d At the time, Mr. Vaughn was seemingly more focused on politics than show business: He often spoke publicly against the war in Vietnam. \u201cIn our fervor to halt the potential spread of totalitarianism, what incredible precedent are we setting in Vietnam?\u201d he asked in an impassioned speech. \u201cBy marching our legions through the countryside of foreign continents, burning homes, laying waste to the land and indiscriminately killing friend and foe alike?\u201d Mr. Vaughn became national chairman of an organization called Dissenting Democrats in 1967 and debated the war with William F. Buckley Jr. on Mr. Buckley\u2019s television program, \u201cFiring Line\u201d \u2014 a bout that Newsday, on Long Island, said Mr. Vaughn had won. \u201cVaughn suffered no wounds from Buckley\u2019s expert needling,\u201d the newspaper said.

Kennedy and was a frequent guest at Hickory Hill, Kennedy\u2019s estate in McLean, Va., where Mr. Vaughn played touch football with luminaries like the writer Art Buchwald and the astronaut John Glenn. The Kennedys, Mr. Vaughn wrote in his name-dropping autobiography, \u201cA Fortunate Life\u201d (2008), were big fans. \u201cThe house was covered with U.N.C.L.E. posters inside and out,\u201d he reported, \u201cincluding pictures of me with my Walther P38 at the ready.\u201d Photo Robert Vaughn, third from right, in the 1960 film \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d with, from left, Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Charles Bronson, Brad Dexter and James Coburn. Credit MGM Studios Robert Francis Vaughn was born on Nov. 22, 1932, in New York City into a theatrically inclined household. His father, Gerald Walter Vaughn, was heard on radio series like \u201cGangbusters\u201d and \u201cCrime Doctor,\u201d and his mother, the former Marcella Gaudel, appeared in a 1931 Broadway production of \u201cDracula.\u201d The couple divorced when Mr. Vaughn was an infant and he moved with his mother to Minneapolis, where he was partly reared by grandparents. \u201cI was a complete wreck as a child, emotionally unstable, excessively prideful,\u201d he told The Sunday News of New York in a 1965 interview. When he was with his mother, she pushed his acting career, teaching him to recite the \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d soliloquy from \u201cHamlet\u201d when he was 5. While she was working as a cocktail waitress in a Chicago bar to earn extra money, his mother had young Robert perform the soliloquy for John Barrymore after Barrymore had dropped by. She later helped get her son cast on radio shows like \u201cLet\u2019s Pretend\u201d and \u201cJack Armstrong, the All-American Boy.\u201d Mr. Vaughn headed to Hollywood in 1952. During the day, he studied theater arts at Los Angeles City College and played bit parts, including a Hebrew slave in the movie epic \u201cThe Ten Commandments.\u201d At night he would go to local hot spots and hobnob with other aspirants and the occasional star. He hung out with Johnny Carson, dated Natalie Wood and knocked back Cutty Sark at 2 a.m. with Bette Davis. He also befriended a young James Coburn and took credit for getting him a role in \u201cThe Magnificent Seven.\u201d After he graduated from college in 1956, Mr. Vaughn signed with Columbia Pictures for $15,000 a role. His career was temporarily waylaid when he was drafted; he served uneventfully as a drill sergeant in the Army and was discharged after 18 months.

He kept busy afterward, appearing on numerous TV shows and in movies like \u201cBullitt\u201d (1968) and \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d (1974). He also traveled extensively. He was in Prague in 1968 when Soviet tanks rolled into the city to suppress the local reform movement. Photo Mr. Vaughn continued to work as an actor into his 80s. In 2012 he appeared on the British television series, \u201cHustle.\u201d Credit BBC Mr. Vaughn earned a doctorate in communications from the University of Southern California in the mid-1960s. His dissertation, \u201cThe Influence of the House Committee on Un-American Activities on the American Theater 1938-58,\u201d was published as a book, \u201cOnly Victims,\u201d in 1972. But the farther away he got from \u201cU.N.C.L.E.,\u201d the more Mr. Vaughn found himself taking roles that he characterized as \u201cnot quality,\u201d among them a millionaire looking to dominate the world through computers in \u201cSuperman III\u201d (1983) and a mercenary in \u201cBattle Beyond the Stars\u201d (1980), a low-budget science fiction epic conceived of as \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d in space. In the late 1980s he acted as pitchman in an infomercial for the Helsinki Formula, which claimed to be a cure for baldness. The Federal Trade Commission eventually prevented the manufacturers from making this claim, but by then they had sold $100 million worth of the product. In a 1993 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Vaughn was unapologetic about his work as a Helsinki Formula spokesman. \u201cThat was about the most profitable thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery call that came in on the 800 number, I got a piece of that.\u201d During one of his rare returns to stage acting, he appeared in a production of \u201cThe Tender Trap\u201d in Chicago in 1970. Also in the cast was the actress Linda Staab, whom he married in 1974 and who survives him. With his Hollywood stature on the decline, they moved to a castle-like stone home in Ridgefield, Conn., in 1981. Mr. Vaughn\u2019s survivors also include a daughter, Caitlin Vaughn; a son, Cassidy; and two grandchildren. Mr. Vaughn continued to work as an actor into his 80s. In 2012 he appeared on two British television series, \u201cHustle\u201d and \u201cCoronation Street.\u201d He was seen on an episode of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d last year.

Time President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with Vice President-elect Mike Pence during his election night rally on Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (Photo: John Locher, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President-in-waiting Mike Pence will take over a Donald Trump transition team that includes high-profile advisers, donors, congressional lawmakers and three of his children, the president-elect's team said Friday. Pence will replace New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who will instead serve on the transition executive committee as a vice chairman. \u201cThe mission of our team will be clear,\" Trump said in a statement: \"Put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington. Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation \u2014\u00a0specifically jobs, security and opportunity.\" A day after meeting with President Obama, Trump also disclosed he would consider keeping some provisions of the \"Obamacare\" health care law he savaged on the campaign trail. Those provisions, he told The Wall Street Journal, include requirements for coverage of people with pre-existing conditions and allowing parents to keep young adult children on their policies. Trump announced formation of a \"Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee,\" a group of congressional lawmakers, campaign staff members, state\u00a0officials, and the president-elect's children\u00a0Donald, Eric, and Ivanka, as well as son-in-law Jared Kushner. The transition team's \"staff leadership\" includes campaign officials such as Kellyanne Conway, David Bossie, Hope Hicks, and Jason Miller. Heading up this effort is Pence, whose new title is chairman of the Presidential Transition Team. His vice chairs are high-profile Trump backers: Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, retired Lt. Gen.\u00a0Michael Flynn, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama will all serve as vice chairs, along with Christie. Who will be in Trump's Cabinet? A few possibilities The\u00a0 New York Times , which first reported Pence's new role, said Trump \"told advisers he wanted to tap Mr. Pence\u2019s Washington experience and contacts to help move the process along.\" \u201cPresident-elect Trump will bring about fundamental change in Washington, and these are the right people to make that happen,\u201d Pence said in a statement. While Trump praised Christie's performance as initial transitional chairman, the New Jersey governor is an awkward position. Former aides were recently convicted in connection with the political motives behind a 2013\u00a0closure of lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge. Trump also said that the transition's team executive director will be Rick Dearborn, chief of staff to Sessions. The announcement came as Trump huddled with advisers and returned to\u00a0social media while putting together a new administration. \"Busy day planned in New York,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!\" Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 Among the aides spotted entering Trump Tower on Friday: campaign CEO Steve Bannon, Bossie, Hicks, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski,  Miller, senior adviser Stephen Miller, and top surrogate and Giuliani. Trump, who had been more understated on Twitter heading into Tuesday's election, also returned to social media to criticize some of the demonstrators who have taken to the streets in protest of his victory . They include huge crowds who have\u00a0gathered in front of Trump Tower. \"Just had a very open and successful presidential election,\" Trump tweeted overnight. \"Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\" ",

    "text": "WATCH Trade: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Standing in front of a wall of metal and recycled cans, Donald Trump told workers at a Pennsylvania recycling facility in June that he planned to scrap or renegotiate key trade deals in order to \u201cget a better deal.\u201d The now-president-elect specifically called out the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) then, as he did on multiple occasions throughout the presidential campaign . TPP: What Exactly Is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? \u201cI am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d he said at the recycling plant, before adding: \u201cI am going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to negotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal -- by a lot, not just a little, by a lot -- for our workers.\u201d This trade-skeptical rhetoric may have been welcomed by many: A survey by the Pew Research Center published in April showed that 49 percent of Americans believe that U.S. involvement in the global economy was a bad thing. In 69 days, Trump will take the Oath of Office and assume the power of the presidency, granting him the ability to try to execute his proposals, which could have resounding effects on international politics and the world economy. Will Trump be able to renegotiate or back out of both deals? And if he does, what would the effect be? ABC News spoke to experts to get their take. TPP: Basically 'Dead' \u201cNAFTA and TPP are totally different,\u201d Derek Scissors, an economist and resident scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told ABC News today. \u201cTPP is dead.\u201d The key difference, Scissors said, is that TPP has yet to be ratified by Congress, whereas NAFTA is a longstanding trade deal that has been in effect for over two decades. \u201cThe TPP is 99 percent or more killed by Trump winning. Congress can technically, of course, pass it in the lame duck, but they didn\u2019t want to pass it anyway,\u201d said Scissors, noting that opposition to the bill was present among members of Congress well before the election. And for the deal to be \u201cdead,\u201d President-elect Trump doesn\u2019t really have to do anything. Jon Lieber, U.S. director at the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy company, echoed Scissors in saying that \u201csince the U.S. hasn\u2019t ratified it, [Trump] can just declare that the U.S. is no longer involved and it will be a dead letter in the U.S.\" He added: \u201cI expect he\u2019ll do that. It\u2019s effectively done.\u201d While the decision to leave behind the TPP will be welcomed by large swaths of the American public who believe free-trade deals have led to the erosion of manufacturing jobs as well as other negative economic outcomes, experts warned that it could damage the America's standing on the world stage. For one, experts said it could diminish the U.S.'s credibility for negotiating other deals and treaties -- economic or otherwise -- in the future. \u201cSome trade partners would be very disappointed if the U.S. withdraws from [the TPP] and it would become more difficult for the U.S. to initiate other international economic and trade agreements or arrangements,\u201d said Jiawen Yang, professor of international business and international affairs at George Washington University. Scissors said that withdrawing from the TPP would have a negligible effect on the economy because \u201cnothing about TPP that changes what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d But he agreed with Yang on the geopolitical aspect, saying \u201cAmerican credibility is going to be hurt by TPP dying, there\u2019s no way to avoid it.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to negotiate with the U.S., you have to have this in the back of your mind,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say: \u2018Am I going to get this? Are they going to elect another president that will reverse course? Is Congress going to support President Trump?\u2019\u201d Leaving behind TPP could also prove an advantage to China, said Lieber. \u201cThe TPP was really all about China, and the U.S. trying to create a regional trading bloc that would project U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific as a bulwark against Chinese influence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe partner countries are going to have to look inwardly and also to China, who, as the second biggest economy in the world, is actively trying to promote their influence throughout the region.\u201d He added that investment opportunities that U.S. companies may have had in the Asian region could now go to Chinese firms. There are signs that Lieber\u2019s theory may already be playing out. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that Chinese President Xi Jinping was \u201crekindling efforts to promote a rival to the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory.\u201d NAFTA: Another Story In his June speech at the recycling plant, Trump said that if Mexico and Canada did not play ball in his bid to renegotiate the treaty, then he would \u201csubmit under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.\u201d \u201cTrade negotiations only work sometimes with swords over people's heads. But that\u2019s a pretty heavy sword,\u201d said Scissors. That article provides member countries the ability to exit the agreement six months after it gives the other members written notice of its intentions to do so. The agreement will remain in force between Canada and Mexico, should the U.S. choose to exit. But invoking Article 2205 might not be as easy as it seems. \u201cThere is an open legal question whether the president needs Congress to withdraw or not,\u201d said Lieber. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if withdrawing from trade bills have to be ratified by Congress.\u201d He added that Congress passed a number of bills in order to implement NAFTA, saying: \u201cWe do know that he can\u2019t unilaterally repeal the implementing bills that came along with that.\u201d Moreover, the agreement is firmly entrenched, having been in force for more than two decades, during which time companies have made decisions under the assumption that NAFTA is here to stay. \u201cSupply chains for a number of U.S.-based manufacturers are fully integrated across the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d Lieber said. \u201cWithdrawing from NAFTA would be much more disruptive than withdrawing from TPP.\u201d He added that companies, like automakers, that conduct business across the northern and southern borders would likely sue to stop the invocation of the withdrawal article. But even if Trump could push past the red tape and begin a withdrawal process, what would it mean for the average American? \u201cThe stock market would certainly respond, [and] the automakers and other beneficiaries would certainly take a hit,\u201d Lieber said. If markets did take a sustained hit, it could affect people\u2019s retirement savings. And if automakers were deeply affected, the United States could see a \u201closs of domestic jobs as the cost of manufacturing [would have] now gone up,\u201d Lieber said. Even closer to home, Americans could see an increase in the prices of certain produce and nuts that are now regularly imported from our southern neighbor. Lieber pointed to avocados specifically. But the good news for guacamole lovers is that reports in recent days suggest that both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have signaled their interest in opening a dialogue with Trump. And Trump appears to have indicated a willingness for discussion in return -- Pe\u00f1a Nieto has said that he and the president-elect have agreed to meet, according to the BBC . 0 Shares ",

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Volunteers load a pallet with bottled water to be distributed outside Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Flint, Mich., in February. Carlos Osorio/AP A federal judge has ordered state and local governments to provide home delivery of bottled water to the residents of Flint, Mich., as they continue to navigate a years-long crisis over lead-laced water. U.S. District Judge David Lawson said in his order that the city and state must provide at least four cases of water per resident every week, unless the officials verify the household has a water filter installed that is properly maintained or the residents opt out. Flint is in the process of repairing its water system after the city switched to a new water source in 2014 without implementing proper corrosion controls. The untreated water corroded the pipes, causing lead to leach out of the pipes. For months, officials have been handing out water filters and distributing bottled water at points throughout the city. But on Thursday, the judge said that's not enough. The water filters do bring the lead levels below the EPA's action levels, he said, but the distribution and monitoring efforts have been \"uneven at best.\" There's no guarantee the filters are \"properly installed and maintained,\" Lawson wrote. Article continues after sponsorship Independent Investigators: State Officials Mostly To Blame For Flint Water Crisis And he said that picking up water at distribution points \"has become a major challenge\" for some residents in Flint, where 40 percent of people live below the poverty line. He cites testimony from residents who spoke of confusion about where to pick up the water and how much they were allowed to take, long lines and the cost of transportation needed to take home the heavy bottles. Some people said they were not given enough to meet their family's needs, and some distribution points were said to have short, inconvenient hours. \"The fact that such items are available does not mean that they are reliably accessible or effective in furnishing safe drinking water to every household,\" Lawson wrote. \"Indeed, the endeavor of hunting for water has become a dominant activity in some Flint residents' daily lives.\" The judge's order granted a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking immediate, reliable access to safe water, as part of a larger case over lead levels in Flint's water that was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Natural Resources Defense Council and several others. \"Activists have fought hard for home delivery for more than a year,\" as Michigan Radio reports . \"Recent tests showed improvement [in lead levels], but lead levels continue to be higher than acceptable in many Flint homes.\" As The Two-Way has reported, many people and groups have come under fire for their handling of the crisis in Flint. An independent task force concluded earlier this year that primary responsibility lies with a state environmental agency called the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, but many others failed to take proper action as the lead levels rose. \"In modern society, when we turn on a faucet, we expect safe drinking water to flow out. As the evidence shows, this is no longer the case in Flint,\" Lawson wrote in his order. \"The Flint water crisis has in effect turned back the clock to a time when people traveled to central water sources to fill their buckets and carry the water home.\" Lead-Laced Water In Flint: A Step-By-Step Look At The Makings Of A Crisis A spokesperson for Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder tells Michigan Radio that \"the government's attorneys are reviewing the order.\" If you're catching up on Flint's lead crisis, have a look at our timeline , which shows how it played out.

But ask some of Manigault's former castmates (she was the only contestant fired by Trump three times from the show) what they think of Omarosa at the White House and you get opinions as divided as Americans are about Trump himself. My last briefing as senior advisor to @realDonaldTrump for campaign. President Elect Trump is now headed to the White House @POTUS #MAGA pic.twitter.com/nSb6osqxXF \u2014 OMAROSA (@OMAROSA) November 10, 2016 \"What a smart move, and not a surprise, for Mr. Trump\u00a0to get people on his team who want to help him achieve his goals,\" enthused Bowie Hogg, 38, a conservative Texan\u00a0Trump supporter, businessman and local school-board member who also was on Season 1 and admires Manigault, with whom he's stayed in touch since 2004. He says Omarosa, 42, has in abundance the quality Trump values most of all: Total loyalty. \"She never wavered on loyalty to him, no matter what happened. And he honors loyalty,\" Hogg says. \"I\u00a0do think she'd be a strong candidate in the African-American community. \u00a0She\u2019s a hard worker, you can like her or not,\u00a0but no one can say she doesn\u2019t work hard.\" Spike Lee calls out Omarosa Manigault over her new appointment to Trump's campaign A more sour assessment comes from business consultant Kwame Jackson, who was the second-to-last-man standing on Season I (he lost to Bill Rancic) and who spent the campaign on cable news criticizing Trump. Donald Trump with his daughter-in-law Lara Trump (L) and Omarosa Manigault (R) in Charlotte, N.C. on Oct. 14,  2016. \u00a0(Photo: ERIK S. LESSER, EPA) \"I don\u2019t think Omarosa should get any job, I am not a fan of her work or her ideals,\" says Jackson, 42. \"Appointing her to direct African-American outreach is like appointing Benedict Arnold to lead the Revolutionary Army.\" There is no confirmation that Manigault will be tapped by Trump nor any discussion yet about what her job might be . But she is being \"mentioned,\" as the pols say in Washington, especially by Omarosa herself. Omarosa Manigault named head of black outreach for Trump campaign On election night, she told The Hollywood Reporter \u00a0that Trump asked her if she was \"ready to come with me to Washington.\" On Wednesday, she tweeted a picture of herself with a poster of Trump. \"My last briefing as senior adviser to #realDonaldTrump for campaign.\" At least two wags on Twitter are already pushing \"#ApprenticeCabinet.\" I fully expect Bill Rancic, Penn Gilette & Omarosa to be appointed to key positions in the Trump administration \uf609 #ApprenticeCabinet \u2014 RussChrusciel (@dbug4) November 9, 2016 It's not a totally off-the-wall possibility: Manigault was appointed Trump's adviser on outreach to African Americans in July. Trump still lost the black vote to Hillary Clinton, but not by as much as Mitt Romney did to Barack Obama in the 2012 campaign. \"It's higher than Romney but it's still single digits,\" says Jackson. \"She doesn't have resonance in the black community.\" Among the jobs Manigault could be suited for: Minority and millennial outreach, business outreach, communications and White House spokesperson, protocol, or just as a vaguely-defined \"senior adviser\" \u00a0or \"trusted confidant,\" as Valerie Jarrett has been for the two terms of the Obama administration. \u201cAs Donald says, I am his Valerie Jarrett,\u201d said Manigault during a one-on-one-interview \u00a0at a business conference for multicultural women in June. She's no policy poseur: Manigault once worked for Vice President Al Gore in the Bill Clinton White House. She's a church pastor, possesses\u00a0a PhD\u00a0in communications, and is\u00a0an undisputed self-marketing whiz. She is certainly the most famous previously unknown\u00a0castmember to come out of the\u00a0Apprentice\u00a0powerhouse. Omarosa: Trump already has an enemies list But she's also famous for clashing with practically everybody on the show, including celebrity castmembers such as Piers Morgan and La Toya Jackson . Like Trump, she was often caustic and unfiltered,\u00a0with little patience for anyone she considered a fool.\u00a0And a lot of people seemed foolish to her. Her post-Apprentice years have featured more clashes, including with the family of her late fiance , actor Michael Clarke Duncan, over his will. After she was appointed to Trump's campaign, Spike Lee attacked her in a dramatic way:\u00a0He posted a sideways\u00a0 photograph of Manigault \u00a0wearing a clown nose. \"Omarosa grew up a fighter her entire life, she's not going to back down,\" says Hogg. \"She's\u00a0always going to give her opinion; it's one of her strengths and\u00a0sometimes it\u00a0can hurt her. \"She's always prepared to be the villain.\" 1643 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fktOqq ",

The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u00a0was an immediate hit, particularly with young people, when it debuted on NBC 1964. It was part of an avalanche of secret agent shows (I Spy,\u00a0Mission: Impossible,\u00a0Secret Agent), spoofs (Get Smart), books (The Spy Who Came in From the Cold) and even songs (Secret Agent Man) inspired by the James Bond films. Vaughn\u2019s urbane superspy Napoleon Solo teamed with Scottish actor David McCallum\u2019s Illya Kuryakin, a soft-spoken, Russian-born agent. The pair, who had put aside Cold War differences for a greater good, worked together each week for the mysterious U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) in combatting the international crime syndicate THRUSH. \u201cGirls age 9 to 12 liked David McCallum because he was so sweet,\u201d Vaughn remarked in a 2005 interview in England. \u201cBut the old ladies and the 13- to 16-year-olds liked me because I was so detached.\u201d The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u00a0was also a big hit abroad, particularly in McCallum\u2019s native Great Britain. The show aired until early 1968, when sagging ratings brought it to an end. In his The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Book,\u00a0Jon Heitland blamed its demise on a shift from straight adventure to more comic plots in the show\u2019s third season that turned off many viewers, as well as time slot changes. Vaughn and McCallum reunited in 1983 for a TV movie, The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u00a0in which the super spies were lured out of retirement to save the world once more. (McCallum has found stardom anew in his 14th season playing Dr. Donald \u201cDucky\u201d Mallard on the hit CBS drama NCIS.) In recent years, Vaughn had starred for eight seasons on the British crime-caper series \u201cHustle,\u201d playing Albert Stroller, the lone Yank in a band of London-based con artists. Hustle\u00a0also aired in the U.S. \u201cI imagined that Napoleon Solo had retired from U.N.C.L.E., whatever U.N.C.L.E. was,\u201d Vaughn recalled in 2006. \u201cWhat could he do now to use his talents and to supplement his government pension? I imagined Stroller as Napoleon Solo, The Later Years.\u201d Before U.N.C.L.E.\u00a0Vaughn made his mark in movies, earning an Oscar nomination in 1959 for his supporting role in The Young Philadelphians,\u00a0in which he played a wounded war veteran accused of murder. The following year, he turned in a memorable performance as a gunfighter who had lost his nerve in The Magnificent Seven. Making that movie, Vaughn recalled in 2005, had presented the cast with a vexing problem: no script. \u201cWe had to improvise everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to go to the costume department myself and choose the black vest and the black hat.\u201d A liberal Democrat, Vaughn became passionately opposed to the Vietnam War while he was making U.N.C.L.E.\u00a0and delivered anti-war speeches at colleges and other venues around the country. He also debated the war with conservative William F. Buckley on the latter\u2019s TV talk show, Firing Line. Vaughn became a friend of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and campaigned for him during his 1968 run for the presidency. When Kennedy was assassinated that year, Vaughn was so upset that he moved to England for five years. Returning to the U.S., the actor decided to resume his education. He had already earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in theater arts from California State University, Los Angeles, in 1956, and a master\u2019s degree from the University of Southern California in 1960. He returned to USC, where he earned a Ph.D. His doctoral dissertation was an overview of the House Un-American Activities Commission\u2019s effect on American theater. It resulted in a well-received book \u201cOnly Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting.\u201d Vaughn was also drawn to politics in several of the TV roles he chose. He portrayed Harry S. Truman in \u201cThe Man from Independence,\u201d Woodrow Wilson in \u201cBackstairs at the White House\u201d and a presidential aide in the 12-hour \u201cWashington: Behind Closed Doors,\u201d for which he won an Emmy. He also toured in a one-man play \u201cF.D.R.\u201d about Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s battles with polio. Vaughn also remained active in movies, usually in character roles. Among his films: The Venetian Affair,\u00a0The Bridge at Remagen,\u00a0Julius Caesar\u00a0(the 1970 British version starring Charlton Heston), The Towering Inferno,\u00a0S.O.B.,\u00a0Superman III\u00a0and Delta Force. Robert Francis Vaughn was born into a theatrical family Nov. 22, 1932, in New York City. His father was a radio actor, his mother performed on Broadway and his grandparents acted in theater. His parents divorced when he was only 6 months old, however, and he was sent to live with his grandparents in Minneapolis, where he said his childhood was miserable. \u201cI cried all the time and I was always getting beat up.\u201d After his grandparents died, Vaughn moved to Los Angeles. Spotted in a college play, he was signed to a contract with Burt Lancaster\u2019s company but was soon drafted into the Army. After his discharge in 1957, he made his first movie, No Time to Be Young. Long among Hollywood\u2019s most eligible bachelors, Vaughn married actress Linda Staab in 1974. \u201cThe breaks all fell my way,\u201d said Vaughn in 2006. But was he really as cool as he appeared to his adoring audience? \u201cNot according to my wife,\u201d Vaughn chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s married to the guy who doesn\u2019t take the garbage out on Tuesday evenings, the guy she battles with to get me out of my jumpsuit and running shoes. She doesn\u2019t allow me in public unless I wear a tie and a coat.\u201d Vaughn is survived by his wife, Linda Staab Vaughn, their son Cassidy and daughter Caitlin. 546 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fjX0h6 ",

    "text": "By Amy Goldstein November 11 at 5:30 PM Follow @goldsteinamy During the brief period since his election, President-elect Donald Trump has begun to revise his health-care agenda in ways that conform more closely to the heart of Republican thinking in recent decades. On the presidential transition website, at greatagain.gov , antiabortion statements and policy positions have appeared that were not part of the campaign\u2019s health-care platform. Other proposals have been deleted. Erasing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a set of policies long favored by conservatives remain at the core of the agenda. But in his first interview as president-elect, Trump significantly softened his language for the ACA\u2019s fate, telling the Wall Street Journal on Friday, \u201cEither Obamacare will be amended or repealed and replaced.\u201d He mentioned just two parts of the law to keep, both favored by House Republicans despite their eagerness to axe the law. Trump reiterated his support for a rule forbidding insurers to refuse coverage to people with preexisting medical problems. And he said young adults should be able to stay on their parents insurance policies until 26 \u2014 an aspect he did not discuss during the campaign. [Trump\u2019s health-care positions as a candidate] On the transition website, the first two lines in a set of bullet points say that the Trump administration will protect health-care workers from being required to perform services that violate their religious or moral beliefs and that it will \u201cprotect innocent human life from conception to natural death.\u201d Neither had figured among the campaign\u2019s health-care positions. Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat still might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Conversely, the website omits what had been the Republican nominee\u2019s call for Congress to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from countries where they are sold at lower prices. This idea has long been favored by Democratic lawmakers but repeatedly blocked by Republicans. The idea of drugs crossing U.S. borders could be construed as conflicting with the president-elect\u2019s support of trade barriers, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. But Cannon acknowledged that, overall, Trump\u2019s \u201chealth-care machinations have been a black box for me.\u201d According to insiders to the transition, the shifts in the agenda primarily reflect the views of people chosen to help handle his ascension to the Oval Office, not a deliberate strategy by Trump to align with the GOP majorities in the House and Senate. [ Is Paul Ryan already eyeing Medicare cuts? ] Many of the ideas, including the \u201cconscience clause\u201d for health-care workers, mirror the positions of the Heritage Foundation. Edwin Feulner, the conservative think tank\u2019s former president, has a prominent role in the transition for domestic policy. So does Kenneth Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state who is a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and serves on boards of other conservative organizations. The tweaked health-care agenda \u201cis certainly moving in the direction of traditional Republican thinking,\u201d said Gail Wilensky, a veteran health-policy expert who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush and has not conferred with the Trump post-election team. \u201cNot with a fulsome leap, but he\u2019s definitely moved in that direction.\u201d During the campaign, for instance, the candidate\u2019s platform did not address the future of Medicare, the vast federal insurance program for older or disabled Americans. The program has been strained financially for years, and the trust fund that pays for Medicare patients\u2019 hospital care is forecast to become insolvent in a dozen years. Before his election, Trump said repeatedly that he would not cut or change the program. \u201cI\u2019m leaving it the way it is,\u201d he said in May. 1 of 22 ",

Bannon. Republican National Convention Chairman Reince Priebus and Donald Trump's campaign Chief Executive Officer Stephen K. Bannon. (AFP/Getty Images) Cathleen Decker and Evan Halper Contact Reporters Fresh from a successful battle against a Democratic opponent, Donald Trump \u2019s attention must now turn to defining his presidency. His campaign offered two divergent approaches. He was a disruptive bomb-thrower when it came to general demeanor and his immigration and national security stances. He was a more conventional Republican when it came to his social-issue positions and economic concerns. The warring options were on sharp display overnight into Friday. Responding to protests around the country Thursday night, Trump first issued a tweet in keeping with the defiant tone of his campaign that \u201cprofessional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\u201d Nine hours later came one that was more presidential in approach, if a reversal from his first sentiment. When all the ballots are counted \u2014\u00a0 some 4.3 million remained in California as of Thursday night, according to the state\u2019s secretary of state \u2014\u00a0 Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by well over a million votes, en route to losing the electoral college and the White House. The result put... When all the ballots are counted \u2014\u00a0 some 4.3 million remained in California as of Thursday night, according to the state\u2019s secretary of state \u2014\u00a0 Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by well over a million votes, en route to losing the electoral college and the White House. The result put... (David Lauter) \u201cLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\u201d he said. The early discussions about\u00a0key positions in his administration\u00a0included similarly opposed sentiments,\u00a0suggesting that Trump has yet to lock down precisely how he will approach governing the nation. Among those being considered for presidential chief of staff \u2014\u00a0the figure who more than any other determines how well a White House works, and at what \u2014 was Stephen K. Bannon, who took a leave as chairman of Breitbart News to serve as Trump\u2019s campaign CEO. Bannon is a controversial figure even among Republicans , seen in the campaign as encouraging Trump\u2019s more eye-opening stunts such as his news conference with\u00a0several women who accused former President Bill Clinton of making sexual advances. He also fanned some of Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and African Americans. But he has no experience in\u00a0governing or keeping on track an organization as large as the executive branch. Another person being considered was the far more buttoned-down Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, an establishment figure who has close ties to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other GOP leaders, having helped to run the party for almost six years. Bannon and Priebus share an alliance with Trump, but little else. The pick is seen as essential to Trump\u2019s direction since the chief of staff often has the president\u2019s ear just before a decision is reached. The picture is no clearer for other top Cabinet posts, such as secretary of State. Trump is considering Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a consensus builder in the Senate who is well-liked across the aisle. But he is also looking at former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, one of the most aggressive neoconservative hawks during the George W. Bush administration and a favorite among the Breitbart set. Adding further uncertainty, on Friday afternoon Trump shook up his transition team, announcing that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would take over, replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. As much as staffing, Trump\u2019s presidency also will be defined by the issues he chooses to take up early in his administration. Already, outside groups and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have control of both houses, are pressuring Trump to make good on myriad and sometimes competing campaign promises.\u00a0And they are moving into the vacuum formed by the lack of substantive policy proposals in the campaign. Trump\u2019s success in Tuesday\u2019s election rested on running against both parties, Democrats and Republicans alike. That suggests that he may end up cutting a distinct path untethered to the traditional lines, even Republican ones. For now, the president-elect is keeping his options open, at least publicly.\u00a0In a brief comment to reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday, he offered only one broad directive. \u201cWe're going to work very strongly on immigration, healthcare and we're looking at jobs, big-league jobs,\" he said. Asked specifically whether he intended to ban Muslims from entering the United States, as he pledged during the campaign, Trump raised his hand, said \"thank you\u201d and walked off. Turning from a campaign to governing is difficult for any winning nominee, but for Trump it represents not just an occupational shift but a cultural one. He will go from being the top man in a company bearing his name, with his children as his chief lieutenants, to commanding the sprawling executive branch with miles-long lines of authority and an expansive reach over issues with which he has no experience. He will confront not only the majesties of the presidency but its limitations \u2014 specifically the other equal partners in government, such as a legislative branch that runs on its own calendar and with its own priorities. For more on politics \u00bb Both Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans appear eager to make the repeal of Obamacare a prime early focus. In the waning days of the campaign, he had talked of calling a special session to repeal his predecessor\u2019s signature achievement, but Congress will already be in session by the time he becomes president. \u201cWe would urge them to go big on the issues and the first would be to repeal Obamacare,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-allied interest group that worked in dozens of states to elect Republicans. \u201cIt was a key issue in the elections in the Senate and the presidential as well. Don\u2019t nibble around the edges. Go big,\u201d said Phillips, whose organization also favors early action on tax reform. But calling for the repeal of a measure at campaign rallies peopled by voters who dislike Obama is different altogether than taking health insurance coverage from 20 million Americans without a detailed plan for replacing it. Already, differences have emerged between Trump and House Speaker Ryan as to how expansive\u00a0changes would be. Ryan, in a Fox News interview on Friday, suggested a revamping of both healthcare and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, long\u00a0thwarted by Obama\u2019s threatened veto. \u201cIf you are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThose things are part of our plan.\u201d But the coalition that helped elect Trump benefits from the very programs that Ryan wants to shrink. And as a candidate, Trump deviated from Republican promises to curtail entitlements. Still on his campaign website is a quote from the candidate distancing himself\u00a0from the very measures Ryan discussed Friday. ",

Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY 4:54 p.m. EST November 11, 2016 x Share Jefferson Graham reviews the new Snapchat Spectacles video sunglasses, a fun toy that lets you shoot 10-second video clips hands free, on #TalkingTech. Video by Jefferson Graham Comedin Nemr Abou Nassar sports a pair of Snapchat Spectacles (Photo: Jefferson Graham) LOS ANGELES \u2014 For a short span Thursday, consumers got a chance to buy Snapchat's new $129 Spectacles. Within a few hours, they were gone. USA TODAY wasn't one of the lucky ones, even after\u00a0a two-hour wait , but we got to borrow a pair to test out. Here's the download. The specs let you record on-the-fly 10-second video clips that can be played back in the updated Snapchat app, for more spontaneous, on-the-moments. The glasses are stylish and a whole lot of fun. Snapchat has done a great job at making the operation drop-dead simple. But if you're looking for great video quality, stick with a camera or smartphone. The clips are low-res and really jerky \u2014 shooting from your eyes doesn't allow for any steadiness help from the hands. Like Google Glass, the late, $1,500 and since discontinued futuristic eyewear, Spectacles are meant to capture moments wherever we are, and that could create for awkward times. I wore them to the gym and picked up a clip walking in the door, which meant I was probably invading everyone's personal space. (I deleted it.) Moments in restaurants, bars and other open settings would have to also be considered intrusive. I see folks using Spectacles in social situations, but buyer beware: if used at a party or other evening gathering, the video quality will be pretty poor; at least it was for me when I shot inside. (The camera does better in daylight.) Actress Angell Conwell sports Snapchat Spectacles \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) But then again, no one is buying Spectacles for great video quality. They want Spectacles because they're colorful, cool and for the time being, represent an instant status symbol status, because they are so rare. x Share Snapchat's hard to get video glasses, Spectacles, went on sale Thursday in a vending machine on the beach in California. They sold out within 4 hours. Jefferson Graham reports Snapchat is selling Spectacles not online, or at retail, but via a bright yellow vending machine attached to yellow balloons that will just show\u00a0up unannounced. The Snap Bot appeared on the Venice Beach boardwalk Thursday for the first time and attracted long, long lines. Each bot will only make its appearance for one-24-hour period, says Snapchat and there's no word for where it\u2019s headed to next. Check spectacles.com and scroll to the bottom of the page, for the \"Find a Bot\" section to see if there's a Bot sighting in your neighborhood. As of this writing, no new sightings have been scheduled. Jarek Khan has fun with the new Snapchat Spectacles, which records in circular video \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham) Spectacles basics: Begin by charging the specs. You need to connect the USB to the back of the glasses case. Once done, pair the glasses with the Snapchat app (again, make sure to update to the latest IOS or Android version.) Once charged, click the right button atop the glasses, and it starts recording 10-second video snippets of our lives. You'll know, and those around you will know, that\u00a0you're recording\u00a0because a light goes in a circular motion to indicate recording status. People wait in line to buy Snapchat's Spectacles, available Thursday. \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) The clips themselves get wirelessly sent to Snapchat, where you can view, share and save them to your camera roll. The video is in a new, circular format. But on Snapchat, they are processed and flattened. Outside Snapchat, they're round. Again, the video looks fine on Snapchat, but if you save and send them to your computer for viewing on a bigger screen, not so good. Not that I really cared, nor do I think anyone else will. Spectacles is a\u00a0fun toy, and easily the must-have gift of the holiday season--if you can find one. Good luck.

Steve Bannon, campaign CEO for President-elect Donald Trump, leaves Trump Tower, Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, in New York. (Evan Vucci / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Donald Trump is considering a conservative bomb-thrower and the face of the GOP establishment, among others, for White House chief of staff \u2014 a major post that could set the direction for his presidency. The Republican president-elect is days away from naming his chief of staff, according to people with direct knowledge of his thinking. No position is considered more important than chief of staff, a behind-the-scenes power player who typically controls access to the president, guides the enactment of his policy priorities and oversees White House hiring. Trump has already narrowed his list to a handful of high-profile loyalists that includes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , campaign CEO Steve Bannon and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. The incoming president repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" during his campaign's final weeks, yet both Priebus and Conway have operated for years in that same Washington \"swamp.\" Bannon, by contrast, would represent a dramatically different direction, having spent recent years leading a conservative news site that fueled conspiracy theories popular with the \"alt-right\" movement of white nationalists.

Memoli and Christi Parsons) Trump ran as an outsider, but some suggest it would be risky to tap another outsider to serve as his right hand in the Oval Office. \"I'm trying to think of who was successful as chief of staff as an outsider and I can't think of one,\" said John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who served as chief of staff for the first three years of former President George H.W. Bush 's administration. A president's chief of staff sets the tone for the White House, guarding who has access to the president and what problems land on his desk. The role blends both policy and politics, working with congressional lawmakers and Cabinet officials. The chief of staff is also typically among the closest advisers to the president, providing counsel on domestic and foreign policy decisions. In 2013, President Barack Obama made the decision to abruptly pull back plans to launch airstrikes on Syria while walking on the South Lawn with his chief of staff, Denis McDonough . The chief of staff \"is often the last person who speaks to a president before a decision is made,\" said Sara Fagen, who worked under two chiefs of staff in the George W. Bush White House. \"This person has to have the confidence of the president and they have to have the kind of relationship with the president where they can give him candid advice and tell him things he does not want to hear.\" Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Full Donald Trump victory speech Donald Trump's complete victory speech in New York City after he was elected the 45th president of the United States.

(The White House)\u00a0 It's also helpful, Sununu said, if the chief of staff \"understands the nuances and the politics of policy so that the president doesn't accidently get himself into a bind.\" There are few people in Trump's inner circle who are experienced in the nuances of politics and policy. The businessman and reality television star is expected to lean heavily on Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a sitting governor who previously served in Congress for more than a decade. But with Trump having been shunned by most of the political world's most respected leaders for much of the last year, few of his closest campaign advisers have governing experience in Washington. Trump has only about 70 days to form a new government, including hundreds of senior-level employees across various federal agencies. The jobs \u2014 and the selection of his Cabinet \u2014 will be filled only after a chief of staff is selected. And with so many questions about Trump's specific priorities as president, his early personnel decisions become major signals of his intentions. ",

Anadolu Agency/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images People attend the Veterans Day Parade in New York City Thursday. Known as \"America's Parade,\" it features over 20,000 participants, including veterans of numerous eras, military units, businesses and high school bands and civic and youth groups. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Stories from the frontlines of war \u2014 and from the descendants of military families \u2014 are being told on this Veterans Day, as America honors those who've worn its uniforms and promised to protect it. The conversation also centers on how the U.S. can return the obligation, and serve its veterans. President Obama laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, praising the military and highlighting the story of Patrick Holbrook, a young veteran from Hawaii who had written to him to say, \"Sir, all my life I've tried to find what a Good man is, and be that man but I [realize] now life is more difficult for some. I'm not sure where I am going, and it is something that I can not shake.\" YouTube Obama said, in both a written reply to Holbrook and at today's ceremony: \"I can tell from your letter you are already a good man; you just need to find the calling that will express that goodness \u2014 or it will find you. Article continues after sponsorship Here's a sampling of Veterans Day stories from NPR and its member stations. This list isn't exhaustive \u2014 but it gives a sense of the breadth of the military community, and the wide range of experiences and challenges shared by veterans. From St. Louis Public Radio comes the story of how a team of archivists are trying to recover millions of veterans' records that were damaged in a 1973 fire. Years later, the documents remain vital: They can determine veterans' benefits and burial rights. The center gets anywhere from 4,000 and 5,000 requests every day. \"They're not just documents,\" said technician Marie Taylor, 25, who was trying to restore a soldier's file from World War II. \"There was somebody who lived this out. I'm doing my best to preserve that. To remember that.\" From Arizona Public Media comes the account of a visit to Camp Bravo, a tent city that serves as a base for homeless veterans who need, as the station says, \"shelter, nourishment and protection against the damages they bear from mental and physical injury, addiction, and isolation.\" Member station WABE in Atlanta describes how the city is closing in on the federal designation of having ended homelessness among veterans. \"According to the U.S. Department of Housing, about 360 veterans were in shelters or on Atlanta streets in January,\" WABE reports, \"nearly half what it was the year before.\" The wildly varying ways veterans who return from war are seen by civilians is at the heart of the Veterans Coming Home project that's been explored at a local level by member station WHYY in Philadelphia. \"Civilians don't even know how to approach veterans,\" says Caroline Meehan, program and research manager of Volunteers of America. \"There's now sort of this view, this dichotomy in society: Are veterans just heroes? Or are they scary people with PTSD who are gonna explode?\" Members station WAMU in Washington tells us about a father and son who were both deployed to Afghanistan, years apart. Their conversation was recorded by StoryCorps Local. \"I never thought that you would end up fighting on the same battlefields that I was in,\" Gary Berntsen, who went to Afghanistan after the 2001 attacks, tells his son Garrett. First-person accounts make up Minnesota Public Radio's project with LifePosts for Veterans. It includes the story of a journalist and photographer who worked in Afghanistan \u2014 and who realizes, \"I'm too confused to know that I'm scared.\" Another voice comes from Vietnam vet Loren Hanson, whose tour as a finance clerk wasn't as quiet as he expected: \"After a short flight to Pleiku then on to An Khe, I processed through the replacement detachment and was assigned to Delta Company 1st Bn (Abn) 8th Cav, the \"Jumping Mustangs\", an Airborne unit - risky stuff for a leg finance clerk.\" And from member station KMUW in Kansas comes this historic note: \"The idea for Veteran's Day began through the efforts of Emporia shoe repairman Alvin King.\" After King's nephew was killed serving in the Army in Germany during World War II, King pushed to expand Armistice Day \u2014 which was dedicated to World War I veterans \u2014 to cover all U.S. military veterans. Rep. Ed Rees of Emporia \"agreed to take King's idea to Washington, D.C.,\" KMUW reports. \"The legislation passed, and President Dwight Eisenhower\u2014a native Kansan \u2014 signed the bill establishing the nation's first Veterans Day on Nov. 11, 1954.\" ",

    "text": "MoneyWatch Nov 11, 2016 5:45 AM EST On his first day in office, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on trade deals, the Iran nuclear agreement, immigrants and Barack Obama\u2019s environmental moves. Can he make good on his pledges? Mostly, yes, although he\u2019s limited in some areas. In \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Contract with the American Voter,\u201d the next president says his goal is \u201crestoring honesty and accountability, and bringing change to Washington.\u201d Shredding initiatives by Obama and previous presidents will keep Americans safer and lift drags on economic growth, he reasons. These Trump targets, which played so well with his base during the campaign, are hot-button issues with Democrats, who surely will try to push back.\u00a0 But a president has a good amount of leeway on these key issues:\u00a0 Donald Trump's \"contract\" with American voters Trade.\u00a0Trump has said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and slap punitive tariffs on China. A pact among the U.S., Canada and Mexico, NAFTA was enacted in the early 1990s by Democratic President Bill Clinton. It eliminated barriers to trade and investment for the three nations. But the incoming president claims the agreement \u201chas destroyed our country\u201d by shipping jobs south of the border, a conclusion that has sparked a wide-ranging debate. Democrats say withdrawal would lead to job losses in the U.S. and higher prices. And Trump\u2019s stance goes against the bipartisan free-trade consensus that has held sway since World War II. The U.S. hasn\u2019t withdrawn from any trade agreement since 1866. If Trump can\u2019t get Mexico -- and Canada, with which he has no quarrel -- to alter NAFTA, he pledges to walk away from it. According to Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute research organization, Trump would need Congress\u2019 approval to renegotiate the pact, something he likely would receive given GOP control of Capitol Hill. But if he can\u2019t get the other two nations to go along, Trump could back out of NAFTA with six months\u2019 notice. The 12-nation TPP, which binds the U.S., Canada and a bunch of mainly Asian nations (excluding China), is easier to exit for Trump. It still hasn\u2019t received congressional approval, and Republican lawmakers show little inclination to bring it up. The most consequential action Trump could take would be to declare China a currency manipulator and to slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. President George W. Bush took such a step against the Chinese in 2002 for dumping cheap steel in the U.S. After negotiations, Bush was satisfied the problem was solved and lifted the tariffs the next year. But Trump\u2019s anti-Chinese action is far broader, and many fear it would ignite a trade war. \u201cHe\u2019d probably need a congressional OK to do the tariffs,\u201d Strand said.\u00a0 Trump's trade policy with Mexico spurs concern over jobs Trump also has talked about hitting Mexico with a 35 percent tariff. If China and Mexico imposed their own tariffs in retaliation, reminiscent of a similar conflict that helped worsen the Great Depression, 4 million U.S. workers would lose their jobs, an analysis by Moody\u2019s Analytics projects. One argument says Trump\u2019s tariffs wouldn\u2019t pass muster with the World Trade Organization, which serves as a referee for trade disputes. Trump could simply ignore any WTO objections, albeit at the risk of putting the U.S. in a bad position for future trade tiffs. Iran nukes. In exchange for lifting sanctions on their nation, the Iranian regime has largely suspended its program to develop nuclear weapons for 15 years. As part of this framework, Iran received $1.3 billion, a third of it in cash, that was frozen after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\u00a0 Obama never submitted the pact to Congress for a vote, knowing Republicans would reject it. Instead, he classified the measure as an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201d which provoked objections by Trump and other Republicans, who argued he was legislating by fiat. Still, should Trump back out of the nuke deal , it would be mostly symbolic. Five other signatories -- Britain, Russia, China, Germany and France -- have lifted sanctions and are starting to strike up business arrangements with the mullahs. \u201cWe could ask for the money back, but I don\u2019t think the Iranians would give it,\u201d Strand said. Immigration. Here, the president enjoys wide discretion to protect the homeland. Trump has proposed barring Muslim immigrants, or at least people from nations where terrorism is rampant, from entering the U.S. He has precedent on his side. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ordered that a tide of Haitians be blocked, and the U.S. military intercepted the refugees\u2019 boats. Farmworkers caught in the web of illegal immigration debate Also, Trump has said he wants to\u00a0 deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants already living here, many from Mexico and other Latin Americans lands, although he may have softened that position. He would need Congress to pass funding for such a costly venture, which would entail the largest dragnet in U.S. history. His easiest crackdown would be on the 70,000 people who came to this country as children of parents who were undocumented migrants. Obama has used an executive order to shield them from deportation. \u201cTrump could simply rescind Obama\u2019s action,\u201d said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u00a0\u00a0 Environment.\u00a0Because Republicans in Congress have been hostile to Obama\u2019s policies, particularly on the environment, the Democrat has used executive orders. This has elicited a GOP outcry that his steps are illegal and subvert the Constitution. Once again, Trump could zap those environmental regs with ease. When Reagan took over, he immediately yanked 39 executive orders that his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, had imposed. Among the most prominent environment-oriented orders from Obama were to enlist the U.S. as a party to the Paris climate accords , in which 195 nations promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to prevent coal mining on federal lands. Technically, Trump could withdraw from the Paris  treaty with three years notice. But because it\u2019s nonbinding, he could merely refuse to obey its edicts. All in all, Trump could indeed fulfill many of his pledges to his voters on Day One. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved. ",

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , Trump acknowledged there are aspects of President Obama\u2019s signature health care plan that he wants to maintain, like protecting patients with pre-existing conditions and allowing parents to keep their children on their own plans until age 26. \u201cI like those very much,\u201d he said, according to the newspaper. Most congressional Republicans would agree that in order to craft a viable alternative to the president\u2019s law, they need to include at least those two aspects, which appear to be very popular with participants in the Affordable Care Act. Both of the items Trump mentioned are included in House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d health care agenda, although he has not yet offered actionable legislation to achieve them. Trump also appeared to back off his desire to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, which prompted chants of \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d at his rallies. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,\u201d he said. The office of Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley , who has vowed to continue investigating Clinton, did not respond to a request for comment. 0 Shares ",

(John Minchillo / AP) CNN says Corey Lewandowski , who served a brief, stormy stint as CNN commentator after being fired as Donald Trump 's campaign manager, has resigned from the network. CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin says the resignation Friday afternoon is effective immediately. Lewandowski's stay at CNN began days after he left the Trump campaign in June. It stirred debate over whether political insiders hired as network on-air contributors are more loyal to the politicians they once worked for than the network and its viewers. Lewandowski had stayed in close touch with Trump while at CNN, leading to speculation since Trump's victory this week that he might take a role in the new administration. Earlier on Friday, he was seen arriving at Trump Tower, where the president-elect was holding transition meetings. Associated Press ",

    "text": "By Brady Dennis November 11 at 3:17 PM Follow @brady_dennis President-elect Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the regulations it has put out under President Obama are \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\u00a0He has vowed to roll back Obama\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, known as the Clean Power Plan, and to scrap a litany of other \u201cunnecessary\u201d rules, especially those imposed on the oil, gas and coal sectors. The man planning how a Trump administration can obliterate Obama\u2019s environmental legacy is Myron Ebell, a Washington fixture who has long been a cheerful warrior against what he sees as an alarmist, overzealous environmental movement that has used global warming as a pretext for expanding government. Ebell has argued for opening up more federal lands for logging, oil and gas exploration and coal mining, and for turning over more permitting authority to the states. And he has urged the Senate to vote to reject an international climate accord signed last year in Paris. The self-described public-policy wonk has for years\u00a0made his home at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a conservative policy group that once received considerable funding from ExxonMobil. More recently, the organization has been funded in part\u00a0by Donors Trust. The Virginia-based organization, which is not required by law to disclose its contributors, is staffed largely by people who have worked for Koch Industries or nonprofit groups supported by the conservative Koch brothers. Ebell, who is not a scientist, has long questioned the overwhelming scientific\u00a0consensus that human activity is fueling unprecedented global warming. He also has staunchly opposed what he calls energy rationing, instead arguing that the United States should unleash the full power of coal, oil and gas to fuel economic growth and job creation. All that makes him an ideal ambassador for Trump, who has repeatedly called the notion of man-made climate change a \u201choax.\u201d [ Trump victory reverses U.S. energy and environmental priorities ] Ebell declined to comment this week on his work or the type of people likely to be appointed to run the EPA, instead referring inquiries to the Trump transition headquarters. But it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to figure out the likely list of priorities. The \u201c energy independence \u201d section of Trump\u2019s transition website \u2014 there is no \u201cenvironment\u201d section \u2014 reads like an oil-and-gas-industry wish list. \u201cRather than continuing the current path to undermine and block America\u2019s fossil fuel producers, the Trump Administration will encourage the production of these resources by opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters,\u201d the site states. \u201cWe will streamline the permitting process for all energy projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama, and rescind the job-destroying executive actions under his Administration. We will end the war on coal, and rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.\u201d The site does say that Trump is \u201cfirmly committed to conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats.\u201d But it has no specifics on what that might mean, other than \u201cAmerica\u2019s environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.\u201d As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Presumably that means people such as Ebell. He has gleefully opposed environmentalists and railed against the policies of the Obama administration and others that take aim at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions \u2014 and by extension\u00a0weaning the United States off its dependence of fossil fuels. A 2007 Vanity Fair profile \u00a0described Ebell as a \u201csound-bite artist\u201d and an \u201coil-industry mouthpiece.\u201d \u201cAlmost no scientist doubts that global warming is here, that man-made greenhouse gases are to blame, or that if we don\u2019t cut back on those gases fairly soon we\u2019ll be in a heap of trouble,\u201d the article said. \u201cBut as the \u2018other hand\u2019 in all those news stories, Ebell and his quotable cohorts sustain the impression that a scientific debate is still raging. The more studies that confirm global warming, the more ink Ebell gets.\u201d [ What it would really mean if Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement ] Last year, when Pope Francis in an encyclical wrote about the \u201curgent challenge to protect our common home\u201d and said \u201cthe earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor,\u201d Ebell was quick to pounce. \u201cThe Vatican seems to have forgotten to consider the effects that energy-rationing policies to reduce emissions will also have on poor people in poor countries,\u201d he said on CEI\u2019s website. \u201cPutting the world on an energy-starvation diet will consign billions of people to perpetual energy poverty.\u201d During an appearance on C-SPAN last year, Ebell criticized the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan as an example of the type of aggressive regulation that would hinder the U.S. economy while proclaiming to address what he said was the overblown issue of global warming. \u201cI think that the environmental movement has been proclaiming doom right around the corner since it was founded in the late 1960s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they fund the environmental movement. It\u2019s how they attract political support, by saying we have this crisis. We\u2019ve had one crisis after another. Many of them were real problems, but not crises.\u201d Steven Mufson contributed to this report.\u00a0 Read more at Energy & Environment: ",

    "text": "Stem Cell Researchers Anxious About Trump Presidency By Gillian Mohney Nov 11, 2016, 3:26 PM ET 0 Shares Star Noah Berger/Bloomberg via Getty Images A researcher applies supplement to stem cells in a lab at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease in San Francisco, Calif., Sept. 15, 2010. 0 Shares Email As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, scientists are anxiously waiting to see if his policies will affect ongoing scientific research that utilizes embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue. Both embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research have faced either backlash or federal funding restrictions in recent decades. Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, said that at this point, not enough has been said by Trump to give a clear indication about whether any restrictions could be reintroduced. \"It's all a little bit like using a Ouija board,\" Charo, co-chair of the National Academy of Medicine Forum on Regenerative Medicine, said about the upcoming administration. However, she suggested looking to Vice President-elect Mike Pence for some clue as to how the administration might view research. Decorating the White House: What the Trumps Can and Can't Do Treatment Using Stem Cells The field of embryonic stem cell research faced federal funding restrictions under President George Bush that were later removed under President Barack Obama. In 2009, after Obama removed restrictions on federal funding for stem cell research, Pence wrote an op-ed for The Hill calling embryonic stem cell research an \u201cempty promise.\u201d \u201cI am a Christian who believes that life begins at conception and that a human embryo is human life,\u201d Pence wrote. \u201cTherefore, I believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research. Not only that, I believe it is morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Americans, who believe that life is sacred, and use it to fund the destruction of human embryos for research.\u201d Stem cells are developed mainly from donated embryos. From a single embryo, millions of cells can be cultured to develop due to the unique nature of the cells, according to the National Institutes of Health . In recent years, the field of stem cells has advanced greatly, according to experts, thanks in part to the lessening of restrictions and advancements in technology. Experiments involving stem cells are being done across the country to help a host of conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis , spinal cord injury and diabetes , among others. Kevin McCormack, communications director at California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, said reintroducing a funding ban to stymie research would likely be more difficult than it was in the early 2000s when stem cell research was a new field. \u201cIt would be like putting a genie back in the bottle,\u201d said McCormack. Pointing to one case at the University of Southern California , where a paralyzed man regained hand movement after an experimental stem cell therapy, McCormack said any measures that would halt funding or restrict stem cell research wholesale, \u201cwould be like going up to someone and say you can't have that treatment.\u201d McCormack did note that more states have provided stem cell funding, including California, which provides grants for the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. While state funding could help, the NIH provides a huge amount of funding for U.S. medical research, spending approximately $32 billion on medical research annually. Dr. Lorenz Studer, director of the Center for Stem Cell Biology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said after decades of research, scientists are finally starting to see concrete signs that stem cells could become a common form of treatment for certain diseases. \u201cThere has been so much investment to do basic research,\u201d said Studer. \u201cWe want to move forward and see it's going to work.\u201d Studer\u2019s lab has been working on treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease for decades and said he expects that next year experimental treatments for human patients will finally start. His team has created billions of nerve cells designed to imitate the cells lost in Parkinson\u2019s disease. The cells are derived from a single line of embryonic stem cells that are replicated again and again from a single embryo. \u201cThe idea has been around for 20 or 30 years ... but we never had a good source of cells to do it,\u201d he said. Researchers have seen promising results in animal studies with stem cell-based treatments, Studer said. Federal Funding Is 'Essential' Studer\u2019s current funding comes from New York State, but he said federal funding has been \u201cessential for this type of research\u201d in the last 20 years. In 2001, Bush signed an executive order that stopped all federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, except for a handful of cell lines that had already been cultivated from embryos. As a result of these restrictions, researchers faced either giving up federal funding, creating siloed work environments to separate federal funds from other grants or working with cell lines that weren\u2019t quite right for their area of study, according to Studer. Studer himself said he had duplicates of lab equipment that had labels to denote if they were paid for by federal funds or other funds. \u201cWhat you had to do was label all vial dishes, so some would be for federal funding and some would be for non-federal funding,\u201d said Studer. \u201cIt was obviously very cumbersome.\u201d Around the time the restrictions were lifted, Dr. Allen Spiegel, dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and vice chair of the National Institutes of Health Stem Cell Task Force, told ABC News the years of restriction on embryonic stem cell research has been a major setback for U.S. researchers. \"In hearings [before senators] ... I stated that banning funding for research on human embryonic stem cells was like tying one hand behind the backs of stem cell investigators,\" Spiegel said in 2009 . \"Lifting the ban cannot eliminate the effect of years of delay, but harnessing the full power of NIH to review and fund scientifically meritorious research projects will accelerate progress toward the goal of helping people suffering from diabetes, neurologic diseases and many other conditions.\" Other Concerns Studer said there is promise with a new line of stem cells called \u201cinduced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.\u201d These cells are \u201creprogrammed\u201d adult cells, derived from skin or blood cells, that mimic embryonic stem cells. In 2009, Pence cited these cells as a way to avoid using embryonic stem cells. \u201cThese altered cells are known as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and unlike embryonic stem cells, iPS cells do not require the destruction of human eggs or embryos,\u201d Pence wrote in the essay. \u201cThese reprogrammed cells have equal or greater potential to heal unhealthy tissue or combat disease in human organs.\u201d However, the NIH reports \"it is not known if iPSCs and embryonic stem cells differ in clinically significant ways.\" \u201cThe process of making your skin or blood cells into iPS cells, it's a pretty crazy process. You have to put in four genes, and at the end, you get something similar,\u201d Studer, who uses iPS cells in research, explained. \u201cAt the end, there's a concern that... it may not be completely safe\u201d for clinical use. He noted that there is not as much evidence these iPS cells -- first discovered in 2007 -- are as safe to use in experimental treatments in humans as embryonic stem cells, which have been studied for decades. Charo said the way researchers find out if these cells are effective \u201cis by comparing them to what embryonic stem cells can do, that will be an important thing to keep in mind.\u201d Charo said in addition to access to funds for stem cell research, one area of concern is that research using fetal tissue will also be curtailed. Fetal tissue has been used since the 1920s by researchers to study a host of conditions, including vaccine efficacy, transplantation complications and other neurological disorders. In the 1950s, the NIH started to fund research that involved using fetal tissue. Earlier this year, four states, including Indiana, where Pence is currently governor, passed legislation that banned the donation of fetal tissue for research, according to the Guttmacher Institute . The Indiana law signed by Pence also required abortion providers to cremate or dispose of the fetal tissue rather than give the tissue to medical researchers. The laws were passed after video emerged that incorrectly indicated abortion providers from Planned Parenthood were illegally selling fetal tissue for a profit. \u201cWe already have ongoing clinical trials for things like serious neurological [diseases] like MS,\u201d said Charo. \u201cIt's been so much more difficult to get this tissue ... because the atmosphere has gotten really chilling.\u201d This summer, the Indiana law was suspended by a judge a day before it was set to be enacted. It currently remains suspended. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH Former Chris Christie Aides Convicted in 'Bridgegate' Trial 0 Shares Email Two former aides to Republican Gov. Chris Christie convicted in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing case filed for a new trial Friday, a week after a federal jury found them guilty on all counts in a scheme to use gridlock to punish a political opponent. Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a top appointee to the authority that operates the bridge, were each convicted on seven counts of wire fraud, conspiracy and misusing the bridge for improper purposes. Prosecutors said they engineered traffic jams in the town adjacent to the bridge to retaliate against its Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie in 2013. Christie, a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, wasn't charged, but testimony during the trial contradicted what he's said he knew about it. He continued this week to deny any prior knowledge. Vice President-elect Mike Pence was selected Friday to lead Trump's transition team, replacing Christie. Christie will now serve as vice chairman. Meanwhile, a New Jersey lawmaker who co-chaired a legislative committee that probed the lane closings in 2014 called this week for impeachment hearings and for the release of notes on Christie's interviews with federal investigators. On Thursday, Christie's office called state Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg's calls for hearings \"ridiculous.\" David Wildstein, a former political blogger who attended high school with Christie in the 1970s and was Baroni's right-hand man at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, pleaded guilty in 2015 and testified for the government at the trial. Attorneys for Baroni and Kelly argued in court that jurors should have been instructed to return not-guilty verdicts if they believed the government didn't prove the two had conspired with Wildstein for the purpose of punishing Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. Wildstein testified he concocted the scheme. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton disagreed, ruling the government didn't have to prove the motive behind the conspiracy, only that Baroni and Kelly conspired to break the law \u2014 in this case, to misapply Port Authority property, i.e., the bridge. Defense attorneys filed a motion for a mistrial during jury deliberations last week that was denied by Wigenton. The motion was redacted, and neither attorney has revealed what it contained. 0 Shares ",

The president-elect has a Republican-dominated House and Senate in Congress to help him try, but experts say full repeal won't be so easy. And it may not be what the new administration even wants now. Trump told the Wall Street Journal he would consider keeping two of its most popular provisions \u2014 one that allows adult children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans, and another that would forbid insurance companies from refusing to cover \"pre-existing conditions.\" \"I like those very much,\" the newspaper quoted Trump as saying Friday. And the Trump transition team posted a policy website with a skeleton rundown of priorities. \"A Trump Administration will work with Congress to repeal the ACA (Affordable Care Act)and replace it with a solution that includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states,\" it reads. The Obama administration is still talking up the law, announcing via Twitter on Thursday that 100,000 people signed up for coverage on the \"Obamacare\" exchanges on Wednesday, the day after the election. Best day yet this Open Enrollment. Nov 9: Over 100K plan selections on https://t.co/VvaQqwzQu6 . Consumers shopping & enrolling. #GetCovered \u2014 Sylvia Burwell (@SecBurwell) November 10, 2016 The ACA, widely known as Obamacare, has been the signature achievement of Obama's two terms. It sought to transform the unruly, expensive and inefficient U.S. health care system by stopping what were widely considered insurance company abuses, such as dumping people when their health conditions got too expensive to cover and refusing to pay for pre-existing conditions. The ACA requires health insurance companies to pay for cancer screenings, wellness checks and vaccinations with no co-pay, and it allows children to stay on their parents' policies until age 26. Related: Exit Polls Show People Unhappy With Obamacare It puts into place gradual incentives to move from a system where people pay piecemeal for health treatments and, instead, reward doctors and hospitals for keeping patients well and managing their diseases. And most of all, it sought to provide health insurance to the 15 percent of Americans who did not have it before the law passed. It's gone a long way to doing that. Only 8.9 percent of Americans now lack health insurance. Republicans actually like many of these aspects of Obamacare, which was loosely based on Mitt Romney's plan for Massachusetts when he was the Republican governor there. \"The Administration recognizes that the problems with the U.S. health care system did not begin with - and will not end with the repeal of - the ACA,\" the new Trump policy statement reads. Much of the public debate has come because the average person does not understand what Obamacare does and what it doesn't do, said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and an expert on health care. \"People who think we can just repeal Obamacare and everything will be great are in for a very, very, very rude surprise.\" \"Frankly, everything that has gone wrong with the health care system for the past six years has been blamed on Obamacare,\" Jost said. \"Everything that goes wrong with the health care system for the next four years will be blamed on Trump care. People who think we can just repeal Obamacare and everything will be great are in for a very, very, very rude surprise.\" Unlikely to lose coverage in 2017 For one thing, the Trump administration is going to worry about the political risks of leaving 20 million people suddenly without health insurance. \"The number of uninsured is expected to grow to about 50 million people with 'repeal and replace',\" PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) says in a report released this week. \"Trump's challenge will be to lower that number through his replacement proposals.\" Related: Obamacare as We Know it May Be Done For And he cannot do much alone. \"The White House is just one part of a much larger machine. To really put his stamp on health policy, Trump must work with a patchwork of federal lawmakers, regulatory agencies, trade and advocacy groups, and the Supreme Court. These institutions will either accelerate or decelerate Trump's agenda,\" PwC said. The people who now have coverage on the exchanges \u2014 including people signing up right now during open enrollment \u2014 are unlikely to lose their coverage in the coming year, experts from all political viewpoints agree. \"The new administration is going to want to do something fast to show that they are keeping their promise to fundamentally change the federal role in the health care system,\" said Michael Sparer, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University. One thing a new Republican administration could do immediately is drop appeals against last May's federal court ruling that said the Obama administration was illegally paying insurance companies to help keep health insurance costs down for low-income clients. \"The new administration is going to want to do something fast to show that they are keeping their promise to fundamentally change the federal role in the health care system.\" These so-called cost sharing reductions reimburse health insurers for charging lower co-pays and deductibles for more than 60 percent of Obamacare customers. Congress refused to allocate money to do that, and a federal district judge ruled in May that the administration couldn't spend that money. The federal government kept on doing so while it appealed. Related: How Trump Could Erase Obama's Legacy Symbolic moves A new administration could stop fighting that right away, although it's not a particularly sexy issue for voters. And it might irritate health insurance companies, Jost said. \"I don't think anyone disagrees that it would be the insurers left holding the bag,\" Jost told NBC News. A new administration could also stop fighting lawsuits against the mandate that employers pay for birth control for women covered under their insurance plans, Sparer said. That might be popular with conservatives who said the requirement forced them to violate their religious beliefs. There could be symbolic moves, also. The new Republican-led Congress may immediately vote on a repeal that will almost certainly be stopped by a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. While the Democrats do not have a majority in the Senate, they have enough seats to stop some legislation with a filibuster. \"I think the only grand gesture they can make is to blame Democrats for filibustering their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\" said Jost. Sparer agreed that is likely. Republicans could campaign to get more seats in the Senate in the 2018 elections. \"That gives them a couple of years to think about what the replacement plan they want to come up with is,\" Sparer said. A new Trump Health and Human Services Department could also stop promoting open enrollment onto the Obamacare exchanges, which closes at the end of January \u201410 days after Inauguration Day. Enrollment usually spikes right at the deadline, and simply stopping outreach could hit numbers. Related: Obamacare Premiums Are Up But What Does That Mean? In fact, doing nothing could accomplish a lot, said Jost. \"It has been a full court press by the Obama administration since 2010 to get this thing implemented and it has taken a Herculean effort,\" Jost said. \"As soon as it stops moving forward, it could start moving backward pretty quickly. Almost just by doing nothing there could be some very negative effects.\" \"I think the only grand gesture they can make is to blame Democrats for filibustering their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\" Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute, says Republicans plan to use the budget process to tweak the law. \"I would look to the reconciliation package,\" he told NBC News. \"This is the mechanism for how we move forward on this.\" Re-branding with a new plan Budget issues can pass the Senate with a simple majority, bypassing Democrats who may object, although they must go through a lengthy process involving committees. Troy said the GOP has been discussing ways to provide a transition period so as not to throw the health insurance and health care industries into chaos. \"What I always hear is that Republicans have no plans on replacing the Affordable Care Act. I think that is not only untrue, but unfair,\" Troy said. An immediate target may be the unpopular exchanges, the web-based system for buying health insurance. Troy says they are unnecessary, and changing them up would be an easy way for Republicans to re-brand Obamacare. \"People can get health care without exchanges,\" he said. \"People can get health care without exchanges.\" Trump has put forward the idea of allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines, and Troy said that could lower costs by creating more competition, although it will be a messy task to undertake since insurance is now firmly regulated by states. Trump's also advocated the use of health savings accounts and tax credits to help people pay for health insurance, although experts such as Jost say it's not clear how those would help low-income people. The mandate to buy health insurance is another obvious target for a new administration, even though Republicans originally supported the idea. It's there to try to ensure that enough healthy people buy health insurance so that companies can profitably pay for the sick, but it's been seen as onerous. And it hasn't worked well as an incentive, said Caroline Pearson of consultancy Avalere Health. Simply dropping enforcement of the mandate would be popular and easy, while causing little damage to existing coverage. Maggie Fox ",

Vaughn died Friday morning after a brief battle with acute leukemia, according to his manager, Matthew Sullivan. \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" was an immediate hit, particularly with young people, when it debuted on NBC 1964. It was part of an avalanche of secret agent shows (\"I Spy,\" ''Mission: Impossible,\" ''Secret Agent\"), spoofs (\"Get Smart\"), books (\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\") and even songs (\"Secret Agent Man\") inspired by the James Bond films. Vaughn's urbane superspy Napoleon Solo teamed with Scottish actor David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin, a soft-spoken, Russian-born agent. In this undated photo, actor Robert Vaughn is photographed in Rome, Italy. Vaughn, the debonair crime-fighter of television's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" in the 1960s, died Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, after a brief battle with acute leukemia. He was 83. Anonymous / AP The pair, who had put aside Cold War differences for a greater good, worked together each week for the mysterious U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) in combatting the international crime syndicate THRUSH. \"Girls age 9 to 12 liked David McCallum because he was so sweet,\" Vaughn remarked in a 2005 interview in England. \"But the old ladies and the 13- to 16-year-olds liked me because I was so detached.\" \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" was also a big hit abroad, particularly in McCallum's native Great Britain. The show aired until early 1968, when sagging ratings brought it to an end. In his \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Book,\" Jon Heitland blamed its demise on a shift from straight adventure to more comic plots in the show's third season that turned off many viewers, as well as time slot changes. Vaughn and McCallum reunited in 1983 for a TV movie, \"The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" in which the super spies were lured out of retirement to save the world once more. (McCallum has found stardom anew in his 14th season playing Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard on the hit CBS drama \"NCIS\".) In recent years, Vaughn had starred for eight seasons on the British crime-caper series \"Hustle,\" playing Albert Stroller, the lone Yank in a band of London-based con artists. \"Hustle\" also aired in the U.S. \"I imagined that Napoleon Solo had retired from U.N.C.L.E., whatever U.N.C.L.E. was,\" Vaughn recalled in 2006. \"What could he do now to use his talents and to supplement his government pension? I imagined Stroller as Napoleon Solo, The Later Years.\" In this Sept. 18, 1979 file photo, actor Robert Vaughn poses with his Emmy Award for outstanding supporting actor for a drama series in \"Washington: Behind Closed Doors.\" during the 31st Annual Primetime Emmy Award presentation in Los Angeles, Calif. AP Before \"U.N.C.L.E.\" Vaughn made his mark in movies, earning an Oscar nomination in 1959 for his supporting role in \"The Young Philadelphians,\" in which he played a wounded war veteran accused of murder. The following year, he turned in a memorable performance as a gunfighter who had lost his nerve in \"The Magnificent Seven.\" Making that movie, Vaughn recalled in 2005, had presented the cast with a vexing problem: no script. \"We had to improvise everything,\" he said. \"I had to go to the costume department myself and choose the black vest and the black hat.\" A liberal Democrat, Vaughn became passionately opposed to the Vietnam War while he was making \"U.N.C.L.E.\" and delivered anti-war speeches at colleges and other venues around the country. He also debated the war with conservative William F. Buckley on the latter's TV talk show, \"Firing Line.\" Vaughn became a friend of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and campaigned for him during his 1968 run for the presidency. When Kennedy was assassinated that year, Vaughn was so upset that he moved to England for five years. Returning to the U.S., the actor decided to resume his education. He had already earned a bachelor's degree in theater arts from California State University, Los Angeles, in 1956, and a master's degree from the University of Southern California in 1960. He returned to USC, where he earned a Ph.D. His doctoral dissertation was an overview of the House Un-American Activities Commission's effect on American theater. It resulted in a well-received book \"Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting.\" Vaughn was also drawn to politics in several of the TV roles he chose. He portrayed Harry S. Truman in \"The Man from Independence,\" Woodrow Wilson in \"Backstairs at the White House\" and a presidential aide in the 12-hour \"Washington: Behind Closed Doors,\" for which he won an Emmy. He also toured in a one-man play \"F.D.R.\" about Franklin D. Roosevelt's battles with polio. Vaughn also remained active in movies, usually in character roles. Among his films: \"The Venetian Affair,\" ''The Bridge at Remagen,\" ''Julius Caesar\" (the 1970 British version starring Charlton Heston), \"The Towering Inferno,\" ''S.O.B.,\" ''Superman III\" and \"Delta Force.\" Robert Francis Vaughn was born into a theatrical family Nov. 22, 1932, in New York City. His father was a radio actor, his mother performed on Broadway and his grandparents acted in theater. His parents divorced when he was only 6 months old, however, and he was sent to live with his grandparents in Minneapolis, where he said his childhood was miserable. \"I cried all the time and I was always getting beat up.\" After his grandparents died, Vaughn moved to Los Angeles. Spotted in a college play, he was signed to a contract with Burt Lancaster's company but was soon drafted into the Army. After his discharge in 1957, he made his first movie, \"No Time to Be Young.\" Long among Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, Vaughn married actress Linda Staab in 1974. \"The breaks all fell my way,\" said Vaughn in 2006. But was he really as cool as he appeared to his adoring audience? \"Not according to my wife,\" Vaughn chuckled. \"She's married to the guy who doesn't take the garbage out on Tuesday evenings, the guy she battles with to get me out of my jumpsuit and running shoes. She doesn't allow me in public unless I wear a tie and a coat.\" Vaughn is survived by his wife, Linda Staab Vaughn, their son Cassidy and daughter Caitlin. The Associated Press ",

The social networking site had come under fire for a practice that many viewed as discriminatory.\u00a0 In a blog post Friday, Erin Egan, vice president of Facebook U.S. public policy and the company\u2019s chief privacy officer, affirmed that advertisers will no longer be able to target or exclude different groups from ads for credit, employment, or housing.\u00a0 Egan acknowledged that while the company\u2019s \u201cethnic affinity\u201d marketing service was created so that brands could reach more \u201cmulticultural audiences with more relevant advertising,\u201d concerns from civil rights leaders and site users have caused the company to reassess its approach to ads.\u00a0 \u201cRecently, policymakers and civil rights leaders have expressed concerns that advertisers could misuse some aspects of our affinity marketing segments. Specifically, they\u2019ve raised the possibility that some advertisers might use these segments to run ads that discriminate against people, particularly in areas where certain groups have historically faced discrimination \u2014 housing, employment and the extension of credit,\u201d Egan wrote. \u201cWe take these issues seriously. Discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook.\u201d Just last week, three users filed a lawsuit alleging that Facebook\u2019s advertising practice violates the Fair Housing Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Mark Zuckerberg: False news stories on Facebook did not sway the election ProPublica was the first outlet to shed a light on the company\u2019s advertising policies at the end of last month.\u00a0 The nonprofit news outlet tested the system by purchasing an ad using tools on Facebook to target members who were house hunting but exclude anyone with an \u201cEthnic Affinity\u201d of African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic. \u201cWhen we showed Facebook\u2019s racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer John Relman, he gasped and said, \u2018This is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find,\u2019\u201d ProPublica \u2019s Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr. wrote. Moving forward, Facebook said it will build tools to \u201cdetect and automatically disable\u201d this ethnic affinity marketing tool for ads offering housing, employment, or credit. Egan stressed that \u201cthere are many non-discriminatory uses\u201d of the ethnic affinity tool but that the company made the call to \u201cbest guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads.\u201d Beyond this, the company is updating its advertising policy guidelines that will require advertisers to declare they will not engage with discriminatory advertising on the site. The company will give these advertisers \u201ceducational materials\u201d that will help them \u201cunderstand their obligations\u201d when placing ads for these services. \u201cWe are making these changes to deter discrimination and strengthen our ability to enforce our policies,\u201d she added. \u201cWe look forward to finding additional ways to combat discrimination, while increasing opportunity, and to continuing our dialogue with policymakers and civil rights leaders about these important issues.\u201d \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Nov 11 2016, 4:01 pm ET Cubs Manager Joe Maddon Goes to Bat for Hometown Hispanics by Corky Siemaszko advertisement Joe Maddon was six years from leading the Chicago Cubs to their first World Series victory in more than a century, and sitting on a kid-sized chair in a private home-turned-preschool, when a light bulb went on in his head. He had come to a Christmas party at a daycare in his beloved Hazleton, Pennsylvania, to meet some of the area's Hispanic residents \u2014 the very people who were being blamed for the crime, for the drug abuse, for the joblessness and despair that was gripping his hometown. The proud city that once was home to more than 30,000 people in 1980, when the coals mines were operating and the garment factories were humming, had lost a third of its population when those jobs went away. And those who stayed were leery of the new arrivals. Cubs manager Joe Maddon sits with kids at the Hazleton One Community Center he helped found to improve relations in the Hazleton, Pennsylvania between whites and Hispanics. Bob Curry / Hazleton One Communi As the kids clambered in and out of his lap and their parents filled their plates with Dominican delicacies and chattered happily in Spanish and English, Maddon had this revelation: \"He said, 'This is exactly what I grew up with,'\" Amilcar Arroyo, a local businessman who was at that bash, recalled. \"This is the way we Italians grew up. A mom and pop business, all the children around. He was touched by that reality.\" And thus began Maddon's unlikely quest to save his city from the anti-Hispanic bigotry that was ripping it apart. \"My city was dying,\" he would later tell The Washington Post. Within a few years, Maddon and his allies in town had launched the Hazleton Integration Project (HIP), which was designed to break down the barriers between the white residents of this city of 25,340 and the Hispanics who now account for 40 percent of the population. They also started the Hazleton One Community Center, which now provides after-school and other programs for hundreds of kids as well as adults. With the election of Donald Trump as the nation's next president, Arroyo said HIP is needed more than ever to keep the lines of communication open between the two groups. \"This was a very tough and hard election, but the campaign is over and it is time to move on,\" he said. \"This is the kind of place that helps people move on.\" Hazleton, which sits near the junctures of Interstates 80 and 81, was built by generations of earlier immigrants who flocked there when the mines were humming. But even back then it was not always a place that welcomed foreigners with open arms. \"This was a very tough and hard election, but the campaign is over and it is time to move on. This is the kind of place that helps people move on.\" In 1897, 19 immigrant miners demanding decent treatment \u2014 Poles, Slovaks, Lithuanians and Germans \u2014 were gunned down by sheriff's deputies. That bloodletting that came to be known as the Lattimer massacre and led to the rise of the United Mine Workers union and dramatic improvements in the way miners were treated nationwide. On his father's side, Maddon's people were Italians who lopped off the \"ini\" from Maddonini to sound more American. On his mother's side, they were hardworking Poles who toiled in the mines and clothing factories. \"Those tough Polish ladies, man, I grew up with them,\" an appreciative Maddon told ESPN as the Cubs were battling the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. \"They're awesome.\" Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon stands in the dugout during a baseball game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Pittsburgh on Aug. 4, 2015. Gene J. Puskar / AP Hazleton was already in decline when Maddon was growing up in an apartment over his dad's plumbing business. Most of the mines had closed and the once-thriving garment industry had moved away. At 19, Maddon left town to pursue his dream of playing Major League baseball. But Maddon would always return to Hazleton. And it was on one of his regular trips back to see his mother and his extended family that Maddon started hearing about \"them.\" From one end of town to the other it was the same refrain \u2014 crime was on rise, drugs were running rampant, and it was all the fault of those Dominicans and the other Hispanics who were barely a demographic blip in 2010. He'd hear it at the Third Base Luncheonette, a popular eatery that has been in the family since 1949 and where his now 83-year-old mom Albina, better known as \"Beanie,\" still works. He'd hear it at Cusat's Caf\u00e9, when he would stop in for a shot and a beer. Related: Cubs fan travels to dad's grave to listen to Chicago's World Series win \"If you know Joe Maddon, he loves his city,\" said Bob Curry, who is married to Maddon's cousin Elaine. \"Suddenly he hears people really bad mouthing the place and it's all the Hispanics fault. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to him because his whole life has been about taking people from all kinds of backgrounds and getting them to work as a team. He thinks it's just flat out weird.\" Maddon made his living getting the most out of players with names like Miguel Montero, Albert Amora and Javier Baez. And he had made a point of learning enough Spanish to make it easier to communicate with his stars. \"Suddenly he hears people really bad mouthing the place and it's all the Hispanics fault. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to him...\" Then in 2006, Hazleton made national headlines when the city's Republican mayor pushed through an ordinance called the Illegal Immigration Relief Act. It gave city officials the greenlight to deny business permits to outfits that hired undocumented workers and fine landlords up to $1,000 for leasing apartments to \"illegals.\" The ordinance, which was later struck down in federal court, also made English the official language of Hazleton. \"That really got Joe's attention,\" Curry said. \"About six years or so ago, Joe was in the city for a couple of weeks. We were sitting around dinner and Joe was expressing his concerns about what he was hearing from people he knows and loves about the Hispanics. He was saying, 'Why are they pinning all of Hazleton's problems on them?'\" Maddon's concerns fell on receptive ears. Play ",

Says By NICK CUMMING-BRUCE Continue reading the main story Photo Members of the Iraqi police tried to pull a body from a mass grave discovered in Hamam al-Alil on Monday. Credit Ahmad Al-Rubaye/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images GENEVA \u2014 Islamic State militants have summarily killed scores of civilians in the Iraqi city of Mosul in recent days, sometimes using children as executioners, and have used chemical agents against Iraqi and Kurdish troops, United Nations officials said on Friday. Video posted by the militants on Wednesday showed four children, who appear to be 10 to 14 years old, shooting four civilians accused of disloyalty at a location near the Tigris River, said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office in Geneva. The video release identified one of the children as Russian, another as coming from Uzbekistan and two as Iraqis. United Nations investigators had not identified the time of the killings but believed they were recent, citing the surge in executions by Islamic State courts and fighters in and around Mosul in recent weeks and the brutal training the militants have forced on children in the parts of Iraq and Syria they control. \u201cThey are showing they are still in business,\u201d Ms. Shamdasani said of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh. In one massacre, militants were said to have summarily shot 40 civilians in Mosul, dressing them in orange clothes adorned with words, marked in red, labeling them \u201ctraitors and agents of the I.S.F.,\u201d Ms. Shamdasani said, using the abbreviation for Iraqi Security Forces. Afterward, the militants strung up the bodies of their victims from electricity poles around the city \u2014 a practice the Islamic State long used to strike fear into those who live in the group\u2019s strongholds. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The next day, Islamic State fighters shot 20 civilians at a military base in the north of the city and also strung up their bodies with signs carrying statements like \u201cused cellphones to leak information to the I.S.F.,\u201d she said. The battle for Mosul, with tens of thousands of security force members bearing down on Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, is now almost a month old. At the beginning, the fighting moved relatively quickly because the first objective was to clear dozens of outlying villages that, while they were defended by Islamic State militants, were largely uninhabited by civilians, allowing government forces a freer hand to act without regard for killing civilians. But in the 10 days since Iraqi counterterrorism forces punched into the city itself from the east, the fighting has slowed, as soldiers go house to house in brutal urban fighting in areas where there are still large numbers of civilians. Over the past week, the largest numbers of civilians so far have fled the fighting, with close to 48,000 people displaced as of Friday, according to the World Health Organization and United Nations. But that is nowhere near the total that officials worry could be in danger once the fighting moves to the most populated areas across the Tigris on the west side of Mosul, which is still believed to be home to at least one million people. Reports from inside the city indicate that the Islamic State has set up elaborate defenses on the banks of the Tigris, including artillery pieces. The United Nations said that militants were reported to have shot six civilians on Oct. 20 for keeping hidden SIM cards in defiance of an order to surrender them. A week later, a 27-year-old man was killed for keeping a cellphone, she added. Among the witnesses to the recent killings was the sole survivor from a group of 50 former members of Iraq\u2019s security forces who was abducted by militants, taken to the Mosul airport and shot. Although wounded, \u201che pretended to be dead, escaped, and we spoke to him,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, a mass grave discovered on Monday by Iraqi troops near an agricultural college in the town of Hamam al-Alil was only one among numerous sites of large-scale killings, Ms. Shamdasani said. The grave contained at least 100 corpses, but Islamic State fighters were also reported to have dumped bodies down a well and at a cement factory yard in the same town, and at several other locations including the Mosul airport and in the Tigris. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On a lengthening list of atrocities reported from Mosul, militants had deployed \u201csons of the Caliphate,\u201d believed to be teenagers or younger, around the old town armed with explosive belts. They had also brought abducted women, some of them members of Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority, into the city to distribute them as slaves for their fighters. Interviews with residents inside Mosul in recent days indicate a pattern of brutality by the Islamic State much like what the United Nations has been reporting, including an increase in the number of boys on the streets carrying rifles and swords. One resident told The New York Times that the Islamic State in recent days had executed 18 former security force members and driven their bodies in the back of a pickup truck to a freshly dug mass grave. In addition to the Islamic State\u2019s forcibly moving civilians into Mosul for use as human shields to deter attack, the United Nations said it had credible reports of the group\u2019s fighters\u2019 using chemical weapons and chemical agents like chlorine gas against advancing Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Ms. Shamdasani said that Iraqi troops entering the city had found large quantities of sulfur and ammonia stockpiled in civilian areas of the city. The discovery raised fears that the chemicals could be used as a weapon to slow advancing government forces or punish civilians left behind after militants set on fire and shelled a sulfur gas factory in a subdistrict of Mosul. Their action resulted in the death of four civilians who inhaled fumes from burning sulfur, she added. Militants had also reportedly dumped sulfur in trenches and pits in Mosul and were holding civilians nearby. Human rights officials are also receiving accounts of revenge killings by pro-government forces, targeting local Sunni civilians they accused of aiding or supporting the Islamic State, deepening fears that sectarian strife will continue after the battle for Mosul has ended. Voicing outrage at the \u201cnumbing and intolerable\u201d suffering inflicted on civilians by the unfolding conflict, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, in a statement on Friday demanded immediate action by the Iraqi government to protect fleeing or freed residents of areas held by the Islamic State and to bring the attackers to justice. Quick action could save lives by discouraging people from taking the law into their own hands, Ms. Shamdasani said. Tim Arango contributed reporting from Erbil, Iraq.

    "text": "The sweeps hark back to the workplace actions of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and deviated significantly from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s longstanding enforcement strategy of avoiding roundups of unauthorized workers and instead targeting abusive employers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story During the raids, the authorities discovered that nine workers had re-entered the country after having been deported, which is a federal crime. Three more, including Mr. Salazar, were charged with immigration violations \u2014 which are administrative offenses only \u2014 and were ordered deported. The remaining 10 workers were released. \u201cThe targets of the investigation were the employers,\u201d a homeland security spokesman, Khaalid Walls, said. \u201cAfter investigating the case, we alleged that many of the employees were either subject to criminal charges or immigration violations, and we charged accordingly.\u201d Camille Mackler, the legal director of the New York Immigration Coalition , which oversees immigrant advocacy groups, said, \u201cThere\u2019s always collateral damage in a criminal investigation, but the workers in this case are victims.\u201d Now, Ms. Mackler added, workers and advocates fear that this could be the blueprint for future raids under Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201cand that would be on the small side.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo Sergio Mucino, the owner of La Divina and three other restaurants, was arrested last month, accused of harboring undocumented workers and paying them off the books. Credit Brendan Bannon for The New York Times Mr. Trump pledged that in his first year in office he would deport unauthorized immigrants with criminal records, putting their number at two million, while increasing enforcement operations to deal with an undocumented population of more than 11 million people in the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t see Mr. Trump as the kind of individual who is going to make such a large promise and neglect to keep it,\u201d said Tom Bauerle , a Buffalo native and conservative talk show host on WBEN, who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI expect the law to be enforced.\u201d Mr. Bauerle said that after the raids the radio station received numerous comments from listeners cheering the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement . \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cthey are disappointed because apparently these places made awesome tacos.\u201d The authorities said the raids were set in motion more than two years ago, thanks, in part, to a tip from a former employee who was fired. Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to the workers and their lawyers, Mr. Mucino paid weekly salaries for 11-hour days that worked out to be below the minimum hourly wage of $9. Two workers interviewed said salaries started at $450 a week for a dishwasher and increased at different positions in the kitchen. The federal complaint stated that each restaurant grossed $50,000 per week, which was not reported for state or federal taxes. The authorities said Mr. Mucino operated some of the business on the books, endorsing payroll checks to 28 employees. \u201cBuilding and supporting a business through the intentional use of people not lawfully authorized to work here is a model that H.S.I. will not tolerate,\u201d said Kevin Sibley, the acting special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Buffalo. He added that such practices undermine competition and \u201coften come at the peril of the workers.\u201d But the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Western District of New York did not charge Mr. Mucino or his associates with human trafficking, nor have tax evasion or labor violation charges been filed. Nicole Hallett, a University at Buffalo law professor who is representing three workers in their immigration cases, called the government\u2019s actions counterintuitive. \u201cIf you are concerned about the exploitation of workers, you should not be prosecuting or deporting worker victims, because that discourages workers from coming forward in situations where they are being exploited,\u201d Professor Hallett said. In interviews, four workers said they were not mistreated at the restaurants. They noted that the pay was better than that at agricultural or factory jobs they held previously. Mr. Salazar, the head cook at La Divina, is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor as he awaits deportation proceedings, though he is charged only with a civil offense. \u201cIf this is just from being here to work,\u201d Mr. Salazar said, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, \u201cwhat would happen if I actually committed a crime?\u201d He said he had earned a law degree in Mexico, but was unable to find work there to support his family of three. Photo Sergio Roblero, one of the undocumented workers, said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that other people are going to go through what I did.\u201d Credit Brendan Bannon for The New York Times Sergio Roblero, 19, said he had paid a recruiter in Mexico $4,480 for a guest worker\u2019s visa and travel expenses to pick blueberries in Georgia. He was told he would be making $10.59 an hour; he made only $3, he said. Mr. Roblero was unable to leave the farm unless he paid $1,000 to get his passport back. To recoup his losses, he moved four months ago to Buffalo, where a friend from Mexico was working for Mr. Mucino\u2019s restaurants. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI\u2019m afraid that other people are going to go through what I did,\u201d Mr. Roblero said. \u201cI know that the economy in Mexico is always going to be bad and people are always going to come to this country.\u201d According to statistics from 2014 released this month by the Pew Research Center, nearly eight million undocumented people in the United States were part of the work force or seeking employment. In New York State, undocumented immigrants represented 6 percent of the labor force. While some of his workers are still detained, Mr. Mucino was released on $85,000 bail and reopened La Divina, though his other restaurants, which are full service, remain closed. Mr. Mucino parked a black Mercedes sport utility vehicle behind the store last week and spoke of his employees. \u201cAll of them are very nice people and they\u2019re hard workers,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel very bad for everything that happened.\u201d He declined to comment further on the charges. According to the authorities, an incident in August accelerated the investigation. Fourteen men went to play basketball after their shifts around 10 p.m., at a suburban Buffalo playground. The local police answered a call about the group and asked for identification. When some of the men could produce only Mexican identification cards, the police called the United States Border Patrol. By 1:30 a.m., 10 people were detained and five were arrested, charged with having illegally re-entered the country. Later, a manager, Manguin Sanchez, a United States citizen, went to collect the men\u2019s cash, which had been seized by immigration officers, and told the authorities it was their pay. According to the federal complaint, he also said restaurant workers lived in properties he owned. It was confirmation for investigators. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition to Mr. Sanchez, 22, and Mr. Mucino, the authorities arrested another manager, Jose Sanchez-Ocampo, 37. The men provided two houses and nine apartments for their employees\u2019 housing. Leticia and Saul Sanchez-Ocampo \u2014 Jose Sanchez-Ocampo\u2019s brother \u2014 live in one house, along with four children, all of whom are United States citizens. Continue reading the main story Photo Leticia Sanchez-Ocampo in her home, which was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. \u201cIt\u2019s been like a nightmare for the whole family,\u201d she said. Credit Brendan Bannon for The New York Times Ms. Sanchez-Ocampo, who had started working with her husband at La Divina only two days before the raids, said the family moved in 2015 from Los Angeles to Buffalo to be closer to relatives. Her daughter, Magali, 17, is the best student in the family, she said, and had saved more than $9,000 in cash for her college fund. It was confiscated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during a raid of the house. \u201cIt\u2019s been like a nightmare for the whole family,\u201d Ms. Sanchez-Ocampo said in Spanish, through an interpreter. The workers have received support from local churches, community organizations and a national workers\u2019 rights group, Movimiento Cosecha , which organized several protests in Buffalo. Some Buffalo residents have put aside questions of immigration policy and the exploitation of immigrant labor in favor of their taste buds. Since opening in 2015, La Divina has drawn rave reviews and long lines for its authentic, overstuffed $2.50 tacos. Gaetano Augello, 60, acknowledged that he felt uncomfortable hearing that workers might have been taken advantage of. \u201cOf course, who wants to subsidize that? That\u2019s not a feel-good story,\u201d he said. But he had returned for the tacos. And now that Mr. Mucino has hired replacement cooks to make the recipes? \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re quite as good,\u201d Mr. Augello said. \u201cThey\u2019re good, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on November 12, 2016, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Restaurateur Was Target, but Workers Are Swept Up in Immigration Raid.

'There Has to Be a Complete Restructuring' by Alex Seitz-Wald advertisement In the wake of Hillary Clinton's stunning loss this week, progressives are moving quickly to fill the power vacuum left in the Democratic Party and eyeing a takeover of the Democratic National Committee, with Rep. Keith Ellison gaining momentum as the left's apparent candidate of choice to lead it. The next chair of the DNC will play a key leadership role as the party builds itself back from defeat, and their election early next year will be a key test in the struggle for control of the party between the so-called establishment and a more populist wing that largely backed Bernie Sanders in the primary. Congressman Keith Ellison. Getty Images Less than 48 hours out from the election, an unusually rapid consolidation already seems to be occurring around Ellison, the co-chairman of the Progressive Caucus, who had been quietly discussing his interest in the chairmanship before the election. Meanwhile, former DNC Chair Howard Dean said he would be interested in serving again. \"The Dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again,\" Dean said on Twitter. Related: Democrats Try to Salvage What They Can From Wreckage of 2016 Election Dean's DNC tenure has been widely praised, though he's drifted a bit from the progressive message he embraced during his 2004 presidential campaign and was an early and vocal Clinton endorser. The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again. \u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) November 10, 2016 Ellison has not declared his candidacy and it's unclear who else might run, but Sen. Bernie Sanders and a number of progressives groups indicated they favored Ellison Thursday. \"You cannot be a party which on one hand says we're in favor of working people, we're in favor of the needs of young people but we don't quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class. People do not believe that. You've got to decide which side you're on,\" Sanders told the AP in an interview endorsing Ellison. Donna Brazile, the Democratic strategist who took over as interim chair after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz abruptly stepped down from the post this summer, has said she will not run for a full term as DNC chair. Donna Brazile, the acting Chair of the Democratic National Committee since the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, talks to the media on the floor at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. July 25, 2016. CARLOS BARRIA / Reuters \"The DNC must clean house,\" MoveOn.org executive director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement expressing support for Ellison. \"At the same time, the DNC must connect with the grassroots of the party base that wants the party to reject corporate influence and advance an inclusive, progressive agenda.\" Progressive Change Campaign Committee also gave some support the idea of Ellison, with co-founder Stephanie Taylor calling him \"one of many good people who could lead the DNC in a new and more winning direction.\" \"The Democratic establishment had their chance with this election. It's time for new leadership of the Democratic Party \u2014 younger, more diverse, and more ideological \u2014 that is hungry to do things differently, like leading a movement instead of dragging people to the polls,\" Taylor said in a statement.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, the other co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, declined to speak about Ellison's candidacy Thursday, but called for the kinds of changes at the DNC that Ellison might bring. \"There has to be a complete restructuring of that committee,\" he told NBC News. \"The DNC cannot continue as it is as if nothing occurred.\" Related: Obama Hosts Trump at White House for First Meeting After Election Neil Sroka of Democracy for America, which grew out of Dean's presidential bid, said his group would not endorse in the DNC chair's race until they had seen all the candidates. \"That said, Keith Ellison has been a stalwart ally of the progressive grassroots and is definitely someone that we're very happy is thinking about possibly pursuing a race for chair,\" Sroka said. \"The Democratic Party establishment that tried to ensure the primary was over before it even started has zero moral authority in the fight for who will be the next party chair.\" Related: Republican Battles Won't End With Election Night Victories Before the election, which Democrats assumed Hillary Clinton would win, those said to be eyeing the post included EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock, Reps. Xavier Becerra and Steve Israel, who each held leadership posts in the House, and South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison, among others. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who had been seen as a front runner, seemed to take herself out of the running last week when she called for a younger and more diverse pick \u2014 but that could have been influenced by a desire for a Clinton administration post, which is now not an option. The committee's primary roles includes fundraising, messaging, and maintaining key databases, but it has not in recent years had a major field organizing capacity, which Grijalva said is a must. Ellison became the first Muslim-American elected to Congress in 2006, and has risen to become a prominent national progressive voice as one of the first members of Congress to endorse Sanders. In his native Minneapolis, Ellison worked on innovative ways to contact low-income voters in inner cities who often don't turn out in elections. Supporters have resurfaced a clip from July of 2015 when Ellison was practically laughed off a TV set for saying Trump could win the Republican nomination. \"I know you don't believe,\" ABC host George Stephanopoulos replied. However, many Democrats objected to putting a House member in charge of the DNC after Wasserman Shultz' tenure, since it complicated relationships with congressional leadership. And the chair is traditionally a major party fundraiser, which might be at odds with the left's objects to big money-in-politics. Post-election losses are typically a time of major rebuilding for parties. Dean, who ran as a progressive in the 2004 Democratic primary, took over as chairman of the party in 2005 after nominee John Kerry lost the presidential race. Before him, Terry Mcauliffe took over after the party lost the 2000 and raised the money to build it's current headquarters. Alex Seitz-Wald ",

And though they have been bigger in scope than prior protests -- most of which surrounded the 2000 election where the winner was not determined for weeks after the vote -- the demonstrations have largely been confined to cities in states that Hillary Clinton won. \"The nation is highly polarized and even more than it had been in 2000. Differences are greater and, therefore, the stakes are higher, emotions run stronger, and losses felt more deeply,\" said James Campbell, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo in New York. ABC News USA_Post_Election_Protests_v01 Campbell, whose book \"Polarized: Making Sense of a Divided America\" was published this summer, said that the stark differences that were shown in these election results are likely contributing to the fervor. \"We are so polarized that many Americans had not really come into contact with others who have opposite views. Because of this, it becomes unthinkable to those on either side that other side could win the election. This was expressed in the claims about the election being possibly rigged,\" Campbell said. Campbell said other contributing factors include the age of many of the protesters -- and this being their first presidential loss -- and the general trend that \"protests are much more commonplace on the left than on the right.\" The locations of the protests fit with Democratic strongholds, though that comes as little surprise to Georgetown University associate professor Hans Noel. \"In general, Democrats are strong in cities and in areas with larger non-white populations,\" Noel told ABC News. 0 Shares ",

In Trump's 10-point immigration plan, he says he will \"cancel\" the executive orders. Related: Latinos Who Voted, Campaigned For Trump Found Common Ground With Him Kobach was the architect of Arizona's SB 1070 law which allows law enforcement to ask people for to prove their immigration status when there is \"reasonable suspicion\" that they might not be in the country legally. He also coined the idea of \"self-deportation,\" which would make immigration laws so stringent that it would encourage people to leave the country. As for the wall along the southern border, Kobach said it will get built, \"no question.\" \"The only question is how quickly will it get done and who helps pay for it,\" he said. Trump has vowed that Mexico will pay for it. According to a document obtained by the New York Times , leading Trump's \"Immigration Reform & Building the Wall\" component of his transition is Danielle Cutrona. She is Sen. Jeff Sessions' counsel on the Judiciary Committee. Sessions has long opposed illegal \u2014 and many forms of legal \u2014 immigration. During the campaign, Trump adopted many of Sessions' policy positions, including ending federal funding for sanctuary cities and ending \"catch-and-release.\" Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said that \"personnel is policy\" at this point in the administration. \"Who is in the room and who is appointed to these positiosn has massive implications for the American economy, particularly when it comes to immigration,\" Noorani said. Trump made immigration central to his candidacy, and after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan on Capitol Hill Thursday, h e said immigration was his top priority. As for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country, Rep. Chris Collins of New York, one of Trump's earliest backers, said deporting them is not part of the plan and that after the border is secure and the \"criminal element\" is removed, Collins predicts some sort of legalization for the undocumented. \"I think we can do fundamental immigration reform,\" he said.

The debate over the repeal campaign often centered on the billions of dollars that the state has spent on capital punishment in recent decades. Michael Hestrin , the district attorney of Riverside County, who opposed Proposition 62, said Californians have consistently favored keeping the death penalty. He cited an earlier failed repeal proposition in 2012.

While eight states have ended capital punishment since 2000, all of them did so through elected officials and courts. In California, death penalty opponents convinced that public opinion had shifted their way were searching for answers. Some contended that a dueling capital punishment measure on the ballot may have confused voters. (Proposition 66, which promised to streamline the death row appeals process, still remained undecided ). Sharon Dolovich , a U.C.L.A. law professor whose research has focused on prisons and punishment, said she wondered whether the country\u2019s anxious political mood could have had a role. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people are scared, that fear can manifest as a punitive impulse.\u201d California Online Photo Demonstrators blocked traffic in Oakland on Thursday night.

Trump now in bind over his threat to prosecute Hillary Clinton Donald Trump is in a bind after \u201clock her up\u201d comments Here\u2019s a look at the dilemma Donald Trump now faces if he chooses to follow through on his promise to investigate Hillary Clinton. Here\u2019s a look at the dilemma Donald Trump now faces if he chooses to follow through on his promise to investigate Hillary Clinton. Del Quentin Wilber Contact Reporter \u201cLock her up!\u201d was his\u00a0supporters\u2019 fervent cry. \u00a0 But it\u2019s Donald Trump who\u00a0may\u00a0find\u00a0himself in political shackles,\u00a0stuck between his followers\u2019 yearning to put Hillary Clinton in jail and his expressed desire to unite a badly fractured country\u00a0after an election in which he lost the popular vote. The tension is not likely to dissipate anytime soon. After having pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate\u00a0Clinton,\u00a0Trump faces a dilemma: He can either drop the matter and risk angering his supporters, or charge ahead with a criminal\u00a0inquiry targeting his vanquished political foe, something never before done in U.S. history. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision,\u201d former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump advisor and a top choice to be the next attorney general, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the right answer to that is. It\u2019s a tough one that ought to be given a lot of thought. \u201d The answer, of course,\u00a0rests with Trump. The president-elect may have signaled his intentions\u00a0to forgo an investigation when he told supporters\u00a0Wednesday morning\u00a0during his victory address that the country owed Clinton \u201ca major debt of gratitude for her service.\" That\u00a0doesn\u2019t sound like\u00a0what you would say when you are about to seek a special prosecutor, according to legal experts and political consultants. Trump is surely cognizant, they said, of the immense political and legal hurdles of forging ahead.\u00a0 A prosecution of Clinton for mishandling classified material on a private email server while secretary of State\u00a0would certainly inflame Democrats and anger independent voters wishing for nothing more than to put the nightmare of the 2016 campaign behind them. It would also become campaign fodder in the 2018 midterm election\u00a0and\u00a0might distract from Trump\u2019s efforts to build\u00a0a wall on the border of Mexico and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Starting Tuesday night, as Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election started coming into focus, anguished questions flooded social media: Could Trump overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide? Could he abolish same-sex marriages? Could he increase... (David Lauter) \"Is there a backlash to him reopening this? There would be,\" said Reed Galen, a Republican strategist. \"This country is so highly divided along political lines. Are you really going to antagonize 160 million Americans for the purposes of making the other 160 million happy?\" \u201cIf I were advising him, and I am certainly not, I would tell him to take the [victory] speech he gave and allow the Clintons to fade into American political history,\u201d Galen said. Douglas Brinkley, a bestselling author and historian at Rice University, said appointing a special prosecutor\u00a0would be unprecedented and draw comparisons\u00a0to the well-known vindictive streak of President\u00a0Nixon. \u00a0 \u201cTrump has to be careful not to seem Nixonian and develop his enemies list and destroy opponents,\u201d \u00a0Brinkley said. \u201cI think he has his hands full with building a wall, and I\u2019m not sure playing to the \u2018lock her up\u2019 motif gets him anywhere. It would just be very bad, a terrible precedent to start trying to jail your political opponent after an election.\u201d (David G. Savage) The problem of dropping such a promise is that Trump issued his pledge to appoint a special prosecutor during a presidential debate viewed by tens of millions of people. In one back-and-forth, Clinton said she was glad that someone with\u00a0\u201cthe temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\u201d Trump shot back: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d In rallies later, he repeatedly said Clinton\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d actions were the worst political scandal since Watergate and that the Clinton Foundation was the \u201cmost corrupt\u00a0enterprise\u00a0in political\u00a0history.\u201d The idea of jailing Clinton has\u00a0long been enthusiastically embraced by his followers and their anger at Clinton was\u00a0a major motivator for many Trump voters. They have produced merchandise including T-shirts and\u00a0bobblehead dolls emblazoned with\u00a0\u201cHillary for Prison\u201d or Clinton wearing pinstripes or jail jumpsuits.\u00a0 Their desire to put Clinton in handcuffs\u00a0has not dissipated\u00a0with Trump\u2019s ascension to the presidency, and they would surely be disappointed if he backed off his promise. Such a course risks Trump being seen by his supporters as suddenly part of the same \u201crigged\u201d political system that he long said was protecting Clinton.\u00a0 \"She should be prosecuted,\u201d Shawn Gibby, 50, a maintenance manager\u00a0in Bessemer City, N.C., said this week.\u00a0\u201cI want justice to be served. We should be a nation of law and order.\" Said Stephanie Bevens, 46, also of North Carolina: \"Hillary should be held accountable \u2014 just like anyone else. I'd like to see her investigated, and I think her punishment should be the same as it would be for anyone else. She's been treated as if she's above the law. She's not above the rest of us.\" Some of his top advisors have also advocated charging Clinton.\u00a0During his interview with\u00a0CNN, Giuliani\u00a0expressed an eagerness to lead the Justice Department , saying that as a former associate attorney general and U.S. attorney in New York, \u201cthere's probably nobody that knows\u201d the place better than he does. Giuliani has long said he favors prosecuting Clinton.\u00a0\u201cI would have brought such a case,\u201d he told ABC News in August.\u00a0\u201cI would have won such a case.\u201d\u00a0 On CNN on Thursday, he hesitated when asked whether\u00a0he would accept the attorney general\u2019s job if Trump also demanded he drop\u00a0the re-investigation of\u00a0Clinton as a condition of the appointment. \u201cWe would have to talk about that,\u201d said Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney and\u00a0No.\u00a03 at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration. \u201cWe would have to talk about ...\u00a0what the ramifications of that to other prosecutions, future prosecutions, how would you couch that?\u00a0Suppose more evidence came forward a year from now that we don't know about now\u00a0that makes it a much worse situation?\u201d There has been some speculation that President Obama could pardon Clinton, even without her being convicted of any crimes.\u00a0Giuliani told CNN that he hoped Obama -- and presumably Trump -- didn\u2019t issue one.\u00a0\u201cI don't think that would be right because if he pardons her, he's got to pardon about five other people who helped her,\u201d Giuliani said. Legal experts said reopening the case \u2014\u00a0barring the discovery of new and explosive evidence \u2014\u00a0would either end without charges or be savaged\u00a0in the courtroom. For one, they said, career prosecutors and agents have already determined that no charges were warranted. FBI Director James. B. Comey, who previously served in a Republican administration, has said the thorough investigation uncovered no evidence that Clinton or her aides intended to violate espionage laws.\u00a0In the end, the FBI said, agents uncovered classified information in 193\u00a0emails\u00a0that were part of 81\u00a0email chains. On Oct. 28, Comey sparked a political wildfire when he sent a letter to Congress saying agents were reviewing new emails potentially relevant to the case. On\u00a0Sunday, two days before the election, he sent a second letter reiterating his earlier\u00a0position that no charges were warranted after his agents reviewed the new emails discovered on a laptop belonging to former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin , a Clinton confidant. If Trump\u2019s political appointees at the Justice Department were to reach a different conclusion upon reviewing the evidence or ordering a new investigation, they might\u00a0appear vindictive or perhaps unethical. To make matters more difficult, any future prosecution\u00a0would\u00a0be marred by the earlier determination that no charges were warranted, legal experts said. \"It would be a tremendous waste of time and resources,\" said Steven Levin, a former federal prosecutor and registered Republican. \"It would be a disastrous prosecution.\" Friction could develop between\u00a0career prosecutors and their political bosses if they saw the evidence differently, and such embarrassing disagreements could become public. \"You are free to disagree with what Comey did, but to pick up the same evidence and just reach a totally different result would make us look like a banana republic,\" said a former top Justice Department official in Republican administrations, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject. \"They would need career prosecutors and agents, however. If they just tapped a bunch of political appointees to do the case, the Justice Department building would just explode.\" Special correspondent Jenny Jarvie in North Carolina contributed to this report.

    "text": "Trump supporters vow never to use Grubhub after CEO memo goes viral Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Food delivery service Grubhub is leaving a bad taste in Donald Trump supporters' mouths.\u00a0 The company is already feeling the financial repercussions of an internal email CEO Matt Maloney sent to employees Wednesday, with company shares falling 5 percent in the last 24 hours. In the Apple iTunes store, the app now has new one-star reviews knocking Maloney's comments. \"I just heard about your CEO's leaked memo regarding President-Elect Trump. While his opinion is his prerogative, to assert that his employees should resign if they supported Trump is mean and manipulative,\" posted one user in a review titled \"I'll never use GrubHub [sic] again.\" In the email, first obtained by FoxNews.com, Maloney suggested that supporters of President-elect Donald Trump should resign, and the company would not tolerate \u201chateful attitudes\u201d in the workplace. FARM TO ROBOT TO TABLE: INSIDE THE FOOD INDUSTRY'S HIGH-TECH FUTURE On Thursday, Grubhub tweeted a response to the email\u00a0 with a link to a follow-up statement from Maloney indicating that his original comments had been misconstrued. \u00a0 \u201cI want to clarify that I did not ask for anyone to resign if they voted for Trump. I would never make such a demand. To the contrary, the message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees.\u201d But many Grubhub users are furious with Maloney\u2019s original statement against Trump and say they\u2019re willing to for go the convenience of the delivery service--for good. Dozens have taken to social media using the hashtag #boycottgrubhub and have vowed never to use the platform again. . @M3aloney @FoxNews No need to backtrack, no Trump supporter will ever give a dime to your disgraceful company ever again #boycottgrubhub \u2014 Trump 45 (@PoliticalTropes) November 10, 2016 No more @Grubhub for tens of millions of people. Take your censorship and closed minds far from here. #FreeSpeech #MAGA #BoycottGrubHub https://t.co/V7cqFRF6FM \u2014 Deplorable J (@pullheadfromass) November 10, 2016 Congrats, GrubHub.

Tage Larsen (@etagelarsen) November 11, 2016 Many are calling for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to step in. Grubhub CEO deserves a nice sitdown and fine from the EEOC. Will never use them again. #boycottgrubhub \u2014 David Scavo (@CaptainScavo) November 11, 2016 Good #EEOC case to threaten employees for not agreeing with his personal view. Employees should sue him. #Boycottgrubhub https://t.co/25H8PgyA5v \u2014 Kimbrough (@KimKimbrough) November 11, 2016 But will Maloney's e-mail, and follow up comments, do irreparable harm to the brand? Rick Crandall, Professor and Chair of Management, Marketing & International Business at the University of North Carolina, Pembroke says he believes the CEO's comment won't hurt Grubhub and believes the e-mails message of inclusion for all will resonate with both employees and consumers in the long run.\u00a0 \"It is really not an anti-Trump statement, but a pro-diversity statement. CEOs make key statements like this when they are trying to promote a certain organizational culture, sometimes called corporate culture,\" Crandall tells FoxNews.com.\u00a0 \"In context, he [Maloney] is supporting the corporate culture that already\u00a0exists at Grubhub. The election just happens to be a handy prop. His statement about offering a resignation is to be taken with a grain of salt.\"\u00a0 Plus, Maloney isn't the only CEO in the startup world bringing politics into the office after Tuesday's election. On Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to employees urging unity following Trump's victory. And Marco Zappacosta, the CEO of the odd jobs and services site Thumbtack, sent a note to employees reassuring them that the company would continue to be \u201cinclusive.\u201d \u201cPolitical scientists will study this election for a long time to come,\u201d said Zappacosta, \u201cbut there is no doubt that yesterday\u2019s outcome highlighted that there are many people across the political spectrum who feel like the hopes and dreams they hold most dear are slipping out of reach.\u201d BEN & JERRY\u2019S DECLARE SUPPORT FOR BLACK LIVES MATTER, CALLS FOR ICE CREAM BOYCOTT ENSUE Ben & Jerry's took a slightly different tack, penning an open letter to the President-elect , asking for an end to Trump's divisive rhetoric and calling on the businessman to listen to all voices during his upcoming term. \"During your campaign, you gave voice to\u00a0many Americans who feel left out and marginalized, and today we challenge you to hear the voices of all Americans\u2014regardless of race or gender or religion or sexual orientation or economic status\u2014who are fighting for a country built on justice and equity. These are things we all want. And so, we hope these are the things you also want,\" said the ice cream company. On Thursday, Maloney told Fox News that he was not \"embarrassed\" by the note and many employees had thanked him for the e-mail.\u00a0 Chicago-based Grubhub Inc , which owns online ordering platforms Grubhub and Seamless, says it serves an average of 267,500 users daily across 1,100 U.S. cities.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence reacts after speaking at a public rally on Nov. 10, 2016, in Indianapolis. (Darron Cummings / AP) Noah Bierman , Michael A. Memoli and Christi Parsons Contact Reporters President-elect Donald Trump named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence , the vice president-elect, to head their transition team, abruptly replacing\u00a0New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday\u00a0amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is\u00a0off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual step of naming his three\u00a0oldest children and his son-in-law to top posts, moves certain to create potential conflicts of interest\u00a0given that his attorney said Trump would\u00a0put his children in charge of his assets while he is president. The transition team is always crucial, but especially so for the first president elected without experience in either government or the military. In addition to recruiting thousands of people to staff the White House, Cabinet agencies, embassies and other key government posts, the transition team needs to make sure Trump is briefed and prepared to take responsibility for the government and for\u00a0implementing his policy initiatives as soon as he is inaugurated in just 76\u00a0days. \u201cYou need to have your team on the field when the clock starts,\" said Max Stier, who heads the\u00a0Partnership for Public Service, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on good-government practices.\u00a0\"This is not simply about achieving the policy promises;\u00a0it\u2019s also about keeping us safe. Transitions are the point of maximum vulnerability for our nation.\" The effort is almost always well underway before a new president is elected, given the complexity and critical nature of the job, even as candidates know the work will be in vain if they are not chosen by the voters. Legislation passed in 2010, and updated in 2015, formalized much of the process for the transition from George W. Bush to Obama after the 2008 election, considered one of the smoothest in history.\u00a0Both Trump and Hillary Clinton formed transition teams months ago that began working with the White House on first steps toward a potential handoff.

    "text": "AP November 11, 2016, 2:52 PM Iran nuclear deal endangered if Donald Trump seeks to renegotiate its terms Iranian President Hassan Rouhani takes part in a news conference near the United Nations General Assembly in the Manhattan borough of New York Sept. 22, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson Email WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to rip up the Iran nuclear deal on day one as president, but his vows to renegotiate the terms and increase enforcement could imperil an agreement that has put off the threat of Tehran developing atomic weapons. Emboldened Republican lawmakers are already considering ways to test Iran\u2019s resolve to live up to the deal. Now that Donald Trump is the president-elect, he's going to do one big interview. Where? Where else but 60 Minutes. Tune in this Sunday, Nov. 13 ... As a candidate, Trump issued a variety of statements about last year\u2019s pact. He called it \u201cstupid,\u201d a \u201clopsided disgrace\u201d and the \u201cworst deal ever negotiated,\u201d railing against its time-limited restrictions on Iran\u2019s enrichment of uranium and other nuclear activity, and exaggerating the scale of U.S. concessions. Trump said that he doesn\u2019t want to simply tear up the agreement. Instead, he spoke of reopening the diplomacy and declared that unlike President Obama\u2019s diplomats, he would have been prepared to walk away from talks. Trump\u2019s exact plans are vague, however, and a renegotiation would be difficult. Iran has little incentive to open talks over a deal it is satisfied with. And none of the other countries in the seven-nation accord has expressed interest in picking apart an understanding that took more than a decade of stop-and-go diplomacy and almost two full years of negotiation to complete. CBS News' Major Garrett joins CBSN with details on President-elect Donald Trump's latest challenge: choosing Cabinet members and other officials ... As Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said: If the U.S. tears up the agreement, \u201cwe will light it on fire.\u201d President Hassan Rouhani said this week no country could simply change what was agreed, pointing to a U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the package. The deal, which went into effect in January, forced Iran to pull back from the brink of nuclear weapons capacity in exchange for an end to many of the U.S. and European sanctions that devastated Iran\u2019s economy. It has been largely respected despite undiminished U.S.-Iranian tensions throughout the Middle East, including their support for rival sides in Syria and Yemen\u2019s civil wars. Each side has leverage: Iran doesn\u2019t want a new onslaught of U.S.-led economic pressure and America would be alarmed by any Iranian escalation of its nuclear program. But the accord rests on fragile ground, with powerful constituencies in Washington and Tehran vehemently opposed and looking for any excuse to break it apart. In such a climate, it\u2019s unclear what Trump\u2019s demands for a renegotiation might mean. Sir Richard Branson's trans-Atlantic hot air balloon crossing in 1987 was just one of his death-defying adventures. The British businessman's rec... \u201cThe agreement is valid only as long as all parties uphold it,\u201d State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged Wednesday in the agency\u2019s first briefing since Trump\u2019s stunning election victory over Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president. Last summer, Walid Phares, a Trump adviser on the Middle East, said Trump wouldn\u2019t pull out of an agreement with America\u2019s \u201cinstitutional signature,\u201d but rather revise elements through one-on-one negotiations with Iran or with a larger grouping of allies. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the pro-deal Arms Control Association, said that re-litigating the deal would unsettle American allies, with no clear picture of what Trump would be trying to accomplish. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has already taken steps to ensure a smooth transition at the Department of Defense for President-elect Donald Trump'... Trump could also send the deal to Congress, whose Republican majority has opposed it. GOP lawmakers are examining a slew of possible actions. Among the likeliest pieces of legislation is one targeting sectors of Iran\u2019s economy supporting ballistic missile work, including those specifically exempted from sanctions under the nuclear deal. Another goes after Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard for its military activity in Syria and support of terrorism. Iran could use either as an excuse to push past the limits of the nuclear deal, which may partly explain Republican motivations. Donald Trump's election victory means Defense Secretary Ash Carter's tenure as Pentagon chief is likely nearing an end. Only on \"CBS This Morning... Trump has largely avoided talk of killing the agreement, but has said he would police the deal \u201cso tough they don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d The U.N. nuclear agency has confirmed minor Iranian violations, specifically on its stockpiling of heavy water that can be used in plutonium production. It has faced no punishment. Iran also has repeatedly breached a ballistic missile ban that was extended for eight years under the nuclear deal, prompting some limited sanctions from Washington. The Obama administration has been hamstrung. Determined to protect the president\u2019s foreign policy legacy, it has gone above and beyond the agreement\u2019s stipulation that no new nuclear-related sanctions be introduced. When Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Shiite rebels fired missiles at U.S. Navy vessels, the retaliatory action didn\u2019t extend to Tehran. Nor has Iran faced repercussions for joining Syria and Russia\u2019s offensive in Aleppo, which has drawn U.S. charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. And whenever top Iranian officials have complained about the speed and scope of their post-deal economic recovery, top Obama officials like Secretary of State John Kerry have served as pitchmen to international banks and companies hesitant about investing in Iran. \u201cIt is a whole new reality,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, an Iran sanctions proponent at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. What does he expect from Trump? \u201cNo more free lunches for the Iranians, no more unilateral concessions, no more excuses.\u201d \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Pence replaces Christie in Trump transition team shuffle Published               November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Vice President-elect Mike Pence is taking over White House transition efforts from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2013 one of a host of changes announced Friday by President-elect Donald Trump as he works quickly to form his administration-in-waiting. Pence will now serve as chairman of the transition team. Christie, the scandal-scarred governor who has supported Trump ever since dropping his own 2016 presidential bid, will remain on board \u2013 only in a lesser role, as one of several transition vice chairs. \u201cTogether this outstanding group of advisors, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, will build on the initial work done under the leadership of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThe mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington.\u201d The decision marks Trump\u2019s biggest personnel move since being elected president. Speculation is widespread over whom he will consider for the highest-profile Cabinet and White House positions in his administration, but the first order of business was sorting out the team leading those discussions. Predictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map \u2192 Trump expressed gratitude for the New Jersey governor's support in his election night acceptance speech. But in recent weeks, Christie\u2019s reputation has taken more hits from the scandal involving staffers who shut down several lanes of the George Washington Bridge in September 2013 to punish a political rival. Two more aides were found guilty of involvement in a trial where Christie's own knowledge of the closures repeatedly was called into question.\u00a0 Christie has maintained his innocence and said the outcome of the trial confirmed his past statements that those aides were responsible. It\u2019s unclear where the controversy goes from here, but Christie is set to continue serving as Trump transition vice chair along with Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Jeff Sessions. The news comes as Trump himself was in New York for discussions on his future administration team.\u00a0 Trump also announced Friday that several other big names would join the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee, including: his finance chairman Steven Mnuchin; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus; campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon; and children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump. Some of those figures are also seen as potential prospects for key administration posts.\u00a0 Sessions\u2019 chief of staff Rick Dearborn will be executive director of the transition team.\u00a0 Fox News' Dan Gallo contributed to this report.

By David Weigel November 10 at 8:09 PM Follow daveweigel KENOSHA, Wis. \u2014 The day after the election, Bob Oldani parked himself at the Common Grounds coffee shop and talked to whoever came by. At 71, he had just cast his first Republican vote for president. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife,\u201d he joked, as he told anyone within earshot why he\u2019d backed Donald Trump. \u201cWe need a change in everything, and I hope he can do it,\u201d said Oldani, who\u2019d retired after years as a machinist. \u201cThis guy\u2019s a billionaire, so I\u2019m thinking he can say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just get the job done. I don\u2019t need your money.\u2019\u00a0\u201d The rebuttals started flying. What about the leaked tax forms that showed Trump\u2019s writing off nearly a billion dollars? \u201cMore power to him. He ain\u2019t in jail, right?\u201d What about the Access Hollywood tape? These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump \u201cAs far as these rumors with the girls, and all of that \u2014 if you do your job, who cares?\u201d A few miles away, outside a Culver\u2019s near Kenosha\u2019s sprawling and anonymous business park, Joe Schmaling and Oscar Corona were taking a break from their landscaping business. Schmaling, 32, said that work had been steady \u2014 \u201cmaybe because Obama\u2019s on the way out\u201d \u2014 and that Trump, in the words of his campaign, would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. \u201cIf we put up with Obama, we can put up with four years of this guy,\u201d said Schmaling. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see him blow the place up. He stands on his own, so he can throw the middle finger up.\u201d Corona, 30, was born in Mexico but lives in the United States with a green card. They\u2019d just been joking about whether Trump would kick him out of the country, fully confident that he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cHe\u2019s not rash,\u201d Schmaling said. In interviews on Wednesday, again and again, voters in Kenosha said that they had gotten behind Donald Trump. Often, they had not cast a vote for a Republican presidential nominee before. More often, they said that the past eight years had gone well for them \u2014 although, tellingly, the city had been better in the times they dimly remembered. Trump, the first Republican to win the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin since the 1980s, did so by narrow margins. Michigan has not been called but with all the results in Trump has 2,279,210 votes to Clinton\u2019s 2,267,373, according to Associated Press figures. Rural voters broke decisively his way. Trump\u2019s last-minute campaign swing through Eau Claire, a western Wisconsin city that shares a largely rural media market with parts of Minnesota, confounded Democrats who saw him losing in polls. It made more sense when massive Trump margins in rural Wisconsin gave him the state. How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea Kenosha, south of Milwaukee and north of the Chicago suburbs where Hillary Clinton was raised, was telling of the threat that sneaked up on Democrats. The industrial economy had been replaced by tourism, but the county was growing. No one would have picked it for a travelogue of trade-racked America. And it had voted for Democrats. It voted for Barack Obama, twice. It voted against George W. Bush, twice, and for Bill Clinton, twice. It helped Michael Dukakis carry the state in 1988 and, four years earlier, gave Walter Mondale a five-percentage-point victory over Ronald Reagan. No Democrat had lost since 1972. Hillary Clinton lost it; in retrospect, the trend was obvious. In her 2008 loss to Barack Obama, Clinton lost Kenosha County by just three points, as she lost by 18 points statewide. In the 2016 Democratic primaries, Clinton lost the county to Sen. Bernie Sanders by 15 points \u2014 despite a closer result across the state. She carried heavily black Milwaukee County, and Sanders carried everything else. \u201cWhite working-class people are deserting the Democratic Party in droves,\u201d Sanders said in an interview Thursday. The 2016 election was Wisconsin\u2019s first since the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which undid part of the Voting Rights Act; the first since Gov. Scott Walker (R) signed voter ID legislation; the first since Walker pushed through right-to-work legislation. Each domino, Democrats warned, was falling on their party by design. An estimated 300,000 people lacked voter IDs on Election Day, and private-sector unions had shrunk and consolidated since 2015. \u201cWe had to go to our membership and ask specifically, \u2018Are you able to donate ten cents per hour?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Randy Bryce, a local organizer and one-time Democratic candidate for state Senate, describing how a series of laws had weakened the labor movement. \u201cWith the economy now, that\u2019s impossible to do. So any money we had [at] the start of the process was all we\u2019d have for the rest of our existence.\u201d Yet on Wednesday, sitting around a table in their downtown Kenosha headquarters, local leaders of the Democratic Party said the voter-ID issue had not stuck. Approaching the election, it seemed that they were mobilizing the party\u2019s loyal voters. \u201cIt was just that \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 turned out to be genius,\u201d said Karen Kempinen, 67, a retired teacher. \u201cThat resonated. They didn\u2019t need to think any further than those words.\u201d In 2012, 21\u00a0percent of Wisconsin voters told exit pollsters that they or a family member belonged to a union. They broke for Barack Obama by 33\u00a0percentage points. This year, just as many voters said they were in union households \u2014 and Clinton won them by just 10\u00a0points. The numbers and the swoon were similar in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Early on, Clinton\u2019s campaign had waved off the idea of a backlash. After her victory in Ohio\u2019s primary, campaign pollster Joel Benenson, an Obama veteran, wrote confidently that white working-class voters had paid attention to her real trade record. \u201cDemocrats in states hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs are looking for more than anger and accusations, and stopping abuse by foreign countries,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for real plans and a broad economic agenda.\u201d But to the bafflement of Democrats here, the late Clinton push into the state \u2014 a series of ads that began in late October \u2014 did not mirror the economic messaging of the local labor unions. One played back Trump\u2019s worst remarks about women; another, his mocking of a reporter with a physical disability; the last, a warning from a nuclear technician who worried that a reckless President Trump would start a war. In 2012, when Democrats fought for Wisconsin all cycle, there had been clear economic messaging. One Obama ad dramatized Mitt Romney\u2019s plan to \u201cgive millionaires another tax break\u201d with a photo of him walking past Donald Trump\u2019s plane. Romney lost Kenosha despite tapping Paul D. Ryan, who represented the district in Congress, as his running mate. But in midterm years, and in the historic 2012 recall that took place before the general election, Kenosha voted for Walker, the governor. Walker\u2019s popularity had slipped since then, but his style had stuck with people. After work on Wednesday, a retiree named Larry Ancona, 61, bitterly pointed out the rows of homes that stood where there used to be an American Motors plant powering the city\u2019s economy. \u201cI know people that get $800 a month in food stamps, lied to get that, lied to get the medical benefits. And here we are \u2014 we\u2019re paying for it,\u201d he said. Angelo Tenuta, 51, politely argued with his friend.

    "text": "Tribal Leader Calls on Obama to Halt Pipeline Construction Before Trump Takes Office By Catherine Thorbecke Nov 11, 2016, 3:13 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Timeline of Events Surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline 0 Shares Email The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe has called on President Obama to \"set a lasting and true legacy\" by halting construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. The tribe is more concerned than ever about the future of its water and lands as public records show Trump has invested up to $1 million in Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access, the builder of the controversial pipeline. The exact figures of how much Trump has invested in Energy Transfer remains unclear, as he has refused to release his tax returns. Why a Previously Proposed Route for the Dakota Access Pipeline Was Rejected Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement that results of the presidential election \"indicate that we as a country have so much work to do,\" and urged Obama to \"set a lasting and true legacy\" by halting the pipeline's construction. \"We must strengthen our resolve to protect the water, pray together for understanding, and pour our hearts and minds into the future of our children,\" Archambault said. \"In this time of uncertainty, President Obama still has the power to give our children hope. We believe halting the Dakota Access pipeline presents a unique opportunity for President Obama to set a lasting and true legacy and respect the sovereignty and treaty rights of Standing Rock and tribal nations across America.\u201d Stephanie Keith/REUTERS Police use pepper spray against protestors standing in the water of a river during a protest against the building of a pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation near Cannonball, North Dakota, Nov. 2, 2016. The 1,172-mile crude oil pipeline has courted controversy for months from Native American groups and environmental activists. Hundreds of protesters have camped out near the tribe's reservation in North Dakota, arguing that construction of the pipeline threatens the local water supply and traverses culturally sacred sites. Tensions between local law enforcement and demonstrators have become more tense in recent weeks after heavily armed police unleashed rubber bullets and pepper spray in confrontations with protesters on private land. At a hearing yesterday, a Department of Justice spokesperson said the agency will announce its decision on \"next steps\" and a \"path forward\" for the final easement needed in order to complete construction of the pipeline, \u201cwithin\u00a0a\u00a0matter\u00a0of\u00a0days.\u201d Archambault said in a statement: \"The only possible path forward for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a decision that denies the easement or subjects it too a full environmental impact statement and tribal consultation.\" Three federal agencies, the Department of Justice, Department of Interior, and Deptartment of the Army, requested \"that the pipeline company voluntarily pause all construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe,\" while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reviews permits. Dakota Access has so far disregarded the government's request to temporarily halt construction, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. In an effort to defuse tensions between law enforcement and demonstrators, \"We asked Dakota Access Pipeline on Nov. 4 to honor the Administration's request for a voluntary shut down by stopping work for a 30 day period to allow for deescalation. Dakota Access did not agree to this request,\" John W. Henderson of the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers Omaha District said in a statement on Wednesday. Today, Dakota Access said in a statement that it would suspend construction near Lake Oahe \"for a reasonable time period as part of an effort to diffuse tensions and to facilitate peaceful removal of protesters from the protest site\" but the Corps has repeatedly rejected that offer. \"In our view, the authority to complete construction is part and parcel of a river crossing permit which was issued by the Corps on July 25,\" the statement added. \"We now wish to reiterate that Dakota Access shares the safety concerns of the Corps and is prepared to suspend activities at the site if Dakota Access and the Corps can agree upon a date certain upon which we can complete construction beneath the Missouri River at Lake Oahe.\" Law enforcement said they made 33 arrests today as tensions continue to mount in North Dakota near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a statement this afternoon that the 33 people were arrested for \"creating illegal roadblocks and trespassing on private property.\" Demonstrators have said its their right to be on the privately held land, citing an 1851 Treaty that they say designates the land for Native American tribes.

    "text": "MoneyWatch Nov 11, 2016 3:00 PM EST The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been described as everything from a federal agency \u201crun amok\u201d to an \u201cimportant tool\u201d for protecting consumers. Such disparate views reflects the bureau\u2019s increasingly prominent role since it was created six years under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Where both critics and advocates of the CFPB agree is this: The election of Donald Trump puts a target on the agency.\u00a0 The brainchild of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, in recent years the CFPB has established rules for the mortgage industry, payday loans and for-profit colleges, among others. It has cracked down on banks, debt collectors and a range of dodgy financial firms, from bogus \u201ccredit repair\u201d firms to predatory student loan servicers. Most visibly, the agency in September fined Wells Fargo ( WFC ) $100 million for opening fake accounts in customers\u2019 names . The CFPB also has formed a clearinghouse for consumer complaints and returned millions of dollars in payments to consumers harmed by financial institutions.\u00a0 What's behind the post-election surge in financial markets? Such actions, along with Dodd-Frank as a whole, aren\u2019t helping average Americans, according to Team Trump. Reads a statement on the president-elect\u2019s transition website:\u00a0 \u201cThe Dodd-Frank economy does not work for working people. Bureaucratic red tape and Washington mandates are not the answer. The Financial Services Policy Implementation team will be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.\u201d Republicans and other opponents of the CFPB have sought to curb its power from the day it formally opened its doors in July 2011, with one goal being to revamp how the agency is structured. The CFPP draws its funding from the Federal Reserve system and is led by a single director -- currently Democrat Richard Cordray -- who oversees its rule-making and enforcement actions. Republicans have introduced legislation, such as House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling\u2019s Choice Act, that would place Congress in charge of funding the agency and restructure it as a bipartisan commission, like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Hensarling is in the running to serve as U.S. Treasury Secretary in the incoming Trump administration.\u00a0 With a Republican president and Republican-controlled Congress, such legislation could be approved. Defenders of the CFPB fear that would erode the agency\u2019s financial independence and, by ensuring that some Republicans are always on the commission that sets its agenda, expose it to more pressure by financial industry lobbyists.\u00a0 The CFPB also faces other challenges that predate Trump\u2019s victory at the polls. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled last month that the agency\u2019s structure is unconstitutional, raising questions about its future. The Obama administration is expected to appeal the ruling .\u00a0 Elizabeth Warren trashes Trump on Wall Street reform Notably, Trump ran on a platform of overhauling the lobbying industry, although it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll carry through on that promise. The real estate developer is adding lobbyists and corporate consultants to his transition team despite his vows to weaken their power, according to The New York Times.\u00a0 As a watchdog, the CFPB could end up toothless, one Wall Street firm told its clients.\u00a0 \u201cWe expect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to survive, but it will get turned into a commission, subjected to the congressional appropriations process and could lose its ability to police \u2018abusive\u2019 behavior,\u201d analyst Jaret Steinberg of Cowen & Co. wrote in a research note.\u00a0 Although the CFPB is in the crosshairs, moving to effectively neutralize the agency could also backfire for the Trump regime. About nine of 10 Americans say regulating financial products is important to make sure they\u2019re fair to consumers, according to a 2016 survey from the Center for Responsible Lending and Americans for Financial Reform.\u00a0 \u201cVoters of all persuasions are dead set against turning over the keys of the government to Wall Street cronies and their ideological allies,\u201d said Brian Marshall, policy counsel for Americans for Financial Reform, a progressive nonprofit that focuses on regulation. \u201cPeople understand the difference between the banks having the power and the consumers having the power.\u201d\u00a0 Still, many consumers aren\u2019t aware of the CFPB or its purpose, although the 2016 survey found that seven of 10 voters supported the agency once they learned about its mission. Even though Republicans were less likely to support it, six of 10 still said they agreed with its purpose. \u00a0 Trump and a conservative Congress may need to navigate between their plan to weaken financial regulation and arouse the ire of consumers. Many Americans still say they haven\u2019t recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, which depleted retirement savings and housing wealth, and left them feeling less than charitable about financial institutions. This June, only 27 percent of Americans said they have confidence in banks, down from 49 percent a decade ago, according to Gallup.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the CFPB is considering new regulations for arbitration clauses, which are today used by most financial institutions to block consumers from their day in court, including banning mandatory arbitration clauses. As highlighted by CBS MoneyWatch this month, arbitration is billed by financial institutions as quick and easy, but consumers can end up saddled with large legal bills \u00a0and fewer rights.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Video provided by AFP Newslook Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski resigned from his role as a political commentator on CNN Friday, effectively immediately, after being seen arriving at Trump Tower earlier in the day. Despite being fired from the Trump campaign in June, Lewandowski has stayed in close contact with his former co-workers and there has been a lot of speculation about a Lewandowski role in the Trump White House.\u00a0\u200b Pence to take over Trump transition team CNN's decision to hire Lewandowski three days after he left the Trump campaign was highly controversial and the move was condemned by several media critics. USA TODAY's Rem Reider felt Lewandoski's hire was one of the worst examples of \"the revolving door between politics and the media\" because unlike many talking heads, the combative Lewandoski had minimal political experience. Rieder: CNN's horrendous Lewandowski hire \"His background is largely as a Trump guy,\" Reider wrote. \"And not so much as a strategist \u2014 Trump is his own strategist \u2014 or deep thinker, but as a right-hand man, a body man and an enforcer.\" \"I think it's really important to have voices on CNN who are supportive of the Republican nominee,\" CNN President Jeff\u00a0Zucker said, defending his decision to hire Lewandowski to Variety. \"It's hard to find a lot of those. Our competitors tried to hire him too.\" Lewandowski drew national media attention in March when he was charged with simple assault after reporter Michelle Fields accused him of forcefully grabbing her during a Florida Trump rally. Authorities declined to prosecute Lewandowski, citing a lack of evidence. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fkAW6b Most Popular ",

(Photo: Darron Cummings, AP) INDIANAPOLIS -- Election-related taunts of Hispanic students in Mike Pence\u2019s hometown of Columbus have prompted school administrators to call for civility and respect. Those taunts have included chants of \"Build that wall\" that made some students uncomfortable. \u201cThe results of the recent Presidential election have inspired a myriad of reactions and behaviors within our local community and local schools,\u201d Jim Roberts, superintendent of Bartholomew Consolidated Schools, said in a memo Friday to staff and other stakeholders. He said \"some of these reactions have included remarks and behaviors that are particularly hurtful to many members of our student body and compromise our efforts to provide a welcoming and diverse learning culture of respect, fairness and trust for all.\" Roberts did not identify any specific incidents in his letter and district officials declined to comment beyond the memo. But one parent, Felipe Martinez, said his two sons, who are Hispanic, were intimidated\u00a0by other students on two occasions with chants of \u201cbuild that wall!\u201d One incident occurred on Election Day. \u201cMy stomach is in a knot,\u201d Martinez, a pastor at First Presbyterian Church in Columbus, wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cThe intimidation and hatred is escalating.\u201d Post by felipe.n.martinez . Chants of \u201cbuild that wall!\u201d were frequent at campaign rallies for President-elect Donald Trump. He has promised to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States and deport millions of immigrants who are here illegally. IndyStar reached out to Pence through a campaign spokesman, but did not immediately receive a response. The governor returned to Indiana Thursday for the first time since being elected vice president and is scheduled to visit Camp Atterbury, about 15 miles from Columbus, later today. In an interview with IndyStar, Martinez said he addressed the incidents with school administrators and has been happy with the response. \u201cI believe that we have normalized or given societal permission to express some opinions in a way that is more about discrimination and hate then it is about immigration policies,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that these expressions of hate are not new and in some way the current political environment has pulled the curtain\u2026as to make them visible. There are individuals who have felt emboldened to express hate.\u201d Pence to take over Trump transition team In his memo, Roberts said school administrators and staff members are communicating expectations, providing counsel to those in need, and delivering corrective measures as warranted. \u201cOur school system will not tolerate actions that demonstrate a lack of understanding and respect for our differences,\u201d he said. The district is asking students and families to report any concerns to teachers or school administrators so they can be immediately addressed. \u201cIn addition, we request the contributions of all stakeholders in the community in order to most effectively address the raw feelings that currently exist,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of our political leanings, it is imperative that we address each other in a civil manner, openly communicate, and actively demonstrate respect and appreciation.\u201d Posted!

By Robert Costa , Philip Rucker and Elise Viebeck November 11 at 4:04 PM Follow @costareports Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @eliseviebeck Vice president-elect Mike Pence. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Vice President-elect Mike Pence will replace New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition effort, a change that will cement the Indiana governor\u2019s influence over the incoming administration\u2019s policy and personnel. Trump, in a broad transition shake-up announced Friday, also gave his son-in-law and three eldest children official roles as transition advisers. The involvement of Trump\u2019s adult children raises the specter of conflicts of interest, since they are poised to manage Trump\u2019s business over the next four years. The changes within the transition effort will substantially dilute the influence of Christie and his closest aides, add a conservative edge to the upper level of Trump\u2019s team and formally empower Trump\u2019s family in decisions about their father\u2019s administration. Rick Dearborn, the chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a Trump loyalist and hard-line voice on immigration, will now serve as the transition\u2019s executive director, replacing ex-Christie chief of staff Richard Bagger. The three Trump children \u2014 Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump \u2014 and Jared Kushner, husband to Ivanka Trump, will serve on the transition\u2019s executive committee. The move comes after two former aides to Christie, whose administration has been hobbled by scandal, were convicted for their roles in politically motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Christie, however, remains involved in the transition and was named a vice chair on Friday along with Sessions, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Republican presidential primary contender Ben Carson \u2014 all considered likely members of a Trump administration. [ Trump loyalists, inner circle poised to claim top government roles ] \u201cTogether this outstanding group of advisors, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, will build on the initial work done under the leadership of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThe mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTogether, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation \u2014 specifically jobs, security and opportunity.\u201d During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drain the swamp\" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) The changes come as the transition effort races to organize personnel and policy for the administration that will begin Jan. 20. Three days after Trump\u2019s surprise win over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and one day after Trump met with leaders in Washington, campaign insiders spent Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to discuss the next steps. The group included Christie, who met privately Thursday with campaign chairman and Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon for several hours, according to two people familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss Friday\u2019s shake-up. A senior Republican briefed on the Trump transition team\u2019s deliberations said Trump confidants, including Kushner and banker Steven Mnuchin, his campaign\u2019s national finance co-chairman and a possible Cabinet appointee, felt the transition team was too loyal to Christie and wanted to assert Trump\u2019s influence on the operation. The Republican spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks have been confidential. \u201cThe Trump high command felt like the president-elect needed to get control of his transition,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt was populated with Christie loyalists, not that they weren\u2019t for Trump, and it didn\u2019t appear to be as ramped up as it should have been. So taking a page from George W. Bush\u2019s book, he decided to put his vice president in charge.\u201d Pence and Christie also met privately on Thursday for about 90 minutes, according to one Republican briefed on the meeting. Christie\u2019s sidelining comes as he is increasingly consumed by the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which George Washington Bridge traffic lanes were closed as political retribution against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. Christie has claimed he did not know about the scheme at the time, but multiple witnesses in the corruption trial against his former aides said he did know. The Democratic majority leader of the New Jersey Senate called Thursday for impeachment proceedings against Christie, who is seen as unable to focus full-time on transition work. Other people familiar with Friday\u2019s developments played down the reduction in Christie\u2019s power but acknowledged that he had been layered in the inner circle. They described Sessions and Dearborn as low-key presences at Trump Tower in recent days and the \u201cnatural\u201d successors to Christie because of their loyalty to the candidate and populist instincts. Neither clashed with Christie, the people said. The appointment of Dearborn is intended to install someone well known to Congress to serve as a bridge between Trump Tower and Capitol Hill, helping recruit talent and processing incoming requests and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from lawmakers. Pence is also bringing on three of his senior advisers \u2014 Nick Ayers, Josh Pitcock and Marc Short \u2014 to assist him on transition work. Other prominent Trump allies, including Mnuchin, Bannon, billionaire investor Peter Thiel and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, will serve on the 16-person executive committee alongside Trump\u2019s children and son-in-law. Ethics experts and Trump opponents raised questions about the younger Trumps\u2019 participation in the transition given the Trump Organization\u2019s announcement Friday that it is working to \u201cimmediately transfer\u201d company leadership to them. \u201cThe notion that Trump would put his company into a blind trust run by his children was already a total farce. Now, it\u2019s even more alarming that his children will be involved in the government while managing his dangerous conflicts of interest with our adversaries,\u201d said Jessica Mackler, the president of the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century. Other members of the executive committee are Reps. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Marino (R-Pa.) and Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi; conservative donor Rebekah Mercer and New York investor Anthony Scaramucci. The transition staff will include figures familiar from Trump\u2019s campaign: Kellyanne Conway as senior adviser, Don McGahn as general counsel, David Bossie as deputy executive director, Stephen Miller as national policy director, Jason Miller as communications director and Hope Hicks as national press secretary. Dan Scavino will continue to run the social-media operation. RNC Chief of Staff Katie Walsh will serve as another senior adviser. Prominent Christie allies Bagger and Bill Palatucci, who formerly served as the transition\u2019s general counsel, will return to the private sector. Trump\u2019s announcement stated they would remain \u201cadvisers\u201d to the transition. \u201cThe signal is they\u2019ve lost confidence in Christie and that Mike Pence will have a very outsized role,\u201d Republican consultant Rick Tyler said of the changes. \u201cEverything that is happening reflects the new dynamics and how Trump is going to be as president, focusing on the big picture and leaving details to others.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got people coming in who are going to help him with his agenda,\u201d added Tyler, a longtime adviser to Gingrich. \u201cThis is going to be a team that\u2019s ready to work with Paul Ryan and Congress.\u201d Giuliani was among the insiders who spent part of the day at Trump Tower. \u201cI can see already how he is going to be a great president,\u201d he told reporters in the lobby. Sean Sullivan contributed. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told reporters on Friday that his advice to President-elect Donald Trump is \"out of great loyalty\" and has \"no expectation\" about his role in Trump's administration.

Trump's Potential Cabinet Fills Out With Washington Insiders by Alexandra Jaffe and Katy Tur Share VP-Elect Pence Takes Over Trump Presidential Transition Team 2:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161112013539if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/807068739586\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Donald Trump on Friday announced Vice President-elect Mike Pence would take over transition planning from Chris Christie, a move that sources say reflect a diminished role for the New Jersey governor. Sources tell NBC News that the controversy surrounding two former Christie aides being convicted in the closure of George Washington Bridge lanes was an issue, but more significant was Christie's failure to vocally defend Trump at key moments throughout the campaign. Pence, meanwhile, increasingly earned Trump's trust and respect by becoming one of his more vocal defenders on the campaign trail. Christie will remain a vice-chair, along with a number of other key campaign advisers, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, among others. \"The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,\" Trump said in a statement. Pence, as well as Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chief Steve Bannon will be leading the charge to whittle down names for cabinet positions. The transition executive committee will include three of his children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump. But despite Donald Trump's campaign pledge to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington and his outsider campaign, many of the prospects are clear Washington insiders. Sources tell NBC News that Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is being considered for Secretary of Homeland Security; former Michigan Rep.

A CNN spokesman later confirmed the resignation to NBC News. The hiring of Lewandowski raised eyebrows among some watchers, who accused Lewandowski of disrespect for a free press while running the Trump campaign. Corey Lewandowski, former campaign manager for President-elect Donald Trump, arrives at Trump Tower, Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, in New York. Evan Vucci / AP Lewandowski was fired from his role with the campaign in June after being accused of assaulting then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Fields said that as she tried to ask Trump a question, Lewandowski grabbed her arm and yanked her, leaving bruises and nearly causing her to fall. CNN President Jeff Zucker has defended hiring Lewandowski, telling Variety in August : \"I think it's really important to have voices on CNN who are supportive of the Republican nominee,\" and noting that other networks were looking at hiring him as well. Lewandowski's resignation comes days after Trump defied polls and won the presidential election. Lewandowski did not return a call seeking comment. Lewandowski was seen in the lobby of Trump Tower Friday, where the Trump transition team has been meeting . Phil Helsel ",

Egypt Floats Its Currency, Paving Way For An International Bailout The IMF said the program \"will help restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive grown.\" According to The Associated Press, Egypt is set to \"receive a first installment of $2.75 billion immediately.\" This comes after the government implemented several painful measures that have inspired praise from the IMF but frustrated many Egyptians, who have already navigated years of economic turbulence.

Many of the veterans are in their twilight years, with ages in the late 80s and the 90s. The teenager, Rishi Sharma, has started a nonprofit organization, Heroes of the Second World War , to record video interviews with them for posterity. Of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, about 620,000 are still alive, and 372 die each day, according to the National World War II Museum . The teenager, who graduated last year from Agoura High School outside Los Angeles, wrote on a crowdfunding page that there is \u201cno commercial aspect\u201d to the project. He said he\u2019s putting off many of the typical priorities of 19-year-olds, like going to college, finding a job or dating, so that he can focus on the project.

Across the country, Americans \u2014 including President Obama, who laid a wreath in Arlington Cemetery in Washington \u2014 led tributes to past and present military members.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis) shows President-elect Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump the Speaker's Balcony at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday. (Zach Gibson/Getty Images) David Lauter Contact Reporter When all the ballots are counted \u2014\u00a0 some 4.3 million remained in California as of Thursday night, according to the state\u2019s secretary of state \u2014\u00a0 Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by well over a million votes, en route to losing the electoral college and the White House. The result put a spotlight on the country\u2019s deep,\u00a0almost 50/50 division. Democrats , many still in shock over a result that most people in either party did not expect, have been agonizing over how this happened. They don\u2019t need to look far from home for a big part of the answer. How Republicans lost Orange County for the first time since 1936 Open link In the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump \u2019s victory Tuesday night, a lot of attention, justifiably, centered on his ability to boost turnout in conservative, rural counties, especially in the upper Midwest. The Wall St. Journal presciently had focused on that region about a week before the election . Census data showed that during the past 15 years, counties in the region surrounding where Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois meet had shown \u201camong the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S.\u201d \u2014\u00a0largely Latino immigrants starting to move into formerly all-white areas, they found. Those same counties had shown great support for Trump in the GOP primaries. On election night, that area was where Trump made many of his biggest gains, accounting for his victories in Wisconsin and Iowa and the unexpectedly close result in Minnesota.\u00a0 The data analysis that Trump\u2019s campaign did, an effort that was more extensive and sophisticated\u00a0than many Democrats believed , showed the same thing. In the closing days of the campaign, the Republicans targeted the areas they needed most. But there was no Trump surge overall. While he made big gains in those Midwestern\u00a0counties and in other heavily white areas such as eastern Ohio, northeastern Pennsylvania\u00a0and parts of central Florida, he lost ground elsewhere. How America feels about Trump's victory \u00bb Clinton actually succeeded in one of her campaign\u2019s key goals \u2014\u00a0eating into traditional Republican territory in big suburban counties. In Montgomery County, Pa., for example, the largest of the suburban counties\u00a0that ring Philadelphia, Clinton ran about 30,000 votes ahead of the pace that President Obama set four years ago. Among other big suburban locales she won was Fort\u00a0Bend County outside of Houston, a once-deeply Republican area that was represented in Congress by former Rep. Tom DeLay , the Republican majority leader of the House a decade ago. Clinton also won Orange County, which since 1936 had never voted for a Democrat \u2014\u00a0the longest streak of one-party victories in California. Those suburban losses largely offset Trump\u2019s gains in more blue-collar\u00a0white counties. As a result, once the final votes are in, he will end up with pretty much the same total that Mitt Romney received four years ago \u2014\u00a0likely slightly fewer. Clinton lost\u00a0not because of a Trump surge, but because she will end up with several million fewer votes than President Obama got in 2012. Some of the Democratic drop-off came in those heavily white\u00a0blue-collar counties that Trump carried. In Lackawanna County, Pa., for example, the county that includes Scranton, where Vice President Joe Biden grew up, Clinton fell some 23,000 votes short of Obama\u2019s mark. Because she lost Pennsylvania by just\u00a0over 68,000 votes out of almost 5.8 million cast,\u00a0that deficit mattered greatly. But Clinton also got about 37,000 fewer votes in Philadelphia than Obama achieved. Similarly, Clinton lags more than 78,000 votes behind Obama\u2019s 2012 pace in Michigan\u2019s Wayne County, home to Detroit, with some ballots still to be counted. As of Friday morning, Michigan remained too close to call, with Trump narrowly in the lead. Democratic strategists had always expected that turnout among African American voters would fall once Obama was no longer on the ballot. They hoped to make up the difference by attracting\u00a0suburban voters turned off by Trump\u2019s often bombastic style. They almost made it \u2014\u00a0a switch of only 40,000 among Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, out of more than 13 million cast in those three states, would have delivered the election to Clinton. But the combination of white, working-class defections in places like Scranton, lower African-American voting and an overall drop in turnout of several million people sank their plans. In the aftermath, Clinton aides have blamed their loss on a highly negative campaign that turned off voters, on FBI Director James Comey, whose last-minute intervention in the race may have blunted their appeal to wavering voters, and on the apparent Russian-backed leaking campaign by WikiLeaks, which served as a constant distraction. But campaigns always encounter turbulence. In the final accounting, Clinton simply failed to inspire enough of her supporters to turn out. Like John Kerry and Al Gore, she fell short.

Now Facebook is getting it too, as a modern media company that does not vet fake news from its News Feed and that, critics argue, allows users to stay in information bubbles that reinforce existing prejudices. Zuckerberg took both these criticisms head-on yesterday, at a conference called Techonomy . (You can find the full interview on his Facebook feed .) Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016? He says hoaxes existed before his platform was created. They aren't new, and people who say misinformation is why Donald Trump won simply do not get it. \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news,\" Zuckerberg says. He also says his company has studied fake news and found it's a \"very small volume\" of the content on Facebook. He did not specify if that content is more or less viral or impactful than other information. Weeks back Facebook algorithms accidentally promoted to \"trending news\" a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pledging her support for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Article continues after sponsorship In Wake Of Shootings, Facebook Struggles To Define Hate Speech Zuckerberg also said his team has studied the filter bubble effect and the research shows that almost everyone has some friend on the other side of the aisle. A Democrat may think there's no Republican in his News Feed, but there likely is. The social network's ability to connect people makes it \"inherently more diverse\" than the major news stations of 20 years back, Zuckerberg says. He says right now the problem is not that diverse information isn't there. It's there more than it was in the days of traditional media. The problem, he says, is that people don't click on things that don't conform to their worldview. And, he says, \"I don't know what to do about that.\" Facebook is not a free speech platform. It has a long list of rules, called Community Standards , of things you're not allowed to say or share. Naked pictures of children are a well-known example. With 'Napalm Girl,' Facebook Humans (Not Algorithms) Struggle To Be Editor During this election cycle, Zuckerberg personally intervened to change the rules. When Trump called for a ban on all Muslims, it was clearly hate speech, as defined by Facebook guidelines. But the CEO ordered his staff to not take it down because it was newsworthy. That example is just one illustration of the extraordinary power Zuckerberg has amassed to decide what news is. And from his talk, it's clear that he's thinking about how to wield this power. \"When we started, the north star for us was: We're building a safe community,\" Zuckerberg says. He thought about how to control for bullies. One of the things that has shifted, he says, is that now news is a more important part of Facebook content. \"We're still working through what that means.\" ",

People with pre-existing conditions will still be covered in the version of health care that Trump wants to see replace Obamacare , he said in a wide-ranging interview with CBS News\u2019 Lesley Stahl on \u201c 60 Minutes .\u201d Production shots from Trump's interview with 60 Minu... \u201cIt happens to be one of the strongest assets,\u201d Trump said about insuring people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cIt adds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re gonna try and keep.\u201d And, he told Stahl, that there will be no lapse between the repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health-care law and its replacement by his version. The\u2019re won\u2019t be \u201ca two day period\u201d or \u201ca two year period where there\u2019s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. I mean, you\u2019ll know. And it\u2019ll be great health care for much less money,\u201d he promised. Trump on Obamacare \u201cEither Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Friday. Mr. Trump favors keeping in place protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, along with a measure that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance policies until the age of 26, the Journal said, and it also reported that during their meeting Thursday, Mr. Obama asked the president-elect to reconsider repealing it.\u00a0 In fact, Mr. Trump told the Journal that a big reason for his shift from his call for a full repeal was his meeting with Mr. Obama, who, he said, suggested areas of Obamacare to keep intact. \u201cI told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said. 17 Photos The Trump kids The measures on pre-existing conditions and keeping children on their parents\u2019 policies are popular even among the most partisan Republican legislators who have called for a full repeal of the law, and they have been included in proposals that would replace the ACA with a GOP-backed alternative. House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d healthcare plan, for example, would also prevent insurance companies form denying coverage to those with existing conditions and would keep the parental provision. Trump on speaking with the Clintons Trump himself has said before in a Republican primary debate that he would want to keep some measures Obamacare instituted. \u201cI would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. I want to keep pre-existing conditions. It\u2019s a modern age, and I think we have to have it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in February at the CNN-Telemundo debate in Texas. \u201cI would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. I want to keep pre- existing conditions. It\u2019s a modern age, and I think we have to have it.\u201d But Trump\u2019s recent answer in the Journal is a softening even from the plan his campaign team recently put on his website for his first 100 days in office , which explicitly calls for a piece of legislation called the \u201cRepeal and Replace Obamacare Act.\u201d The legislation, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, \u201cfully repeals Obamacare and replaces it.\u201d\u00a0 In the interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the president-elect also said talked about the call he received from Hillary Clinton when she conceded. 40 Photos Melania Trump \u201c[I]t was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u00a0\u201cI can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. I mean, for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn\u2019t have been nicer. She just said, \u2018Congratulations, Donald, well done.\u2019\u201d And former President Bill Clinton called Thurday, Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been more gracious,\u201d the president-elect said. \u201cHe said it was an amazing run.

It was the first time Planned Parenthood endorsed a candidate in a presidential primary in the organization\u2019s history. \"There are almost no words to capture the threat that this election result posts to our democracy, to our economic security, to access to reproductive health care and most especially to the safety and dignity of people of color,\" said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement on Wednesday after news of Trump's win. \"We will fight to make sure that Planned Parenthood health center doors stay open, and that people in this country can get access to basic reproductive health care, no matter their zip code, income, sexual orientation, race, religion, gender, or country of origin,\" Richards added.

    "text": "Top Democrats Line up Behind Progressive Keith Ellison for Party Chair By MaryAlice Parks Nov 11, 2016, 11:14 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Keith Ellison: The Basics 0 Shares Email New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , slated to take over soon as the Senate 's Democratic leader, is backing progressive Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison to be the new chair of the Democratic National Committee , according to Schumer\u2019s staff. Schumer and Ellison \u201cspoke yesterday,\" Schumer spokesperson Matt House told ABC News. \"Without a Democratic White House, Schumer\u2019s view is the DNC is where grassroots organizing in sync with legislative battles should be organized.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced yesterday that he too supports Ellison, who was one of only a handful of congressmen to back Sanders during his presidential primary bid. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in an interview Thursday that she thinks Ellison would be \u201cterrific\u201d for the job. Progressive grassroots organizations such as \u2018People for Bernie\u2019 and \u2018MoveOn\u2019 have been quick to lobby for Ellison too and are circulating petitions. If Ellison wins the post, which could be decided as early as next month, it would signal a significant shift by the party toward embracing a Sanders-style progressive agenda in the wake of a bruising election loss that has left Democrats with a massive identity crisis. In some ways, Clinton\u2019s loss emboldened the party's left-wing members, who argue that their candidates and message excited voters more than hers and that they are more prepared to take on a Trump presidency. Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, has not formally announced that he wants the job, but has said he will make an announcement of some kind on Monday. The congressman met with activists Thursday night about the election results and possible next steps. \u201cWe can present a very clear alternative to the American people as to what we could have if we organize and engage,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe have to use the First Amendment ... to oppose Trump and Trumpism at every turn.\u201d Donna Brazile has been the acting chair of the party's national committee since the Democratic National Convention in July, after Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in the wake of emails posted by Wikileaks . Ironically, any thought that Brazile may stay on was wiped away this month, before the election, when the most recent emails posted on Wikileaks appeared to show that she too may have helped the Clinton campaign when she was active with the party committee but before she was acting chair. Besides Ellison, other possible candidates for DNC chair include former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean who announced on Twitter that he was throwing his hat in the rang to take the job again. Dean held that post from 2005-2006, employing what he called a \u201c50-state\u201d strategy that attempted to put even traditionally red seats into contention, reaping tremendous success with Democrats taking control of the Congress that year. In addition, Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a former presidential contender, said he was \u201ctaking a hard look\u201d at the role too. According to the emails posted on Wikileaks this month, many of Clinton\u2019s top advisers seemed to like former Michigan Governor Jen Granholm for the job of DNC Chair. Other names floated include New Hampshire Party Chair Ray Buckley and South Carolina Party Chair Jamie Harrison. Even beyond the attention to who will chair the party committee, both Sanders and Warren have made a point of being visible in the press and to the pubic during this week when so many other Democrats have stayed out of the spotlight. Sanders said during an interview with CNN Thursday that he understands voters are angry about, what he calls, a decline of middle-class jobs. \u201cBut we have got to channel that anger against the people who caused the decline of the middle class and so many people living in poverty, not take it out on our neighbors, who may happen to be Muslim or Latino or women. That is demagoguery.\u201d Sanders\u2019 aides says he will not rule out another run for the White House in 2020, but they acknowledge that he would be 78 then and his health may be a variable. As for now, the Vermont senator is not planning to challenge New York Sen. Chuck Schumer for the position of Senate minority leader that becomes vacant with the retirement of Nevada Sen. Harry Reid at the end of the year. But Sanders' team confirmed that he is looking for ways to take on a leadership role during this turbulent time for Democrats and progressives. \u201cI think he can play a big role,\u201d Sanders\u2019 spokesperson Michael Briggs told ABC News. \u201cHe really connects somehow with people \u2026 they are looking for leadership.\u201d Warren gave a stern, passionate speech to AFL-CIO union folks Thursday, where she argued that Democrats' first job in the \u201cnew era\u201d is to stand up to Trump\u2019s \u201cbigotry.\u201d \u201cThere is no compromise here \u2026 Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever,\u201d she said.

A number of prominent Republican former security officials have made it clear through words or deeds they wouldn't consider joining the administration. For example, Michael Hayden, who was CIA director under George W. Bush, has accused Trump of being a dupe of Russia, given his advocacy of views espoused by Vladimir Putin. But others are said to be mulling a move to Team Trump, including Stephen Hadley, a former Bush national security adviser. Hadley told NBC News he is \"not participating in the transition at this point.\" Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee until he retired last year, is playing a key role in the transition after quietly backing Trump during the latter stages of the campaign. His senior aide and former House chief of staff, Andy Keiser, is also involved, a Trump advisor told NBC News. Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan is a top figure on the Trump transition team. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images, file Rep. Michael McCaul (R.-Texas), who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, is under consideration to be homeland security secretary, a campaign official and a source close to McCaul told NBC News. One list obtained by NBC News includes two dozen people of varying backgrounds to be vetted for security clearances, according to one U.S. military intelligence official and one Trump transition team member. Subjects to be discussed by various members of the group include the nation's nuclear war plans and the classified details of Russia's role in the election. That list includes four current or former Republican members of Congress \u2014 Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and former Congressman Robert Smith Walker of Pennsylvania. It includes two retired generals \u2014 former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Mike Flynn, who publicly campaigned for Trump, and Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, vice president of strategic initiatives at Cubic Corporation, a defense and transportation firm. Also on the list is former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, a blunt-talking, controversial figure. Two other polarizing names on the list are Clare Lopez a former CIA officer who has said the Muslim Brotherhood has \"infiltrated\" the Obama administration; and Walid Phares, is a Lebanese born Maronite Christian who speaks frequently about radical Islam. A Trump adviser said Lopez, who specialized in Russia during her CIA career, has been \"one of the intellectual thought leaders about why we have to fight back against radical Islam,\" and Phares has briefed Trump and is trusted by him. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) speaks during a news conference held by House Republicans on \"Protecting America's Veterans\" at the U.S. Capitol on May 29, 2014 . Win McNamee / Getty Images file \"This is a very eclectic group of folks,\" said Admiral James Stravidis, the former NATO commander. \"Collectively they're going to come at international affairs with a bias towards hard power\" \u2014 meaning military force \u2014 \"as opposed to soft power\" \u2014 meaning diplomacy and economic influence. A Trump national security aide said he could not confirm the list, but told NBC News that revamping policies toward Iran and Russia are at the top of Trump's security agenda. Pressuring Iran to stop enriching uranium and renegotiating the broader Iran deal is a top priority, he said, \"because it was such a horrible deal\u2026.Clearly he wants to renegotiate the deal.\" As for Russia, the adviser said Trump will seek to immediately establish \"better relationships with Russia across the board and not have so much hostility. We need to cooperate on countering radical Islam and combating all of these Sunni jihadist terrorist groups\" like Islamic State and al Qaeda. Asked if he was concerned that Trump would be manipulated by Putin, the advisor said, \"I don't think so. Trump is a good negotiator.\" For any new president, said Stavridis, national security \"has to be job one. \u2026 Instantly, on Jan. 20 he will be tested. He'll be tested by the Russians in the cyber world. He'll be tested by the Chinese in the South China Sea. He'll be tested by the Iranians in the Arabian Gulf. We will see test after test and they will come fast and furious in the new year.\" Ken Dilanian ",

USA TODAY NETWORK In this photo taken Nov. 10, 2016, President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House. Obamacare was one of the topics discussed. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) President-elect Trump backed down a bit from his vow to repeal Obamacare, suggesting in an interview Friday that he might retain the prohibition of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and the ability to keep children on parents' insurance until they are 26. In an interview with the Wall Street\u00a0Journal,\u00a0Trump\u00a0reportedly\u00a0said\u00a0he would move quickly to deal with\u00a0the Affordable Care Act (ACA), because patients \"can\u2019t use it\" due to its high costs. A total repeal of the\u00a0ACA would be as difficult as it is unlikely. Legislation\u00a0that passed both houses of Congress last year before it was vetoed by President Obama would have left more than 20 million people without insurance. It would have eliminated the subsidies to help them pay for it, the penalties if they don't buy it and the taxes to cover the costs. Trump election helps spur top Obamacare signups this month Health care economist John Goodman, who advises Republican members of Congress, says that\u2019s something neither party is likely to vote for without the assurance of a presidential veto. Neither party can afford the political backlash that would follow any move to take away 20 million people's health insurance Trump's apparent support for two of the most popular parts of the health law came as a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted that Ryan's \"A Better Way\" Obamacare replacement also would protect those with preexisting conditions and allow parents to keep children on parents'\u00a0plans until they are 26. Twitter | @brendanbuck Brendan Buck on Twitter That would be a major relief to Jackie Elledge of Oklahoma, who discovered she had stage 4 cancer earlier this year and then lost her job when her employer went out of business in February.

What they learned soon after, however, was that they would just be getting started on the trail of a suspected serial killer. \u201c 48 Hours \u201d goes inside the missing persons investigation and the stunning revelations her alleged captor, Todd Kohlhepp , 45, a real estate broker, made to police in \u201cBuried Truth\u201d to be broadcast Saturday, Nov. 12 at 10 p.m. ET/PT\u00a0 on CBS. Mother of alleged S.C. serial killer: \u201cTodd was not a monster\u201d It\u2019s a story that has made international headlines and continues to unfold as investigators search and find more victims of an alleged serial killer in South Carolina. Correspondents David Begnaud and Peter Van Sant interview investigators, family members, neighbors and friends of the victims. And they talk with experts and others about the mind of a serial killer. Close Anderson, S.C. Police Dept. An investigation led sheriff\u2019s deputies to Kohlhepp\u2019s property last Thursday looking for Kala Brown and her boyfriend, Charles David Carver. Brown had worked for Kohlhepp cleaning houses for his real estate business. Police say Brown, 30, was chained to the shipping container .\u00a0 Later, Kohlhepp shot Carver dead in front of Brown. Brown told the police she had been a hostage for two months on Kohlhepp\u2019s 95-acre farm just outside Spartanburg. Todd Kohlhepp Close Police immediately arrested Kohlhepp.\u00a0 While in custody, Kohlhepp asked for three things before starting to talk. And when Kohlhepp finally opened up he told police more than they ever expected. He revealed critical clues in the well-known cold case of four gruesome murders at a Chesnee, S.C. motorcycle shop in 2003. He also admitted to killing a young couple last December, later identified as Johnny Coxie and Meagan McCraw. \u00a0 Kohlhepp later led police to a location on his property where he had buried Carver, Coxie and McCraw. \u201c48 Hours\u201d explores in depth the lives horribly changed when their loved ones disappeared or were murdered, and who had to exist for years without knowing what happened. The team also examines the life of the self-confessed killer, who after a troubled childhood committed his first violent act when he was 15 years old. Police in Arizona say he sexually assaulted at gunpoint a 14-year-old girl. He was sentenced as an adult and served a 15-year sentence. On the outside, Kohlhepp displayed signs of success, including expensive cars and flying small planes. His life behind closed doors, however, appears to be quite different. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

He was doing it because he was mad and he was hurt,\u201d she added. \u201cGiven what your son has admitted, your son is the definition of what\u2019s known as a serial killer,\u201d Begnaud pointed out. \u201cI hate that,\u201d Tague said, choking up. \u201cI know that\u2019s what they say\u2026 he was a very misunderstood.\u201d But Sheriff\u2019s deputies say there\u2019s no misunderstanding. Kohlhepp is responsible for at least seven murders. His dark past came to light when 30-year-old Brown was found on Kohlhepp\u2019s property. She and her boyfriend Charlie Carver were missing for two months. \u201cShe was banging very hard on the container,\u201d Spartanburg Sheriff Chuck Wright said. \u201cShe was bound. There was a chain from the top of the cage to something else that went around her neck. She was distraught, panicked.\u201d Her boyfriend Charlie Carver was not as fortunate.\u00a0 \u201cShe said she witnessed him being shot,\u201d Wright said. After being taken into custody, Kohlhepp asked to speak to his mother. She said he told her everything and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cDid he cry?\u201d Begnaud said. \u201cMmmhmm,\u201d Tague said. \u201cHis eyes looked horrible. They were red.\u201d \u201cWhy did he kill her boyfriend?\u201d Begnaud asked. \u201cBecause he got nasty and got smart-mouthed,\u201d Tague said. \u201cWhy did he chain that girl up?\u201d Begnaud asked. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t know what to do at that point,\u201d Tague said. \u201cShe saw, evidently, him kill her boyfriend, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with her, he couldn\u2019t turn her loose. She\u2019d go get the police,\u201d Tague said. Last Saturday Kohlepp took Sheriff Wright to his property. He showed him where he had buried Carver and two drifters he murdered after allegedly hiring them to work on his property.\u00a0 \u201cHe was very polite and remorseful, actually. I said a prayer with him,\u201d Wright said. What would take everyone by surprise was when Kohlepp also admitted to gunning down four people in a notorious cold case that became known as the Superbike Murders. Kohlhepp had wanted to return a motorcycle. \u201cThey laughed at him, made jokes at him,\u201d Tague said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s hurt. He hurt everybody,\u201d Tague said of her son. ",

Sullivan added that Vaughn, who was most famous for starring in the series \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E,\" had been battling acute leukemia for one year. He was 83 years old. Vaughn was \u201ca real gentleman,\" Sullivan said. Vaughn, a native New Yorker who grew up in Minnesota, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1960 for his role in \"The Young Philadelphians.\" He also appeared in the classic film \"The Magnificent Seven.\" However, it was his starring role in \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" that made him famous.

Throughout his decades-long career, Vaughn also appeared in TV shows including \"The Protectors,\" \"The A-Team,\" and more recently, two British TV series, \"Hustle\" and \"Coronation Street.\" He was also a prolific movie actor, appearing in films ranging from the 1970 classic \"Julius Caesar\" to the 2001 comedy \"Pootie Tang.\" Vaughn is survived by Linda, his wife of more than four decades, and their two children, Cassidy and Caitlin. 0 Shares ",
