Currently, there is a working list of three to five names being considered for Cabinet positions, the sources say. But no one on the list has been contacted. \"I think all of that will be clarified very soon, then you won't have to take any of it with vague background quotes,\" another senior Pence aide said. \"There should be a lot of clarity very soon. But we're a day and a half into this.\" Ari Fleischer, former spokesman for President George W. Bush, tweeted that whoever gets the nod is in for an adventure. I wonder how many Trump staffers have never set foot in the WH, esp the Oval Office. They'll soon find how wonderful - and tough - it is. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) November 10, 2016 Not likely to be on the list are some of the people Trump trusts most \u2014 family members like daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has been a key campaign adviser. Trump is barred by federal law from appointing any relative to federal agency positions. That, however, doesn't preclude them from having a say over who will serve in the Cabinet. Trump's senior staffers are expected to meet with them later Thursday to go over a recruitment list, sources told NBC News. Pence will serve as the point person for Capitol Hill during the transition process and while serving as vice president, two of his aides said. \"I think you'll see Mike having a very active role as a liaison to Capitol Hill with both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan,\" one aide said. Pence served 12 years in Congress, including time in the GOP leadership, and on the executive committee of the Republican Governors Association. False. Could it be those \"sources\" want the WH job I've been offered? https://t.co/ZXJGUZm5Zz \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 10, 2016 Before traveling to Washington to meet with President Obama on Thursday, Trump spent Wednesday fielding phone calls from foreign leaders at his home in Trump Tower in New York City. Pence has also spent that day on the phone with foreign leaders, though sources have declined to list which heads of state the pair has spoken to. Kelly O'Donnell ",

The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time. And can you blame them? Journalists love mocking Trump supporters. We insult their appearances. We dismiss them as racists and sexists. We emote on Twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other, and yet we reject their feelings as invalid. It\u2019s a profound failure of empathy in the service of endless posturing. There\u2019s been some sympathy from the press, sure: the dispatches from \u201cheroin country\u201d that read like reports from colonial administrators checking in on the natives. But much of that starts from the assumption that Trump voters are backward, and that it\u2019s our duty to catalogue and ultimately reverse that backwardness. What can we do to get these people to stop worshiping their false god and accept our gospel? We diagnose them as racists in the way Dark Age clerics confused medical problems with demonic possession. Journalists, at our worst, see ourselves as a priestly caste. We believe we not only have access to the indisputable facts, but also a greater truth, a system of beliefs divined from an advanced understanding of justice. You\u2019d think that Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 the one we all discounted too far in advance \u2013 would lead to a certain newfound humility in the political press. But of course that\u2019s not how it works. To us, speaking broadly, our diagnosis was still basically correct. The demons were just stronger than we realized. This is all a \u201cwhitelash,\u201d you see. Trump voters are racist and sexist, so there must be more racists and sexists than we realized. Tuesday night\u2019s outcome was not a logic-driven rejection of a deeply flawed candidate named Clinton ; no, it was a primal scream against fairness, equality, and progress. Let the new tantrums commence! ",

Sherri Papini, 34, of Shasta County, was reported missing Nov. 2 around 6 p.m., after having gone jogging at approximately 2 p.m. According to reports, she was last seen jogging alone on Sunrise Drive in Redding. Her absence raised concerns when she did not pick up her two young children from child care that day. Her husband, Keith Papini, said he'd gotten a text from her at 10:37 a.m. Nov. 2, asking whether he was coming home for lunch. \"I usually don't bring my personal phone in on my job,\" he said, \"so I didn't respond to that message until 1:39 p.m. that day.\" He told ABC News in an interview Sunday that he'd used an app to trace her cellphone and had found it on the side of a road. On Wednesday, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office Major Crimes Unit said that Keith Papini had been given a polygraph test earlier in the week. Police said he'd asked investigators about taking the test so they offered it. The office said the results showed that \"he has no involvement with the disappearance of his wife.\" \"Keith Papini continues to be cooperative in the investigation and is not a person of interest in the disappearance of his wife,\" police said in a news release. \"Keith has talked with detectives on several occasions since he reported his wife missing. ... Sheriff's Office detectives have confirmed his whereabouts on the day in question and there is no physical evidence at this time suggesting he had any involvement.\" Northern California 'Super Mom' Vanished While Jogging Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said today that police had corroborated information that Keith Papini was at work at the time of her disappearance. Sherri Papini was last seen wearing a pink jogging top. Bosenko said today that the ground search had been suspended. \"There is no new information since the initial search on the night of the reported disappearance,\" he said. \"Into the next day, our search and rescue teams were there with K9s, and no new evidence turned up other than what we have with the cell phone, earbuds, and a few strands of hair.\" He said investigators were now examining surveillance footage from cameras and businesses as well as cell phone data. A $50,000 reward has been offered. Keith Papini maintained that his wife had been taken against her will. \"Knowing that she didn't pick up our kids -- there is no way that ever happens,\" he said. \"She could drop her phone, but she would never in a million years not pick up our children on a time that she normally would have.\" 0 Shares ",

Students in South Gate protest the election Donald Trump as president in front of City Hall. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Joy Resmovits , Sonali Kohli and Corina Knoll Contact Reporters Thousands of high school students flooded the streets of Los Angeles on Thursday after marching out of classrooms in protest of Donald Trump \u2019s victory in the U.S.\u00a0presidential election. School authorities estimated that about 4,000 students from 16 L.A. Unified high schools had left campus by the afternoon, many of them ending up at the University of Southern California or City Hall. \"It's been a while, I don't remember the last time we had something like this of this magnitude,\u201d said Armando Farias, the deputy chief of Los Angeles School Police. At least one patrol unit along with an administrator accompanied students from each campus to their destinations. No acts of violence or student arrests have been reported. \"It's been peaceful,\" Farias said. \"They're just walking and ending up wherever they end up.\" About 600 students at Hawkins High School in South Los Angeles headed for the doors about 10:15 a.m., said Jazmin Casas, a community representative for the school. Some school administrators and campus police officers joined them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration,\u201d Casas said. \u201cWe ended up opening the gate because we couldn\u2019t hold them back.\u201d Dozens of arrests were reported during a second day of protests in California on Thursday as people from the Bay Area to Los Angeles took to the streets forcefully denouncing President-elect Donald Trump. Demonstrations continued into the morning with students in San Francisco and downtown Los... (Joseph Serna, James Queally, Matt Hamilton) Afterward, the campus auditorium was deemed a \u201csafe space\u201d where remaining students could convene and discuss their thoughts on the election. At Santee Education Complex in downtown Los Angeles, buzz about a walkout began Wednesday as students made plans via text messages. About 500 ended up walking out the next day, according to Jose Lara, a dean at the school. Demonstrating during school hours was the most effective way to mobilize a large number of students, said\u00a0Erasmo Camacho, a 16-year-old junior at Santee. Camacho was among hundreds of students from various schools who made their way to the University of Southern California and gathered at the Tommy Trojan statue. L.A. Unified Supt. Michelle King said that schools across the district had been directed to talk to students about the results of an election that may have stoked fears and to identify those in need of support. \u201cWe teach our students that they have a right to freedom of speech,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cThey are also allowed to participate in peaceful demonstrations on campus during non-instructional times, within parameters set by administrators. They are not permitted to leave school.\u201d Students in South Gate protest the election Donald Trump as president in front of City Hall.

Among them was second-year student David Dorsey from Torrance. The 19-year-old said he considered not voting, but cast his ballot for Hillary\u00a0Clinton. \"I've been fasting since Monday, when I learned just how many friends I have who support Trump,\" he said. \"I'm praying that we won't be drawn apart.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States , Kamala Harris becomes the first black politician to represent California in the U.S. Senate , a heavily-armed man killed one and injured two others in Azusa, \u00a0and the L.A.

But Ross argues that the Electoral College has another benefit: thwarting majority rule. \"The Founders had no intention of creating a pure majority-rule democracy,\" Ross has said. \"In a pure democracy, bare majorities can easily tyrannize the rest of the country.\" It's not clear how letting the president sometimes be the candidate who got fewer votes protects political minorities. And that's not at all why the Founders created the Electoral College. Still, the idea did emerge out of a similar distrust of majoritarian democracy. Related: Trump's Critics Extend an Olive Branch as GOP Prepares to Govern The Founders didn't think ordinary people \u2014 even the white male property owners who were the only ones allowed to vote \u2014 were informed or responsible enough to choose the president. (Letting them do so, said Virginia's George Mason, would be like referring \"a trial of colors to a blind man.\") So they created a double buffer. State legislators would choose presidential electors, who would be \"most enlightened and respectable citizens,\" as John Jay put it. Then, these elites would come together at an Electoral College and use their superior wisdom and intellect to decide on a president. But electors soon began to run on party slates, pledging to rubber-stamp their party's nominee rather than use their own independent judgment. And almost all states soon let voters rather than lawmakers choose the electors. In this way, the system became something close to democratic. But because states don't award their electoral votes proportionately to the popular vote, it still left us with the problem that arose again Tuesday \u2014 that the candidate who gets fewer votes to be elected. In other words, the Electoral College has often fulfilled the Founders' goal of acting as a check on the popular will \u2014 but not at all in the way they intended. * Correction: This article originally identified Sanford Levinson as a professor at Harvard Law School.

Steven Senne/AP hide caption toggle caption Steven Senne/AP A health care provider interviews a patient at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston in 2013. Steven Senne/AP Amy Hagstrom Miller of Whole Women's Health had been having a banner year. Her organization, based in Charlottesville, Va., operates several abortion clinics around the country and brought a legal challenge that led the Supreme Court to issue a landmark ruling this past summer. The court struck down abortion restrictions in Texas, setting a precedent that abortion rights groups believe could help turn back a wave of restrictions passed by legislatures across the country in recent years. But now that Donald Trump is the president-elect? \"I'm devastated,\" Miller says. \"I feel stunned. I'm numb.\" Trump's election could have a profound impact on access to abortion. He has said he'll nominate Supreme Court justices who would be likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized the procedure. And he's set to take office with one opening on the court, since Republican senators have refused to consider President Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy created after Justice Antonin Scalia died earlier this year. Miller worries that Trump could have several vacancies to fill, all due to departures from the moderate to liberal wing of the court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83; Anthony Kennedy is 80; and Stephen Breyer is 78. Replacing them could put a conservative stamp on abortion law for decades to come. Article continues after sponsorship In a statement, Nancy Northup, president of the advocacy group Center for Reproductive Rights, said, \"Our country now stands perilously close to a return to the dark days when women were forced to put their own lives at risk to get safe and legal abortion care.\" Supreme Court Strikes Down Abortion Restrictions In Texas Still, even if the court becomes majority conservative, and even if the right case comes along to challenge Roe v. Wade \u2014 no sure thing \u2014 Julie Rikelman is one who does not think it will be overturned. Rikelman is litigation director with the Center for Reproductive Rights, and says precedent is incredibly important for the Supreme Court.  She says the justices addressed this in a major 1992 decision, noting that several generations of women had come of age being able decide whether abortion was right for them.  The ruling declared that \"the court's very institutional integrity would be in jeopardy if it reversed course now,\" Rikelman says. In the shorter term, Amy Hagstrom Miller says this year's high court ruling in her case will also continue to have a ripple effect. It says states must consider whether limitations on clinics that provide abortion offer any benefit to women's health. A string of court rulings have already cited the precedent in striking down various restrictions. \"We're poised to win back access for women in a state-by-state level in multiple states because of the strength of the decision we got,\" she says. \"And Trump doesn't get to change that.\" But with the GOP sweep of Congress and the White House, abortion opponents are emboldened. \"The Democrats overreached, and this was a rejection of an extreme agenda,\" says Clarke Forsythe, the acting president of Americans United for Life. Americans United for Life and other abortion opponents have a long wish list, including ending Obamacare's coverage of contraception; banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy; and passing a permanent ban on the use of federal funds to pay for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. That ban, called the Hyde Amendment, is a four-decade-old compromise between abortion rights groups and opponents, and it generally applies to abortions through Medicaid. Hillary Clinton had campaigned on overturning the ban. Forsythe and others say they'll also work with supporters in Congress to end $500 million in annual federal funding to Planned Parenthood. \"Essential gynecological care for poor women can be addressed by many more community health centers, and state and local government,\" he says. Reproductive health experts dispute that. After Texas ended funding for Planned Parenthood in 2013, research found that lower-income women had trouble accessing contraception, and that led to a substantial rise in births . Forsythe says with the sizeable Democratic bloc in the Senate, none of this will happen overnight. \"The road ahead is not going to be easy,\" he says, \"and I think we have to be realistic about what can be achieved.\" Still, he says the GOP election sweep presents abortion opponents with \"historic opportunities.\" Trump is an unlikely champion for abortion opponents, many of whom base their views on morality and religion. In the past, he's described himself as \"pro-choice in every respect,\" and during the campaign he made conflicting statements on the issue. But he will face pressure from a lobbying force that's newly energized by his election. \"There are a lot of folks who didn't agree with him on many things he said and some of who he is,\" says Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation of Virginia. \"But they were counting on these pro-life promises he has made.\" ",

Government weather forecasters said Thursday La Nina has arrived and may last through the winter.&nbsp;</p> Close AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File LOS ANGELES --\u00a0 La Ni\u00f1a has arrived and could hang around through winter, government weather forecasters said Thursday. La Nina, the flip side of El Ni\u00f1o , is the periodic cooling of the central Pacific Ocean that affects weather patterns around the globe. Predictions called for fleeting La Ni\u00f1a conditions that could last through February. It\u2019s \u201canticipated to be a weak, short-lived event,\u201d said Mike Halpert of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center. In the United States, the arrival of La Ni\u00f1a usually brings wetter winters to the northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley and warmer, drier conditions to southern parts. Lake Mead drying up There\u2019s a 55 percent chance La Ni\u00f1a will stick around through the winter , causing the drought to persist in Southern California and regions in the Southeast and southern Plains to experience dry conditions, NOAA said. After five years of withering drought that forced mandatory water conservation, parts of California have recovered thanks to October storms that doused the northern part of the state. Three-quarters of California remain in drought , mostly in the central agricultural belt and Southern California. The drought cost the state\u2019s economy $2.7 billion in 2015 alone, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis. NOAA planned to release a winter forecast update next week. Last month, the agency predicted a wet winter in the northern Rockies, Great Lakes region, Hawaii and western Alaska . Warmer and drier than normal conditions were predicted for the South while it was a tossup for the middle section of the country. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The upcoming Congress will be the most diverse in its history and the Senate will have the most women of color in its history -- 35 Democrats and three Republicans, according to EMILY's List , a PAC that supports Democratic pro-choice women candidates in all levels of government. There were several firsts in the four female Senate wins. Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina senator when she won in Nevada, taking over Harry Reid 's seat. I believe our diversity in our strength. As the first Latina Senator I will use my seat at the table to fight for diversity. \u2014 CatherineCortezMasto (@CatherineForNV) November 9, 2016 Kamala Harris , who is taking over Sen. Barbara Boxer 's seat in California, is Indian-American and African-American, making her the first Indian-American in the Senate and the second black Senator. Tammy Duckworth moved from the House of Representatives to the Senate, and she is now the first Thai-American in that chamber. The fourth woman elected to the Senate in the group is Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire, who defeated Republican Kelly Ayotte . Elaine Thompson/AP Photo State Sen. Pramila Jayapal won the race for Washington 7th Congressional district, in Seattle. There were several demographic firsts in the House of Representatives as well. Pramila Jayapal, who won in Washington state, immigrated to the U.S. after being born in India and raised in Indonesia and Singapore, and Stephanie Murphy, who won in Florida, is the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, making her the first Vietnamese-American in Congress. Thomas McKinless/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images Stephanie Murphy defeated John Mica in the race for Florida's 7th congressional district, Sept. 23, 2016. Nanette Barragan is the first Latina elected by her Congressional district in Los Angeles, and the group of incoming Congresswomen is rounded out by Colleen Hanabusa from Hawaii. Lisa Blunt Rochester became the first African-American to serve in Congress from Delaware and Val Demings became the first African-American in her congressional seat in Florida. Rachel Thomas, a national press secretary for EMILY's List, said that they view the Congressional and Senate victories as a way to change the face of power in Washington. \"I think that the election of these women shows how important it is -- and especially now -- to have diverse perspectives in Congress and in government that will help advocate for and build better policies that help all Americans of every background and every community,\" Thomas told ABC News. \"Their leadership will provide the checks and balances that are such an important part of our government,\" she said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Crumble Top Lattice Top To make a lattice top, you\u2019ll need to double your pie dough if it\u2019s not already a recipe for a double crust. Roll out the chilled dough and cut it into 1-inch thick strips. Place half the dough strips parallel to each other across the top of the filled pie. (Reserve some of the longer strips for when you weave the lattice.) The longest strip should be in the center of the pie. Flip up every other strip on the pie. Place another long strip perpendicular to the others across the center of the pie. Flip those strips back down, then flip up the other strips. Weave in a second strip of dough. Repeat process on one side, and then the other, until you have fully covered the pie with woven strips. Gently press lattice strip edges into the bottom crust, then crimp the edges to seal the top and bottom crusts together. Or, if you\u2019ve blind baked the bottom crust, simply tuck in the edges of the lattice so the strips don\u2019t hang over the side of the pan. Brush lattice all over with milk, cream or an egg wash (a mix of egg and water or milk) to encourage browning. You can sprinkle the top with sugar or cinnamon sugar if you like. Whole Top To cover the top of the whole pie, you\u2019ll need to double your pie dough if it\u2019s not already a recipe for a double crust. Roll out the chilled dough, then lay it out over the top of the filled pie. Crimp the edges to seal the top and bottom crusts together. Or, if you\u2019ve blind baked the bottom crust, simply tuck in the edges of the top crust so it doesn\u2019t hang over the side of the pan. Slash the top of the pie with a knife to allow steam to escape. Brush top crust all over with milk, cream or an egg wash (a mix of egg and water or milk) to encourage browning. You can sprinkle it with sugar or cinnamon sugar if you like. Cut-Out Top To make a top using dough cutouts, you\u2019ll need to double your pie dough if it\u2019s not already a recipe for a double crust. Roll out the chilled dough and use decorative cookie cutters (circles, leaves, etc.) to cut out shapes from the dough. If you haven\u2019t blind baked the crust, use a paring knife or scissors to trim any dough that is hanging over the edge of the pan. The dough should be flush with the edge of the pan. Arrange a ring of cutouts around the outer edge of the filled pie (the cutouts should be touching the crust, coming flush to the edge). Continue adding cutouts to fully cover the top of the pie. You can overlap the cutouts (or not) as you see fit. Brush cutouts all over with milk, cream or an egg wash (a mix of egg and water or milk) to encourage browning. You can sprinkle the cutouts with sugar or cinnamon sugar if you like. Crumble Top To make a simple crumble for a standard 9-inch pie, combine 3/4 cup (90 grams) all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup (100 grams) dark brown sugar, 1 teaspoon (5 grams) cinnamon, a large pinch of salt and 5 tablespoons (71 grams) softened butter in a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together, pinching the mixture until large crumbs form. The crumbs should be on the larger side, a bit bigger than a lima bean. Do not make small crumbs. Scatter crumbs over the top of the pie. It is nice, but not necessary, to mound more of the crumbs in the center of the pie and fade them out toward the edges so that some of the filling can show. Baking Tips Always bake a pie on a rimmed baking sheet to contain any overflow. A baking sheet also makes removing the pie from the oven easier. You can freeze a whole, unbaked fruit pie. Then bake it while still frozen, adding about 15 minutes onto the baking time. Do not thaw it first or you could lose flakiness in the crust. For the best-looking crimped crust, or to avoid having your crust shrink in the oven, freeze the unbaked pie dough before filling and baking (or blind baking). The colder your dough when you get it into the oven, the better it holds its shape. You can store your baked pie at room temperature, covered, for up to one day. After that, the crust will become irretrievably soggy. ",

Got it The Justice Department built up an aggressive civil rights division under President Obama, but under President-elect Donald Trump it probably would take a different approach toward police departments alleged to have overused force. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) By Matt Zapotosky , Wesley Lowery and Mark Berman November 10 at 12:26 PM Follow @mattzap Follow @WesleyLowery Follow @markberman The Justice Department is set to significantly shift its priorities under Donald Trump, reflecting the themes of a presidential candidate who consistently described the country as riven by chaos and in need of more powerful law enforcement. The department, which under President Obama built an aggressive civil rights division, is likely to take a more hands-off approach toward police departments alleged to have overused force and loosen restrictions on surveillance in Muslim communities, according to legal analysts and Trump\u2019s public statements. Trump sought to position himself as the candidate of law and order, delivering apocalyptic speeches describing a nation torn apart by crime and terror. He said police in Chicago could stop a spate of deadly violence by being \u201cvery much tougher than they are right now,\u201d and wrote to the International Association of Chiefs of Police that he would generally keep the federal government out of local law enforcement\u2019s business. He has been critical of Obama\u2019s effort to give clemency to inmates serving long prison terms for nonviolent drug offenses. In response to the terrorist attack in Orlando in June, Trump said he would renew surveillance on mosques . [ Donald Trump could actually take steps to try to jail Hillary Clinton ] Donald Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the U.S. in December. But since then, his commitment to a \"total and complete shutdown\" has wavered repeatedly. Here's how. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Those positions put him at odds with the current Justice Department. Under Obama, officials have tried to position Muslims as a partner in the fight against terrorism, and they have been supportive of broad changes to the criminal justice system, including more lenient sentences for nonviolent drug crimes. The department has also taken a tough stance toward policing issues \u2014 scrutinizing entire departments with comprehensive \u201cpattern or practice\u201d inquiries and investigating high-profile incidents of officers killing people. With the impending change, civil rights advocates said they are bracing for the worst. \u201cThis is a guy who will have no problem targeting civil rights leaders, targeting reporters. We\u2019re back to a Nixon enemies-list world,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get ready to fight. This is serious.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s policy positions and priorities often change when a Republican takes over from a Democrat, and vice versa, and in many ways, Trump\u2019s administration will be no different. Under President George W. Bush, for example, the civil rights division took significantly fewer enforcement actions on \u00adanti-discrimination and voting rights laws than it did under President Bill Clinton. After Obama took office, then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. moved to give it back its teeth , taking aim at policies that officials thought resulted in racially disparate outcomes, even if the intent of those policies was not explicitly or intentionally racist. \u201cThe civil rights division gets whipsawed more than any other part of the Department of Justice when the White House changes parties,\u201d said Bill Yeomans, who spent 26 years at the department, primarily in the civil rights division. \u201cThis promises to bring a dramatic shift in priorities and ideology.\u201d Legal analysts said the core mission of the Justice Department \u2014 enforcing the nation\u2019s federal laws \u2014 should remain the same. And they stressed that, because Trump has not yet indicated whom he will select as his attorney general, nor is he likely to follow traditional norms, it is hard to assess what his Justice Department might look like. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a transition like this,\u201d said Jamie Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general under Clinton. Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers and advocates, previously served as the third-highest-ranking official in the Justice Department. (Seth Wenig/Associated Press) Two of Trump\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 have federal legal experience. Both were U.S. attorneys, and Giuliani served as the Justice Department\u2019s third-highest-ranking official under President Ronald Reagan. Giuliani has staked his reputation on the drop in crime during his time as mayor. Officers under him employed controversial stop-and-frisk tactics that a federal court in 2013 ruled were unconstitutional. Both Giuliani and Trump have made the dubious claim that the tactics drove down crime. Christie, likewise, built his political career on his image as a tough-on-crime former prosecutor, talking extensively during his presidential primary campaign about his national security prosecutions. The governor, though, has been tainted by the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal, in which two of his former aides were convicted last week of conspiring to shut down the nation\u2019s busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to support Christie\u2019s reelection bid. After his inauguration, Trump will face an early test in what, if anything, he decides to do with the investigation of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Although FBI Director James B. Comey recommended no charges in that case, Trump has said that he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter and that, if he were president, Clinton would \u201cbe in jail.\u201d Trump could, in theory, order his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to reinvestigate the former secretary of state, although many conservatives argue that it would be ill-advised to do so. Analysts say Trump already will have to contend with the perception that the Justice Department is partisan. \u201cIf anything has become clear as a result of the Justice Department\u2019s recent involvement in political affairs, it\u2019s that the public needs to be reassured that it\u2019s substance, not politics, that drives Justice Department decision-making,\u201d said George Terwilliger, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Whomever Trump appoints will take over a department that has regularly waded into eruptions of anger that followed the deaths of black men and boys at the hands of police officers. In recent months, the Justice Department has opened investigations of fatal police shootings in Baton Rouge and Tulsa. The department also is investigating the Chicago police force, the country\u2019s second-biggest local department, after video footage emerged of an officer fatally shooting a teenager there. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation said that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d that the inquiry will wrap up before Trump is sworn in, and that once the new Justice Department leaders are in place, they could react to the investigation by deciding to take out some required reforms. The official said, though, that it was unlikely that new leadership would opt to override the results of the Chicago investigation or others that resulted in reform agreements already in place. Such inquiries are carried out by career officials rather than political appointees. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that they would come in and undo those\u201d existing agreements, the official said. \u201cBut would they initiate a new one in the future? They might be a little less likely to do those.\u201d Giuliani, speaking to the Cleveland Police Patrolman\u2019s Association in October, said that court-mandated police reform agreements show how the Justice \u00adDepartment has become \u201cpoliticized\u201d during the Obama administration. It is possible, were he to be appointed attorney general, that the department would simply stop suing police departments to bring about new agreements, or even enforce old ones, analysts said. \u201cThe consent decree agreements already in place \u2014 they could just choose not to enforce. They can let it all die by doing nothing,\u201d said Jonathan Smith, who for five years was the Justice Department\u2019s chief of special litigation, overseeing investigations of police departments. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who has been outspoken on the issue of race and policing, announced recently that the FBI will begin a project next year to start collecting nationwide use-of-force statistics in hopes of building a national database. Trump, in response to questions from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, seemed skeptical to the idea, writing that \u201cthe federal government should not be in the habit of demanding data from local or state law enforcement organizations.\u201d \u201cCrime reporting should take place, but the management of local and state law enforcement should be left to those jurisdictions,\u201d he wrote. Sharpton and others said they are strategizing how they will apply pressure to Trump and his advisers, with the hopes of influencing his selection of attorney general, the Cabinet post most vital to issues of civil rights. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought for years, for decades on these issues. It is all at risk,\u201d Sharpton said. The American Civil Liberties Union, after his election, vowed to challenge in court any of his policies that might run afoul of U.S. law. Many of Trump\u2019s changes, though, probably would draw support. The Fraternal Order of Police, which has more than 335,000 members and describes itself as the country\u2019s biggest police union, endorsed Trump in September. \u201cOur membership . . . is pretty energized by the results of the election,\u201d Jim Pasco, the union\u2019s executive director, said Wednesday. Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said that after Trump\u2019s comments about violent crime, immigration, drugs and terrorism, it remains to be seen whether his administration will provide more resources or try to expand its assistance to state and local jurisdictions in how they confront those issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a different administration, and they will have different priorities, and they will put their resources where they think is important,\u201d he said. \u201cHe definitely has expressed support for officers on the street. That did not go unnoticed. The question is: When you get into policy, how does that translate?\u201d Read more: ",

Credit EPFL News Monkeys with spinal cord damage that paralyzed one leg quickly regained the ability to walk with a wireless connection from the brain to the spinal cord below the injury, scientists reported Wednesday. The achievement is yet another advance in the rapidly moving field of technological treatments for spinal cord damage. In recent years, scientists have achieved brain control of robotic hands in monkeys and humans , helped a paralyzed man regain some use of a hand through a chip implanted in his brain, and used electrical stimulation of nerves to enable paralyzed rats to walk again . The new system is unusual because it concentrates on the lower body, and allows a monkey \u2014 and perhaps in the near future a human \u2014 to use a wireless system rather than be tethered to a computer. It utilizes new developments in brain recording and in nerve stimulation. It does require a computer to decode and translate brain signals and send them to the spinal cord, but computer technology makes a wearable device feasible. Photo Gr\u00e9goire Courtine holding a silicon model of a primate\u2019s brain and an implant. The brain-spine interface uses a microelectrode array like this one to detect spiking activity of the brain\u2019s motor cortex. Credit Alain Herzog/Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne Gr\u00e9goire Courtine, a specialist in spinal cord repair at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, said he hoped the system he and his colleagues developed could be transferred \u201cin the next 10 years\u201d to humans for therapy that would aid in rehabilitation and \u201cimprove recovery and quality of life.\u201d But, he emphasized, the goal is better rehabilitation, not a science fiction fix for paralysis. \u201cPeople are not going to walk in the streets with a brain-spine interface,\u201d in the foreseeable future, he said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Andrew Jackson, at Newcastle University, who has worked on upper body paralysis and was not involved in the study, said the research was \u201canother key milestone\u201d in research on treating paralysis. Dr. Jackson wrote a commentary on the research in the journal Nature , which published the report of Dr. Courtine , Marco Capogrosso, Tomislav Milekovic, both at the Swiss institute, and an international team of scientists. Among the reasons that the system is not a miracle fix for paralysis is that it relays only impulses to extend and bend the leg at the right time to fit into a four-legged gait, not other, more subtle movements involving change in direction or navigating obstacles. Humans present different challenges, as well, for instance, in terms of balance in two-legged, rather than four-legged walking. The research was conducted with collaborators in China , Dr. Courtine said, because Swiss restrictions on animal experiments at the time would not allow the work. Now that the work is proving successful, he has permission to proceed with similar experiments in Switzerland, he said.

The woman, Margot Gerster, posted about the encounter on Facebook Thursday afternoon, saying she took her daughters for a walk because she has been \u201cso heartbroken\u201d about the results of the presidential election. Clinton conceded the race at an event in New York City Wednesday morning. Clinton's emotional concession speech \u201cAs we were leaving, I heard a bit of rustling coming towards me and as I stepped into the clearing there she was, Hillary Clinton and Bill with their dogs doing exactly the same thing as I was,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI got to hug her and talk to her and tell her that one of my most proudest moments as a mother was taking Phoebe with me to vote for her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe hugged me and thanked me and we exchanged some sweet pleasantries and then I let them continue their walk.\u201d \u201cNow, I\u2019m not one for signs but I think ill [sic] definitely take this one,\u201d she continued, tweeting #iamstillwithher, a reference to the popular pro-Clinton hashtag #ImWithHer. \u201cSo proud.\u201d The Clintons own a home in Chappaqua, which is about 40 miles north of New York City.

Stephen Maturen /AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stephen Maturen /AFP/Getty Images Ilhan Omar, a Democratic candidate for state representative in Minnesota, gives an acceptance speech on election night, November 8, in Minneapolis. Stephen Maturen /AFP/Getty Images She's a former refugee, a Muslim, a mom of three and now, the first Somali-American lawmaker in the United States. \"This really was a victory for that 8-year-old in that refugee camp,\" Ilhan Omar, 34, said. \"This was a victory for the young woman being forced into child marriage. This was a victory for every person that's been told they have limits on their dreams.\" Omar is the youngest of seven children. She and her family fled from the Somali civil war and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. When she came to the United States in 1995, she spoke only Somali. As her English improved, she began translating for her grandfather at political events in the Twin Cities. Today, the Minneapolis organizer is well-versed in business administration and politics. \"I think I bring the voice of young people,\" Omar said. \"I think I bring the voice of women in the East African community. I bring the voice of Muslims. I bring the voice of young mothers looking for opportunities.\" Article continues after sponsorship She won House District 60B in southeast Minneapolis with 80 percent of the vote. It wasn't a surprise that Omar would win a Minnesota House seat in the reliably Democratic district: In the primary contest earlier, she beat a 22-term incumbent, and her Republican challenger suspended his campaign for family reasons. Allegations were raised during the campaign that she had illegally married her brother to commit immigration fraud; she denied the charge. On Tuesday, as Ilhan Omar walked into a room filled with supporters, she was crushed with hugs and kisses from anyone who could touch her. For nearly 20 minutes, photographers tried desperately to capture Omar as she moved around the room in her white headscarf. When the music stopped and speakers gathered on stage, Omar sat down in the front row, beaming, next to her husband, Ahmed Hirsi. One of her children sat on her lap, and her two other kids stood by her. \"Minneapolis said no tonight, said no to hatred,\" Habon Abdulle said. She's the executive director of the Minneapolis group Women Organizing Woman Network . \"Minneapolis said no the narrative of making America hate again. Minneapolis, tonight said yes to diversity. Minneapolis, and [the] 60B district particularly, you said Muslim women have space in the governing body of our state. Thank you.\" When Omar's husband took the microphone, he got the crowd laughing when he started to describe strong black, Muslim woman. \"For those men \u2014 wooo! \u2014 let me tell you something,\" Hirsi said. \"When you see a strong, African, Muslim woman, don't be afraid, no, you know what, appreciate that. That's the model, that's the new 2016, going into 2017.\" Omar and her children joined him on stage, as the crowd started to chant, \"Ilhan, Ilhan, Ilhan.\" She honored her grandfather first, thanking him for his many lessons, then her dad and finally her supporters. \"Our campaign has been about more than just uniting a district, more than winning back the house, more than making history,\" Omar said. \"Our campaign has been about shifting narratives, restoring hope and re-establishing access in our democracy.\" She told the crowd she would work on an agenda focused on justice and the common good, zero waste and renewable energy. \"And we will never stop fighting for a democracy that works for all of us, for a prosperous and equitable Minnesota that we will all be proud of,\" she said. \"I will never give up fighting for you, and I hope you will never give up fighting for me.\" Omar's mentor and friend, Minneapolis City Council member Andrew Johnson, said he knew long ago that she would make history. \"I had no doubt that Ilhan would get here. The big question is: What's the path an individual takes?\" Johnson said. \"And I just think she's just naturally a great leader.\" Mohamed Omar Giama couldn't agree more. The 90-year-old former Somali ambassador to the European Commission said he was overjoyed witnessing history. \"I never thought a Somali lady, a refugee, can get through all this hardship, and difficulties, to get elected to Minnesota parliament,\" said Giama, who attended her victory party. \"It's wonderful, he said, just wonderful.\" Correction Nov. 10, 2016 ",

We're gonna look very strongly at health care, and we're looking at jobs \u2014 big league jobs,\" Trump told a throng of reporters after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the lawmaker's second-floor Capitol Hill office. While Trump mentioned the border being a top priority within the realm of immigration, he did not specifically mention the construction of a physical wall, something that he campaigned heavily on. Such a wall, however, is estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars . \"We have a lot of priorities, a lot of really great priorities,\" Trump added. \"People are gonna be very, very happy.\" Related: Obama Gives Trump a White House Welcome Trump was asked if he would ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country, a proposal Trump floated on the campaign trail. But Trump ignored the question, said \"thank you, everybody\" and walked away. After a temporary removal of his Muslim ban from his website, it is now back on it, reported the Washington Post. The new website for his transition, GreatAgain.gov, however, doesn't include a Muslim ban per se, but calls for the suspension of \"the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\" Trump's meeting with McConnell lasted about an hour and was superseded by a lunch between Trump, Vice-President-Elect Mike Pence, incoming first lady Melania Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan at the Republican Party's Capitol Hill Club, a private club used for meetings and fundraisers. With Trump by his side, Ryan congratulated Trump on \"one of the most impressive victories we've ever seen.\" Related: Trump Team Focuses on High Level Appointments \"We're gonna turn that victory into progress for the American people, and we are now talking about how we are going to hit the ground running to make sure that we can get this country turned around and make American great again,\" Ryan added.

By David Nakamura and Juliet Eilperin November 10 at 2:38 PM Follow @davidnakamura Follow @eilperin Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was \"very encouraged\" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post) President-elect Donald Trump and President Obama met for the first time Thursday and pledged to work together, starting the whirlwind transition that will unfold over the next 10 weeks until Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump later met with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) at the Capitol and said they also would work together \u2014\u00a0but on Republican goals that are opposed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. \"We're going to lower taxes,\" Trump told reporters, with Ryan seated by his side. \"We're going to fix health care and make it affordable and better.\" He appeared to be referring to a plan to lower taxes that heavily benefits top earners and to the GOP's aim of repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Following his meeting with Ryan, Trump conferred with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) in the Kentucky senator's Capitol office. An hour and a half after Trump entered the White House through the South Lawn entrance \u2014 avoiding news cameras and the president's staff \u2014 a group of reporters was ushered into the Oval Office, where the president and president-elect were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room. In a sign of how tensions between the two politicians have not disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the election, the White House did not arrange for the traditional photo-op between the current first couple and the incoming one, a custom that George W. Bush and his wife Laura observed when the Obamas visited the White House in 2008. Melania Trump met\u00a0separately with Michelle Obama. [ Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington ] Still, Trump told reporters Thursday that he expects to work closely with Obama now and in the future to\u00a0seek his advice in guiding the country. He noted that a session that was supposed to last 10 to 15 minutes went on for an hour and a half. \u201cAs far as I'm concerned, it could have lasted a lot longer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.\u201d \u201cSo Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future,\u201d he added, calling Obama \u201ca very good man.\u201d 1 of 22 What President-elect Donald Trump is doing on his trip to Washington View Photos Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Obama, for his part, said, he was\u00a0encouraged by \"the interest in President-elect Trump's wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces. And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face.\u201d The president said that the men's two wives had enjoyed spending time together\u00a0Thursday morning. \u201cWe want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMost of all, I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed \u2014\u00a0because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s victory exposes Obama\u2019s inability to connect with white working class ] Later, Trump and his wife, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, met with Ryan at the Capitol, where Trump pledged to work closely with Republican congressional leaders. Ryan ushered Trump out onto the Speaker's Balcony and gestured toward the Washington skyline and the monuments west of the Capitol. He pointed to an inaugural platform being built on the Capitol grounds, appearing to show Trump where he would be taking the oath of office as president. McConnell joined Trump and his entourage on a walking tour through part of the building. At the White House, first lady Michelle Obama and Melania Trump met for tea in the private residence and took a tour that included stepping onto Truman Balcony, as well as a tour of the State Floor with the White House curator. They talked about raising children in the White House, and then they visited the Oval Office to meet the president and president-elect. As\u00a0the two leaders met, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough gave a tour to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and other aides, notably Dan Scavino, across the edge of the Rose Garden. Afterward McDonough led\u00a0Kushner on a walk down the South Lawn for nearly 20 minutes, at which point the two men rejoined Trump's senior staff\u00a0and reentered the White House. During Obama and Trump's press availability, Kushner snapped photos with his iPhone. A slew of journalists, including international reporters, milled about on the driveway leading to the West Wing ahead of Trump's arrival. Some did live updates to their networks. Across West Executive Drive, dozens of White House staffers gathered on a steps in hopes of a glimpse of the president-elect. This is the scene on the West Wing driveway right now. pic.twitter.com/KoLxqek8qo \u2014 David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 10, 2016 Obama has pledged his administration's full cooperation with Trump's transition team, citing the close working relationship he enjoyed with President George W. Bush during their transfer of power eight years ago. The White House said\u00a0that Pence met with Vice President Biden in the afternoon. \u201cI have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect,\u201d Obama said in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. The president said he called to congratulate Trump early Wednesday morning after news networks had formally announced Trump as the winner over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after the meeting that the two men did not try to resolve all of their differences, but he said it was \"a little less awkward\" than reporters might have anticipated. Obama and Trump met privately without any other staff in the room. A large part of the Oval Office session was devoted to talking about how to staff and organize the White House. \"That's complicated business,\" Earnest said, noting that presidents have to deal with multiple challenges and crises at the same time. It is \"something President Obama has thought about extensively over the past eight years.\" Obama had denounced Trump as \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d for the White House during a long and brutal campaign. But he said that \u201cwe are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\u201d Trump, and Clinton, already had been receiving national-security briefings as the nominees of the two major political parties. The White House said Thursday that Obama has convened a coordinating council to facilitate a smooth transition, including providing briefings from federal agencies to Trump's transition team, headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). Officials from the Trump transition team are starting to set up shop in agencies across the federal government, where they can consult with top Obama officials as they assemble their staffs. The current White House has already begun to transfer a massive amount of information to the National Archives and Records Administration: so far it has sent 283 million files, comprising 122,000 gigabytes of data. In an interview Wednesday, White House communications director Jennifer Psaki said the president has talked privately with his staff, as well as publicly, about\u00a0putting institutional interests ahead of political ones. Referring to the speeches Obama delivered upon winning the presidency and at his first inaugural, she said: \u201cHe reflects a lot about the cog in the wheel that you are as president. He was taking the baton, he\u2019s handing it off. But I think it\u2019s a recognition that it\u2019s bigger than individual aspirations and it\u2019s bigger than yourself, and bigger than anything that you\u2019ve accomplished. Because we as a country need to be stable, need to have continuity.\u201d In the wake of protests over Trump's win, Earnest said that while the president believes the protesters have a right to express their opinions, his\u00a0message to them is that \"we're Americans and patriots first\" and that an orderly transfer of power ranks as a top White House priority. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who ran unsuccessfully in the GOP presidential primary and harshly criticized Trump, was at the White House on Thursday to attend Obama's ceremony for the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Kasich said he saw people protesting Trump's election as he entered the White House gates, and he called for unity. \u201cI just want to remind everyone in our country that the office of the presidency needs to be respected,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cToday, I said my prayers on the plane for the success of Donald Trump. And I think as Americans, we all need to come together.\u201d There is long-standing bad blood between Trump and Obama, after the New York businessman led a public campaign to try to force the president to disclose his long-form birth certificate in 2011 over unfounded questions from some conservatives who thought the president was not born in the United States. As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) During the White House Correspondents' Association dinner that year, Obama lit into Trump, mocking him before a ballroom of 2,000 guests and on live television. During the campaign, Trump promised to repeal the president's signature health-care law and overturn many of his executive actions. Obama said Trump was not to be trusted with the nation's nuclear codes and represented an existential threat to democracy. Obama sought to play down their differences and said Trump's victory speech was magnanimous and set the right tone to help try to heal the nation's political divisions that were exposed and inflamed over the past 15 months. \u201cThey do not have an extensive personal relationship,\u201d Earnest said Wednesday, drawing laughs from reporters. \u201cThis is not a situation where they\u2019ve had many conversations or played golf together or any of that business. So I guess that will be among the many, many, many reasons that tomorrow\u2019s meeting will be rather interesting.\u201d After his meeting with Trump, Obama will welcome another high-profile visitor with his own large media contingent when LeBron James and the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers arrive for a South Lawn ceremony with the president. 1 of 51 ",

But normally, those children are never coming back.\"\u00a0 She doesn't know how long her family was in the grip of ISIS, her recollection dulled by the fear and hopelessness of the ordeal. Zed is not the only one whose brainwashing remains effective. Many of the returnees still adhere to the Muslim call to prayer when it chimes from a nearby mosque. Many forget what it means to be Yazidi. And many are extremely violent toward their loved ones. Related Image Ahmed is faring better since being rescued from ISIS, and drew an \"X\" through this picture. (FoxNews.com) \"He beats his siblings,\" Seve continued, as her silent son fidgeted and slumped in the corner.\u00a0 With the assistance of smugglers and a network of rescuers, the family finally made it out of Syria and to the relative safety of the camp on June 2. They are now safe, but the family may never be whole again. For every Yazidi in Iraq, life is made up of two parts. There is the quiet, peaceful farming life in mountain villages before Aug.\u00a03, 2014, and then there is the lesser life from that day on - the day the genocide of their ancient religion at the fist of ISIS systematically started. Their men are missing and in many cases, presumed dead. Their women have endured the unspeakable degradation of sexual slavery. There homes have been destroyed. And many children of this ancient faith which predates Islam and Christianity, have become terrorists, weaponized against the people they once loved, and who still love them. The Yazidi boys were turned against their own by twisted training regimes that included Islamist indoctrination, weapons instruction and classes on the finer points of beheading and becoming suicide bombers and human shields. Now housed in camps, their homes sacked and destroyed, the peaceful, traditional community is trying to heal with next to no help. \"Psychologically, they are hurting. They have been influenced a lot, especially the young boys [ages] four to five,\"\u00a0said Hussein Al-Qaidy, director of the Office of Kidnapped Affairs, which operates under the Kurdish Regional Government's Prime Minister's Office. \"They forget how to speak Kurdish. Some still insist on praying five times a day. Many no longer have fathers and mothers. This is a difficult thing.\"\u00a0 According to Al-Qaidy, they formerly had a few basic program agreements with European non-governmental organizations for help in de-radicalization. But funding has dried up, and this devastated, endangered ethnic populace is broken and largely on its own. As it stands, there are just over 700 children who have been rescued or fled ISIS camps, with thousands still missing. According to one Kurdish official, ISIS operatives have been busy shuffling many of these boys to Raqqa in recent days as Iraqi forces move into Mosul. But, Al-Qaidy said, many of these minors are being executed or used as cannon fodder by the brutal terrorists.\u00a0 Al-Qaidy\u2019s office, a cement building nearby in Duhok's city center, is the hub of functions in the war with ISIS that is as somber as it is necessary. People, mostly Yazidi, float through the tiny waiting room looking for news on their loved ones, their eyes haunting and desperate. One aging man, dressed in his finest suit, pulls out his phone and starts showing us photographs of smiling children. All eight have been missing since ISIS marauded through their village three summers ago. Another man, in farmer\u2019s trousers, stares out into the desert sunshine - nervously pulling at strands of hair. At the office, a rescued boy named Ahmed, who is 16, but looks no older than 12, lifts his shirt. It has been more than 18 months since he and his little brother escaped the jihadist bivouac, walking days in the sweltering Iraq heat and finally reaching safety, and yet his ribs are still raw and blue from the daily lashings.\u00a0 The timid, gentle teen drew a picture for FoxNews.com. In black ink, it showed an ISIS member holding up the jihadist flag. Switching to a red pen, he drew a large \u201cX\u201d through it. But Ahmed is a rare exception \u2013 a teenage Yazidi boy who made it through ISIS captivity with his heritage intact. These young, conscripted jihadists pose a real threat to their friends and families, yet community leaders are firm in welcoming them back. They hope more boys will return after the liberation of Mosul and then Raqqa, ISIS\u2019 Syrian stronghold. Time, and the embrace of their people, will heal the boys, they believe. \"These children are victims, what happened to them was not their fault,\" Al-Qaidy said. Baba Chawish, a leading Yazidi spiritual authority and guardian of their holiest site, Lalish, has repeatedly called for the community not to ostracize the returnees, and ensure they are embraced.\u00a0 However, the sense of helplessness is at times overwhelming. \"As a community we don't have a problem accepting them back,\" says Col. Marwan Sabri, who heads the Peshmerga Yazidi brigade in the Northern Iraq area. \"But we have no experience in this and no resources to help. We don't know how to help them.\"\u00a0 A senior Kurdish intelligence official told FoxNews.com that returning Yazidi boys won't face repercussions despite what they may been made do in the service of ISIS. But the official expressed concern that de-radicalization and psychological help is pivotal. Atop the barren Sinjar Mountain, where thousands of Yazidis fled amid the ISIS assault and subsequently died of dehydration in the scorch of summer, a 36-year-old Syrian Kurdish nurse named Khansa Ali - a refugee herself from Rojava - is doing her best to save children, working out of a shoebox clinic with a few medicine bottles and beds. \"Psychological problems are the number one thing.\u00a0They come here - broken and in shock,\" Ali, who locals call a \"hero doctor,\" said from the clinic, where she lives. \"But all we can do is try to sit with them. Talk to them.\" And down in the masticated streets of the mountain foot village of Snoni, once occupied by ISIS, local school teachers are encountering similar frustrations. Depression, isolation, fear, says 6th grade teacher Hadi Mured, are just a few of the symptoms plaguing the survivors.\u00a0 Professional and long-term psychological and de-radicalization programs, experts agree, are desperately needed.\u00a0 \"Many have been forced to kill, and they are now desensitized to killing,\" said Dr. Anne Speckhard, adjunct associate professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the International Center for Violent Extremism. \"They will need programs similar to other forcibly conscripted child soldiers. PTSD and deprogramming-type therapy will be needed intensively at the beginning. They will need to be restored to safety and security to be able to participate in therapy in a meaningful way.\" That, she noted, is particularly challenging, given that many have lost their family to the genocide.\u00a0 \"But this can be treated,\" Speckhard said.\u00a0 As a FoxNews.com reporter rose to leave the humble canvas home, Zed, who has just started first grade at the camp, suddenly - as if slowly warming back to life - had something to say. Today, he learned the English alphabet, he said. And he wanted to practice it. Advertisement ",

They sold out within 4 hours. Jefferson Graham reports A consumer stands in line waiting to buy Snapchat's Spectacles, on sale Thursday. (Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) 53 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE VENICE BEACH, California \u2014 Tech workers, social media enthusiasts, students and journalists flooded here first thing Thursday morning to get their hands on the coveted Snapchat Spectacles. The $129 video sunglasses went on sale, with no advance notice, in a bright yellow vending machine on the Ocean Front Boardwalk. It was placed outside Snapchat\u2019s initial, but since outgrown, headquarters, a beach house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. USA TODAY joined the line at 10 a.m. PT Thursday, and was still there two hours later, with at least an hour left, behind about 100 people.\u00a0However, at 12:00 p.m., Snapchat reps advised us that we were unlikely to get copies. The vending machine will be moving from this location today, to an undisclosed location that hasn\u2019t been announced. Snapchat told us to go to \u201cspectacles.com\u201d to find the next location, when it\u2019s announced. People wait in line to buy Snapchat's Spectacles, available Thursday. \u00a0(Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) Many people walked up to the vending machine, advised they could only buy one pair per credit card transaction, only to buy several. USA TODAY saw one customer pick up four of them, before a guard advised him to please move on. Spectacles are already showing up on eBay , selling for as high as $950. Folks in line wanted to be the first to have the coveted new commodity. \u201cWe have to have them,\u201d said Maya Bengston, 24. \u201cI work for a surf company, and you can record without using your hands.\u201d What about if they get water on them? \u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t get them wet,\u201d she added. Snapchat updates app, teases Spectacles \u201cIt\u2019s really fun and personal,\u201d added Kelsey Da Costa. \u201cI just really want them.\u201d Will Brown said he was really interested in being first. \u201cI want to be one of those people who can have Spectacles when inventory is really scarce,\u201d he said. In late September, Snap renamed itself and announced Spectacles \u2014 camera glasses that can record up to 10 seconds of video, similar to Google Glass,\u00a0the ill-fated attempt by Google in 2013 to get people wearing $1,500 computerized glasses that could surf the Web and record images. The privately held company, which spurned an offer from Facebook and is reportedly planning an IPO next year, has grabbed a growing share of the social media market and prompted rivals to scramble to mimic some of the Snapchat app's trademark features, such as photo filters and placing the camera at the center of the user experience.

    "text": "Paul Ryan Meets With Donald Trump to Build Relationship, Plan Agenda By BENJAMIN SIEGEL Nov 10, 2016, 6:04 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH SPECIAL REPORT: Paul Ryan Meets With Donald Trump to Build Relationship, Plan Agenda 0 Shares Email Mr. Trump is going to Washington -\u2014 and House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed him to Capitol Hill. In the first steps toward cementing a unified Republican government, Ryan met with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Washington Thursday to lay the groundwork for the 2017 GOP agenda. House Speaker Paul Ryan Ignores Donald Trump 'Twitter Storm,' Urges Voters to Do the Same The meeting -- a working buffet lunch where the three leaders were joined by Melania Trump -- was the fourth time Trump and Ryan have met in person. \u201cWe had a fantastic productive meeting about getting to work, rolling up our sleeves and going to work for the American people. Donald Trump had one of the most impressive victories we\u2019ve ever seen and we\u2019re going to turn that victory into progress for the American people,\u201d he said. In his meeting with Ryan -- and following a later meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- Trump listed healthcare and immigration as top priorities for his administration. \"Immigration. Borders are important,\" he told reporters after meeting with McConnell. \"Healthcare. jobs - big league jobs.\" Already, Ryan has phoned Trump twice since the New York developer won the race to the White House, defeating Hillary Clinton -\u2014 and winning Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1984. While Ryan endorsed Trump and even offered to campaign with him in early November, he was vocally critical of elements of his campaign. In a rare House floor speech early in the race, Ryan criticized Trump's proposal to bar foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. He also rebuked Trump for his comments about an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican descent, calling them the \"textbook definition\" of racism, and said he was \"sickened\" by Trump's comments about groping women and sexual assault in the leaked 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" video. Trump has lashed out at Ryan and accused him of undermining his campaign. In August he initially refused to endorse Ryan in his House primary against a populist, Trump-supporting opponent. In the fall he called him a \"very weak and ineffective\" leader and suggested that Ryan wanted him to lose so he could run for president in 2020. The two leaders have their policy differences. Trump has endorsed elements of the House GOP election-year agenda, including the tax reform plank. He agrees with Ryan on repealing and replacing \" Obamacare .\" But they have significant disagreements on immigration and entitlement reform, free trade and foreign policy. However, Ryan said Wednesday that he is ready to follow Trump's lead \u2014 not only in the next session of Congress but also in the remaining months of Barack Obama's administration, when Congress must pass a measure to fund the government past Dec. 9. \"Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government. And we will work hand in hand on a positive agenda to tackle this country's big challenges,\" Ryan said. Before he can get down to business with Trump, Ryan must secure a second term as House speaker next week. Despite complaints from Republican hard-liners about Ryan's performance and his relationship with Trump during the election, he remains the only Republican with enough support to secure the 218 votes needed to keep the gavel. \"I don't know of anybody running against the speaker at this point,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which worked to remove the previous speaker, John Boehner . Some of Trump's prominent supporters, including Fox News' Sean Hannity , have suggested Ryan won't be speaker when Trump becomes president next year. \"Paul Ryan in not going to be the speaker of the House in January,\" Hannity said during a Fox News broadcast on election night. He later walked back the comment on Twitter. On Thursday, Trump appeared to suggest that he plans on working with Ryan in his capacity as speaker next year. \"I think we\u2019re going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe look forward to starting, in fact truthfully we can\u2019t get started fast enough.\" 0 Shares ",

The popular first lady has a favorable rating of 64 percent -- that\u2019s higher than both President Obama and President-elect Trump, according to a\u00a0 recent Gallup poll . Despite the pleas, the chances Mrs. Obama returns to the White House appear to be slim -- at least, that\u2019s what Mr. Obama has said in the past. At an event at a high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in early January, an audience member asked the president since he can\u2019t run for another term, can voters convince his wife to launch a White House bid. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201cNo, no, no ... no, no.\u201d And as if those \u201cno\u2019s\u201d weren\u2019t enough, the president continued to shoot down the idea. \u201cLet me tell you, there are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes and Michelle is not running for president. That, I can tell you,\u201d he said. However, he did predict that the ex-first lady will be \u201creally active\u201d after leaving the White House. So, it doesn\u2019t look like Mrs. Obama will disappear from the spotlight anytime soon. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

GALLAGHER Nov 10, 2016, 12:32 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH 2 Police Officers Ambushed and Shot in Pennsylvania; 1 Killed 0 Shares Email Two police officers in western Pennsylvania were shot, one fatally, in an ambush-style attack early this morning, state police said. The shooting happened in the town of Canonsburg, about 18 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, after the officers responded to a call about a domestic incident at 3:14 a.m. The officers were ambushed upon arrival \"as soon as they approached the front of the residence,\" a Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson said at a news conference this morning. Authorities said there was an \"active PFA,\" or protection from abuse order, at the residence where the officers were dispatched. Shortly before noon, Canonsburg city officials said that there is no longer an active situation or threat to the community. Regarding the suspected shooter, they said a man and woman were found dead inside the home where the ambush took place. Both died from gunshot wounds. Officials said the man's wounds appear to be self-inflicted. The man was known to officers, authorities added. Earlier this morning, some residents in the neighborhood were asked to vacate their homes, while others were ordered to stay inside. The Canon-McMillan School District was closed for the day and another local school had a delayed opening due to the shooting, according to state police. The slain officer was identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum, according to the Washington County Coroner's Office. He had been with the force for seven years. \"He was a loving husband a loving father, he was always willing to do whatever he had to do, never once did he ever say no to me for anything,\" Police Chief Alex Coghill said. \"Just one of those guys that always was there for you whenever you needed anything.\" Gene J.

The injured officer was hospitalized and underwent surgery, and is listed in stable condition, officials said. The identity of the injured officer has not been released. It was not immediately known what led to the shooting. The investigation is ongoing. Gene J.

That may come down to a political decision by his staff. But as a security matter, he could do it \u2014 just not with an unmodified, off-the-shelf phone, says a former senior National Security Agency official who retrofit President Obama's first Blackberry handheld. \"There are things an adversary can to do a cellphone \u2014 turn on the mic, for example \u2014 that make it really dangerous for a guy in his position to carry an unmodified device,\" the former official told NBC News. When President Obama took office in 2009, he was a Blackberry user, and he was allowed to keep one specially-modified by the NSA \u2014 but only to email a small circle of family members and colleagues. NSA experts beefed up the device's security, according to the former NSA official. Obama used the Blackberry until this year, when he finally got a smart phone, he told Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon in June. But it wasn't a normal smart phone. U.S. President Barack Obama works on his Blackberry on his belt as he returns to the Oval Office at the White House January 29, 2009 in Washington, DC. Pool / Getty Images \"I get the thing, and they're all like, 'Well, Mr. President, for security reasons ... it doesn't take pictures, you can't text, the phone doesn't work ... you can't play your music on it,'\" Obama said. \"Basically, it's like, does your three-year-old have one of those play phones?\" The former official said, \"That's how you do it \u2014 you strip out all the functionality so it becomes a brick that does the one thing he needs it to do. Luckily, he has someone to carry around the brick.\" Trump's tweets, some of them coming in the wee hours, have been a hallmark of his campaign, often provoking controversy. Data scientists who analyzed his tweets during the campaign said some came from an iPhone, and others from an Android phone . There has been speculation that campaign aides were responsible for the iPhone ones, while Trump himself wrote the Android ones, such as this one: The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, \"the baby\" and so much more. Very dishonest! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2016 Trump has tweeted on his \"@realDonaldTrump\" account only once since he won, on the morning after the election. \"Such a beautiful and important evening!,\" the tweet said. \"The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again.

Aaron Schock speaks to reporters in Peoria, Ill., in 2015. Seth Perlman/AP A grand jury indicted former Rep. Aaron Schock on 24 counts including wire fraud, theft of government funds and making false statements. After the charges were announced Thursday, U.S. Attorney Jim Lewis said in a statement: \"These charges allege that Mr. Schock deliberately and repeatedly violated federal law, to his personal and financial advantage. Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds.\" In response to the indictment, Schock issued a statement saying, \"As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes \u2014 no one intended to break any law,\" reported The Associated Press. Schock was elected to Congress in 2008 when he was just 27 years old and a rising star in the Illinois Republican Party. ( Some, including NPR, also pointed out his good looks. ) Article continues after sponsorship Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock Resigns Amid Spending Questions But he resigned in 2015 after the Office of Congressional Ethics reportedly began an investigation into his spending, as we have reported. The ethics inquiry came after multiple news reports alleged inappropriate spending, including a story in The Washington Post about his choice to turn his office into a replica of a lavish Victorian sitting room from the hit PBS show Downton Abbey. The Two-Way reported : \"The woman who designed the room had apparently done it for free, leading to ethics questions. Schock responded by saying he would pay her for the work . \"Later, there were reports that Schock billed taxpayers and his campaign thousands for private flights or trips taken on planes owned by donors.\" The Associated Press also reported on business deals between Schock and his political donors, including a case in which donors \"bought, sold and financed\" a house owned by Schock, and a case in which donors financed an apartment complex Schock invested in. The indictment announced Thursday alleges Schock \"generated income to himself, which resulted in a loss of more than $100,000 to the government, Schock's campaign committees and others,\" according to the statement by U.S. Attorney Lewis. In one instance, the indictment alleges Schock accepted \"skybox tickets for a Chicago Bears football game in Chicago at no cost to himself.\" The indictment continues: \"He invited others, including two staff members, to attend the game with him. [Schock] then hired the pilot of a private plane to fly the group from Peoria to Chicago. Following their arrival in Chicago, [Schock], his staffer, and the pilot traveled by Uber to a Chicago restaurant for dinner and then rented five hotel rooms. ... The total costs of the trip were approximately $3,293.96. [Schock] caused the [U.S.] House [of Representatives], through the use of his government travel card, submission of false vouchers for payment on the travel card, and direct payment to the pilot to pay ... for the Chicago trip with federal funds, as if they were legitimate expenses of his official office.\" As for the Downton Abbey-inspired office suite, costs associated with the redecorating project do show up in the indictment, which estimates the remodeling totaled \"approximately $40,000, including the purchase of a $5,000 chandelier.\" Schock allegedly charged $25,000 of that to the House of Representatives, describing it as \"services to assist the member in setting up our district and DC offices,\" and saying the Victorian lounge design included \"using materials from our district and rearranging/ designing/ structuring the space to best suit the member and staff's needs.\" ",

AP Aaron Schock speaks to reporters in Peoria Ill., in this 2015 photo. (Photo: Seth Perlman, AP) 157 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORE Former Illinois congressman Aaron Schock, once a rising star in the Republican Party, was charged in a 24-count indictment Thursday, alleging that he defrauded the government of more than $100,000 by allegedly falsifying vouchers for reimbursement for personnel travel, and filing false tax returns. Schock, 35, resigned his seat last year as federal investigators dug into allegations of the lawmaker's questionable spending on air travel and office decor. \u201cThese charges allege that Mr. Schock deliberately and repeatedly violated federal law, to his personal and financial advantage,'' said U.S. Attorney Jim Lewis, the chief federal prosecutor in Springfield, Ill. \"Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds.\u201d At a Peoria, Ill., news conference Thursday, Schock said he intends to \"not only prove these allegations false, but in the process expose this investigation for what it was.'' \"Neither I nor anyone else intentionally did anything wrong.'' the former lawmaker said. \"As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes \u2014 no one intended to break any law.'' Rep. Aaron Schock to resign amid spending scandal But prosecutors asserted that from as early as 2008, when he was first elected to the House, and continuing until last year Schock submitted a series of fraudulent claims to both House and campaign accounts to cover a range of expenses \"for his direct personal benefit and for the benefit of others.'' In tax filings for the years 2010 and 2015, Schock also allegedly failed to report additional income. Schock's swift downfall began in February 2015 when The Washington Post chronicled the unusual renovation of his Capitol Hill office, which his staff said was modeled after the PBS television series Downton Abbey. Staffers told the Post that the interior designer had done the work for free. The report prompted a wave of inquiries into the congressman's spending. USA TODAY disclosed that he had spent more than $100,000 on a prior office remodeling, including leather furniture and hardwood floors. Schock ultimately reimbursed taxpayers $35,000 for the Downton Abbey renovation. Taxpayers pay thousands for Rep. Schock's renovations Federal prosecutors referenced the renovations in court papers Thursday, detailing the congressman's hiring of an Illinois decorator to redo the congressional office at cost of about $40,000, including a $5,000 chandelier. He allegedly submitted false claims for reimbursement to a House account asserting that the claims represented \"services to assist the member in setting up our district and DC offices.'' In 2014, Schock allegedly used $73,896 from one of his campaign committees to purchase a new Chevrolet sport utility vehicle for his personal use. The purchase was made after Schock allegedly arranged for the campaign to purchase the congressman's used, 2010 SUV for $31,621. The old vehicle was then traded in for a $26,000 used-car allowance, causing a loss to the campaign account. The $73,896 payment was then recorded as campaign \"transportation expense ... rather than the purchase of vehicle for Schock's exclusive use.'' \"I am eager to finally defend my name and reputation in a court of law and move on with my life,'' Schock said. \"I have learned a painful lesson in this investigation \u2014 our own government cannot be trusted. But the people\u00a0can\u00a0be trusted.\u00a0 And we will put my future \u2014 once again \u2014 in the hands of the good people of this community.'' 157 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fG6qlH ",

    "text": "WATCH SPECIAL REPORT: Trump, Obama Meet at White House 0 Shares Email The swamp placed a red carpet over itself to welcome Donald Trump . And the president-elect played it the way you would expect from pretty much any other president-elect. The scenes out of Washington today were striking to anyone who has watched Trump and the wild campaign he just concluded. There was Trump seated next to President Obama in the Oval Office, being wished well by the man whom he will replace. The president whose very legitimacy Trump questioned was praised by Trump as a \u201cvery good man,\u201d and for the \u201creally great things that have been achieved\u201d during his time in office. Just an hour later, there was Trump on Capitol Hill, sitting between his wife and House Speaker Paul Ryan . The man Trump labeled a \u201cweak and ineffective leader\u201d less than a month ago uttered Trump\u2019s signature phrase: \u201cMake America great again.\u201d Paul Ryan Meets With Donald Trump to Build Relationship, Plan Agenda It\u2019s not a question of whether this era of jovial banter and mutual praise will last -- it won\u2019t. But the scenes that played out in official Washington today serve as a vivid reminder of the key choices ahead for the biggest outsider ever elevated to this ultimate insider post. Not many details about the coming Trump era can be derived from the largely ceremonial motions of the two days since Hillary Clinton conceded the race to the White House. Today, the president-elect briefly mentioned jobs, immigration, and controlling health care costs as among his top priorities, though with scant details. As leaders in Washington size him up, it\u2019s worth remembering that Trump\u2019s rise came at the expense of the establishment of both political parties. He didn\u2019t just not have their support -- he plowed right through their collective strength. Trump rode a populist, angry wave based on a promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d and sported a biography where a lack of government experience was a plus. He took on the Obama legacy, the Republicans\u2019 hierarchy and ideology, the congressional leadership in both parties, and even the nation\u2019s military leaders -- and, yes, exploited racial and ethnic tensions and suspicions. Trump has never shown an accommodating side as a politician. It seems folly to expect he will adjust his agenda to fit those of other leaders in a city where he\u2019s pledged to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d But he comes to Washington largely liberated of the traditional special interests that have long held sway over the agenda. He will have a window to operate and make deals, buffeted by congressional majorities that remember, for now, that Trump helped them stay in power this election. His first trip to D.C. as president-elect also suggests he might benefit from an overall political weariness. Obama showed Trump a path, with his gracious recognition of his election, and what that means from here. \u201cI believe that it is important for all regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together,\u201d Obama said. The fights, and maybe even the tweets, will come later. But a political system that fought Trump every step of the way may not be in a fighting mood when he takes office. 0 Shares ",

Jordan McLeod, a regional climatologist at the Southeast Regional Climate Center, told the Los Angeles Times that the Southeastern drought first developed in the spring and \"really began to intensify during the summer.\" The Times reports that the reason for the drought is essentially bad weather luck, because recent storms have skipped the driest areas: \"The rains that drenched Louisiana and led to disastrous floods this summer didn't head east, and the tropical storms that flooded parts of the East Coast didn't move west. \" 'Unfortunately those storms did not take a very favorable inland trek that would have brought some much-needed rainfall to interior areas that are under drought,' McLeod said of recent tropical storms that formed in the Atlantic Ocean and headed toward the U.S.\" Article continues after sponsorship The hardest-hit parts of the Southeast, mostly in Georgia and Alabama, are dealing with dryness comparable to the ongoing, catastrophic drought in California .

(Photo: MAURITZ ANTIN, EPA) 16 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2013 The House is preparing to debate legislation that aims to block U.S. financing for Boeing Co.\u2019s sale of $25 billion worth of planes to Iran, a key committee announced Thursday. President Obama could veto the legislation if Congress sends it to him. But the bill represents the latest salvo from lawmakers opposed to the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, which President-elect Donald Trump has criticized and said he would overturn. The bill from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., would prohibit U.S. banks from financing the plane sale\u00a0and would revoke any Treasury Department approval of the sale granted before the legislation is approved. The bill would\u00a0\"prohibit the secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the export or re-export of a commercial \u00a0passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" \"I am extremely concerned that by relaxing the rules, the Obama administration has allowed American companies to be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian regime,\" Huizenga told USA TODAY. The bill \"prevents the leaders of the Iranian regime from having access to the U.S. financial system.\" The House Rules Committee announced Thursday that it would meet Monday to set the terms for how the bill is debated on the House floor.\u00a0Even if approved in the House, it is unclear whether the legislation could clear the Senate during the lame-duck session of Congress. The bill was one of several pieces of legislation that lawmakers crafted in opposition to the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, which opened the door to greater trade. The 2015 deal lifted sanctions in exchange for the country curbing its nuclear facilities and allowed the purchase of aircraft and parts. The sanctions followed the\u00a01979 Islamic revolution\u00a0in Iran, in which students took over the\u00a0U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Boeing rival\u00a0Airbus, a European manufacturer, announced it had\u00a0received Treasury Department approval in September to sell planes to Iran.\u00a0Boeing, a Chicago-based manufacturer, has also received a Treasury license to sell 80 planes to Iran, under a memo signed in June, but\u00a0talks\u00a0continued about actually selling the planes to the\u00a0national airline Iran Air. Huizenga told the Financial Services Committee when it approved the bill in July that Iran Air had been\u00a0sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2011 for transporting missiles and fighters to Syria. He said\u00a0a United Nations report found Iran had shared ballistic-missile technology with North Korea. \u201cWho wants U.S. banks to draw on savings accounts in order to extend loans to the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism?\" Huizenga asked before the panel approved the bill.\u00a0\u201cIt does not make sense to me.\" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., \"strongly opposed\" the bill as undermining the nuclear agreement. But Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who supported the bill, said it didn't violate the agreement. He suggested that Iran could default on loan payments to U.S. banks. \"Let's not expose American depositors and banks to\u00a0the risk\u00a0that they will not be paid tens of billions of dollars by Iran,\" Sherman said. Boeing didn't immediately responded to requests for comment for Thursday. ",

Aside from Facebook director and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, few in tech openly supported Trump, and many gave large donations and other support to Hillary Clinton, whose win was expected to continue a generally collaborative relationship between the White House and Silicon Valley.

Time Graffiti of swastika on a softball field dugout in Wellsville, N.Y., Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: Brian Quinn, Wellsville Daily Reporter) 1083 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 176 COMMENTEMAILMORE In Wellsville, N.Y., a massive swastika is scrawled on a park wall: \"Make America White Again.\" In Maple Grove, Minn.,\u00a0messages in a high school bathroom include \"#gobacktoafrica,\"\u00a0\"#whitesonly\" and \"#whiteamerica\" \u2014\u00a0along with \"Trump Train.\" At the University of Vermont, students\u00a0found a Donald Trump campaign sign painted with a swastika three doors down from the campus Hillel. Experts and educators say an alarming succession of racist behavior, graffiti and crime since Election Day can be linked to\u00a0Trump's victory. And they say the Republican president-elect could play a crucial role in curbing the disquieting\u00a0conduct. Obama says he and Trump had 'excellent conversation' Carlos Wiley, director of the Paul Robeson Cultural Center at Penn State University, said he believes the attacks represent a backlash from people who suppressed racial hatred for years during the Obama presidency. Now they feel it is safe to openly display their contempt. \"People looked at the way protesters were manhandled at Trump rallies, and they think 'oh, if someone disagrees with us, we can do those things\u00a0as well,' \" Wiley said. Enid Logan, who teaches sociology and African-American studies at the University of Minnesota, says Trump's victory legitimized white supremacists' point of view. \"There was nothing subtle with Trump \u2014 extreme vetting and ideological testing of Muslims, deporting all undocumented people, Mexicans are rapists and murders,\" she said. \"And he won. White people supported him. So this kind of thinking isn't as marginal as we thought.\" In San Marcos, Texas, Texas State University police\u00a0are trying to determine who is responsible for a series of ominous, threatening fliers posted around campus. Not even 24 hours yet. My friend's sister, who is Muslim, had a knife pulled on her by a Trump supporter while on the bus by UIUC campus. \u2014 Sarah A. Harvard (@amyharvard_) November 9, 2016 \"Now that our man Trump is elected and Republicans own both the Senate and the House\u00a0\u2014\u00a0time to organize tar & feather VIGILANTE SQUADS and go arrest and torture those deviant university leaders spouting off all this diversity garbage,\" one of the fliers read. The fliers were found in bathrooms around the campus about 30 miles south of Austin, and images of them quickly spread on social media.\u00a0They featured a photo of several men clad in camouflage and holding rifles and claimed diversity was a code word for \"white genocide.\" University President Denise Trauth issued a statement calling for \"constructive dialogue\" in the wake of the contentious election. \"Discourse is fundamental to the academic enterprise, and this university strives to protect it,\" the statement said. \"Our aim should be to better understand that which causes divisions among us and to work toward strengthening our bond as a university community.\" Wiley agrees with Trauth\u00a0and said Trump could lead the discourse. \"He doesn't need to say anything about specific incidents, but he should say they are occurring and they should stop,\" Wiley said. \"That they aren't part of the America he wants to lead.\" Logan has her doubts. \"All that red meat he threw out to his base during the campaign, I'm not sure he believes it,\" she said. \"But it was incredibly powerful and it worked. Why would he pivot now?\" In Minnesota,\u00a0officials at Maple Grove Senior High launched an investigation into the racist graffiti, which has been widely shared on Twitter. \"The tweet you may have seen of a racist message scrawled in a school bathroom is real,\u00a0and we are horrified by it,\" said Barbara Olson,\u00a0Osseo area schools community relations director. She said such racist messages endanger students and staff\u00a0and create a climate that is not conducive to learning. \"This incident is additional evidence of the pressing need in our schools, our community and our nation to find ways to talk about race constructively and respectfully,\" Olson said.

In California, San Jose State University said a woman lost her balance and choked\u00a0when a man attempted to rip her\u00a0headscarf away. In Louisiana, a report of another racial incident was later debunked.\u00a0\u200bA Louisiana college student, 18,\u00a0acknowledged she fabricated a report that she was assaulted and robbed of her wallet and Muslim headscarf by two men, one of whom she described as wearing a white \u201cTrump\u201d hat, police said Thursday. The Lafayette Police Department said in a statement that it is no longer investigating the\u00a0claims, which were made within hours of\u00a0Trump\u2019s presidential victory. The presidents of both schools issued statements\u00a0referencing the \"contentious\" election and urging their communities to respect diversity as the nation moves forward. It may take awhile. Social media is full of examples of hate.\u00a0And Trump foes have joined the chaos online and on the streets, where shouts of\u00a0\"Not my president\" and\u00a0profanity are\u00a0appearing on signs and buildings. Thousands across the USA protest Trump victory Wiley said he was encouraged by Trump's conciliatory remarks during his acceptance speech. But he fears that if Trump fails to quickly make good on promises such as building a wall that Mexico will pay for, his backers will grow angry. And, he said, take it out on \"populations\" they don't like. \"We need to allow people to mourn a little bit, to contemplate what their future looks like with\u00a0a Donald Trump presidency,\" Wiley\u00a0said. \"Then we need to have serious conversations about humanity, about civility.

    "text": "Got it By Deepti Hajela | AP November 10 at 5:19 PM NEW YORK \u2014 Demonstrators took to the streets in San Francisco and gathered in a New York City park Thursday to express their outrage over Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected presidential win while Trump supporters took to social media and denounced demonstrators as hypocrites or worse for not accepting defeat in a democratic process. High-spirited high school students marched through San Francisco\u2019s downtown, chanting \u201cnot my president\u201d and holding signs urging a Donald Trump eviction. They waved rainbow banners and Mexican flags, as bystanders in the heavily Democratic city high-fived the marchers from the sidelines. \u201cAs a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up,\u201d said Claire Bye, a 15-year-old sophomore at Academy High School. \u201cI\u2019m fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person. I\u2019m fighting for the rights of brown people, black people, Muslim people.\u201d In New York City, about a hundred protesters gathered at Union Square in Manhattan to protest a Trump presidency. They held signs that read \u201cDivided States of America\u201d and \u201cNot My President\u201d and \u201cLet the New Generation Speak!!\u201d At a subway station along 14th Street, New Yorkers expressed their thoughts \u2014 \u201cTime to Fight Back\u201d and \u201cKeep the Faith! Our work is just beginning!\u201d \u2014 along the walls of a walkway using sticky notes. On Twitter, Trump supporters accused protesters of not respecting the process because it didn\u2019t work out in their favor. \u201cYou\u2019re literally protesting against free democratic elections. Go live in North Korea, you absolute trash,\u201d one said. \u201cThey\u2019re not protesting Trump, they\u2019re protesting democracy and the right to disagree with them. Isn\u2019t that fascism,\u201d said another. Thousands demonstrated Wednesday around the country, from New England to Kansas City to the West Coast. Flames lit up the night sky in California cities as protesters burned a giant papier-mache Trump head in Los Angeles and started fires in Oakland intersections. In Chicago, where thousands had recently poured into the streets to celebrate the Chicago Cubs\u2019 first World Series victory in over a century, several thousand people marched through the Loop. They gathered outside Trump Tower, chanting \u201cNot my president!\u201d Since Tuesday night, protesters have marched in the Midwest, including St. Paul, Minnesota, Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri. Marchers protesting Trump\u2019s election chanted and carried signs in front of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. ___ Associated Press writer Janie Har in San Francisco contributed to this report.

    "text": "Despite Republican pledges, 'repealing Obamacare' will be almost impossible \u2014 but it could be vandalized The challenges Trump and the GOP face with repealing Obamacare Republicans have promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act pretty much since the law\u2019s enactment in 2010. Republicans have promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act pretty much since the law\u2019s enactment in 2010. Michael Hiltzik Contact Reporter The promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act has been a staple of the Republican Party\u00a0platform virtually since the law\u2019s enactment in 2010. Now it looks like it might happen. President-elect Donald Trump picked up the theme in his campaign, promising \u201con Day One of the Trump administration\u201d to \u201cask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare .\u201d He pledged to supplant it with \u201csomething terrific.\u201d This promise is about to come face-to-face with reality. Repealing many\u00a0Obamacare provisions isn\u2019t possible without the assent of congressional Democrats . Perhaps more important, dismantling key elements of the law risks leaving the U.S. healthcare system in chaos \u2014 certainly in worse shape than it was even before the Affordable Care Act was passed. As my colleague David Lazarus observes , at\u00a0stake is coverage for approximately 20 million Americans and the cost of coverage for many more. [Republicans] made the public think Obamacare caused all the trouble. That's absolutely wrong. They could repeal it tomorrow and costs would continue to go up. \u2014 Healthcare expert Don Berwick Starting in January, when it assumes control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the GOP will be \u201cit\u201d\u00a0on healthcare. The party will own every change made to the law\u00a0and take the blame for every consequence of its actions, so it will be well-advised to tread carefully. \u00a0 Trump on Thursday took a shot at putting meat on the bones of his \u201csomething terrific\u201d pledge, posting a healthcare policy outline on his president-elect website. Interestingly, the outline replaces the \u201cDay One\u201d promise with a commitment to \u201cwork with Congress to repeal the ACA and replace it,\u201d which sounds like a longer timeline. The outline includes\u00a0several\u00a0traditional GOP shibboleths, such as returning \u201cthe historic role in regulating health insurance to the states\u201d (though under the ACA, they still have considerable authority); expanding the availability of tax-exempt health savings accounts, a provision that benefits the rich and is virtually worthless to low-income households that don\u2019t pay much federal income tax; and allowing the sale of policies across state lines, which would launch a race to the bottom as insurers established themselves in states with the most minimal consumer protections.\u00a0 Trump also put in a pitch for reestablishing high-risk pools, public insurers which would enroll customers with especially costly healthcare needs. Trump called this \u201ca proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage.\u201d\u00a0 The truth is almost exactly the opposite. As we explained in April , when high-risk pools were being promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan\u00a0(R-Wis.), the only thing these pools have been proven to be in the\u00a035 states that tried them before the ACA is a failure. The pools were never adequately funded,\u00a0which prompted states either to place caps on enrollments or saddle members with sky-high, unaffordable\u00a0premiums.\u00a0 Conservative economist\u00a0 James Capretta estimated in 2010 \u00a0that a high-risk program would need $15 billion to\u00a0$20 billion a year to cover 4 million enrollees -- and he was\u00a0in favor\u00a0of the idea. What are the chances that such a program would succeed in the budget-cutting environment sure to prevail under a Trump White House and GOP Congress? Trump also tosses in pledges to\u00a0protect\u00a0\u201chuman life from conception to natural death,\u201d which doesn\u2019t sound good for abortion rights or end-of-life planning, and\u00a0to \u201cmodernize Medicare ,\u201d which sounds like a warning for seniors to hold on to their wallets. Many provisions of the Affordable Care Act are better appreciated by the public than GOP rhetoric would have one believe. Repealing them won\u2019t necessarily be a crowd-pleaser.\u00a0 Jeffrey Young of the Huffington Post points to Kentucky, where right-winger Matt Bevin rode into the governor\u2019s mansion on a platform of unadorned Obamacare hate and a promise to dismantle\u00a0it, root and branch. The problem is that Obamacare had worked spectacularly well in Kentucky, reducing its uninsured rate to 7.5%, from 20.4%, thanks to Medicaid expansion and an efficient state-run exchange, Kynect. The law\u2019s provisions were broadly popular, even if Obamacare\u2019s image was widely abominated. \u00a0 Donald Trump says he expects Congress to send him a bill repealing Obamacare, which he says\u00a0he\u2019ll sign. And more than 20 million Americans will lose health coverage. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat any of this,\u201d said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for... Day 1. That\u2019s when President-elect Donald Trump says he expects Congress to send him a bill repealing Obamacare, which he says\u00a0he\u2019ll sign. And more than 20 million Americans will lose health coverage. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat any of this,\u201d said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for... (David Lazarus) As a result, Bevin has made mostly\u00a0cosmetic changes to the law. He scrapped the Kynect brand and transferred some of its duties to the federal government, but left in place its role of enrolling Kentuckians in health plans and has kept its\u00a0Medicaid expansion in place. As Young observes, if that\u2019s the worst \u201ca tea party Republican ushered into office by a wide margin in a conservative state can do to Obamacare,\u201d the challenge of repeal on a national scale becomes evident. The GOP\u2019s biggest problem may be that much of the increase in healthcare costs that the party blamed on Obamacare, including rising premiums and deductibles, actually has little to do with its provisions and stem from broader trends. Republicans \u201cmade the public think Obamacare caused all the trouble,\u201d former Medicare official Don Berwick told Kaiser Health News. \u201cThat's absolutely wrong. They could repeal it tomorrow and costs would continue to go up.\u201d If the GOP executes broad changes in the law but can\u2019t quell the cost trends, it will be blamed for the failure. More than political risk stands in the way. Numerous provisions of the Affordable Care Act are subject to filibuster in the Senate, which the GOP doesn\u2019t have 60 votes to avoid. According to healthcare expert Timothy Jost, an emeritus law professor at Washington and Lee University, those may be safe from repeal . As it happens, they include many consumer-protection reforms that are very popular, including the ban on exclusions or higher premiums for preexisting conditions, and caps on annual and lifetime benefits.\u00a0 boasts his campaign website . The candidate himself claims to have \"saved the American taxpayer... Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential campaign has been crowing lately about the blow he supposedly scored against the Affordable Care Act. \"Only one candidate has actually done significant damage to Obamacare,\" boasts his campaign website . The candidate himself claims to have \"saved the American taxpayer... (Michael Hiltzik) (Michael Hiltzik) Other provisions involve government spending, so they\u2019re subject to budget reconciliation legislation that requires only a majority vote in the Senate. Jost observes that the Republicans\u00a0passed a reconciliation bill in 2015 that might serve as a model for 2017. Vetoed by President Obama, it would have repealed tax subsidies for premiums and \u2014 for very low-income Americans \u2014 for deductibles and co-pays; Medicaid expansion, which covers low-income adults in states that chose to participate; taxes levied to fund elements of the law; and the widely detested individual and business mandates. But reconciliation is a multi-step process that can\u2019t be done on Day One. Reconciliation faces other potholes. That\u2019s because the Affordable Care Act has many interlinked moving parts, and removing some of them could make the entire machine grind to a halt, raising costs and throwing the system into turmoil for millions of Americans who didn\u2019t even know they were exposed. Removing the mandates but leaving in place the ban on exclusions for preexisting conditions will cause torrents of red ink for insurance companies. Repealing Medicaid expansion will drive up costs for hospitals, which have seen welcome relief from the burden of providing uncompensated care for uninsured patients. Moreover, there appears to be a poison pill that would be triggered by repeal of the cost-sharing subsidies, which are available to individual policies with income less than 250% of the federal poverty line ($60,750 for a family of four next year) and received currently by nearly 7 million people. As explained by Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net , the contracts reached by the federal government with insurers in states using the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, allow them to immediately cancel their policies if the cost-sharing subsidies are overturned.\u00a0 A challenge by House Republicans to the legality of\u00a0the government\u2019s payments for those subsidies is currently being pondered by a federal court. Theoretically, President Trump could end the payments by fiat on Day One of his administration. This could mean the immediate cancellation of as many as 7 million policies, purely by GOP action. Gaba reports that the cancellations are subject to state laws, and\u00a0it\u2019s unclear how many states would require the policies to remain in force through the year. Nicholas Bagley of the University of Michigan reckons that in states that allow health plans to pull out of the market if the cost-sharing payments cease, \u201cthe collapse of the individual market could occur very quickly. Millions of people would be pitched off their insurance, leaving them with no other options.\u201d \u00a0That\u2019s just a hint of the complexities of repeal. Even without repeal, Trump could throw a wrench into\u00a0the Affordable Care Act by sheer administrative starvation \u2014 though making the law less efficient might not count as turning it into \u201csomething terrific.\u201d Trump could abandon Obama administration efforts to enroll customers in Affordable Care Act plans or to keep insurers in the marketplace. \u201cIf a Trump administration simply stopped implementing or enforcing certain regulatory requirements, there might be little that could be done about it,\u201d Jost observed. \u201cJust a change in leadership in the agencies implementing the ACA will cause months of disruption.\u201d What about \u201creplace\u201d? Republican alternatives have been sketchy, and their potential for maintaining coverage for the 20 million Americans receiving coverage via Obamacare dubious. As for Trump\u2019s campaign healthcare plan, in addition to the features ported over to his president-elect website, these include\u00a0eliminating the individual mandate, which would drive lots of insurers out of the individual market, and block-granting Medicaid to the states, which would merely be an invitation to many state governments to cut Medicaid benefits. Trump also would make premiums tax deductible for individuals, as they are for\u00a0corporations and those receiving healthcare through their employers. That\u2019s a good idea, but it\u2019s also of limited use for working-class and low-income households. Here\u2019s a concise rundown of what can and can\u2019t be done in repealing Obamacare: Low-hanging fruit: Say goodbye to Obamacare\u2019s\u00a0medical device tax and \u201c Cadillac\u201d tax \u00a0on high-quality healthplans such as those sponsored by big employers and many large unions. Repeal of both has bipartisan support; last year,\u00a0with Obama\u2019s assent, Congress deferred the Cadillac tax to 2020, from 2018. Also likely to go is the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which was given authority to trim Medicare spending if it rose faster than a given benchmark. The IPAB has never gone into effect, but conservatives detest it and only healthcare wonks care much about it. Possible, but not so simple:\u00a0Trump might be able to eliminate by administrative order\u00a0some mandated minimum benefits , such as pregnancy and maternity care, mental health services and emergency services. Trump and Congress could also encourage more bare-bones or catastrophic plans, which would carry lower premiums but provide lower benefits. Politically safe, probably: The ban on exclusions for pre-existing conditions, though Republicans may impose a condition requiring continuous coverage, that is, no lapse in coverage for some period of time.\u00a0This could be legislated, but leaves open the question of how to care for those who drop coverage temporarily because of economic reversals. Also probably safe: The right to keep children on parents\u2019 employer plans up to the age of 26, and bans on annual and lifetime benefit limits. Legislative limbo: The Child Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, comes up for reauthorization next year. The program covers about 8 million children in low-income households who would lose their benefits if the program is allowed to die. But CHIP is associated with Hillary Clinton , who is widely credited with a \u201cpivotal\u201d role in its creation. If Trump and the Republicans really want to draw a sharp line between them and Clinton, this is the place to do it \u2014 with 8 million kids as collateral damage. So, good luck, GOP. Until now, the party has not paid serious attention to the U.S.\u00a0healthcare system and all its ills, because it chose the course of sniping from the sidelines and obstructing problem-solving efforts by federal agencies. Now it is the government, and the risks and rewards of healthcare policy are in its possession. Republicans could make things better by careful policymaking, or immeasurably worse by maintaining its ideological opposition to \u201cObamacare\u201d without thinking too hard about the consequences. Let\u2019s see how they do.

So... that happened... what's next? I'm still trying to reconcile my own worldview with the overwhelming message that was delivered last night. Clearly there are a lot of people angry and scared as the antithesis of every modern presidential candidate won and will be our next president. While demeaning, insulting and ridiculing minorities, immigrants and the physically/mentally disabled worked for Mr. Trump, I want to be clear that this behavior - and these views, have no place at Grubhub. Had he worked here, many of his comments would have resulted in his immediate termination. We have worked for years cultivating a culture of support and inclusiveness. I firmly believe that we must bring together different perspectives to continue innovating - including all genders, races, ethnicities and sexual, cultural or ideological preferences. We are better, faster and stronger together. Further I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can. As we all try to understand what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States. If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here. We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team. I want to repeat what Hillary said this morning, that the new administration deserves our open minds and a chance to lead, but never stop believing that the fight for what's right is worth it.

He said three police were wounded. \u201cPolice have surrounded the area and our forces are inside the compound,\u201d he said. The Taliban issued a statement saying they had sent suicide attackers to the consulate. Sher Jan Durrani, spokesman for the police chief of Balkh province, said early Friday that a gun battle was going on at the consulate. The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement there was an \u201carmed attack\u201d on the consulate but didn\u2019t specify the nature of the attack or mention any casualties. The statement said there had been fighting outside and on the grounds of the consulate and that Afghan security forces and troops from the international Resolute Support mission were at the scene. Mazar-i-Sharif is the capital of Balkh province and one of the most important cities in the country. Residents in the city reported hearing a huge explosion near the consulate that shattered windows in buildings nearby. Germany has 983 soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, most of them in Balkh, as part of NATO\u2019s Resolute Support mission. The Taliban\u2019s insurgency has spread from their southern heartland across the country in the past two years. The Taliban statement from spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack was retaliation for recent airstrikes in the northern city of Kunduz, capital of the province of the same name. A U.S. airstrike earlier this month killed dozens of people, including women and children, and is under investigation.\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "A more presidential Trump tries to woo Washington in visits to the White House and the Capitol President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Noah Bierman Contact Reporter Donald Trump \u2019s top advisors urged his opponents to grant the president-elect a \u201cfresh start\u201d on Thursday, as the man who spent 17 months maligning the establishment took his first formal steps in assuming its reins. Trump and his aides made a ritual journey\u00a0to the White House to meet with President Obama , a man whose birthplace he questioned until recently, before strolling the august corridors and admiring the views from the Capitol with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the two Republicans whose relationships will prove pivotal to his success. Normally, such steps are symbolic but rote. For Trump, the significance went much further. Ryan, like many in his party\u2019s establishment, was reluctant to embrace Trump, and Trump campaigned on a promise to reverse the achievements of Obama, who\u00a0explicitly charged that the business mogul was unfit to hold the nation\u2019s highest elected office. Though Trump\u00a0hunched and twitched his fingers uncomfortably while sitting across from Obama in the Oval Office,\u00a0the men spoke warmly of each other, giving unspoken assurance that the transition of power would not be impeded by the historically nasty presidential campaign. Obama called the meeting excellent and\u00a0renewed his vow to help make Trump successful. Trump only lamented that the summit did not last longer, saying it had already been stretched beyond the planned 10 or 15 minutes into a full hour and a half\u00a0due to their easy rapport. \u201cI very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u201d he said. Armand Emamdjomeh Trump also promised to work quickly with Ryan and other congressional Republicans on healthcare \u2014\u00a0an issue on which they are united in their desire to repeal Obama\u2019s signature law \u2014\u00a0as well as\u00a0immigration and \u201cbig-league jobs\u201d proposals. The pledges to cooperate,\u00a0even if many items on his to-do list remain divisive,\u00a0were among several signs that\u00a0Trump wants to put some aspects of the polarizing campaign behind him and show, as he long promised, a more presidential face. His blunt call to ban all Muslims from entering the country, for example, was temporarily expunged from his campaign website after lingering there since he issued it in December, following the deadly terrorist attack\u00a0in San Bernardino. Trump\u2019s staff restored it Thursday afternoon. Trump walked away from reporters without answering when asked during his Capitol visit whether he would continue to pursue the policy, which he had seemed to amend over the course of the campaign. Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor and close Trump confidant, also suggested Trump may let go of his vow to pursue a prosecution of Hillary Clinton , another campaign rallying cry.\u00a0On Capitol Hill, Republicans have been mum on whether they would press forward with investigations. \"I don't like to see America become a country where we prosecute people because of politics,\" Giuliani said on Fox News. Yet he gave Trump room to maneuver, adding that \"there are deep and disturbing issues there.\" The day followed an evening of large protests around the country by\u00a0opponents who came away from the election angry, declaring that they would still not accept Trump as their president. Starting Tuesday night, as Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election started coming into focus, anguished questions flooded social media: Could Trump overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide? Could he abolish same-sex marriages? Could he increase... (David Lauter) \"There will be a fresh start,\" Michael Cohen, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said on CNN as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is leading Trump\u2019s transition to the White House, declared that Trump and the nation had moved beyond the controversy Trump inflamed regarding Obama\u2019s birthplace. It remained\u00a0unclear whether such moves represent a full or permanent shift in Trump\u2019s approach. As a candidate, Trump frequently rebuffed public suggestions from his own campaign that he would soften some of his stances or pull back from controversial promises. He notably contradicted his running mate, Vice President-elect Mike Pence , at one point saying that Pence did not accurately represent his Syria policy because the two men had not spoken about it. Trump would also follow days of scripted policy speeches with late-night tweets or other public denunciations of his critics that would dilute his efforts to appear above the fray. Trump will also face immense pressure from the passionate backers who fueled his election to keep hammering at the establishment. Yet, as Trump assumes the presidency\u00a0and begins to grasp the full weight of responsibility, he may be entering a new phase.\u00a0 This is America's state of mind on election day Open link His precise policy agenda will take shape over the next several weeks as he selects Cabinet secretaries and other key advisors who will help determine his priorities. On Thursday, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent immigration hardliners emerged as a top player in Trump\u2019s transition.\u00a0Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who\u00a0helped to craft Arizona's 2010 law that let local police crack down on immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally, told a local television station that he would be helping Trump\u2019s team on immigration-related issues. \"There's no question the wall is going to get built. The only question is, how quickly will it get done and who pays for it?\" Kobach told KWCH. Other names from the lobbying world were also emerging in media reports detailing members of the transition team, including people with ties to energy, banking and tobacco industries. Trump laid out an extensive list for his first days in office during a speech\u00a0in Gettysburg, Pa., last month, including\u00a0steep tax reductions, a border wall with Mexico, a freeze in most federal government hiring\u00a0and the cancellation of billions of dollars in payments for United Nations climate change programs. He also included a dozen issues on a new transition website he unveiled Thursday, including infrastructure spending, trade policy, and the dismantling of the financial rules Obama created with Congress following the 2008 banking industry collapse. Some of the actions can be taken unilaterally \u00a0\u2014 something McConnell has welcomed.\u00a0But others will require congressional approval, with politically difficult votes that not all Republicans will want to take. Giuliani said on CNN that the Trump administration could begin\u00a0building an immigration wall on the Southwest border under\u00a0executive authority, rearranging money already approved by Congress for other aspects of immigration enforcement. It is unclear whether Congress will agree with that interpretation. Caption Hillary Clinton's concession speech A portion of Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

Related: In Capitol Hill Meetings, Trump Reveals Top Priorities Democrats in Washington are uneasy working with Trump, but worry he'd be more dangerous if left to his own devices. And as the the party of government, Democrats feel compelled to make it work for their constituents as much as possible. Dysfunctional government will generally benefit the anti-government party, which is the GOP. \"My number one priority in the next two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful,\" President Barack Obama said Thursday after meeting with Trump.

But Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress \u2014 and their way of doing business \u2014 were rejected. Rejected by their own primary voters, rejected during the campaign, and rejected in Tuesday's election,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said at the AFL-CIO on Thursday. \"If Donald Trump is ready to make good on his promise to get corruption out of politics,\" she continued, \"Then count me in. I will work as hard as I can. I will pull as many people as I can into the fight.\" But she drew a bright line around defending the rights of minority groups. \"That is Democrats' first job in this new era: We will stand up to bigotry.

Bernie Sanders said in a statement. \"To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,\" Sanders added. The clarity of vision from the populist-left has made the muted response from the Democratic establishment more noticeable.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told colleagues that she spoke with Trump to offer \"the support of House Democrats to find common ground for a robust infrastructure jobs bill,\" according to an aide. Pelosi also suggested a path forward on child care and family leave issues, for which Trump expressed support during his campaign. But beyond that, the outlook is bleak for Democrats. Play ",

Arkin and Robert Windrem Share advertisement With many mainstream Republican defense experts having denounced his candidacy, President-elect Donald Trump is assembling a team of lesser known national security figures to staff his transition team, intelligence and military officials told NBC News. A number of prominent Republican former security officials have made it clear through words or deeds they wouldn't consider joining the administration. For example, Michael Hayden, who was CIA director under George W. Bush, has accused Trump of being a dupe of Russia, given his advocacy of views espoused by Vladimir Putin. Watch Cynthia McFadden on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt for More But others are said to be mulling a move to Team Trump, including Stephen Hadley, a former Bush national security adviser. Hadley told NBC News he is \"not participating in the transition at this point.\" Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee until he retired last year, is playing a key role in the transition after quietly backing Trump during the latter stages of the campaign. His senior aide and former House chief of staff, Andy Keiser, is also involved, a Trump advisor told NBC News. Former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan is a top figure on the Trump transition team. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images, file Rep. Michael McCaul (R.-Texas), who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, is under consideration to be homeland security secretary, a campaign official and a source close to McCaul told NBC News. One list obtained by NBC News includes two dozen people of varying backgrounds to be vetted for security clearances, according to one U.S. military intelligence official and one Trump transition team member. Subjects to be discussed by various members of the group include the nation's nuclear war plans and the classified details of Russia's role in the election. That list includes four current or former Republican members of Congress \u2014 Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and former Congressman Robert Smith Walker of Pennsylvania. It includes two retired generals \u2014 former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Mike Flynn, who publicly campaigned for Trump, and Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, vice president of strategic initiatives at Cubic Corporation, a defense and transportation firm. Also on the list is former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, a blunt-talking, controversial figure. Two other polarizing names on the list are Clare Lopez a former CIA officer who has said the Muslim Brotherhood has \"infiltrated\" the Obama administration; and Walid Phares, is a Lebanese born Maronite Christian who speaks frequently about radical Islam. A Trump adviser said Lopez, who specialized in Russia during her CIA career, has been \"one of the intellectual thought leaders about why we have to fight back against radical Islam,\" and Phares has briefed Trump and is trusted by him. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) speaks during a news conference held by House Republicans on \"Protecting America's Veterans\" at the U.S. Capitol on May 29, 2014 . Win McNamee / Getty Images file \"This is a very eclectic group of folks,\" said Admiral James Stravidis, the former NATO commander. \"Collectively they're going to come at international affairs with a bias towards hard power\" \u2014 meaning military force \u2014 \"as opposed to soft power\" \u2014 meaning diplomacy and economic influence. A Trump national security aide said he could not confirm the list, but told NBC News that revamping policies toward Iran and Russia are at the top of Trump's security agenda. Pressuring Iran to stop enriching uranium and renegotiating the broader Iran deal is a top priority, he said, \"because it was such a horrible deal\u2026.Clearly he wants to renegotiate the deal.\" As for Russia, the adviser said Trump will seek to immediately establish \"better relationships with Russia across the board and not have so much hostility. We need to cooperate on countering radical Islam and combating all of these Sunni jihadist terrorist groups\" like Islamic State and al Qaeda. Asked if he was concerned that Trump would be manipulated by Putin, the advisor said, \"I don't think so. Trump is a good negotiator.\" For any new president, said Stavridis, national security \"has to be job one. \u2026 Instantly, on Jan. 20 he will be tested. He'll be tested by the Russians in the cyber world. He'll be tested by the Chinese in the South China Sea. He'll be tested by the Iranians in the Arabian Gulf. We will see test after test and they will come fast and furious in the new year.\" Ken Dilanian ",

By Krissah Thompson November 10 at 4:19 PM Follow @Krissah30 First lady Michelle Obama meets with Melania Trump for tea in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House on Nov. 10. (Chuck Kennedy/The White House) Michelle Obama carried on an awkward White House tradition when she hosted Melania Trump for tea Thursday. It was their first meeting, coming on the heels of the ugliest campaign in recent history. They talked about raising children and took a tour of the White House\u2019s private residence before heading to the Oval Office to meet with the president and president-elect. The tour also included a visit to the Truman Balcony, which overlooks the South Lawn, and a tour of the State Floor of the executive mansion with the White House curator. Mrs. Obama\u2019s aides offered no further details of the meeting. Donald Trump and his wife arrived at the White House via a back door on the South Lawn, an area not visible to the public. [ Meet Melania Trump, a new model for first lady ] Still, the meeting of the current and future first ladies was a moment to consider both the fraught public relationship between the two and their differing styles. Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was \"very encouraged\" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post) Michelle Obama played an unprecedented role in the failed campaign to elect Hillary Clinton, traveling the country to make the case that Donald Trump was a poor role model for the nation\u2019s children and unfit for the presidency. [ How Michelle Obama talks to voters in a way Hillary Clinton can\u2019t ] Melania Trump was less involved in her husband\u2019s campaign. She rarely gave public speeches, saying she preferred to stay home in Manhattan and care for her young son, Barron. Mrs. Trump\u2019s most prominent moment of the campaign came during the Republican National Convention when she gave her first speech before a large national audience. It was well received \u2014 until a journalist discovered that s everal phrases had been plagiarized from a 2008 Michelle Obama speech . Trump\u2019s campaign later explained that Melania was an admirer of Michelle\u2019s. Obama addressed the plagiarism matter only briefly, when talk-show host Stephen Colbert asked her about it during a September appearance on his show. \u201cThat\u2019s tough,\u201d she said. [ What\u2019s on Michelle Obama\u2019s mind? Meet the speechwriter who puts it into words. ] Aside from being mothers whose children were young when their husbands won the presidency, Obama and Trump have little in common. Trump, who is from Slovenia, is only the second first lady to be born outside the country. Though Melania Trump has evidently read up a little on the current first lady, Michelle Obama has said she never expected to become first lady and purposely did not read the memoirs of other East Wing inhabitants before she took on the role. There is likely to be another visit by Melania Trump to the White House prior to moving her family in. During the transition period, the spouse of the president-elect usually meets with White House staff to discuss a range of issues, from interior decor to nitty-gritty household details such as which kinds of soaps and deodorants their families prefer, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of two books about the White House, \u201c The Residence \u201d and \u201c First Women .\u201d [ When first ladies meet: an awkward post-election White House tradition ] Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Trump are far from the first political spouses to be tossed together following a difficult campaign. Betty Ford had no interest in meeting with Rosalynn Carter and had to be prodded to greet her. Mamie Eisenhower never offered a seat to Jackie Kennedy, who toured the house just days after giving birth. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to like each other personally, and given what has gone on, I would be surprised if Michelle Obama was chatty with Melania,\u201d Brower said. \u201cThis is pure political theater now.\u201d lifestyle ",

Aaron Schock speaks to reporters before meetings with constituents after a week in which he faced twin scandals Feb. 6, 2015, in Peoria, Illinois.</p> Close AP Photo/Seth Perlman PEORIA, Ill. -- The Illinois congressman who resigned amid scrutiny of lavish spending - including remodeling his Capitol Hill office in the style of the television series \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d - was indicted Thursday on 24 federal counts ranging from theft of government funds to filing false federal income tax returns. Rep. Aaron Schock resigns amid spending controversy The 52-page indictment alleges that Aaron Schock spent $40,000 in government funds to redecorate his Washington office, including $5,000 on a chandelier, and asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment. It also accuses him of running up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. The 35-year-old Republican from Peoria is charged with nine counts of wire fraud, five of falsification of election commission filings, six of filing false federal income tax returns, two of making false statements and one each of mail fraud and theft of government funds. A conviction on just one count of wire fraud alone carries a maximum 20 year prison sentence. \u201cMr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds,\u201d the U.S. attorney in Springfield, Jim Lewis, said in a statement announcing the indictment. Before the charges were announced, Schock\u2019s attorney, George Terwilliger, called the indictment a \u201cmisuse\u201d of prosecutorial power by the Justice Department. \u201cThis indictment will look bad, but underneath it is just made-up allegations of criminal activity arising from unintentional administrative errors,\u201d Terwilliger said in a statement. \u201cThese charges are the culmination of an effort to find something, anything, to take down Aaron Schock.\u201d Once a rising star and prodigious fundraiser for the GOP, Schock resigned in March 2015 amid intensifying scrutiny over real estate deals, extensive travel that he documented on his social media accounts and other spending documented by The Associated Press and other media outlets. The reports raised questions about improper mileage reimbursements, trips on donors\u2019 aircraft and more. The former congressman downplayed the allegations in June, saying any wrongdoing was \u201chonest mistakes.\u201d In his own statement Thursday, Schock said he never intentionally did anything wrong and that he was eager to defend his name and reputation. \u201cAs I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes - no one intended to break any law,\u201d he said. The charges are the culmination of 19-month investigation that included two grand juries that Schock said \u201cpoked, prodded, and probed every aspect of my professional, political, and personal life.\u201d \u201cLike many Americans, I wanted to have faith in the integrity of our Justice Department,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after this experience, I am forced to join millions of other Americans who have sadly concluded that our federal justice system is broken and too often driven by politics instead of facts.\u201d Schock began his career as a successful 19-year-old write-in candidate for school board and became the youngest legislator ever elected to the Illinois General Assembly at 23. In Congress, he replaced Republican Ray LaHood, who became President Obama\u2019s transportation secretary. LaHood\u2019s son, Republican Darrin LaHood, took Schock\u2019s congressional seat after a special election in September 2015, following Schock\u2019s resignation. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Sanders Doesn't Rule Out 2020 White House Run By ken thomas and lisa lerer, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Nov 10, 2016, 3:29 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this Nov. 3, 2016, photo, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., campaigns for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the University of Cincinnati. President Barack Obama hands over the White House to Republican Donald Trump in 71 days, leaving the Democratic Party leaderless and with few up-and-coming stars among its aging cast of stalwarts. The defeat of Clinton, an experienced Washington politician who sought common ground with Republicans, could make it more likely that the party will turn to its liberal wing as it grapples with its future. That\u2019s best represented by Sanders, whom Clinton defeated in a long primary, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a pull-no-punches progressive darling. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) 0 Shares Email Bernie Sanders is leaving open the possibility of another presidential bid as shell-shocked liberals focus on helping the Democratic Party rebuild after Donald Trump's victory. \"Four years is a long time from now,\" said the 75-year-old Vermont independent, noting that he faces re-election to the Senate in 2018. But he added: \"We'll take one thing at a time, but I'm not ruling out anything.\" Democrats have begun postelection soul searching, with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., urging the party to embrace a more populist economic message. As some Democrats protested across the country, the party's liberal wing began jockeying for power, arguing that Clinton's loss could be attributed to her reluctance to fully focus on economic inequality and tougher Wall Street regulations. \"The final results may have divided us \u2014 but the entire electorate embraced deep, fundamental reform of our economic system and our political system,\" Warren told the AFL-CIO on Thursday. \"Working families across this country are deeply frustrated about an economy and a government that doesn't work for them.\" Warren laid out the principles she believes should govern Democrats during the Trump era: Standing up to bigotry, pushing for economic equality and combatting the influence of Wall Street. \"We will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans \u2014 on anyone. Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House , we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever,\" she said. The sweeping Republican gains have thrown the future of the party into uncertainty, as Democrats process the scale of their losses and try to figure out the best way to come back in the 2018 elections. The Democratic National Committee may end up being ground zero for the fight, with no clear successor in line to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile. Sanders is backing Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Warren and Sanders were articulating the frustrations among many liberals in the aftermath of Trump's stunning triumph over Hillary Clinton . But their influence underscores another problem facing Democrats: Many of the party's leading voices are senior citizens, older than their core constituencies of young and minority voters. Warren is 67. Sanders said that millions of working-class voters' decision to back Trump was \"an embarrassment\" to the party and Democrats must take a strong stand against the role of corporate interests in politics. He said the party as a whole was unable to make a strong enough case to struggling workers, particularly in the industrial Midwest, who sided with Trump. \"You cannot be a party which, on one hand, says we're in favor of working people, we're in favor of the needs of young people, but we don't quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class. People do not believe that. You've got to decide which side you're on.\" While Clinton pushed for greater financial regulation and higher taxes on the wealthy, she shied away from his more populist rhetoric. And she also largely ignored white working-class male voters in favor of trying to boost turnout among minority and female supporters. The decision infuriated former President Bill Clinton who argued to campaign officials that they should pay greater attention to the voters who twice boosted her husband to office. During the long primary slog against Sanders, he insisted the campaign make stops in Wisconsin, which ended up being the last time either Clinton appeared in the state. Wisconsin voted for Trump, shocking many in her campaign. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Ken Thomas on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "OBAMA, TRUMP DISCUSS TRANSITION OF POWER The differences are even more stark when it comes to advertising.\u00a0 The Clinton campaign and its allies accounted for about 75 percent of all TV ads aired during the general election in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to data from the Center for Public Integrity provided to Time . Yet Trump won all four of those swing states, beating Clinton by a combined 820,518 votes. Romney unleashed $156.8 million in advertisements against President Obama's $241.5 million in ads last cycle, Politico reported. Clinton spent $211.4 million on ads in the 2016 general election. But Trump needed to spend just $74 million in ad dollars to capture the 279 electoral votes that assured his victory on Tuesday, with three states yet to be called. Not only did Clinton\u2019s monetary advantage fail to win her an Electoral College victory, it also didn\u2019t help turn out Democratic voters in the same numbers as the two previous presidential elections. With less money spent, Trump captured about the same number of total votes as Romney in 2012 \u2013 just fewer than 60 million (though 2016\u2019s tally hasn\u2019t been completely counted). Clinton was leading Trump in the popular vote total by about 200,000 votes as of Thursday morning. But that total badly trails the numbers put up by President Obama in 2008 (69.4 million) and 2012 (65.9 million), despite a comparable amount raised and spent on ads. In the final analysis, the man who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d ended up with a great one. Trump spent about $13.29 per individual vote and $2.8 million per Electoral College vote. Clinton spent about $21.63 per individual vote and $5.7 million per Electoral College vote. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Credit Carl Richards A big life change does not come easily. That might seem a bit obvious, because if it were easy, chances are you would have made the big life change that\u2019s on your list of changes you would really like to make. But you haven\u2019t. So my question for you is this: Why not? What\u2019s stopping you from just doing it? It might be money, family obligations, fear or just feeling stuck. If you\u2019re at all like me, you see people doing something transformative, like going to medical school at 45, because they couldn\u2019t imagine being an accountant for 20 more years. It seems magical, like one day they just decided to make it happen. For some people (a tiny few, I suspect), it might work that way. I have found, however, that most of the time, it\u2019s much less magical. In truth, it\u2019s a slog. It takes years of thinking and planning. But after plenty of practice, I think I\u2019ve figured out how to streamline things a bit. You may want to try it yourself. First, embrace the uncertainty of life. As much as we don\u2019t like to admit it, life is uncertain . We never know exactly where it will take us. If you doubt me, go back 10 years and ask yourself where you thought you\u2019d be now. I doubt it looks exactly like you planned. So start by being O.K. with the truth in the old saying, \u201cPeople make plans, and God laughs.\u201d What\u2019s Stopping You From Making the Big Change? The Sketch Guy, on clearing obstacles in the way of transitions that we ought to consider more deeply. Second, be open to possibilities. Many times, we know we want to do something, but we don\u2019t know what \u201cit\u201d is. Explore a bit. Brainstorm. Journal. Allow things to come up and be open to new ideas. Then, once you settle on something, it\u2019s time to plan a bit. At this point, obstacles start to show up, particularly around money. My family first explored the idea of spending a year living outside the United States more than a decade ago. At the time, there were a bunch of reasons it didn\u2019t make sense. Money was just one of them, but it was a big obstacle. Advertisement Continue reading the main story So we kept weighing options. For you, it might be as simple as setting aside an hour a week to consider ways to move forward. Ask people who have done the thing you want to do. Use a little of that time you spend on social media for research instead. Little by little, a plan might emerge. If it doesn\u2019t, maybe it\u2019s not time, or it\u2019s not the right plan. As you reach different obstacles, make sure you spend time questioning your assumptions. Maybe something you always considered true is nothing more than someone else\u2019s opinion. Or maybe looking at it from a slightly different angle will produce a different result. Finally, as paths open, head down them. Don\u2019t worry if you experience false starts. I can tell you there will be plenty of those, and you may only need a quick course correction. Almost all of the stories readers shared with me about doing life-altering things involved changing plans, disappointment and lots of hard work. But almost all said that in the end, it was worth it. And one last thing. As you explore making big changes, please realize that maybe nothing needs to change. Sometimes, the permission we seek is to embrace what we have and accept that it brings us real happiness. It\u2019s important to understand that there is nothing wrong with choosing not to change if that\u2019s the right answer for you. Carl Richards, a certified financial planner, is the author of \u201cThe Behavior Gap\u201d and \u201cThe One-Page Financial Plan.\u201d His sketches and essays appear weekly. ",

    "text": "Students Chant 'Build the Wall' at Middle School Cafeteria the Day After the Election By JULIA JACOBO Nov 10, 2016, 5:58 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Middle School Students Chant 'Build the Wall' at Lunch 0 Shares Email Middle school students in a Detroit suburb chanted \"build the wall\" during lunchtime on Wednesday, hours after Donald Trump became president-elect of the United States, according to school officials. The incident in Royal Oak, Michigan, was caught on cellphone video by a student sitting in the cafeteria as the chants rang out. By the time the video starts, the chants begin to fade, according to the mother of the student who recorded the video, but the seventh-grade students can still be heard saying \"build the wall.\" The mother of the student who recorded the video told ABC News that racially motivated bullying has been getting progressively worse at the school and that her daughter felt she needed to document it. The chant continued on in the school gym after school was let out, according to the mother, who wished to remain anonymous. The eight-second video circulated rapidly through social media after it was posted Wednesday and has been viewed more than 4 million times. Anti-Trump and Nazi Graffiti Appear on Structures Across US Amid Protests Royal Oak Middle School Principal Todd Noonan addressed the incident in a video statement recorded by the school production team, telling students that their teachers and families \"push\" them to \"be open-minded to the beliefs and views of others.\" \"Yesterday, there was an incident during seventh-grade lunch that caused your classmates, and many of your community members in Royal Oak and beyond, to feel alienated and unwelcomed,\" Noonan said. \"This is unacceptable.\" Noonan told his students that the chanting \"made people feel unsafe\" and that the incident was not reflective of who they are. \"Everyone is welcome in our community of learners,\" Noonan said. \"We build bridges. We work together. We push each other. We help each other. This is who we are.\" Noonan then invited school staff to attend lunch and \"engage in meaningful dialogue\" with the students, whom he called \"awesome.\" \"You belong here, and you are safe here,\" Noonan said. In a statement, the school district called the incident \"brief\" and said school personnel in the cafeteria responded immediately. \"We are committed to providing a safe, secure, and supportive learning environment for all students,\" said Shawn Lewis-Lakin, superintendent of Royal Oak Schools. \"We are working with our students to help them understand the impact of their words and actions on others in their school community. Our school district and each building in it works every day to be a welcoming community for all, inclusive and caring, where all students know they are valued, safe and supported.\" Families have expressed concern for students' safety in the wake of the video's release, Lewis-Lakin said, noting that the school district is working with law enforcement to respond to any and all threats that are made toward the students or schools. \"In responding to this incident -- indeed in responding to this election \u2013- we need to hear each other\u2019s stories, not slogans, we need to work towards understanding, not scoring points, and we need to find a way to move forward that respects and values each and every member of our community,\" Lewis-Lakin said. The school and the school district did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for further comment. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH American Democrats in Israel React to Trump's Strong Showing 0 Shares Email As Melania Trump said of her husband in her second and final campaign speech: \"He certainly knows how to shake things up, doesn't he?\" President-elect Donald Trump 's potential to \"shake things up\" on a global scale is endless. And if he sticks to his campaign rhetoric (and that's a big if) nowhere could that be more true than in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In one of his first campaign speeches that relied on the use of a teleprompter, candidate Donald Trump described himself to gathering of Israel's largest lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), as a \u201clifelong supporter and true friend of Israel.\u201d Women Accusing Trump Won't Be Intimidated After Election, Lawyer Says He derided President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, saying it made Israel less safe, and promised a Trump administration would dismantle that deal and protect Israel from Iranian aggression. Trump said he would veto any resolution aimed at an agreement between Israel and Palestine proposed by the United Nations Security Council and said the entire U.N. is \"not a friend of democracy\" and \"surely is not a friend to Israel.\" He also described President Obama as possibly the \"worst thing to ever happen to Israel.\" So, we know what's bad in his mind. So what's good, and how might he \"shake things up\"? For starters, he said he would move the United States embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he called \"the eternal capital of the Jewish people.\" But U.S. administrations from both parties have recognized Jerusalem as a disputed area with the Palestinians, and have said that the status of Jerusalem should be resolved in negotiations between the two. In turn, most foreign nations keep their embassies in nearby Tel Aviv. As for any agreement on a two-state solution, a top adviser to Trump said today that the president-elect doesn't think Israeli settlements (new construction on occupied territory) will impede the peace process. In an interview with Israel's Army Radio, Jason's Greenblatt, co-chairman of the Trump campaign\u2019s Israel Advisory Committee, said: \u201cIt is certainly not Mr. Trump\u2019s view that settlement activities should be condemned and that it is an obstacle for peace, because it is not an obstacle for peace.\u201d Those remarks stand in stark contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy that Israeli development on land captured in the 1967 war makes a peace agreement with the Palestinians far less achievable. He has been tapped as a chief Israel adviser to Trump. Just last month the Obama administration said it \"strongly condemned\" new Israeli plans to build a new Jewish settlement in the West Bank and that such action undermine the ability to achieve a two-state solution. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said at the time that it was \"deeply troubling\" that Israel would make this decision just after it had reached an agreement with Washington on the largest military aid package to Israel in history, a $38 billion 10-year deal. Ultimately, it's unknown whether Trump's campaign rhetoric will shift to actual policy. Even candidate Obama told AIPAC in 2008 that Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel. But in September, his office was forced to make an embarrassing correction to a public transcript that mistakenly identified Jerusalem as part of Israel. 0 Shares ",

Florida International tight end Jonnu Smith, front right, runs as Middle Tennessee safety Jovante Moffatt, left, defends during the first half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Oct. 29, 2016, in Miami. Lynne Sladky, AP In a fit of anger, Mary Gaspar, Jonnu Smith\u2019s 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend, allegedly admitted to police she poured a pot of boiling water onto Smith for not paying enough attention to her. She said the two had been arguing all day and while \u201cfeeling extremely emotional and stressed,\u201d she boiled the water and attacked him in his dorm. Smith is a prospect in next year\u2019s NFL Draft but his skills and career may now have been jeopardized. He reportedly suffered burns to his head, neck, back, shoulder and arm. According to the arrest report, when Smith still didn\u2019t show a reaction to the boiling water, Gaspar began hitting him with her open hands. He was taken to Kendall Regional Medical Center. Smith is projected as a late round pick or undrafted free agent, CBS News partner The Miami Herald reports. Gaspar is charged with aggravated battery and is on pre-trial release. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Jay Cutler happy with Donald Trump's victory Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. Jay Cutler is happy Donald Trump won the presidential election. The Bears quarterback spoke with reporters Thursday for eight minutes about football and his team. Then he was asked about Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. He broke into a smile. \"I'm happy with the results,\" said Cutler, a native of Santa Claus, Ind. \"I've supported Trump for a while. I'm not going to dive into it. I know it's a sensitive issue, but I like where it's going.\" The identity of Cutler's preferred presidential candidate was much less surprising than his willingness to share it, given that most NFL players and coaches have an aversion to so-called distractions while preparing for the next game. There's the also the matter of how Cutler's outspoken preference on such a divisive issue might be received by teammates. He is, after all, the quarterback, a co-captain and the Bears' longest-tenured player. The election of Donald Trump as president spurred protests in spots around the country and, for some athletes in the NBA and NFL , it was a sobering development they struggled to accept and understand. NBA players, such as David West , and coaches Doc Rivers , Steve Kerr and Stan Van Gundy , were outwardly... The election of Donald Trump as president spurred protests in spots around the country and, for some athletes in the NBA and NFL , it was a sobering development they struggled to accept and understand. NBA players, such as David West , and coaches Doc Rivers , Steve Kerr and Stan Van Gundy , were outwardly... (Cindy Boren, Kelyn Soong) \"If my opinion is different from his or not, I've just got to respect everybody,\" linebacker Jerrell Freeman said. \"Everybody has that right.\" Tight end Zach Miller joked he wrote in Cutler for president on his ballot. \"As you know, families don't always get along,\" Miller said. \"That's just how we are. Brothers fight. But at the end of the day I think we all get along and love each other through football.\" Right guard Kyle Long jokingly gasped, \"Oh, my gosh!\" when a reporter informed him of Cutler's revelation. \"With our system that's in place, I think \u2014 and I'm hoping \u2014 that checks and balances and everything will work out the way it was drawn out to do so,\" Long said. \"And hopefully we can get together. That's the big thing. Love one another.\" Long pointed out how the Bears locker room \u2014 full of dozens of players from varied backgrounds, different areas of this country and others, and a few different races \u2014 exposes each player to differences between them. \"You get an understanding and appreciation and respect for the things certain people have to go through for whatever reason, right or wrong,\" Long said. \"And it gives you a little bit of perspective. It makes you understand how little acts of kindness, little acts of just going out of your way to be nice to somebody can go a long way.\" As for Trump's victory, no other player shared a reaction as Cutler did. \"Whoever is in office, we've got to hope they do great because they're representing everybody here,\" Freeman said. \"Regardless of who won, we can't wish bad on them. We'd be wishing bad on ourselves.\" Added Miller: \"Whoever is leading our country, we need to come together as people and just do better. We've got a guy leading our country right now who nobody knows what's going to happen. Hopefully he surrounds himself with people to move forward as a united country.\" Long and left guard Josh Sitton fully participated in practice. The Bears' two Pro Bowl guards were limited Wednesday, but Long (triceps/left shoulder) and Sitton (right ankle) progressed Thursday. Long said he's feeling \"really good,\" but he'll have to continue to fighting through pain. \"It's going to be something I'm dealing with until I get it taken care of,\" he said. Running back Ka'Deem Carey (illness) returned to practice and fully participated. ",

John Kasich speaks at the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum on July 19, 2016, in Cleveland, during the second day of the Republican convention. 0 Shares Email Ohio Gov. John Kasich called protests against President-elect Donald Trump \"unfortunate\" and said that the country should respect the will of voters. \"I would never try and tell them get off the streets or anything like that, but we need to be together,\" Kasich told ABC News' chief White House correspondent Jon Karl in an interview. \"The people of this country have spoken.\" \"There was concern about what would happen if the race was close and would people say it wasn't fair,\" he continued. \"Look it was fair. There's nobody saying it wasn't fair. So now all of us take a deep breath. Now, all Americans take a deep breath.\" Kasich made waves following the GOP presidential primary for breaking the Republican National Committee pledge by not supporting Trump. But now that the billionaire businessman is president-elect, Kasich says Americans of all political stripes should \"give him a chance.\" Inside John Kasich's Last-Minute Decision to Drop Out of the 2016 Race \"Give him a chance and there'll be places where I agree with him and where I disagree with him, but that doesn't lead to any disrespect,\" Kasich said. \"That's one of the things that's really important.\" Kasich, who opted to vote for Arizona Sen.

If they call and want my advice or they want me to help them in some way. Just like when President Obama called on trade, you know. I disagree with the president most of the time, but if there's issues where I can help, where I can do something -- maybe even bridge some bipartisan feelings -- I'm more than willing to do that, but I don't expect to be in the administration.\" Kasich, in attendance at today\u2019s White House ceremony honoring the 2015-16 NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers, said he spent a few minutes with President Obama and had a \"good conversation\" but they did not discuss the president\u2019s meeting with Trump. \"We have a new president, and it' an exciting time to have a new president,\" he said. \"We've got to put any of our differences aside and we've got to give him support.\" \"We can't have a country that's constantly fighting with one another,\" Kasich added. \"Let's all say our prayers, let's wish him support and wish him the best for all of our people, for our kids.\" 0 Shares ",

On Tuesday, voters approved Measure JJJ, which imposes new affordable housing requirements on L.A. developments. An apartment project under construction in downtown Los Angeles this year. On Tuesday, voters approved Measure JJJ, which imposes new affordable housing requirements on L.A. developments. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Andrew Khouri Contact Reporter Amid a Los Angeles building boom, voters this week overwhelmingly approved new labor and affordable-housing requirements for developers, who have warned the\u00a0rules could be costly and crimp construction. Measure JJJ, which passed with nearly 64% of the vote, requires developers to pay higher wages and build below-market rate units if they get exemptions from key planning rules \u2014 a common occurrence in Los Angeles, where the city's zoning is considered outdated. The measure was pitched by advocates as a way to add more affordable housing in an already expensive city where many new apartment and condo projects are aimed at the luxury end of the market. But opponents, led by development interests, argued the proposed regulations, however well-meaning, would have the unintended consequence of reducing housing production and worsening the affordability crisis. In particular, they raised concerns over the effect on small developments, because those projects often don\u2019t command the higher return of larger ones, which often already use more expensive union labor. Al Leibovic is one of those developers and builds small apartment buildings in the San Fernando Valley. He previously told The Times that if the measure passed he wouldn\u2019t build projects with fewer than 25 units that required exemptions \u2014 which many do. But after further running the numbers with his development team, he\u2019s now worried about larger projects as well.\u00a0 \u201cThis is pretty devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really throws all of our plans to construct an additional 700 units in the city of L.A. into question.\u201d Olson Co., a larger Seal Beach-based home builder with projects across Southern California, has a more positive outlook. Chief Executive Scott Laurie said his company \u201cwants to be in Los Angeles\u201d and will try to make projects work despite the new requirements.\u00a0 Still, he\u2019s worried many projects might not be financially viable if land prices continue to rise as they have during this development boom. \u201cWe will be in Los Angeles as long as we get a return,\u201d said Laurie, who is building a 29 town home project in Highland Park. \u201cIf the land price doesn\u2019t change, I don\u2019t think you will make it.\u201d See how every neighborhood voted in the 2016 election Open link Backers of the measure disputed that construction would decline and indeed argued that the development restrictions would drive land prices down, allowing developers like Laurie to afford the new rules. But even if land values declined, it isn\u2019t clear that construction could continue at the same pace. Kevin Farrell, chief operating officer of Century West Partners, which is building about 1,000 apartment units in Los Angeles, said that many landowners are selling only because property prices are up. \u201cIf a guy thought his land was worth $10 million and now it\u2019s worth $6 million, they are not going to say sure $6 million. They will say screw it and will wait,\u201d he said. The measure applies to projects with 10 units or more for which developers seek a zoning change, general plan amendment or height-district change \u2014 essentially to build more units than allowed or to build them where they currently can't be located, such as a parking lot or industrial neighborhood. Developers of those projects would then have to include a certain number of below-market units in their buildings, hire some local workers and pay wages set by a city agency, which developers worry will be equivalent to what is required for public projects. Farrell said his company hasn\u2019t sought the types of exemptions targeted by JJJ\u00a0but had\u00a0looked at doing projects that required them prior to the election.\u00a0\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t now,\u201d he said. Supporters of the measure, which included an alliance of labor, tenant and housing advocacy groups, disputed construction will fall. \u201cNow the city\u2019s majority \u2014 \u00a0working Angelenos who have been anxious for solutions to the crippling housing crisis facing our city \u2014 \u00a0raised their voices in support of good housing and jobs policy,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Laura Raymond of the Alliance for Community Transit \u2013 Los Angeles. \u201cThis will mean thousands of families will have access to safe, stable homes and good, local jobs.\u201d Beyond the dispute over the measure\u2019s effect on construction, other uncertainty exists as well. It includes just how many projects submitted prior to Tuesday will not be subject to the new rules and grandfathered in. For months, companies have rushed to file proposals with the city, fearful over JJJ, as well as an upcoming March ballot measure that would temporarily bar the same sort of projects affected by JJJ. Edward J. Casey, chairman\u00a0of the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce\u2019s land-use committee, said projects whose applications are already deemed complete \u2014 even if they are not yet approved \u2014 should be exempt from the new rules. But what exactly makes an application complete is an \u201cevolving area of the law,\u201d the land-use attorney said. \u201cThat will probably be one of the first court fights,\u201d Casey said. Ken Bernstein, a principal city planner, said the planning department is working with the city attorney to decide which projects would be grandfathered in.

    "text": "Trump meets with Obama at White House in symbolic start to transition of power President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Tribune news services Contact Reporter President-elect Donald Trump took a triumphant tour of the nation's capital Thursday, holding a cordial White House meeting with President Barack Obama, sketching out priorities with Republican congressional leaders and taking in the majestic view from where he'll be sworn in to office. Trump's meeting with Obama spanned 90 minutes, longer than originally scheduled. Obama said he was \"encouraged\" by Trump's willingness to work with his team during the transition of power, and the Republican called the president a \"very good man.\" \"I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including his counsel,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. He'll begin occupying the office on Jan. 20. While Trump noted that he and Obama had never met before, their political histories will forever be linked. Trump spent years perpetrating the lie that Obama was born outside the United States. The president campaigned aggressively against Trump during the 2016 campaign, warning that his election would put the republic at risk. Click and drag within the image to explore a 360-degree view of President Barack Obama meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 10, 2016. (Jim Watson / AFP) But at least publicly, the two men appeared to put aside their animosity. As the meeting concluded and journalists scrambled out of the Oval Office, Obama smiled at his successor and explained the unfolding scene. \"We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed the country succeeds,\" Obama said. From the White House, Trump headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to discuss the GOP legislative agenda. Ryan, who holds the most powerful post in Congress, was a sometime critic of Trump and never campaigned with the nominee. Emerging from the meetings, Trump sketched out priorities for his presidency. \"We're going to move very strongly on immigration,\" he said. \"We will move very strongly on health care. And we're looking at jobs. Big league jobs.\" (Tribune news services) Ryan took Trump on a tour of the Speaker's Balcony overlooking the National Mall, the scene of Trump's upcoming inauguration. The view, Trump said, was \"really, really beautiful.\" Trump was also beginning the process of putting together his White House team. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who worked his way into Trump's inner circle during the election, and top campaign official Kellyanne Conway were emerging as possible picks for White House chief of staff, according to two people familiar with the transition planning. A third person said conservative media executive Steve Bannon was also in the mix, though others insisted Bannon would not have a White House role. Those involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days. First lady Michelle Obama met privately in the White House residence with Trump's wife, Melania, while Vice President Joe Biden saw Vice President-elect Mike Pence late Thursday. Trump's team was said to be sketching a robust role for Pence, an experienced Washington hand, that would include both domestic and foreign policy responsibilities. President Barack Obama met with President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 10, 2016, at the White House. Obama and Trump met alone, with no staff present, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters following the discussion. \"The two men did not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office,\" Earnest said. \"We're on to the next phase.\" Trump traveled to Washington from New York on his private jet, breaking with protocol by not bringing journalists in his motorcade or on his plane to document his historic visit to the White House. Trump was harshly critical of the media during his campaign and for a time banned news organizations whose coverage he disliked from his events. At the White House, Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough was seen walking along the South Lawn driveway with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. A handful of Trump aides trailed them. 2009: Oval Office of the White House J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press President George W.

Bush, from left, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter\u00a0on Jan. 7, 2009, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.\u00a0 (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) The show of civility at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue contrasted with postelection scenes of protests across a politically divided country. Demonstrators from New England to the heartland and the West Coast vented against the election winner on Wednesday, chanting \"Not my president,\" burning a papier-mache Trump head, beating a Trump pinata and carrying signs that said \"Impeach Trump.\" More than 100 protesters held a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House. The mostly student protesters held signs saying \"Love Trumps Hate,\" a phrase Democrat Hillary Clinton often used during the campaign. Trump's advisers, many of whom were stunned by his unexpected victory, plunged into the huge task of staffing government agencies. A transition website, GreatAgain.gov, referenced 4,000 political appointee openings. Officials at the Pentagon and State Department said they had not yet been contacted. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency stood ready \"to work with the incoming team once that team is designated and arrives here. But we don't have any firm word as to when that will be.\" As president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same daily intelligence briefing as Obama \u2014 including information on U.S. covert operations, information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by America's 17 intelligence agencies. The White House said it would organize two exercises involving multiple agencies to help Trump's team learn how to respond to major domestic incidents. Associated Press ",

    "text": "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents have voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use in their state . Maine joins California, Nevada and Massachusetts, which passed similar measures this year. Arizona rejected a similar measure. Recreational marijuana was already legal in Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. The final results on the referendum were tabulated on Thursday. The count took nearly two days because of how close the race was, within a fraction of a percentage point, and The Associated Press made the call Thursday afternoon. Supporters had already declared themselves the winners and had predicted home cultivation of marijuana would be legal by around Christmas. \u201cThe Maine people have passed it, and we should work on implementing it,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey, of Auburn, who supported the ballot issue. More states vote to allow recreational marijuana Medical marijuana was already legal in Maine. People 21 or older will now be allowed to use up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana, and retail marijuana shops and social clubs could open around the state. Some municipalities have balked at allowing such businesses to open in their communities. Opponents have vowed to request a recount. \u201cWe\u2019re standing firm,\u201d said Scott Gagnon, an organizer of a campaign against legalization. Pending the recount, Maine joins California, Nevada and Massachusetts, which passed similar measures this year. Arizona rejected a similar measure. Recreational marijuana was already legal in Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. In Maine, the proposal allows people to cultivate, distribute and sell marijuana and marijuana products. Marijuana is set to be taxed at 10 percent and subject to local restrictions. Parents\u2019 groups and some law enforcement organizations opposed the proposal. The proposal also received scrutiny from members of the medical marijuana community, who say they fear it could replace the state\u2019s medical program. The secretary of state\u2019s office said Thursday that the largest bloc of uncounted votes that remained were from more than 4,000 overseas absentee voters. Those were counted and failed to make the difference for those who opposed legalization. \u00a9 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Nov 10, 2016 4:14 PM EST Investors who initially turned bearish at the idea of Donald Trump occupying the White House are rediscovering their bullish streak.\u00a0 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high on Thursday, shooting up 218 points, or 1.2, percent to end at 18,218. That topped the Big Board\u2019s last record-high on August 15, when it closed at 18,636 points.\u00a0 Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher in afternoon trading Thursday. Consumer-focused companies, utilities and technology stocks were among the biggest decliners. The market was coming off a big rally following the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Financial markets are rising on speculation that the Trump administration, backed by the Republican-controlled Congress, will ramp up public spending, as well as cut personal and corporate taxes, as he pledged during the presidential campaign.\u00a0 Investors think Trump \u201cwill have more success in implementing his domestic policy agenda in light of the Republicans\u2019 retention of Congress,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note.\u00a0 How Trump victory impacted the stock markets The upcoming Trump presidency, which will commence on Jan. 20, triggered a strong rally on Wednesday that extended somewhat into trading Thursday. Traders were focusing on Trump\u2019s promises to boost U.S. economic growth through infrastructure spending and by cutting red tape, rather than uncertainties such as what he might do with trade agreements. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index added 4 points to close at 2,167. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,209. Before the election, markets had been worried about a Trump presidency because his campaign promises carried few policy details, making him an unknown quantity compared with rival Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe had a gangbuster day yesterday; call it a Trump rally,\u201d said Doug Cote, chief market strategist for Voya Investment Management. \u201cToday we\u2019re having a little breather, a little rest, but the key thing that will also keep the market going is the S&P 500 corporate earnings for the third quarter are positive for the first time in six quarters.\u201d Banks and other financial companies got a boost amid speculation that a Trump presidency could result in higher interest rates and less government regulation. JPMorgan Chase climbed $2.78, or 3.8 percent, to $76.03. Goldman Sachs rose $6.75, or 3.5 percent, to $199.38. Wells Fargo gained $3.01, or 6.3 percent, to $51, while Discover Financial Services added $3.03, or 5 percent, to $63.32. Demonstrators across U.S. protest against President-elect Trump Bond prices continued to fall, sending yields higher. Bond investors expect that Trump\u2019s plans to increase spending on infrastructure while also lowering taxes will lead to stronger economic growth and possibly inflation, both of which are bad for bonds.\u00a0 Benchmark U.S. crude was down 50 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $44.77 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 39 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $45.97 a barrel in London. The dollar has been fairly solid since Trump\u2019s victory. The U.S. currency rose to 106.66 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday. The euro was down to $1.0892 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar now buys 20.50 pesos, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump\u2019s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country\u2019s economy. \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Trump said he looked forward to working with Obama in the future and would seek his counsel.

President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House Nov. 10, 2016. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP The private White House meeting had the potential to be awkward after the two men sniped at each other throughout the bitter presidential campaign. Trump, a businessman and central figure in the so-called \"birther\" movement, spent years railing against Obama and challenging the legitimacy of his 2008 election. Obama, who campaigned heartily for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, repeatedly slammed Trump as unfit for office. Before their meeting, the two men had virtually no personal contact. They were in the same room at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association dinner \u2014 the night Obama pilloried Trump in a scathing comedy routine . As Obama huddled with Trump for their closed-door meeting, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough strolled along the South Lawn with Trump's son-in-law and confidant, Jared Kushner. Trump's wife, Melania, was also at the White House to meet with first lady Michelle Obama. \"We had an excellent conversation with her as well,\" the president told reporters of Melania Trump.

    "text": "\u00a0 If you voted for Donald Trump, you may not feel welcomed at Grubhub. The CEO of Grubhub, an online food delivery service, sent a company wide email Wednesday suggesting employees who agree with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s behaviors and his campaign rhetoric should resign. \u201cIf you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here,\u201d wrote Matt Maloney, Co-Founder of Grubhub. \u201cWe do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team.\" Related Image Expand / Contract Maloney, a Hillary Clinton supporter, sent the email Wednesday afternoon with the subject line, \u201cSo\u2026that happened\u2026what\u2019s next?\u201d He made it clear in the email statement that he is personally stunned and deeply concerned with the results of Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cI absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can,\u201d Maloney wrote about Trump\u2019s supporters. \u00a0 Related Image Expand / Contract Maloney stands by the email, which he said many of his employees appreciated. \u201cI want to reaffirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States.\u201d The CEO made it clear he\u2019s particularly concerned Trump\u2019s victory will empower others in his workplace to act out against marginalized groups. \u201cWhile demeaning, insulting, and ridiculing minorities, immigrants, and the physically/mentally disabled worked for Mr. Trump, I want to be clear that this behavior -- and these views -- have no place at Grubhub,\u201d Maloney explained. Adding, if it were up to him, Trump would have been fired a long time ago. \"Had he worked here, many of his comments would have resulted in his immediate termination.\u201d Maloney tells Fox News that \u00a0\"almost 20 percent\u201d of his employees have personally thanked him for the note. \u201cI am not embarrassed by it,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The CEO said that he deeply respects the right of people to vote for whoever they decide, but that he simply wanted to \u201creassure our employees that our company will actively support diversity and inclusion -- regardless of national politics.\u201d This letter is noteworthy because it underscores the fine-line between the intersection of politics and business, especially given the divisive presidential campaign of the past year and a half. Bruce Tulgan, Author of \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be the Boss,\u201d calls the letter \u201cextraordinary\u201d because while a CEO has a right to build the kind of \u00a0corporate culture he or she wants -- Tulgan advises business leaders to stay away from politics. \u201cMuch of that message could have been communicated without making direct reference to the election,\u201d Tulgan said of Maloney\u2019s email. \"Anytime you are talking about things that are not work at work you\u2019re risking potentially alienating people, making people feel uncomfortable or un-welcomed at work.\" Mark Horstman, co-founder of Manager Tools, says if he were advising Mr. Maloney -- he would have recommended he not send the note particularly because he's the CEO of a public company. \"That note could be construed by his employees that someone who voted for Trump could be fired,\" said Horstman, who suspects other CEOs have sent similar notes. \"It has a chilling effect on people's perception of their rights.\" While Maloney seemingly calls out Trump supporters at his company on the one hand, the young CEO boasted about the company\u2019s supportive and inclusive culture on the other, saying he \u201cfirmly believes that we must bring together different perspectives.\u201d\u00a0 Evoking Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan, Maloney says we are \u201cstronger together,\u201d and he ends his letter to his employees by echoing Clinton\u2019s concession speech, saying Trump\u2019s administration deserves our open minds and a chance to lead. He ends the letter imploring his employees to \u201cstay strong.\" Bryan Llenas currently serves as a New York-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) and a reporter for Fox News Latino (FNL).

Forty-six years later, she is married to the next leader of the free world and the rural Slovenian town of Sevnica is embracing the success of its most famous citizen. Melania Trump's childhood friend Mirjana Jelancic. Carlo Angerer / NBC News \"I feel very happy for her,\" Mirjana Jelancic, a childhood friend of Melania who is now principal at the local school, told NBC News on Thursday. Residents are stunned that Melania will move into the White House, becoming only the second first lady not born in the United States. Jelancic hopes that Melania will soon make an official visit to her birthplace, where 5,000 people are overlooked by smokestacks, church towers and a historic hilltop castle. Sevnica has striking similarities to the American Rust Belt communities where working-class voters helped carry her husband to victory. In the past two decades, many of its plants have shut down, including the Jutranka clothing factory where Melania's mother once worked. Locals say her father sold car parts in a parking lot. Sevnica, the Slovenia town where Melania Trump was born. Darko Bandic / AP Both her parents now spend most of their time near their daughter in New York, but they still own a house in Sevnica. Today, the town's largest factory produces lingerie. Srecko Ocvirk, the town's mayor, told NBC News that factories have recently become competitive on the global marketplace again and unemployment has fallen below 10 percent. He hopes that Melania Trump's new role will provide a further boost. Barron Trump and his mother Melania Trump stand on stage after Donald Trump delivered his acceptance speech in New York early Wednesday. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images The town's businesses are already trying to capitalize on the new-found fame. A restaurant already introduced a dessert in Melania's honor and a coffee shop is now serving a \"Melanija cake,\" white like her clothes on Election Night and topped by a golden-colored white-chocolate leaf. Born Melanija Knavs, Melania Trump used her modeling career to escape rural Slovenia \u2014 first to European fashion centers such as Paris or Milan, then to New York where she met Donald Trump in 1998 during a party. They were married at a lavish wedding in 2005. Nusha Vidmar, who owns Caffe Central, a local bar near the railway station, said the prospect of a Slovenian first lady was encouraging for the town as it emerged from a period of high unemployment. Local cafe owner Nusha Vidmar with a cake inspired and named after Melania Trump. Carlo Angerer / NBC News \"She was one of us \u2026 this is very huge success for one of us, and also for Sevnica, and Slovenia,\" she said. \"I was very proud of her, of her success. For such success you don't need only luck, you must have courage.\" The cafe held an election party Wednesday morning as the results came in and locals streamed in during the day. A poster advertising the election party still hangs on the walls of the bar. It asked: \"Will Melanija succeed?\" \u2014 using the original Slovenian spelling of her name. The country's government and its tourism agency are fully embracing the election victory. #Slovenia welcomes Slovenian-born @MELANIATRUMP as she becomes the First Lady of the United States of America. #ifeelslovenia pic.twitter.com/tbW3wB8NLL \u2014 Slovenia Tourism (@tourism_slo) November 9, 2016 In a statement congratulating Donald Trump, Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said: \"Due to the origin of first lady Melania Trump, the newly elected president will now be even more aware of developments in Slovenia, which he is probably already very familiar with.\" Vidmar, the cafe owner, said Melania Trump's success could help build national identity in Slovenia, whose two million citizens gained independence from Yugoslavia during the 1991 collapse of communism. \"Maybe that one of us is so successful ... will help the nation, all people in our country,\" Vidmar said. \"We're a very small country, and we're an even smaller town in a small country,\" she added. \"In America, do you know where Slovenia is? Now, you maybe will find it on a map!\" A map showing the location of Sevnica, Slovenia. Google Maps Diana Kosar said she was woken up Wednesday morning by friends with the news that her childhood friend would soon move to Washington, D.C. \"I was all the time silently voting for her,\" she said. \"It was her race, too, so I'm very glad she did it.\" Kosar added: \"I think America just got the perfect first lady. You know, Melania has this gracious, gentle character and she's beautiful. To go out of Sevnica that was her dream and I'm very glad she did it. She went out in the world and she succeeded.\" Carlo Angerer ",

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt Email WikiLeaks became a focal point of the 2016 presidential election, and on Thursday, Reddit users took the controversial document-sharing site to task during an AMA , or \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session. WikiLeaks\u2019 periodic email dumps during the 2016 presidential election targeted Hillary Clinton, her campaign, and the DNC, and arguably proved to be disastrous.\u00a0 The document dump shows John Podesta, now Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, emailing Obama before he was even elected president and discussing a ... Over the summer, WikiLeaks released thousands of internal DNC emails. The emails led to questioning about the fairness of the Democratic process, and the DNC\u2019s apparent favoring of Clinton over her former rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Most recently, WikiLeaks released thousands of emails from accounts used by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who has since acknowledged his emails were hacked. The persistent email dumps, while praised by some, also brought much criticism, including Russia\u2019s possible involvement in the email hacks. On Thursday, WikiLeaks staff held an AMA following Tuesday\u2019s election of Donald Trump as president.\u00a0 Many users had tough questions for WikiLeaks. Along with alleged\u00a0 Russian involvement in the hacking,\u00a0 these questions also included WikiLeaks\u2019 role in Trump\u2019s U.S. election win, its sourcing, and its focus on releasing information about the Democrats and Clinton, and not Republicans.\u00a0 Among the highlights of the AMA, was WikiLeaks revealing it decides to publish information according to its \u201cpromise to sources for maximum impact.\u201d WikiLeaks also denied colluding with Trump\u2019s campaign\u00a0and Russia, and defended the information it dumped and its timing.\u00a0 Here are some of the top questions asked of WikiLeaks during the Reddit AMA, followed by WikiLeaks\u2019 answers. The questions and answers have been published in full below, without editing:\u00a0 WikiLeaks on Trump Q: Why did you want Donald Trump to be elected president? A: Sorry to just see this one now. We arent ignoring the question. There are a lot of questions coming in - which is great, just please forgive us for taking time to go through them.... We were not publishing with a goal to get any specific candidate elected. We were publishing with the one goal of making the elections as transparent as possible. We published what we received. I know that many media, including the New York Times, did editorially back one candidate over another. We didnt and havent. We would have published on any candidate. We still will if we get the submissions. Russia\u2019s alleged involvement\u00a0 Q: Many people have suggested that WikiLeaks was brazenly partisan in this election and colluded with Team Trump (and by extension, Russia). Just today a top Russian ally to Putin is quoted as saying Russia did not interfere in the election but \u201cmaybe helped a bit with WikiLeaks\u201d.1 \u201cHow much do you consider the impact of selective releasing, insinuation, the timing of releases and the intentions of your sources when preparing to release documents? Would there ever come a point when these factors outweigh the benefit of informing the public or is informing the public inherently worthwhile regardless of the circumstances?\u201d\u00a0 Many thanks. 1. Note: the ally was speculating, not admitting - https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/putin-applauds-trump-win-and-hails-new-era-of-positive-ties-with-us?CMP=share_btn_tw A: The allegations that we have colluded with Trump, or any other candidate for that matter, or with Russia, are just groundless and false. We receive information anonymously, through an anonymous submission platform. We do not need to know the identity of the source, neither do we want to know it. The intention of the source is irrelevant in our editorial process. Every source of every journalist has an intention and an agenda, may it be hidden or clear. Requesting the intention from our sources would firstly likely jeopardize their anonymity, and secondly form a bias in our understanding of the information we received. Their authenticity and their relevance to the public or the historical record are the only preconditions for us to publish the documents we are given. Q: Yesterday, while denying Russian interference in the US electoral process, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said \u201cmaybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.\u201d Who is the \u201cwe\u201d that Ryabkov is referring to here? Why would a member of the Russian Foreign Ministry claim credit for the work that you do? A: I dont know. We are rather annoyed though he tried to take credit for our work! ;) He is just a political pundit, akin to the likes of Bill O\u2019Reilly, and was just repeating speculative claims. Timing of Podesta email dump\u00a0 Q: How did you decide timing of #PodestaEmails and how to groups emails into parts? A: We publish according to our promise to sources for maximum impact, along with our goal of informing the public, so often we split large archive releases into sections to ensure the public can fully absorb and utilise the material. For the Podesta Emails our release strategy was based on our Stochastic Terminator algorithm. We are of course also only able to publish as fast as our resources allow. You can help us to publish faster by supporting us here:\u00a0 https://shop.wikileaks.org/donate Focus on Democrats Q: Why do you only seem to have information on Democrats? If you were as Noble as you say you would believe in government accountability at all levels, not just for one party. A: To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, or other campaigns. If it were to be submitted now we would happily publish it. Information on how campaigns are fought is important in the moment, and after to learn lessons from. We certainly believe in accountability and transparency for the powerful. And this includes for all the campaigns in the election. We can of course only publish what we receive. If anyone has information on any of the other campaigns we urge them to submit it now before it is deleted -\u00a0 https://wikileaks.org/#submit Q: Why did you choose to expose Clinton and not trump? A: There was no choice to be made. We release information that we receive. We cannot release what we don\u2019t have. Is there anything they wouldn\u2019t leak? Q: Are there any things that you wouldn\u2019t condone leaking? Anything that has come in that was just too much of a risk, or would have too much impact on something? A: We have an editorial policy to publish only information that we have validated as true and that is important to the political, diplomatic or historical. We believe in transparency for the powerful and privacy for the rest. We publish in full in an uncensored and uncensorable fashion. We have had to, and will have to, take risks ourselves (the secret Grand Jury that began due to our 2010 publications continues to this day) in a number of the publications we do. But we are not risk adverse and will continue to publish fearlessly. Sourcing and curation Q: How much information comes from sources wikileaks is aware of vs. those that are anonymous? A: Our submissions system is based on the concept of sources being as anonymous and protected as possible. We dont want to know who our sources are for their protection, and ours. Q: Curation and deciding \u201chow to present and where and when\u201d\u00a0is\u00a0gatekeeping. Editorial voice is as much about deciding where and when to say something as it is about what is said. Thinking that somehow you\u2019re not a gatekeeper when you are timing the release of information for maximum political impact is either disingenuous or dangerously naive. A: We decide for maximum impact, source protection etc with the goal to publish as soon as possible after submission as we are ready (things like source protection and validation can take some time) according to our editorial policies. We do not withhold or censor information and we publish full archives. If we didnt that would be gatekeeping. We have published more classified or otherwise supressed documents than the rest of the worlds media combined. We do publish as fast as we can. We always call for leaks early and often to ensure that as fast as possible is as fast as needed. Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0 Q: Why wasn\u2019t the DNC corruption, or any of Hillary\u2019s corruption scandals released; you know, when Bernie was still in the race? A: We publish as fast as we can. When we started that publication it was the first day we were ready. We were able to go out just before the nomination, but to do that we had to work all through the night. As we say: leak early and leak often. Edward Snowden\u2019s criticism\u00a0 Q: What is your response to Snowden\u2019s\u00a0 remarks \u00a0saying: Democratizing information has never been more vital, and @Wikileaks has helped. But their hostility to even modest curation is a mistake. A: This sort of conversation about a journalist\u2019s role in controlling information is an important one. We have also had public conversations with Glenn Greenwald on this too. I like that these happen publicly, so that the public can follow and interact with the position of both sides and make up their own minds. I think it was clear even before this twitter exchange that WikiLeaks and some others have different stances on this. For example it has been said the whole Snowden archive will never be published - something we highly disagree with. Regarding the curation comment - I would disagree with Snowden\u2019s comment here. Working at WikiLeaks I know we do work with our submissions a lot for validation, how to present and where and when. What we do not do is censor. We believe in full access to information and knowledge for all citizens. We do not think we are the gatekeepers of information and your right to know. We publish what we receive that is true, for you all to see. Your right to information shouldn\u2019t be controlled by others. The entire AMA can be read here .\u00a0 \u00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Richard Shiro/AP hide caption toggle caption Richard Shiro/AP Members of a local church hold a prayer service on Todd Kohlhepp's property in Woodruff, S.C. Richard Shiro/AP The bodies of two more presumed victims of Todd Kohlhepp, the South Carolina man who has confessed to multiple murders, have been identified as a young married couple who went missing in late 2015. Kohlhepp was arrested last week after a woman was found chained in a storage container on his land in Woodruff, S.C. After Kala Brown was found alive but imprisoned on Kohlhepp's nearly 100-acre property, the body of her boyfriend, Charles Carver, was found nearby. The couple had been missing since late August. Now the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office says it has found the remains of another couple on the property, and that both victims appear to have died from gunshots. Meagan Leigh McCraw Coxie, 25, and her husband, Johnny Joe Coxie, 29, were reported missing in December of last year. The couple has at least one child, officials say. \"Kohlhepp has also confessed to killing four employees of a motorcycle shop in 2003 \u2014 a long unsolved case. He's confessed to seven murders in total,\" South Carolina Public Radio's Cooper McKim reports for our Newscast unit. \"Investigators say active investigations continue on the expansive property, though the search may move beyond South Carolina. Officials say Kohlhepp owned several properties.\" Article continues after sponsorship Of the Coxies, local TV news WSPA reports: \"Deputies say that the couple panhandled near Interstate 26. The Coxies were released from jail in December 2015. Meagan told her mother that she had gotten a job and asked to be bonded out of jail, and her mother agreed, [Lt. Kevin] Bobo said. \"Meagan's mother reported the couple missing to the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office later that same month, according to authorities.\" The TV station also relayed a statement from Johnny Coxie's relatives, in which they said, \"The family is in shock, grieving, and are not comfortable talking to anyone at this time. They have asked for people to please try and understand and give them time to heal. They appreciate everyone's love and concern.\" As The Two-Way reported this past weekend: \"When she was found on Kohlhepp's nearly 100-acre property, Brown told law enforcement agents that as many as four bodies could be buried there \u2014 prompting Wright to tell journalists Thursday , \"We're trying to make sure we don't have a serial killer on our hands.' \" ",

Demonstrations have taken place in at least 10 cities, with more adding to the mix. Anti-Trump protests in Miami; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Dallas; and Louisville, Kentucky, are expected this week. For the most part, demonstrations have been peaceful, but some arrests have been made in California and Chicago. \"The president believes that's a right that should be protected. It is a right that should be exercised without violence,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. \"There are people who are disappointed.\" As Obama lauded Trump's recent tone during their meeting at the White House on Thursday as \"reassuring,\" some Americans don't seem to feel that way.

Especially for those who felt attacked during his campaign. \"Trump ran his campaign on very hateful and racially divisive rhetoric that is very worrisome for a lot of people,\" he said. When his campaign capitalized on the isolation and fears of half the country, it came at a cost of alienating and demonizing the other half, cultural commentators said. Play ",

USA TODAY NETWORK While President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump held their meeting in the Oval Office Thursday, another awkward White House get-together was taking place between first lady Michelle Obama and her successor, Melania Trump. This was the first meeting on the heels of one of the nastiest campaigns in American presidential history, in which Michelle Obama had plenty of harsh things to say about Melania Trump's husband. The two women appeared to put the harsh campaign rhetoric aside as Michelle Obama gave the future first lady a tour of the White House's private residence.

    "text": "The Design Issue Makeover Mania Credit Wheel by Pink Sparrow, based on a concept by Pablo Delcan. Photograph by Henry Leutwyler for The New York Times. The Design Issue 1. The Problem In theory, the redesign begins with a problem. The problem might be specific or systemic or subjective. A logo makes a company\u2019s image feel out of date. A familiar household object has been overtaken by new technology. A service has become too confusing for new users. And so on. The world is, after all, full of problems. The human desire to solve problems fuels brand-new inventions too: The wheel, for example, eased conveyance significantly. But the redesign tends to address problems with, or caused by, dimensions of the human-designed world, and identifying such problems may be the designer\u2019s most crucial skill. Redesigns fail when they address the wrong problem \u2014 or something that really wasn\u2019t a problem in the first place. While progress may entail change, change does not necessarily guarantee progress. But a clever redesign, one that addresses the right problem in an intelligent fashion, improves the world, if just by a bit. Read an editor's letter by Jake Silverstein about the Design Issue. As an example in miniature of how the redesign is supposed to work, consider New York\u2019s bike-share program . In 2014, Dani Simons, then the director of marketing for Citi Bike, visited a School of Visual Arts interaction-design class and presented it with a problem to solve. Citi Bike was selling plenty of annual memberships, but it was failing to attract enough \u201ccasual\u201d riders, the sorts of one-off users who might rent a bike for just a day or a week. The class went into the field, observing and interviewing people at Citi Bike stations, and at their final meeting, the students presented Simons with their findings \u2014 and potential solutions. Simons was so impressed that she signed two students, Amy Wu and Luke Stern, to a three-month contract that summer. The two of them soon zeroed in on a particularly thorny design problem: the big, instructional decal on Citi Bike\u2019s kiosks. Annual members used a key fob and had no reason to interact with the decal, but it was the gateway for casual users. Consisting mostly of text, the decals were dense and off-putting, especially to tourists uncomfortable with English. Some failed to understand that they were supposed to type in a code from a printed receipt to unlock a bike; instead, they tried to figure out how to insert the receipt itself into a slot on the docking station. There was another, more prosaic reason that Stern and Wu focused on the decal: It was something they could actually change. Citi Bike is operated by a private firm, but New York\u2019s Transportation Department oversees it, too, and the technology involves an external vendor. The decal, however, was produced in-house. So Stern and Wu proposed refashioning it, using a set of instructional pictograms loosely inspired by Ikea booklets. They tested several prototypes and endured baffled responses from Citi Bike users until eventually landing on a gridlike arrangement of visuals that people found intuitive. Simons and the Transportation Department signed off on a final version, and it was installed on the city\u2019s 300-plus Citi Bike stations. Wu checked the service\u2019s publicly available user data a month later and discovered that casual ridership had increased about 14 percent. \u201cIt was a little bit surreal,\u201d Stern recalls. \u201cWe can actually make a difference.\u201d Indeed, this is the platonic ideal of the redesign: A designer sees a problem, proposes a solution, makes a difference. Such tidy narratives fuel a reigning ideology in which every object, symbol or pool of information is just another design problem awaiting some solution. The thermostat, the fire extinguisher, the toothbrush, the car dashboard \u2014 all have been redesigned, whether anybody was clamoring for their alteration or not. This hunger for change has been a boon for firms like IDEO. Tim Brown, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, has overseen IDEO\u2019s steady expansion from product design to interactive and service design for businesses like Bank of America and Microsoft, and in more recent years even for municipalities and governments. He has been a vocal proponent of the idea that \u201cdesign thinking\u201d can be applied to just about any problem. \u201cThere are two takes on the redesign,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThe glass-half-empty take on redesign is, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re unnecessarily redesigning a chair,\u2019 or a lamp, or whatever.\u201d Citi Bike Kiosk Decal Problem: not enough casual users. Solution: reworking the instructions for newcomers from a text-heavy approach to something more pictorial, reminiscent of Ikea instructions. Credit Motivate The glass-half-full take requires a broader perspective: \u201cThe need to redesign is really dependent on how fit for purpose the thing in question is,\u201d Brown says. In his thinking, much of our world is built around systems designed to respond to the social structures and technologies of the industrial age. Everything from systems of education and health care to the design of cities and modes of transportation, he says, all trace their roots to a drastically different era and ought to be fundamentally rethought for the one we live in now. \u201cI think we\u2019ve potentially never been in a period of history where there are so many things that are no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore the idea of redesign is entirely appropriate, I think \u2014 even though it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d 2. What to Change You don\u2019t have to listen to Karim Rashid for very long to get a sense that he thinks pretty much every single manifestation of the built environment needs to be redesigned. Known for his colorful personal and professional style, he has had a long run as one of the most famous industrial designers in America. He believes design is a fundamentally social act that makes the world a better place. But it is also, he points out, a business. So in practice, most redesigns begin with a client; without one, not much happens. He has worked with many of them \u2014 on furniture, packaging, gadgets, housewares, luxury goods, even condos and hotels. But he has learned that even having a client does not guarantee that any given redesign will ever make it out of renderings and prototypes and into the real world. \u201cPeople say I\u2019m prolific,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine if all the other stuff got to go to market?\u201d As Rashid sees it, so many of the things that surround us bear cumbersome vestiges of the past. \u201cThe world is full of this kind of kitsch history \u2014 history that has nothing to do with the world we live in now,\u201d he says. He points to a redesign project of his that fizzled, a complete rethinking of the business-class tableware for Delta Air Lines. His proposal was bold: His bowls had sharp angles that echoed Delta\u2019s triangular logo, his trays had subtle recesses that anchored dishes in place and his wineglasses skipped the stem in favor of a tapered shape with a wide base. \u201cThe stem on a wineglass is meaningless,\u201d Rashid says. He dismisses the conventional argument that it prevents the drinker\u2019s hand from interfering with wine\u2019s ideal temperature; to have the slightest such effect, he claims, you\u2019d have to wrap your palm around the bowl for 20 straight minutes. The stem is actually a leftover artifact, he says, from centuries ago, when goblets made of metal had high stems to signal status and wealth. This design quirk remained after we switched to glass, Rashid says. Making wineglasses look a certain way because that\u2019s how they have always looked is a classic example of privileging form over function. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in first class or business class on an airplane with turbulence,\u201d Rashid says, \u201cwith a wineglass with a stem on it \u2014 do you understand? It\u2019s so stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His proposed redesigns were striking, but they had to pass muster with the service-item maker, the flight attendants\u2019 union and Delta itself \u2014 which ultimately declined to move forward with the concepts Rashid proposed. \u201cIt was all rejected,\u201d he tells me, with a sigh. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t look like domestic tableware.\u201d Rashid loves to \u201cbreak archetypes,\u201d in effect redesigning a whole object category. But the hurdles to doing so involve practicality as well as taste. More recently, he designed the Solarin mobile phone for Sirin Labs. It is equipped with extreme encryption capabilities and made with wealthy, privacy-obsessed customers in mind. It costs an eye-popping $12,000 and up. The client had a sky\u2019s-the-limit attitude about imbuing the phone with a truly distinct form. Rashid proposed an oval shape. \u201cIt would fit perfectly in your hand,\u201d he says. His concept made it to prototype, and \u201ceverybody loved the oval phone.\u201d But it turned out that only a handful of factories do smartphone glass assembly, and none were willing to retool an entire production line to accommodate a relatively small client. Moreover, existing operating systems are all designed to work in a grid format. The phone ended up with pronounced beveling at the edges, but was still fundamentally a rectangle. \u201cI was so, so disappointed,\u201d Rashid says. \u201cI tried every trick.\u201d Sounding almost wistful, he recalls a similar misadventure: an oval-shaped television set he designed for Samsung. \u201cThey showed it in some focus group, and it bombed,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t like the idea of an oval television. I have no idea why.\u201d Mastercard Logo The payment giant\u2019s top priority in revisiting its logo for the first time in decades: Don\u2019t mess it up. The result, released earlier this year, is a version of the familiar interlocked-circles symbol streamlined for the digital era. Credit 3. What to Keep I know why. And really, so does Rashid. As much as we are attracted to the new, we simultaneously cling to the familiar. This tension means that some redesigns \u2014 particularly in the realm of graphic design \u2014 can inspire surprisingly visceral public backlash. Earlier this year, for instance, Instagram updated its logo and app icon, simplifying the design and making it more colorful. The chorus of online moaning and mockery that followed grew so loud that it was actually reported on by The Times , which called it a \u201cfreak out.\u201d Instagram didn\u2019t budge, but a similar backlash in 2010 caused the Gap to retract plans for a new logo it had floated online. The University of California pulled back key elements of a redesign that met with a similarly furious response. Probably the most notorious and consequential example involved Tropicana . In 2009, the brand rolled out a new look that included a full redesign of its familiar packaging and visual identity, dropping its orange-with-a-straw-in it logo \u2014 corny, perhaps, but very familiar \u2014 for a more stylish icon and a sans-serif type treatment. Fans howled online, but that probably mattered less than the reported 20 percent drop in retail sales. The redesign was withdrawn, and the brand went back to its old look. Situations like this can unnerve clients, and this knowledge was certainly relevant to Mastercard when it decided this year to update its logo for the first time in more than 20 years. Raja Rajamannar, the global chief marketing and communications officer, says that the first parameter he gave his designer, Michael Bierut at Pentagram, \u201cwas not to mess things up.\u201d The online crowd can get \u201cpretty nasty,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get mired in unnecessary controversy and negativity.\u201d This conservatism among clients can frustrate designers. \u201cI was kind of brought up in this tradition that, you know, there\u2019s nothing more inspiring than the blank slate, the open brief,\u201d Bierut says. But over the years he has come to appreciate the challenge of \u201cstarting with a given,\u201d particularly now. \u201cThe last big period of redesign was the postwar era,\u201d Bierut says. \u201cThere was this mania to make older companies look new and modern.\u201d As a more corporate world emerged, the visual vernacular of mom-and-pop businesses looked quaint, and so design shifted from an emphasis on manufacturing things to selling more abstract forms of value. A railroad doesn\u2019t run trains, the thinking went; it provides transportation \u2014 so instead of a representation of a locomotive, its more modern logo might rely on arrows and italic typography. More broadly, idiosyncratic or hand-drawn lettering gave way to stylized and minimal iconography and type treatments that projected far-flung and trustworthy power. \u201cCorporate design was done as a command-and-control exercise,\u201d he says, resulting in a master solution laid out in \u201ca thick binder\u201d prescribing how every branding element would appear. By the \u201980s and \u201990s, that approach started to feel dated, suspicious and at odds with a vogue for more agile management theories. So in the last two decades, there has been a fresh wave of redesigns as companies have repositioned themselves in a more globalized, technologized marketplace. Mastercard is one of many examples of a company looking to update visual strategies designed with billboards and brick-and-mortar stores in mind for the age of social media and a transnational customer base. Nevertheless, the specific dimensions of Mastercard\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t mess it up\u201d parameter included keeping the interlocking circles \u2014 one red, one yellow \u2014 that the brand has used for more than half a century. Bierut believes that this was wise: Unlike a book cover or a poster, a brand mark is \u201cmore like a building,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t unveil it thinking it\u2019s going to work once and then be on its way. It\u2019s supposed to accrue value the longer it\u2019s invested in.\u201d The raw familiarity that builds up over years, which marketers refer to as \u201cequity,\u201d probably plays a bigger factor in our assessment of a supposedly great logo design than we realize. Bierut is tickled, for instance, by how many people seem to admire Target\u2019s logo. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine if you went to your client whose name was Target and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea,\u2019 then you went away for a few weeks and came back with a circle with a dot in the middle, and an invoice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe client would be skeptical \u2014 and the world at large would destroy you.\u201d 1 IOS 7 Apple\u2019s 2013 mobile operating system did away with \u2018skeuomorphs\u2019 \u2014 visual echoes of physical-world objects like wooden bookshelves and green gaming tables, long a bugbear among some digital designers. 2 AirBNB Logo In 2014 the home-sharing platform adopted a stylized A as its logo \u2014 which was instantly mocked by those who thought it resembled certain parts of the human anatomy. The company stuck with it anyway. 3 $100 Bill It took more than a decade to develop the more colorful version of the Benjamin that began circulating in 2013. Its look was largely shaped by functional considerations aimed at thwarting counterfeiters, like a blue strip that seems to show movement when tilted. 4 Whitney Museum Visual Identity In preparation for its move to a new space in 2015, the museum switched its logo to a minimal, \u2018responsive\u2019 W that\u2019s rendered at various angles depending on the imagery with which it\u2019s paired. Some complained, but design geeks loved the variety. 5 linknyc An attempt to update the pay-phone concept for a smartphone world is adding Wi-Fi connectivity, shiny obelisks and ad-bearing screens to New York sidewalks. After complaints, however, it cut off the kiosks\u2019 built-in browsers when some users started to hang around watching pornography. 6 The Wheelchair Symbol Technically known as the International Symbol of Access, this icon was targeted by a campaign called the Accessible Icon Project. Its more active-looking alternative has joined the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s permanent collection and was officially approved for use in New York State in 2014. 7 Trump-Pence Logo The initial version featured a symbol with a T and P interlocking in a manner that many online observers considered ... suggestive. It was quietly and almost instantly replaced with a text-only version. 8 Quirky Pivot Power This redesign of the power strip emerged from Quirky, a V.C.-backed start-up that did collaborative product design. Quirky declared bankruptcy last year, but its \u2018community\u2019 produced a hit with this object, which has sold more than 1.5 million units. 9 Yahoo Logo A 2013 modernization of the company\u2019s Web 1.0 logo was poorly received \u2014 not least because Marissa Mayer, the company\u2019s C.E.O., announced that she and a small internal design team had knocked it out \u2018one weekend this summer.\u2019 10 Nest Thermostat With a modern look and high-tech capabilities (control from a smartphone, data collection and a promise to \u2018learn\u2019 from usage patterns), the Nest jolted a long-sleepy category in 2011 \u2014 and became an early icon of the \u2018smart object\u2019 phenomenon. 11 Ford Smartgauge With LCD screens on the dashboard allowing digital instruments to replace mechanical ones, Ford offered owners of hybrids new forms of driving feedback to coach them toward better mileage. 12 Bullet Journal One designer\u2019s personal mission to stay organized evolved from a custom system of productivity-tracking into a hit product on Kickstarter that effectively redesigned the to-do list. 13 Metropolitan Museum of Art Logo Dropping its venerable grid-based mark for bright red smushed-together letters this year, the Met took a lot of heat \u2014 and not just from the online mob. New York Magazine\u2019s architecture critic called it \u2018a typographic bus crash.\u2019 14 The Fiat Chrysler Monostable Gear Shift A new take on the automatic shifting mechanism confused some drivers who thought their vehicle was in park when it wasn\u2019t. The unfamiliar design was blamed for injuries and sparked a huge recall. 15 Army Camouflage A pixelated pattern introduced about a decade ago was criticized for being insufficiently concealing (a pretty big flaw in this context). That was revised after five years, and that redesign has now been replaced by a more traditional-looking pattern. 16 American Airlines Visual Identity In 2013, before emerging from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the airline replaced the logo and plane livery it had used since the 1960s with a more abstract image scheme. \u2018It has no sense of permanence,\u2019 declared Massimo Vignelli, creator of the discarded look. 17 Facebook Timeline The social-media giant always seems to be fiddling with the algorithms that guide what users see. In 2013, it revised how users display what they\u2019re willing to share about themselves. For Facebook\u2019s ad-driven business model, the more we share, the better. 18 Sonos Founded in 2002, Sonos took years to redesign home listening into its current product line: a range of streamlined, Wi-Fi-compatible objects controlled by an app. The only tangible element of the old-school hi-fi system you still need may be the speaker. For Mastercard, Pentagram got as creative as the brief allowed, offering dozens of yellow-and-red-circle variations \u2014 adding additional colors to suggest inclusivity, or a superminimal take presenting only the outlines of the interlocked rings. Rajamannar (and others at Mastercard, crosschecked by multiple rounds of market research) passed on those, opting for a treatment that amounted to a kind of reiteration of the existing mark. The colors became a little brighter, a set of stripes in their overlap was eliminated in favor of a single orange-y color and the name moved below the circles. Ultimately, in fact, the new symbol is designed to be able to stand alone, with no name at all; Rajamannar says testing conducted across 11 countries found 81 percent of respondents recognized the wordless version of the logo as Mastercard\u2019s. In short, the not-messing-it-up mission was deemed a success \u2014 and there was no notable backlash. \u201cThis kind of brand mark has become more ubiquitous than the designers of the \u201960s and \u201970s ever would have dreamed,\u201d Bierut says, and that may explain a public interest in design that would have been a shock in that era. It should not be so surprising today; the design profession has been on a decades-long mission to have its work taken seriously across the culture. But now, having achieved what they wanted, many designers seem to wish the public would be more deferential \u2014 something Bierut finds amusing. \u201cIf designers claim to want people to be interested and invested in and care about design,\u201d he says, \u201cthey sort of have to accept that interest on the terms of, you know, the audience.\u201d 4. Where to Compromise In 2011, Jamie Siminoff had just sold a start-up and was spending most of his days in his garage in Pacific Palisades, Calif., determined to come up with a new business concept. Tinkering with ideas including a gardening business and new conference-call technology, he soon became annoyed, because he could never hear his doorbell, and he kept missing visitors. So he \u201chacked together\u201d a system that linked the bell to his phone. His wife told him that it was far more useful than the notions he was chasing in the garage. The idea evolved to include a camera and a motion detector \u2014 and thus the ability to monitor your front door from anywhere, with a smartphone, making the object as much about security as convenience. The product he ended up with, Ring, is a good example of a broader phenomenon in the world of industrial design. The technology shifts that Brown and Rashid cite have quickened the pace of redesigns in more mundane, less grandiose ways. Thanks to the proliferation of cheap sensors, circuit boards, cameras and other components, practically every consumer good now seems susceptible to reinvention as a \u201csmart object.\u201d Even the path Siminoff traveled from concept to design was made easier by technology and start-up mania, first with the aid of a crowdfunding campaign, then with an unsuccessful but profile-raising appearance on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d Sometimes such a path results in a version of what the tech critic Evgeny Morozov calls \u201csolutionism\u201d \u2014 starting with a supposed breakthrough and then seeking out a supposed problem that it can hypothetically solve. And at times the presumed innovations in these tech-centric redesigns seem to run well ahead of their potential privacy and security pitfalls. (\u201cYes,\u201d the tech site Motherboard reported last year, \u201cyour smart dildo can be hacked.\u201d) But sometimes it results in a hit, like the widely celebrated update of the thermostat in internet-connected, app-controlled form created by the start-up Nest, which was ultimately bought by Google for $3.2 billion. By his own account, Siminoff\u2019s first stab at the product was a bit off. He called it Doorbot, and its look matched the geeky name: a vaguely sci-fi, curved object with a camera concealed by a spooky, bulbous protrusion. \u201cThat was the pride of the design,\u201d Siminoff says now, laughing. He prototyped it in his garage with a couple of recent college graduates; none of them had a design background. The marketplace set him straight, he says: \u201cNo one wanted this big HAL 9000 thing on the front door.\u201d He still believed in the object\u2019s utility, but he realized he would need to redesign his redesign. Siminoff found his way to Chris Loew, an industrial designer in Silicon Valley, with a long record in technology hardware; he worked on early versions of tablet products and spent 16 years at IDEO helping clients including Samsung and Oral-B. In more recent years he has been hired by a number of start-ups. Impressed by Siminoff, Loew also recognized the issues with Doorbot. \u201cIt was very gadgety,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know if you were being shot with radiation or \u2014 you know, it\u2019s not offensive, but you didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d In short, it didn\u2019t look like a doorbell, and even the most impressive technical capabilities have to be presented in a form that makes sense to the consumer. Ring Doorbell The original version of this reimagined doorbell (equipped with a camera and intercom) had such a sci-fi look that visitors often didn\u2019t know what it was. A redesign of that redesign has placed it in the realm of functional home d\u00e9cor \u2014 and it has been installed in hundreds of thousands of homes. Credit Gear Shift In this case, that meant a design that resonated with basic home architecture. There were already serious technologized constraints: It had to accommodate a fairly large battery, a camera, a circuit board and a motion detector that required an opening of a specific size. And from a purely aesthetic perspective, the architectural setting imposed limits that might not apply to a free-standing product: Nobody really wants to tack a wild experiment in product design to a front door. Loew settled on a rectangular shape that would visually echo molding. \u201cEverybody\u2019s house is really just extruded shapes and planar shapes,\u201d says Loew, who is now Ring\u2019s lead product designer. The product comes in various finishes informed by classic door hardware, and is meant to be notable but not flashy. The company has grown to 500 employees, with hundreds of thousands of installations already done. The only holdover from Doorbot is a circle around the button that glows blue when pressed. 5. When to Start Over Sometimes the route to a successful redesign leads directly through a decision about what problem not to solve. A few years ago, for instance, an entrepreneur named Richard Smiedt approached Karim Rashid with an idea for a set of travel bags and cases that could be used individually or fit together, according to the needs of any given trip. Recently, in a conference room in Rashid\u2019s Manhattan offices, Smiedt clicked through a set of slides depicting the various ideas the designer had come up with over the course of their many collaborations. \u201cA lot of what you get with Karim,\u201d he said, gesturing at a shelf full of Rashid-designed products and their curves and skewed lines and loud colors, \u201cis this, reinvented.\u201d He paused to clarify his point: \u201cI totally want what he\u2019s done. I just don\u2019t want it to look like any specific thing that he\u2019s done.\u201d Smiedt paused on one image of a carry-on bag with a side pocket containing a flask-shaped plastic bottle outfitted with a strong microfilter. This accessory popped up during the luggage-design process as a useful alternative to buying bottled water after every airport security check. \u201cSo no matter what country,\u201d Rashid explained, \u201cI go across and to the bathroom and fill it up with clean water. Because it\u2019s absurd, this idea of drinking bottled water \u2014 the landfill is enormous, 18 million bottles are thrown away a day in America.\u201d Both men immediately saw its appeal. Smiedt promptly \u201cdisappeared,\u201d Rashid continued, \u201cand six months later came back and said: \u2018You know, forget the luggage. We\u2019re doing the water bottle.\u2019 \u201d On its own, the flasklike form seemed off, so Smiedt pushed for alternatives, something more like what was on Rashid\u2019s product shelf \u2014 but not exactly. An hourglass-like, squeezable shape that Rashid eventually dreamed up was perfect. But it required making a lengthy search to find a capable manufacturer \u2014 \u201cNobody had made a blow-molded bottle that was thinner in the middle,\u201d Smiedt said \u2014 and committing to a huge production order for the product, which they called Bobble. \u201cCompanies are often risk-averse,\u201d Smiedt continued, \u201cand don\u2019t get design\u2019s possibilities. But designers do what they want to design, and it often doesn\u2019t connect with the consumer,\u201d at least not the mass scale he had in mind. \u201cFor me,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe key to design is that it can\u2019t polarize.\u201d Many designers would recoil from that assertion, but as a mass-market-oriented entrepreneur, Smiedt\u2019s goals are different. He thinks a lot about who is not going to like a new take on a useful object, as a way to \u201cget to something that\u2019s really understood.\u201d Bobble Bottle This new take on the reusable water bottle started out as an accessory to a luggage redesign. The luggage was scuttled \u2014 but Bobble, with a distinct shape and a strong microfilter, has sold millions. Credit Karim Rashia The Bobble bottle sold 15 million units in its first three years on the market. Smiedt sold Bobble to Seventh Generation and has gone back into business with Rashid, this time in a partnership. They want to redesign more travel-related accessories, so they started by dumping their luggage onto a table and talking about what they carried, and what they needed. Their first idea involved finding a way to keep smeary touch-controlled gadgets clean. Rashid designed a travel-size spray bottle, arriving at an elliptical form, more like a worry stone than a bottle. They both loved the object\u2019s shape and feel but wondered about the breadth of its appeal. Ultimately, they shelved it, though not entirely. They went back to the results of the bag-dump experiment and zeroed in on the most bothersome objects: the dull-colored, blocky, careless-looking power adapters and portable chargers and their various entangled wires. What if you combined a wall charger and mobile battery in a single object? What if it had a more appealing aesthetic? Smiedt sourced the technology, and Rashid designed around it to create an object they called Bump. Sifting through a box of prototypes, Smiedt pointed out that this completely different product has almost the same elliptical shape as the discarded cleaner idea. This \u201cfun\u201d form (it comes in magenta, red, black and blue) will carry through the entire product line, he explained. Rashid also devised a matching cable, and a clever silicone sleeve that is used both to store the cable and to protect Bump when it\u2019s tossed into a bag. Of course, there was a hitch. Market testing found that consumers were often happy to use Bump with the (less attractive) power cable they already owned, and didn\u2019t bother with the sleeve. So as Bump goes on sale online and rolls out across big retailers, starting with the Container Store in late October, the cord is now sold separately. And that clever silicone sleeve may also be sold separately \u2014 or it may be on its way to a prototype box somewhere. 6. The Solution All redesigns have something in common: They end. This does not happen at the moment the redesigned symbol, object or interface is implemented. It happens when that redesign is replaced. Maybe that\u2019s the lofty logic of progress, or just the workaday logic of capitalism. But it\u2019s certainly the logic of the redesign, and perhaps design in general, in the early 21st century. When IDEO\u2019s Tim Brown talks about updating all that is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d today, he\u2019s talking about entire systems, not just their individual and tangible components and manifestations. IDEO started out as an industrial-design firm working on consumer products; it expanded further into interaction design as the digital world took hold, and then it went into services. Now its projects include \u201credesigning\u201d such abstractions as the school lunch (for the city of San Francisco) or the vote (for Los Angeles County), experimenting with how to lace in 21st-century technology elements and shed out-of-date practices. These are incremental efforts that play out over years. There is no momentous before-and-after unveiling, just a continuous process of researching, trying and replacing ideas. This, after all, is how designers work: in an ongoing system of study, hunches, prototypes, tests and do-overs. The inevitability of re-redesign is something that Amy Wu (now part of a Microsoft design team in San Francisco) and Luke Stern (now a designer for Intersection, a firm focused on civic spaces) encountered in their work for Citi Bike. A few months after the triumphant installation of their redesigned kiosk decals, the company that operated Citi Bike was bought by another bike-share operator, Motivate, which runs similar programs for several other cities. They got an email from Citi Bike saying they might be needed again, but then never heard back. The new owner promptly set about a broader upgrade of Citi Bike\u2019s system involving new software and changes to the hardware in those kiosks. This meant that the decals needed to be redesigned yet again. The new ones incorporated some of Wu and Stern\u2019s thinking, but in a new look that, among other things, visually announced to the world that Citi Bike had been updated. Stern and Wu are philosophical about this turn. \u201cThe logistics had changed,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThey had to update the system. Our design wasn\u2019t actually relevant any more. That\u2019s reality, right?\u201d Right. And it was certainly a useful final lesson for an effort that started out as a student project: All redesigns end, but the redesign never does. \u2666 Rob Walker writes the Workologist column for The Times.

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Nov. 10, 2016. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) 17039 CONNECT TWEET 9 LINKEDIN 459 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said he and successor-in-waiting Donald Trump had an \"excellent conversation\" Thursday as the intense rivals who defined the volatile 2016 election discussed the hand-off of the White House. Just days after vicious attacks on the campaign trail, the two men spoke well of each other and shook hands for the cameras. Trump, who famously challenged the president's place of birth, called his predecessor \"a very good man\" following their Oval Office meeting. Obama said his \"number one priority\" in the next two months in office is to facilitate the transition to the Trump administration. He said the two talked about \"organizational issues,\" as well as domestic and foreign policies.\u00a0\"I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together,\u00a0to deal with the many challenges that we face,\" Obama told reporters. In pledging a smooth transition, Obama told Trump that \"we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed \u2014\u00a0because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\" Trump \u2014 noting that the meeting ran long \u2014 said: \"Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future.\" The New York businessman also said: \"We had never met each other. I have\u00a0great respect.\" The two shook hands for the cameras, but did not take questions from reporters. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Obama is \"quite sincere about fulfilling the basic responsibility that he has to the American people and our democracy to ensure a smooth transition to the next presidency,\" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. After the meeting, Earnest said the two leaders did not resolve all of their differences, but did not try to either; their focus was a smooth transition. An 'Obama era' crashes as Donald Trump takes White House Trump followed up the meeting by heading to Capitol Hill to meet with another key player in his emerging presidency, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. The vice president-elect, Mike Pence, also attended the session\u00a0with Ryan, who, like Obama, has had his share of differences with Trump. Afterward, Ryan said that \"we had a fantastic, productive meeting about getting to work.\" The president-elect also met with another powerful Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

We're going to work very strongly on immigration, health care and we're looking at jobs, big league jobs.\" Gearing up for his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump is also starting to speak on the phone with an array of leaders from across the globe, from Japan to Turkey. British Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated Trump on his victory, and reminded the New York businessman of his \"commitment in his acceptance speech to uniting people across America, which she said is a task we all need to focus on globally,\" according to a statement from May's office. Trump invited May to visit him as soon as possible, the statement said. Another world leader, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced his government is prepared to re-negotiate parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada. During his campaign, Trump said existing free trade deals have shipped overseas. The Trump team is also putting together possible picks for the Cabinet and White House staff . While Obama and Trump spoke in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama gave a tour of the residence to Melania Trump.\u00a0During the campaign, Mrs. Obama criticized Trump over his\u00a0lewd comments about women. Mrs. Trump, during her address to the Republican national convention, used lines cribbed from a speech the first lady had once given. In preparing for his sit-down with Trump, the president said \"it\u00a0is no secret\" that they have \"some pretty significant differences.\" But the president added\u00a0that he'd also had differences with his predecessor, George W. Bush, and they had a smooth transition. He said he has instructed aides to \"follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect.\" People gather outside the West Wing of the White House in on Nov. 10, 2016, as they wait for the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump. \u00a0(Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) One Trump backer and Obama critic, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, described the meeting between the president and his successor\u00a0as \"an amazing tribute to the power of the people.\" Trump spent much of his insurgent campaign pledging to reverse and tear down Obama's legacy. He called for repealing and replacing the president's health care law, voiding the Iran nuclear deal\u00a0and ripping up new business and environmental regulations. On the stump, Trump also criticized Obama for campaigning so much on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying he should \"do the job he's supposed to be doing.\" In his campaign speeches, Obama cast Trump as an erratic and perhaps unstable political novice who shouldn't be allowed near the nuclear codes.\u00a0\"It's really bad being arrogant when you don't know what you're talking about,\" Obama said. The Obama-Trump rivalry, intrinsic to the 2016 election, goes back years. The Trump-Obama rivalry fuels 2016 campaign During Obama's first term,\u00a0Trump made a name for himself by becoming the de facto\u00a0leader\u00a0of the so-called \"birther\" movement, pushing the false idea that the president\u00a0was not born in the United States. In this past campaign year, Clinton described the birther movement as a racist attack on the nation's first African-American president. In 2011, Obama responded by producing a long-form birth certificate and mocking Trump at a high-profile press dinner as the New York businessman sat in the audience.

    "text": "Starting Tuesday night, as Donald Trump 's victory in the presidential election started coming into focus, anguished questions flooded social media: Could Trump overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide? Could he abolish same-sex marriages? Could he increase deportations? How about global warming? Could Trump pull out of U.S. agreements on climate change? What about Obamacare? The chief executive has a lot of authority over the government, as President Obama has demonstrated. But as Obama has found, he also faces tremendous constraints from Congress , the courts and existing laws. Here are some areas in which President Trump could act quickly and where he could not. Could Trump overturn Roe v. Wade? Not on his own. The Supreme Court decision in 1973 struck down state laws around the country that banned abortions. Ever since, antiabortion groups have called for reversing the ruling. The decision could be overturned two ways \u2014\u00a0by a new Supreme Court decision or by a constitutional amendment. The high court has reaffirmed the Roe decision repeatedly, most recently by a 5-3 vote in June that struck down a Texas law that limited abortions . After Trump's win, even some in Silicon Valley wonder: Has Facebook grown too influential? \u00bb In theory, if\u00a0enough vacancies arise on the court, Trump could appoint a sufficient number of\u00a0justices who would overturn Roe . In practice, the Supreme Court has had a majority of Republican-appointed justices since Roe was handed down, except for the past few months of a 4-4 tie, and that\u2019s never happened. As for a constitutional amendment, the president has no role in that process. Amendments have to pass both houses of Congress by a two-thirds vote and be ratified by three-quarters of the states \u2014\u00a0a high bar. What could Trump do about immigration? A lot. The law gives the president broad authority over immigration policy. Trump could speed up deportations, revoke Obama\u2019s program that shielded so-called Dreamers \u2014\u00a0people who came to the U.S. illegally as children \u2014\u00a0and curb certain categories of visas for legal immigrants. But as Obama found, there are limits. Courts struck down his effort to expand the deportation shield to cover millions of adults. Trump also could not build a wall along the Mexican border without money from Congress, although he might be able to get started on construction by shifting funds already in the federal budget. Could Trump ban Muslims from coming to the U.S.? Legal experts have said he probably could : Noncitizens seeking to enter the country generally aren\u2019t protected by the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Here is how America feels about Trump's shocking win \u00bb As of Thursday morning, mention of the Muslim ban had disappeared from Trump\u2019s campaign website. Later in the day, the proposal reappeared on the website . Trump aides insisted the earlier removal had been a technical glitch.\u00a0 Trump could limit the entry of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other war-torn Middle Eastern countries. He probably would face pressure from U.S. allies not to do so, but he could disregard that. Are same-sex marriages at risk? No. Just as with abortion, the president can\u2019t overturn a Supreme Court decision by himself, although he could appoint more conservative justices. Even then, the chance that the high court would reverse itself is very small. Unlike abortion, same-sex marriage has steadily gained in public approval. Trump could try to reverse some Obama administration rulings that favored same-sex couples on issues such as federal benefits. He hasn\u2019t suggested that he would. And if he did, his decisions could be challenged in court. Could Trump reverse current policies on climate change? He could and quite probably will . Trump has promised to withdraw the U.S. from an international agreement made in Paris last year that called on countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. And he has said he would scrap Obama administration rules that aim to shift electricity generation away from coal and oil toward cleaner sources. Since those policies were adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency, using its authority under the Clean Air Act, they could be reversed by the EPA. But environmental groups could \u2014\u00a0and almost certainly would \u2014\u00a0go to court to try to block any such reversal. At minimum, the groups could tie up the Trump administration for a long time. What happens if Trump tries to repeal Obamacare? Trump has promised to ask Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something else. The repeal part is easy since the Republicans control both houses of Congress. The replace part is a lot harder, as my colleague Noam N. Levey explained. Fear of a Trump-triggered recession gives way to hope for short-term economic boost \u00bb Republicans have never been able to agree on a plan to replace the current law, and they would be under tremendous pressure not to simply repeal the law without a backup plan. Doing so would cause some 20 million people to lose healthcare coverage. So carrying out Trump\u2019s pledge may take quite a while, and, in the end, the GOP may have to settle for less dramatic change than the rhetoric might imply. Could Trump end federal funds for Planned Parenthood? Congress would have to act to accomplish that goal, which many conservatives have sought because of the group\u2019s role in providing abortion services. Whether a ban would pass both houses, especially the Senate, remains uncertain. The federal money that goes to support Planned Parenthood\u2019s healthcare activities does not involve abortion but rather funds the group\u2019s other services, including\u00a0mammograms and other preventive care for women. Several\u00a0Republican senators have\u00a0supported Planned Parenthood in the past because those services are popular in their states. During the campaign, Trump threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. Could he? The president, acting through the attorney general,\u00a0has broad authority to appoint prosecutors. But appointing a prosecutor to go after a defeated campaign rival would be unprecedented, and Trump\u2019s aides already have started stepping away from that idea. Could Trump order police to adopt \u2018stop-and-frisk\u2019\u00a0policies? No. During the campaign, Trump defended the use of so-called stop-and-frisk policing\u00a0tactics. But police departments don\u2019t work for the federal government, they work for state and local governments. In some cities, stop-and-frisk has been limited by court decisions. In other places, it has been dropped by police chiefs who decided it was not reducing crime enough to justify the tension it created \u00a0in minority communities. Trump talked about making libel law less protective of the press.\u00a0Could he? No. There is no federal libel law. Each state has its own law. A\u00a0Supreme Court decision handed down more than 40 years ago \u2014\u00a0New York Times v. Sullivan \u2014 provides broad protection for the press in covering public figures.

Credit Ryan David Brown for The New York Times Marijuana Company Prepares to Cross State Lines, as Legally as Possible Dixie Brands wants to navigate complex laws in multiple states to sell its marijuana-infused drinks and edibles beyond Colorado. By JULIE WEED Continue reading the main story Almost all small-business owners dream of the day when they can expand nationally. This has proved to be a unique challenge for those in the marijuana industry because the products they create are illegal under federal law, and the checkerboard of states that permit marijuana sales have complex and constantly changing regulations. Dixie Brands , a company in Denver that creates drinks and other products using marijuana, is aiming to navigate those hurdles and become one of the first companies in the industry to build a national presence. Voters on Tuesday brought that dream a little closer to reality. California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada approved adult-use (a new term for recreational use) marijuana. Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana voted to legalize or expand medical marijuana use. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia now have some sort of allowed use. The legal cannabis industry is dominated by small businesses operating in individual states, so these new laws could open significant prospects for entrepreneurs. And for the companies that can figure out how to operate in multiple states, the opportunity is tremendous. Continue reading the main story GreenWave Advisors , a financial research and advisory firm based in New York, estimates that marijuana product sales in the United States will be $6.5 billion in 2016 and about $30 billion in 2021, if products derived from marijuana are legalized in all 50 states in some capacity. Photo Tripp Keber, left, and Chuck Smith, the founders of Dixie Brands, in their manufacturing center in Denver. The company has set up manufacturing centers in five states. Credit Ryan David Brown for The New York Times Chuck Smith and Tripp Keber, who founded Dixie Brands seven years ago, have been taking steps to be at the forefront of the growing market. The company makes Dixie Elixirs, bottled beverages infused with THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. It also makes THC-infused chocolates, drops and topical lotions. All are sold at licensed recreational pot shops and medical marijuana dispensaries. Low-dose \u201cawakening\u201d and \u201crelaxing\u201d mints containing five milligrams of THC (half a serving) are among the company\u2019s top sellers. Most of the company\u2019s revenue comes from Colorado. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because of federal laws on controlled substances, one challenge to expansion is that products cannot cross state lines, so a pot brownie baked in Oregon, for example, cannot be sold in neighboring Washington, even though the product is legal in both places. Add the complications of financing as well as unique packaging, distribution and marketing laws for each state, and establishing a national brand seems daunting and expensive. Some states require marijuana businesses to be owned by in-state residents, further impeding multistate expansion. Also, because the industry is in its infancy, rules are changing constantly, including regulations governing packaging, food production and agriculture management. When Colorado recently required all marijuana food products to be stamped with a THC symbol, Dixie Brands had to create all new molds for its chocolates and discontinue their Dixie Roll product, which is similar to Tootsie Rolls, because it could not be stamped efficiently. The new rule requires a THC stamp on all packaging as well. Continue reading the main story Photo Processing at Dixie Brands in Denver, clockwise from top left: preparing marijuana buds; removing ethanol from oil infused with THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana; putting chocolate bars, infused with THC, into a plastic sleeve; and THC-infused chocolate. Credit Ryan David Brown \u201cThese changes are costly for small businesses,\u201d said Joe Hodas, chief marketing officer for the company. In addition, because of federal laws, marijuana companies cannot open bank accounts, cannot use credit cards and cannot deduct business expenses from their federal taxes. Giant safes full of cash and pickups by armored cars are the norm. Many companies in the marijuana industry had been started by product aficionados with little business experience. As legalization spreads, the industry is quickly drawing more business professionals, as evidenced by Mr. Smith and Mr. Keber, who began their endeavor with experience in corporate finance, marketing and management. When recreational marijuana joined medical marijuana as a legal market in Colorado in 2014, they were poised to expand Dixie Brands by adding to their line of products. Since that time, the number of employees has expanded from 20 to 100 and sales have increased about sixfold. Expanding beyond Colorado, however, has taken creativity. Two years ago, in their first move outside of the state, the pair found a licensing partner to produce Dixie products in California. After a year, the founders decided to take a more hands-on approach.

Credit Brad Swonetz for The New York Times \u201cOur partner wanted to manufacture other companies\u2019 products as well as ours, and we wanted more focus on absolute quality and consistency,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cTo have total legal, financial and operational control, we decided we would need to control the manufacturing and distribution facilities in any state we expanded to.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story To make this happen, Mr. Smith had to find a way to work within regulations that require owners of marijuana businesses to be residents of the state. He decided that Dixie Brands would own and run anything that did not \u201ctouch the plant\u201d and therefore was not subject to local ownership regulations. A local partner would grow and process the marijuana, but only for Dixie Brands, and only under the company\u2019s strict instructions. Consistent product quality is critical, Mr. Smith said. \u201cCoca-Cola in Denver and Seattle taste exactly the same, and we want Dixie Elixirs and our other products to have that reputation.\u201d Each new manufacturing site will cost about $2 million, according to Mr. Smith. The Dixie holding company will own and control a building that they will rent to the partner as well as the equipment that will be leased to them. All of the noncannabis raw materials and packaging, and the accounting, marketing and legal services, will be provided by Dixie Brands. The state-based partner will own the marijuana itself and employ the personnel who work with the marijuana in any form: plants, concentrates, finished products and the like. This will allow Dixie to control the business while maintaining a clear separation from the federally illegal aspect of it. That separation also protects their investors and gives the company flexibility to react to changing state and federal regulations.

Credit Ryan David Brown for The New York Times To finance the expansion, Mr. Smith says he has tapped a handful of investors from among the 30 who have funded his efforts over the last seven years. Those sources helped to open manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Nevada last month, and one is scheduled to open early next year in Washington State. For efficiency as it enters new locations, Dixie Brands follows the most stringent state\u2019s laws in each area of its operations. For example, Colorado has the strictest packaging requirements encompassing child-safety measures, clear dosing and single-serving packaging. The state also bans cartoon or other child-friendly images, and has many other regulations. Dixie Brands uses those packaging rules for the products they make in every state. \u201cIf it is safe enough for Colorado, it will work for the other states,\u201d Mr. Smith said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company also uses the cleaner carbon dioxide extraction method to strip the oils from the plants instead of butane, even though it is not required everywhere. Colorado also requires multiple rounds of product testing in the manufacturing process, including testing of the raw plants, the extracted oil, batches of products and individual packages. Dixie Brands uses these guidelines everywhere it operates. \u201cWe want to have the highest level of precise consistency and quality control, so we follow Colorado\u2019s rules, even in states that are less strict,\u201d Mr. Smith said. Very few brands have made it to multiple states in the fragmented legal marijuana industry, so Dixie Brands is being watched closely. \u201cWe were pioneers to begin with seven years ago,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cand I think we are well positioned to take this leap.\u201d Correction: November 9, 2016 An earlier version of a picture caption accompanying this article had transposed the names of the founders of Dixie Brands.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some of that belief, but not all, was torn apart after the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, when many Christians felt threatened and fled as Arabs and Kurds fought over old animosities. Mosul, home for many former Baathist army officers suddenly tossed from power after the invasion, became a center of the Sunni insurgency and a stronghold of Al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor of the Islamic State. \u201cUntil 2003, the Mosul community was living in peaceful coexistence, but after that, things changed,\u201d said Jafar Khaleel, 46, who left Mosul in 2014 after the Islamic State onslaught. \u201cThe Sunnis don\u2019t trust the Shiites. The Shabak cannot live with the Christian. This is what the American occupation left behind.\u201d Photo Smoke choking the skies above Qayyarah, south of Mosul, on Wednesday after retreating members of the Islamic State set fire to oil wells. Credit Chris McGrath/Getty Images Back then, there was a social compact for Iraq\u2019s minorities that at least promised security in exchange for tolerating the tyranny and lack of personal freedoms under Saddam Hussein\u2019s government, led by an elite class of Iraq\u2019s minority Sunni population. Today, there is widespread nostalgia for that time, though it is not shared by most of Iraq\u2019s Shiite majority, now in power. \u201cFor generations, life was normal there,\u201d said Sabah Salim Dawood, 62, a Christian from Mosul. \u201cIn the factories, on the farms, in the offices, nobody asked, \u2018What are you?\u2019 \u201d Now there is a sense of unraveling that feels permanent. \u201cA man cannot describe in words what he misses,\u201d said Omar Ahmed, 29, who used to work in Mosul\u2019s Health Ministry and is now exiled in the northern Kurdish region. Walking through a ransacked church recently in Bartella, a mostly Christian town at the edge of Mosul, reveals an elegy to what has been lost. Some walls have been burned; others are streaked with Islamic State graffiti. A whiteboard on a wall in an anteroom lists a daily schedule for Islamic State recruits \u2014 fitness routines, weapons instructions and Shariah law lessons. Strewn on the floor are dusty reminders of those who once prayed there: Christian storybooks, copies of a \u201cquarterly social & cultural journal\u201d published by the Chaldean Church, a Santa Claus figurine, photographs of schoolgirls and a pink plastic rose. An old Iraqi tourist guide from the 1980s celebrated Mosul as a city whose rich history as a place of great Arab conquests important to the region\u2019s pre-Islamic past that made it \u201ca city of great importance.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its nickname as the \u201cthe city of two springs\u201d \u2014 because autumn and spring weather are so similar \u2014 was a testament to the city\u2019s livability. \u201cSince 1969, a Spring Festival has been held every year in Mosul,\u201d the tourist guide noted. \u201cFlower processions and folk dancing by thousands of people from every walk of life bring much gaiety to the place.\u201d Moslawis, as they are known, have their own dialect, and jokes, many based on their reputation for being stingy, which goes back to a famine in 1917, when they suffered as the Ottoman Empire took food from the city to feed its starving army. The rest of Iraq is known for its generosity, but a common joke goes that the only time a Moslawi will invite someone in for lunch is during Ramadan, when everyone is fasting.

Credit Chris McGrath/Getty Images Even so, the city is also known for its food, especially Mosul\u2019s kibbe , flat bulgur wheat discs stuffed with ground meat that are famous all over Iraq. There is the abundance of cultural heritage, the remnants of empires: ancient churches, monasteries, tombs, shrines and an antiquities museum that is important not just to Mosul but the broader Middle East. Nearly all have been destroyed or defaced by the Islamic State. Putting the city back together socially is \u201cgoing to take a very, very long time,\u201d said Rasha al-Aqeedi, a Sunni Arab from Mosul who now lives in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where she is a research fellow at the Al-Mesbar Studies and Research Center and writes about her home city . \u201cI think everyone is going to live on their own. The Yazidis are going to live on their own. Christians are going to live on their own. The Sunnis are going to live on their own.\u201d As a child, she recalls, her classroom had seven Christians, seven or eight Kurds, two or three Yazidis, one or two Shiites, and the rest Sunni Arabs. There were four or five languages spoken, she said, plus three religions and two sects of Islam. \u201cThat diversity you didn\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d she said. Walking to school, she would pass by a winged bull statue from Assyrian times, at the old city walls, that has been demolished by the Islamic State. \u201cI really regret now that I took them for granted,\u201d she said. Perhaps most painful is seeing former friends turn into enemies. Muhammad Sayed, 26, is Shiite, so for him there was only this choice when the Islamic State took over Mosul: Leave or be killed. Like many Shiites from the city, he eventually moved to Najaf, a holy city for his sect, where he now bakes bread and sells it on the street. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe Islamic State destroyed my childhood and my memories,\u201d he said. \u201cThey turned some of my friends into murdering terrorists, some of the friends that I studied with in primary school and high school, and I have the most beautiful memories with them. But they have joined the terrorists, and for them, I have become an infidel.\u201d The task of trying to stitch Iraq back together is immensely complicated. But for Iraqis who have been displaced, it all boils down to a single, simple human emotion. \u201cThe major problem in Iraq is dealing with fear,\u201d said Falah Mustafa, the Kurdish region\u2019s foreign minister, at a recent panel discussion in Erbil, about Mosul\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely painful to be betrayed by your neighbor.\u201d Follow Tim Arango on Twitter @tarangoNYT .

Or it could all end up as some horrid TV show, like that 1980s soap \"Dynasty,\" but with The Donald and the trophy wife and the beautiful kids and intrigue and money and power. We just don't know, yet. But until... President-elect Donald Trump may turn out to be a terrible president, or a good one. Or it could all end up as some horrid TV show, like that 1980s soap \"Dynasty,\" but with The Donald and the trophy wife and the beautiful kids and intrigue and money and power. We just don't know, yet. But until... (John Kass) She received more votes. He won more states, thus winning the electoral votes from those states, as is the law. Is this really fair? Or is it some dusty trick from some faded document, allowing the elites to enforce their will upon us again and again? With Clinton losing the electoral vote and winning the popular vote, as did her fellow Democrat Al Gore a few years ago, many Americans are offering reasons why we should just throw the Electoral College in the garbage and let the popular vote prevail. \"It is only fair,\" said a friend. \"Every vote counts. And the candidate with the most votes wins. What's wrong with that? It's called democracy.\" That's what it's called all right: Democracy, which means either the \"rule of the people\" or \"rule of the mob,\" depending on whether you just liked the songs in \"Hamilton\" or actually read his stuff. Democracy started in ancient Athens, when citizens (and citizens only) could cast pebbles and decide things. And majority rule has been the operative phrase. And why shouldn't the majority rule? Why should minorities like tiny \"Live Free or Die\" New Hampshire have sway over populous California? Even Trump once despised the Electoral College and said we should get rid of it. \"The Electoral College is a disaster for a democracy,\" he tweeted in 2012. Naturally, Trump didn't tweet his anti-Electoral College dreams when he won the presidential election over Clinton. Yet thoughtful people who voted for Hillary are making the case and doing it well. \"I think it is antiquated,\" wrote a reader from Naperville. \"Why deny a large group of people their voice by not counting their vote? My priority is still to count only the popular vote. What do you think?\" Nice, but when people ask me \"what do you think?\" I'm inclined to tell them, and often they're displeased. There is merit to the idea of a popular vote for president. It would certainly be efficient and speedy, especially with our advanced technology. The problem is that in some things I opt for inefficient and slow. Yeah, I'm weird like that. I'm not even a big fan of early voting. I figure that if voting is actually important to you, then you'll get up on Election Day and get your butt down to the polling place and cast a ballot in person. Still, if we got rid of the Electoral College, think of the shape of things to come. Soon after, we could have immediate national referendums on almost every important issue. And depending on America's mood, we could swing quickly, one way or another, this way and then back again. We wouldn't need a House of Representatives or a Senate. Legislation takes too long. The president could appoint governing bureaucrats who would move with great speed. States wouldn't count for much, if anything. They'd disappear eventually, as would the idea that the people of Kentucky might see things differently than the people of New York. The populated coasts would become supreme. And if California got passionate and wanted Great Lakes water, we'd have a quick national vote on it. Bingo. A pipeline to drain the lakes, and it's done. We'd have real democracy for a change. And the majority would rule. And that ancient experiment called a republic, designed to be inefficient and slow, to protect the minority view? Who'd want that anyway? ",

Yes California , a grass-roots organization with 3,000 or so supporters, has for years been trying to persuade Californians to take up the cause of secession. \u201cWe hit it big with Trump being elected,\u201d Marcus Ruiz Evans, a spokesman, said on Wednesday. California cannot, of course, just pick up and leave. Even if the state wanted to, an exit would require two-thirds approval of both the House and Senate in Washington, along with the blessing of 38 state legislatures \u2014 a feat analysts say is implausible. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Evans may be on to something. After Mr. Trump clinched his victory late Tuesday, at least three tech investors signaled a willingness to finance a secession effort. Shervin Pishevar, a co-founder of Hyperloop One, announced on Twitter that he would back a \u201clegitimate campaign\u201d for California to become its own nation. Marc Hemeon, another entrepreneur, responded to Mr. Pishevar saying to count him in. So did Dave Morin , a founder of the social network Path. Speaking by phone, Mr. Hemeon, who is the founder of Design Inc. in Orange County, said he was \u201creeling\u201d from Mr. Trump\u2019s win. He felt compelled to do something. \u201cFighting for your family \u2014 that\u2019s what it comes down to,\u201d said Mr. Hemeon, who has two daughters and a son.

Trump and chanted, \u201cNot my president!\u201d Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Calls for secession are not new in California. There have been at least 200 such proposals since the state\u2019s founding in 1850. Modern secessionists have argued that Californians have simply drifted too far culturally from the rest of the country. What\u2019s more, they say, with an economy larger than France , the state doesn\u2019t need America. Mr. Evans, of Yes California, said help from sympathizers in Silicon Valley, where anti-Trump sentiment runs deep, could help speed the way toward his group\u2019s nearest goal: a referendum on the ballot.

It\u2019s an intrinsic part of my manhood. It\u2019s not something that I think much about. I just have an organic need to keep altering my world for the better with tools. It seems as if these manly arts are fading. That\u2019s what awakens the evangelist in me to say, \u2018Hey guys, I understand you\u2019re depressed. Trust me, if you paint a closet in your house or if you go out and change your tire on your car, I can\u2019t tell you what an incredible feeling of accomplishment awaits you.\u2019 Is it hard to make a living these days as a woodworker? There are six workers in my shop making a living. It\u2019s not the most exorbitant living but they do get a lot of recompense that can\u2019t be counted in dollars.

Longtime advocate, Omarosa Manigault says yes. It got us thinking: Who would make the cut? USA TODAY NETWORK This file photo taken on June 25, 2016 shows then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaking to members of the media during a tour of his International Golf Links course in Balmedie, north of Aberdeen, on the east coast of Scotland on June 25, 2016. (Photo: MICHAL WACHUCIK, AFP/Getty Images) 2742 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 103 COMMENTEMAILMORE Crossing President-elect Trump's path is proving to be treacherous\u00a0and he's not even in office yet. Areas of the market Trump waged a war of words against - especially technology companies, emerging markets like China, Brazil, and Mexico and beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act - are being hit on the stock market. These drubbings quantify\u00a0just how different Trump's expected administration will be and how costly being on the wrong side appears. \"Investors are already repositioning their portfolios in favor of what they view as Trump Administration policies,\" says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at money management firm BMO Private Bank. \"Seemingly quiet trading on the surface masks the turbulence that\u2019s going on underneath.\" UAW backs Trump in effort to crush NAFTA Investors are already taking Trump at his word to rollback long-standing policies toward free trade, health care reform and push for changes in the technology industry. Some of the areas to suffer already include: * Technology stocks.\u00a0The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been conspicuously left out of the market's rally since Trump's win. The Nasdaq 100, an index of the largest non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq, is down 1.2% since the Trump election, lagging the 1.3% rally by the broader Standard & Poor's 500 and 2.6% rise by the Dow Jones industrial average. Trump has routinely fingered technology firms as a source of job losses and low tax rates. Amazon.com (AMZN) has especially been in Trump's cross hairs. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post, a news operation which has been a steady critic of Trump. Trump has accused Amazon of controlling too much of domestic commerce and paying too little in taxes. Shares of Amazon.com are down 5.8% since Trump won the election making it the 13 worst performing stock in Nasdaq 100. Bezos Thursday Tweeted a congratulations to Trump.\u00a0But Amazon.com isn't alone as Apple (AAPL) has been targeted by Trump due to its heavy reliance on overseas manufacturing. Apple is down 3% since the election. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. \u2014 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 * Emerging markets. Trump has routinely railed against several of the U.S. international trade pacts, stating these deals put other nations at a bigger advantage than the U.S. Investors expect revisions to these trade agreements that could slow down trade with other countries. That belief\u00a0is priced into various emerging markets stocks. The Vanguard Emerging Markets exchange traded fund sank 5.5% over the past few days. Not all emerging nations will be hurt equally, according to research by money management firm Causeway Capital. \"The disposal or renegotiation of trade deals would disproportionally hurt those economies with a significant dependence on exports such as Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Mexico,\" the report says. \"We expect more domestically focused economies, such as China, Thailand, and Indonesia, to be less affected.\" TECH AND EMERGING MARKETS STOCKS ARE LAGGING Index, % ch. since election Vanguard Emerging Markets index, -5.5% Nasdaq 100 index, -1.2% Dow Jones industrial average, 2.6% Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence * Hospitals. Trump's effect on healthcare is largely yet to be determined, but investors are already assuming the worst for hospitals. Seeing the repeal of Obamacare will likely increase the number of uninsured patients going to hospitals, which will be a cost for them. Tenet Healthcare (THC) is the second worst performing stock in the S&P 1500 since Trump won, declining 28%. In fact, health care facilities companies account for four of the 15 worst-performing stocks since the election, which is more than any other industry. Investors' fears may prove overblown as there are offsets to soften any hits. Trump's plans to lower corporate tax rates might encourage tech companies holding cash overseas to bring it to the U.S. and boost dividends. Trump election helps spur record Obamacare signups Much remains unknown about a Trump presidency. Trading in the 24 hours after an election is only predictive of the market in the next 12 months half the time, says investment firm Azzad Funds. \"Elections do not in and of themselves cause recessions,\" says Burt White, chief investment officer of LPL Financial in a note to clients. \"Policies can, however, and we need to wait to see which policies Trump moves forward with and the details of those policies.\" WORST PERFORMING NASDAQ 100 STOCKS SINCE ELECTION Company, Symbol, % ch. since election TripAdvisor, TRIP, -17.9% ",

    "text": "Trump Attorneys Open To Settling Trump University Case By Brian Ross Nov 10, 2016, 12:36 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump University: The Basics 0 Shares Email As President-elect Donald Trump met with top officials in Washington, D.C. today, including President Barack Obama , his attorneys went to a California courthouse where one told a judge he would be willing to work on settling a civil fraud case involving Trump University. At the urging of U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, attorney Daniel Petrocelli, representing Trump University, said he is \"all ears\" when it comes to another judge, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller, working with both sides for a resolution, according to The Associated Press . Petrocelli reportedly said that it didn't appear possible that Trump, who's in the midst of his transition to the White House, would be able to attend the trial, as previously expected. Donald Trump Uses Former Students to Fire Back in Trump U Controversy Curiel said he would allow Trump to testify via videoconference should the trial proceed, but said, \"It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that's involved,\" Reuters reported . The class-action suit, one of three concerning the now-defunct for-profit real estate training program, alleges that Trump University was little more than a moneymaking scheme in which students were \"lured\" in by Trump's name and then, \"instead of a complete real estate education, students merely received an 'infomercial' pushing additional seminars or workshops they were told they would need to take to succeed.\" Students were allegedly \"up-sold\" and eventually encouraged to spend more than $35,000 on classes and materials in exchange for \"guaranteed success.\" \"Based upon my personal experience and employment, I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money,\" former Trump University sales manager Ronald Schnackenberg said in a deposition for another lawsuit against Trump, also filed in California. A third suit targeting the program was filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in New York in August 2013. In court papers Trump has denied the allegations and said he will win the cases. Alan Garten, an attorney for the Trump Organization, previously told ABC News that he was \"very confident that we provided a valuable education to students and that those who participated got their money's worth.\" Today's hearing in California began after Curiel filed a \"tentative order,\" ruling on a number of motions from the plaintiffs and the defense regarding what should and should not be used by the opposing side in court. One battle that Trump's defense appears to have lost was to keep statements made by or about Trump during his presidential campaign out of the courtroom. The attorneys had argued that the statements, including everything from Trump's tweets to \"personal conduct accusations,\" could be \"highly prejudicial\" to Trump and Trump University. Curiel said he was denying the defense's blanket motion, but would hear specific objections when the trial started. Both California cases are overseen by Curiel, who Trump said during his presidential campaign has been \"totally biased.\" In June, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Curiel's Mexican heritage meant he had an \"absolute conflict\" in the case because of Trump's aggressive stance on immigration and his proposal to \"build a wall\" separating the U.S. and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents. ",

    "text": "Democrats won popular vote in the Senate, too Paul Singer , USA TODAY 6:17 p.m. EST November 10, 2016 1.0k Shares x Share Donald Trump's success on election night helped Republicans win control of the House and Senate down the ticket. USA TODAY NETWORK The White House may not be the only institution in Washington that Democrats lost on Tuesday despite getting more votes than Republicans. It turns out that Democrats also got more votes for the U.S. Senate than Republicans, and yet Republicans maintained their majority on Capitol Hill. In results that are still preliminary, 45.2\u00a0million Americans cast a vote for a Democratic Senate candidate, while 39.3 million Americans voted for a Republican. (In the White House race, as of Thursday afternoon, Clinton had 60.1 million votes and Trump had 59.8 million.) The problem for Democrats is that, much like the Electoral College, the number of votes matters less than where those votes are cast. In California, for example, there were two Democrats \u2014 Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez \u2014 competing for an open Senate seat, with no Republican on the ballot. Together, they received 7.8 million votes. If you count only Harris' winning vote total of 4.9 million, Democrats still tally 42.2 million votes. Had a Republican Senate candidate in California captured as many votes as Sanchez did \u2014 about 2.9 million \u2014 the total for the two parties nationwide would have been about even. Meet the new U.S. senators The vote totals for Senate are also a bit arbitrary because each state gets two senators no matter how few people live there. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was re-elected with 111,000 votes; Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York was re-elected with 4.8 million votes. Louisiana also complicates the calculations because there were 24 candidates running for a Senate seat and nobody got a majority of the votes. Republican candidates in that race collected 1.2 million votes while Democrats collected just under 700,000 votes. That race will be decided in a Dec. 10 runoff between the two top vote-getters,\u00a0Democrat Foster Campbell and Republican John Kennedy. Until that race is settled, Republicans have 51 Senate seats for the Congress that will convene in January; Democrats have 46, plus\u00a0two independents who generally align with them. Republicans captured the majority of the \"popular vote\" for the House on Election Day, collecting\u00a0about 56.3 million votes while Democrats got about 53.2 million, according to USA TODAY calculations. With a few races still undecided, Republicans so far hold a 239-193 majority for the next Congress. Contributing: Brad Heath Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Maine Chooses to Legalize Marijuana for Recreational Use By patrick whittle, associated press PORTLAND, Maine \u0097 Nov 10, 2016, 5:15 PM ET 0 Shares Email Maine residents have voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use in their state. The final results of the referendum were tabulated on Thursday. The count took nearly two days because of how close the race was, within a fraction of a percentage point, and The Associated Press made the call Thursday afternoon. Supporters had already declared themselves the winners and had predicted home cultivation of marijuana would be legal by around Christmas. \"The Maine people have passed it, and we should work on implementing it,\" said Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey, of Auburn, who supported the ballot issue. Medical marijuana was already legal in Maine. People 21 or older will now be allowed to use up to 2 1/2 ounces of marijuana, and retail marijuana shops and social clubs could open around the state. Some municipalities have balked at allowing such businesses to open in their communities. Opponents who had vowed to request a recount said on Thursday that they would meet to decide what to do next. \"We need to look at the numbers,\" said Scott Gagnon, an organizer of a campaign against legalization that portrayed legalization as a threat to the health and safety of children. The campaign that pushed for legalization turned immediately toward the implementation process on Thursday. They said they hope marijuana will be available in retail establishments by 2018. Marijuana won't become available at the retail level until after a state rulemaking process that could be slow and arduous. David Boyer, campaign manager for Yes On 1, said the people who advocated for legal marijuana will also play a role in its implementation. All of the marijuana sold in Maine will also be grown in Maine, he said. \"We're excited that Maine is going to join many other states that have decided to have a smarter marijuana policy \u2014 a policy that no longer punishes adults for smoking marijuana,\" Boyer said. Gov. Paul LePage , who opposed legalization, did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Pending the possibility of a recount, Maine joins California, Nevada and Massachusetts , which passed similar measures this week. Arizona rejected a similar measure. Recreational marijuana was already legal in Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. In Maine, the proposal allows people to cultivate, distribute and sell marijuana and marijuana products. Marijuana is set to be taxed at 10 percent and subject to local restrictions. Parents' groups and some law enforcement organizations opposed the proposal. The proposal also received scrutiny from members of the medical marijuana community, who say they fear it could replace the state's medical program. The secretary of state's office said Thursday that the largest bloc of uncounted votes that remained were from more than 4,000 overseas absentee voters. Those were counted and failed to make the difference for those who opposed legalization. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer David Sharp in Portland contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

By Philip Rucker and Robert Costa November 9 at 9:22 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @costareports Washington began its transition of power Wednesday as the ascendancy of President-elect Donald Trump promised a seismic shift in nearly every facet of the capital city, from military and executive agencies to federal courts and financial and political establishments. President Obama, who had denounced Trump as unfit to serve as commander in chief, struck a conciliatory note in the Rose Garden of the White House, vowing to work with his successor to ensure a peaceful transfer. The two men, who spoke by phone early Wednesday morning, plan to meet Thursday. Claiming an electoral mandate after maintaining majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump\u2019s resurgent Republican Party planned an aggressive and sweeping program to systematically dismantle Obama\u2019s policies and to usher in a new era of conservative governance. For the GOP, there were signs of unity after a season of acrimony brought by Trump\u2019s divisive candidacy, which antagonized party leaders. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who had all but abandoned the presidential nominee in the final weeks of the campaign, pledged that he and Trump would \u201cwork hand-in-hand on a positive agenda to tackle this country\u2019s big challenges.\u201d 1 of 51 Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory View Photos Vigils and protests flared up across the country Wednesday evening as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country. Caption Nov. 9, 2016 Thousands of people march up Fifth Avenue toward the Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Melina Mara/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \u201cNow is the time to shake the Earth,\u201d said William J. Bennett, a Trump ally and former education secretary in Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d [ How Donald Trump won: The insiders tell their story ] Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that Trump could \u201cunilaterally\u201d unravel Obama\u2019s legacy early next year \u2014 starting with the Affordable Care Act, the president\u2019s signature health-care accomplishment. But, McConnell said, \u201cI think it\u2019s always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it\u2019s going to be forever. Nothing is forever in this country. . . . We\u2019ve been given a temporary lease on power, if you will. And I think we need to use it responsibly.\u201d One key relationship for Trump could be the one with Sen. Charles E. Schumer, who is expected to become the Senate Democratic leader in January. \u201cIs he going to reach out to build a Trump majority which will include Democrats, whether it\u2019s in the Cabinet or the essential relationship with Schumer, who he\u2019s known for many, many years?\u201d asked former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to Trump and a potential appointee in the new administration. \u201cHe is positioned to be the president of a very large coalition \u2014 and that coalition is bigger than the Republican Party,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe has to think through, \u2018How do you operationalize that at a practical level that works?\u2019 \u201d How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea Trump called Schumer on Wednesday and the senator congratulated him. \u201cIt is time for the country to come together and heal the bitter wounds from the campaign,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. In New York, Trump confronted the urgent task not only of uniting a fractured nation but also of forming a government. The celebrity businessman, who has never before held public office, met at Trump Tower with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their advisers and contemplated the makeup of his White House and Cabinet, as well as what he would do following his Jan. 20 inauguration. A transition team chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has been working in Washington since the summer to lay the groundwork for a Trump administration. The group has been run by Rich Bagger, a longtime Christie adviser; William Hagerty, a key player on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s transition team; and other establishment hands. Michael O. Leavitt, a former Utah governor and health secretary in President George W. Bush\u2019s Cabinet who was Romney\u2019s transition chairman, has been informally advising the Trump team. Something Trump must contemplate is how transformative his initial plans might be. \u201cDoes he want to recruit people to manage the federal government or to change the federal government?\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThey\u2019re very different job descriptions . . . Do you go out and recruit people who\u2019ve turned companies around and not just people who\u2019ve managed companies? And do you set goals and metrics for them as change agents?\u201d [ What America\u2019s choice of Donald Trump really means ] Throughout his insurgent campaign, Trump has relied on a tight-knit cadre of aides and associates and has valued their loyalty above all else. Many of them are expected to join him in Washington. Two leading candidates for White House chief of staff are believed to be Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, and Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s first campaign manager who is now a paid commentator for CNN, according to two people familiar with the deliberations who requested anonymity because the talks are private. Both Priebus and Lewandow\u00adski were at Trump Tower on Wednesday, as were RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer, policy adviser Stephen Miller, campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon and other advisers. Priebus and Lewandowski would bring different attributes to the job. As party chairman for nearly six years, Priebus boasts deep ties with the GOP\u2019s elected officials, donors and other luminaries, as well as a long friendship and shared Wisconsin roots with Ryan, which could prove helpful in managing relationships at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Lewandowski would be a relative newcomer to the Washington power structure but has the trust and confidence of the president-elect, having mapped out the strategy for his improbable campaign and executed it during the primaries. Trump fired Lewandowski in June, though they have remained close, and Lewandowski is credited with helping guide Trump\u2019s general-election campaign in New Hampshire. \u201cCorey Lewandowski is trying very, very hard to become the chief of staff,\u201d said one Republican familiar with the talks about Trump\u2019s appointments. \u201cHe\u2019s been talking about it for months, preparing for months and lining up all the right people to get it done. . . . Corey is saying it\u2019s about loyalty. Nobody is more loyal.\u201d Trump\u2019s orbit was abuzz Wednesday with speculation about which other loyalists might land jobs in the new administration. Would Kellyanne Conway, a longtime pollster and communications guru who managed Trump\u2019s campaign in the closing months and became a calming influence on the often-undisciplined candidate, be at his side in the West Wing? Who would be the face of the White House in the press secretary role? Boris Epshteyn, a Trump surrogate who appeared frequently on cable television and anchored the campaign\u2019s Facebook Live broadcasts? Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s senior communications adviser? Or Spicer, a more familiar face for the Washington press corps? [ Many of Trump\u2019s sweeping promises will be hard, if not impossible, to fulfill ] Where might Christie land, after risking his political reputation to become in February one of the first establishment figures to endorse Trump? And would his connection to the bridge-closing scandal, in which two of his former aides were recently convicted, stymie his chances at Senate confirmation for Cabinet posts such as attorney general or secretary of state? Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean (R), who has known Christie for decades, said Christie was certain to end up somewhere in the administration \u201cbecause Trump values loyalty more than anything.\u201d William M. Daley, a former Obama White House chief of staff, said Trump should move slowly with making appointments and thoroughly vet his nominees. \u201cStumbles can be devastating and convey not being ready for prime time, which will be something they should be sensitive to,\u201d he said. Daley counseled the president-elect\u2019s team to \u201csay little and act in a deliberate way,\u201d adding that the new administration must show that it is seasoned and can be trusted to handle a crisis. He noted Trump\u2019s poor approval ratings and the fact that Clinton beat him in the national popular vote, despite losing in the electoral college. \u201cPeople will watch to see whether the new administration acts as though it has a mandate or looks at the fact that more people voted against him than for him as a brake on those who want revenge or want to jam ideas onto a skeptical people,\u201d Daley said. Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff to Reagan, said: \u201cTwenty-four hours ago, you and others were writing that Hillary\u2019s campaign was likely to succeed and we were in for four or eight more years of Obama. All that\u2019s out the window now. You have at least the opportunity for the Republicans to demonstrate that they not only have a desire but an ability to govern smartly and get this country back on track.\u201d Leavitt said there were critical tasks for Trump beyond selecting senior White House aides and agency heads. He will be expected to craft a plan to turn his campaign priorities into legislative and executive actions; make initial contact with foreign leaders in an orderly and diplomatic way; and prepare to move his family to Washington. \u201cYou\u2019re going from campaigning to governance, and there\u2019s a significant difference,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAll of those are things that have to happen in 77 days [before the inauguration]. It\u2019s a massive process.\u201d Patrick Caddell, a veteran pollster who is close to the Trump campaign, suggested that Trump \u201cget away to Mar-a-Lago for a few days to rest and think\u201d at his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., before fully diving into transition activities. \u201cHe\u2019s got to think through how to translate a popular uprising and movement into governing,\u201d Caddell said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make sure the people he hires understand why he\u2019s there and aren\u2019t only from the management class or people who know him.\u201d Paul Kane contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",
