    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 18, 2017 9:41 PM EST \u201c A Dog\u2019s Purpose \u201d -- the upcoming major motion picture based on the best-selling novel by W. Bruce Cameron -- is set to open later this month, but new footage obtained by TMZ may give animal lovers pause about going to see it. The exclusive video shows an animal trainer forcing a terrified German shepherd dog into a pool of raging water, while the animal tries desperately to escape. It\u2019s a chilling behind-the-scenes look at the filmmakers\u2019 attempt to recreate a scene from the book, in which a police K-9 named Ellie rescues someone from a rushing river.\u00a0 \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose,\u201d the movie for anyone who\u2019s ever loved and lost a dog Sources connected to the production reportedly told TMZ that eight outboard motors were used to churn the water that the canine actor so clearly did not want to enter.\u00a0 In the video, as the trainer struggles to drop the dog into the water, a voice can be heard saying, \u201cHe ain\u2019t gonna calm down \u2018til he goes in the water. Just got to throw him in.\u201d Shortly afterward, the trainer succeeds in getting the dog into the churning water, only to immediately pull the terrified animal back up onto the platform by his collar. Arguably, however, the most unsettling part of the video occurs later on, when the German shepherd -- who is one of at least five animal actors used in the production -- is struggling to swim through the raging water on the other end of the pool and suddenly goes under. Filmmakers then rush toward the area of water, under which the animal just disappeared, shouting, \u201cCut it!\u201d American Humane Society told the Associated Press that they are investigating. The Human Society also suspended its safety representative who worked on the film and is hiring an independent investigator to explore the matter, Mark Stubis, a spokesman for the organization, told AP.\u00a0 The director of the film took to social media Wednesday night, saying he was \u201cdisturbed by the video released today from the set of my film...\u201d I am very disturbed by the video released today from the set of my film A dog's purpose. \u2014 lasse hallstrom (@HallstromLasse) January 19, 2017 Lasse Hallstrom went on to say he did not witness the actions in the video, and he promises a thorough investigation.\u00a0 I did not witness these actions. We were all committed to providing a loving and safe environment for all the animals in the film. \u2014 lasse hallstrom (@HallstromLasse) January 19, 2017 I have been promised that a thorough investigation into this situation is underway and that any wrongdoing will be reported and punished. \u2014 lasse hallstrom (@HallstromLasse) January 19, 2017 Universal Pictures and Amblin Partners have now seen the video and tell TMZ that, \u201cFostering a safe environment and ensuring the ethical treatment of our animal actors was of the utmost importance to those involved in making this film, and we will look into the circumstances surrounding this video.\u201d ",

    "text": "Betsy DeVos prepares to testify at her confirmation hearing. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Betsy DeVos prepares to testify at her confirmation hearing. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images After Betsy DeVos' Senate confirmation hearing yesterday \u2014 all three hours and change \u2014 we know a little more about Donald Trump's pick to be the next education secretary. Appearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, DeVos faced questions on a range of issues, from private school vouchers and charter school oversight to guns in schools. We've reported extensively on DeVos' background , her advocacy in Michigan and on the research behind school choice . Below, we've pulled out some of the highlights from her hearing (with a little context where needed): Local Control \"President-elect Trump and I know it won't be Washington, D.C., that unlocks our nation's potential, nor a bigger bureaucracy, tougher mandates or a federal agency. The answer is local control and listening to parents, students, and teachers.\" This came from DeVos' opening remarks, and succinctly captures her education philosophy: Limit the role of government in America's schools and trust that the free market \u2014 and parent choice \u2014 will lead to innovation and improvement. Privatizing Public Schools DeVos' faith in the free market led to several tense exchanges, including this one with the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington: Article continues after sponsorship Murray: \"Can you commit to us tonight that you will not work to privatize public schools or cut a single penny from public education?\" DeVos: \"Senator, thanks for that question. I look forward, if confirmed, to working with you to talk about how we address the needs of all parents and all students. And we acknowledge today that not all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them. And I'm hopeful that we can work together to find common ground and ways that we can solve those issues and empower parents to make choices on behalf of their children that are right for them.\" Murray: \"I take that as not being willing to commit to not privatizing public schools or cutting money from education.\" DeVos: \"I guess I wouldn't characterize it in that way.\" Murray: \"Well,\" she said, laughing, \"OK.\" Ideology Meets Legal Reality The committee's chairman, Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican and former education secretary himself, asked DeVos whether she would try to push school vouchers onto states even though the federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act , does not include or allow it. \"No,\" she answered. \"I would hope I could convince you all of the merit of that in maybe some future legislation, but certainly not any kind of mandate from within the department.\" Qualifications Former senator \u2014 and former Democrat \u2014 Joe Lieberman introduced DeVos at the hearing. He has worked with her as a board member of her school choice advocacy group, The American Federation for Children . DeVos has never taught in, managed or attended a public school. \"I know that some people are questioning her qualifications to be secretary of education,\" Lieberman said. \"And too many of those questions, to me, seem to be based on the fact that she doesn't come from within the education establishment. But honestly I believe that today that's one of the most important qualifications you could have for this job.\" Grizzly Bears Perhaps the strangest exchange of the evening came in response to this question from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.: \"Do you think that guns have any place in or around schools?\" DeVos: \"I think that's best left to locales and states to decide. If the underlying question is...\" Murphy: \"You can't say definitively today that guns shouldn't be in school?\" DeVos: \"Well, I will refer back to Senator Enzi [that's Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.] and the school that he was talking about in Wapiti, Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.\" It's important to note that Murphy represents Connecticut where, in 2012, a gunman shot and killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Trump University And Gainful Employment President-elect Trump's shuttered Trump University loomed large over this back-and-forth between DeVos and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: Warren: \"Do you support protecting federal taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud and abuse?\" DeVos: \"Absolutely.\" Warren: \"Oh good, so do I. Because now we all know that President-elect Trump's experience with higher education was to create a fake university which resulted in his paying $25 million dollars to students that he cheated. So, I'm curious about how the Trump administration would protect against waste, fraud and abuse at similar for-profit colleges. So here's my question, How do you plan to protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud and abuse by colleges that take in millions of dollars in federal student aid?\" DeVos: \"Senator, if confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant...\" Warren: \"I'm asking how. You said you were committed. I'm asking how you are going to do that.\" DeVos: \"The individuals with whom I work in the department will ensure that federal monies are used properly and appropriately, and I will look forward to working with you.\" Warren: \"So you're going to subcontract in making sure that what happened with universities that cheat students doesn't happen anymore?\" DeVos: \"No, I didn't say...\" Warren: \"You're going to give that to someone else to do? I just want to know what your ideas are for making sure we don't have problems with waste, fraud and abuse.\" DeVos: \"I want to make sure we don't have problems with that as well. And if confirmed, I will work diligently to ensure that we are addressing any of those issues.\" Warren: \"Well, let me make a suggestion on this. It actually turns out that there's a whole group of rules that are already written and are there and all you have to do is enforce them. So what I want to know is, will you commit to enforcing these rules to ensure that no career college receives federal funds unless they can prove that they are actually preparing their students for gainful employment and not cheating them?\" DeVos: \"Senator, I will commit to ensuring that institutions which receive federal funds are actually serving their students well.\" Warren: \"And so you will enforce the gainful employment rule to ensure that these career colleges are not cheating students?\" DeVos: \"We will certainly review that rule.\" Warren: \"You'll review it? You won't commit to enforce it?\" DeVos: \"And see that it is actually achieving what the intentions are.\" Accountability DeVos has promoted the expansion of charter schools and private school voucher programs nationwide. Which led to this exchange with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.: Kaine: \"Do you think K-12 schools that receive federal funding should meet the same accountability standards, outcome standards?\" DeVos: \"All schools that receive public funding should be accountable, yes.\" Kaine: \"Should meet the same accountability standards?\" DeVos: \"Yes. Although, you have different accountability standards between traditional public schools and charter schools.\" Kaine: \"But I'm really interested in this, should everybody be on a level playing field? So public, charter or private K-12 schools, if they receive taxpayer funding, they should meet the same accountability standards?\" DeVos: \"Yes, they should be very transparent with the information. And parents should have that information first and foremost.\" Kaine: \"And, if confirmed, will you insist upon that equal accountability in any K-12 school or educational program that receives federal funding whether public, public charter or private?\" DeVos: \"I support accountability.\" Kaine: \"Equal accountability for all schools that receive federal funding.\" DeVos: \"I support accountability.\" Kaine: \"Okay, is that a yes or a no?\" DeVos: \"That's a, 'I support accountability.' \" Kaine: \"Do you not want to answer my question?\" DeVos: \"I support accountability.\" IDEA If DeVos had a true stumble last night, it came shortly after the exchange above, when Kaine pivoted to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act . The federal law requires schools to provide students with disabilities the same educational opportunities that they provide students without disabilities. Given the limited resources in many districts, the requirements of IDEA have often strained school budgets, and the law is now at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court case over just how far schools must go to meet the needs of their students with disabilities. DeVos, at least initially, appeared not to understand IDEA or how it works. Kaine: \"Should all K-12 schools that receive taxpayer funding be required to meet the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act?\" DeVos: \"I think that is a matter that's best left to the states.\" Kaine: \"So some states might be good to kids with disabilities, and other states might not be so good. And then, what? People can just move around the country if they don't like how their kids are being treated?\" DeVos: \"I think that's an issue that's best left to the states.\" Kaine: \"What about the federal requirement? It's a federal law \u2014 the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. Let's limit it to federal funding. If schools receive federal funding should they be required to follow federal law \u2014 whether they're public, public charter, or private?\" At this point, DeVos attempted to invoke a Florida program that came up earlier in the back-and-forth, but Kaine insisted on a yes or no answer. Ultimately, DeVos answered: \"I think that is certainly worth discussion.\" Later, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., followed-up: Hassan: \"Do you stand by your statement a few minutes ago that [IDEA] should be up to the states whether to follow it?\" DeVos: \"Federal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.\" Hassan: \"So were you unaware, when I just asked you about the IDEA, that it was a federal law?\" DeVos: \"I may have confused it.\" Wealth And Political Contributions Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wanted to know about DeVos' personal fortune. Sanders: \"Mrs. DeVos, there is a growing fear I think in this country that we are moving toward what some would call an oligarchic form of society. Where a small number of very, very wealthy billionaires control, to a significant degree, our economic and political life. Would you be so kind as to tell us how much money your family has contributed to the Republican party over the years?\" DeVos: \"Senator, first of all, thank you for that question. I, again, was pleased to meet you in your office last week. I wish I could give you that number. I don't know.\" Sanders: \"I have heard the number was 200 million. Does that sound in the ballpark?\" DeVos: \"Collectively? Between my entire family?\" Sanders: \"Yeah, over the years. Yes.\" DeVos: \"That's possible.\" Sanders: \"My question is, and I don't mean to be rude, but do you think, if you were not a multi-billionaire, if your family had not made hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions to the Republican party, that you would be sitting here today?\" DeVos: \"Senator, as a matter of fact, I do think that there would be that possibility. I've worked very hard on behalf of parents and children for the last almost 30 years to be a voice for parents, voice for students, and to empower parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, primarily low-income children.\" Sanders: \"Thank you.\" ",

By Justin Jouvenal By Justin Jouvenal January 18 at 6:46 PM Follow @jjouvenal Shane Bouvet stands near grain silos in his hometown of Stonington, Ill. Bouvet said that when he was a teenager, he climbed to the top of one of the silos to get a look at the world outside of Stonington. (David Zalaznik for The Washington Post) STONINGTON, ILL. \u2014 Shane Bouvet pointed to the towering grain silos near his parents\u2019 home in this \u201clittle speck in America\u201d and explained how he used to climb them to peer beyond the town\u2019s tight confines. Bouvet, 24, knew then he wanted a life outside, but the prospects for the former night watchman and single father living paycheck-to-paycheck seemed dim, before he improbably rose from delivering signs for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to becoming its volunteer social media coordinator in Illinois. His work earned him an invitation to an inaugural ball near Washington and he planned to attend the inauguration itself. It was an unprecedented opportunity, but he faced one last obstacle as he prepared to leave in recent weeks: How was he going to afford a proper suit and shoes? Much of Washington watches cynically at an inauguration that seems to shrink by the day, with celebrities dropping out of the festivities and the potential for greater attendance at a protest the next day. But loyal supporters are making plans to back a man they still have faith can make America great again. Hundreds of buses will be converging on Washington filled with well-wishers, including many rural voters who flocked to the polls, put out signs or donated a few dollars in an effort that added up to history for Donald Trump. They remain dazzled and want a front-row seat for his ascension. Among the throngs will be Bouvet, who on Wednesday piled into a car with friends and began the drive to Washington to stay at a Days Inn in Arlington. \u201cThis is pretty much the biggest thing I\u2019ve done in my life,\u201d Bouvet said of the inauguration. \u201cI don\u2019t get out much. I\u2019m a small-town, blue-collar guy.\u201d On a recent day, Bouvet was buoyant as he led a short tour of Stonington, a town of less than 1,000 in Southern Illinois with some homes that are boarded up and others sliding into disrepair. Despite skepticism from many, Bouvet said he felt confident that Trump's business experience and promise to bring jobs back to America would bring renewal to struggling and forgotten corners of the country, like his home town. He wanted a hand in the healing. Bouvet, who now works part-time as a FedEx courier, turned aside the questions raised about Russia\u2019s interference in the election and other controversies, saying the standard on which he would judge Trump on was right here in Stonington. An arrow on the prairie of central Illinois directs drivers to Stonington, Ill. (David Zalaznik for The Washington Post) The rear window of Shane Bouvet\u2019s car. (David Zalaznik for The Washington Post) Stonington, which sits amid tilled fields of rich, black earth flat as tabletops, has a story that became familiar during the election. It has been hard hit by plant closures and the shuttering of a nearby mine that once employed Bouvet\u2019s grandfather. Bouvet said his own father had worked hard at a local foundry to move the family from a trailer into a tidy home. Now, he has cancer, and his mother faces a long commute to a minimum-wage job after a layoff. \u201cI get tired of seeing people hit rock bottom,\u201d Bouvet said. \u201cIf you go to the coffee shops, the old guys talk about the old days when engines roared and things weren't built in China.\u201d Shane Bouvet and his son, Landon, eat at a restaurant in Springfield, Ill. (David Zalaznik for The Washington Post) Bouvet said his unlikely foray into presidential politics began during the Republican primary. Bouvet, who has dabbled in local politics, was going through an expensive custody dispute over his 4-year-old son and was working nights as a security guard at a hospital. The boy\u2019s birth had derailed, at least temporarily, his dream of becoming the first person in his family to get a degree at a four-year college. Bouvet was in turmoil and he said Trump's blunt and unfiltered style, plus the fact that his bid for the presidency was dismissed by many, appealed to an underdog like himself. After working nights at the hospital, Bouvet began spending his days supporting Trump. He delivered Trump signs, made cold calls for the candidate and posted pro-Trump memes on Facebook. \u201cTHROWN TO THE WOLVES\u201d reads the text on a photo of Trump striding confidently in front of his private jet, \u201cCOMES BACK LEADER OF THE PACK.\u201d Bouvet\u2019s campaign work reached a new pitch, after attending a Trump rally last March. Bouvet said he arrived at the Peabody Opera House in St. Louis about 12 hours early to ensure he got into Trump\u2019s appearance. He said he shivered through the night, standing in line without a coat. At one point, he waved a Trump flag in front of the opera house as people chanted, \u201cU-S-A.!\u201d When Trump\u2019s speech was over, Bouvet said he pushed through the crowd to try to meet Trump. The encounter was brief, but it was enough that Bouvet recalls it glowingly: He said Trump told him it was amazing he had waited hours, and he autographed a campaign sign for Bouvet before moving on in the swirl of people. Bouvet said he felt part of something bigger \u2014 a movement. Afterward, Bouvet went door-to-door for Trump in Stonington and other towns nearby. He said he paid for about 3,000 Trump stickers out of his own pocket to hand out at the Illinois State Fair. Bouvet upped his work organizing on Facebook and received an offer to become the volunteer coordinator for social media for Trump\u2019s campaign in Illinois in August. \u201cHe grew our audience,\u201d said Stephanie Holderfield, the director of the Trump campaign in Illinois. \u201cHe\u2019s young and he\u2019s energetic. He had good, positive messaging.\u201d Kathy Bouvet helps her son, Shane Bouvet, put shoes on the feet of his son, Landon, 4, at a Springfield, Ill., store. (David Zalaznik for The Washington Post) The efforts culminated on election night. Bouvet said he broke down crying as the results came in. Trump\u2019s surprise victory was his own. Lisa Christiansen, an actress, life coach and Trump supporter, said she invited Bouvet to the Great American Inaugural Ball at the MGM National Harbor after meeting him online and seeing his social media work. She said they plan to attend the inauguration together. Bouvet\u2019s background reminded her of her own challenges growing up. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to reach to people that might not otherwise have the opportunity,\u201d Christiansen said of the invitation. With the invitation in hand, Bouvet scanned his wardrobe for something to wear. He had old suits, but nothing appropriate for an evening ball, let alone the proper shoes. He thought about scrimping a few dollars from his paycheck. That was when Mike Bell, a former teacher and a politico from Bouvet's part of Illinois, stepped in. \u201cI've known him long enough that when he told me he was going to inaugural ball, he would need a suit,\u201d Bell said of Bouvet. \u201cWe went to Men\u2019s Warehouse.\u201d Bell said he was also able to secure a donation of Allen Edmonds dress shoes. The Wisconsin shoemaker has regularly provided shoes to presidents for their inaugurations. On a recent day, Bouvet modeled his black suit as his parent's looked on in the home they share. Bouvet spoke excitedly of the connections he might make in Washington, a city he thought of more for its possibilities and history than as a political swamp. He wants to see the Tomb of the Unknowns and other landmarks. Bouvet hopes to bootstrap his work on the Trump campaign into opportunities with others. It\u2019s a long shot, but Bouvet also hopes he can speak to the man he credits with widening his world. \u201cI'd look him in the eye and, say, \u2018Sir, I . . .\u2019 \u201d Bouvet said confidently, before lapsing into an uncharacteristic and uncertain pause. \u201cI wouldn't know what to say.\u2019\u201d Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report. local ",

AP hide caption toggle caption AP A woman looks down an empty street Wednesday in Banjul, Gambia, hours before the end of longtime leader Yahya Jammeh's mandate. AP In a few hours, longtime Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh's presidential term will expire. But he is clinging to power as troops from regional powers reportedly amass at the border. International and regional powers are demanding that Jammeh step down and make way for his rival, businessman Adama Barrow, who won last month' s presidential election. The African Union has stated that it will stop recognizing Jammeh as president after his term expires at midnight local time. (Gambia is five hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast.) And ECOWAS, the West African regional bloc, appears to be preparing to enforce the election result by force. The Nigerian air force said in a statement that it has moved \"a contingent of 200 men and air assets\" to Senegal's capital, Dakar, \"from where it is expected to operate into Gambia.\" Senegalese forces also are poised to cross the border, army spokesman Col. Abdou Ndiaye tells Reuters. \"We are ready and are awaiting the deadline at midnight. If no political solution is found, we will step in,\" Ndiaye said, according to the wire service. Article continues after sponsorship ECOWAS had earlier threatened military action if Jammeh refused to leave and is seeking \"the U.N. Security Council's endorsement of its 'all necessary measures' to help remove Jammeh from power,\" The Associated Press reported. Gambia, \"a country of 1.9 million people, is estimated to have just 900 troops,\" according to the wire service. Jammeh, who has been president since he led a coup 22 years ago, initially accepted the result of the Dec. 1 election \u2014 but dramatically changed his mind a week later, saying that the results were void because of voting \"irregularities.\" And earlier this week, he issued a 90-day state of emergency. Parliament also extended his term for another three months earlier today, according to news reports, though that hasn't appeared to ease the tension heading into tomorrow's deadline. Meanwhile, it appears Barrow is preparing to be sworn in as president. It's unclear where that ceremony would take place, as Barrow is in Senegal for his own protection. \"Our future starts tomorrow,\" Barrow said in a tweet. We made history on the first day of December. Our future starts tomorrow. #Gambia pic.twitter.com/kSxUcROONJ \u2014 Adama Barrow (@adama_barrow) January 18, 2017 Since Jammeh lost the election, \"Gambian authorities have arbitrarily arrested opposition sympathizers and closed four independent radio stations,\" according to Amnesty International . The U.N.'s refugee agency says thousands of Gambians fearing violence have fled across the border to Senegal. Tourists are also evacuating the country and a correspondent with The Guardian is posting pictures of crowded halls in the capital's airport, saying it is \"absolute chaos.\" Banjul airport is absolute chaos with miffed tourists everywhere #Gambia pic.twitter.com/nkf3TcIfiE \u2014 Ruth Maclean (@ruthmaclean) January 18, 2017 Tour operator Thomas Cook said it is operating extra flights in order to \"get our UK customers home from the Gambia as quickly as possible.\" The company adds that it hopes to transport some 3,500 people on 16 flights by Friday. The smallest country on the African continent is a popular destination for tourists seeking sandy beaches. ",

By Valerie Strauss By Valerie Strauss January 18 at 1:46 AM Follow @valeriestrauss Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary, appeared before senators at her confirmation hearing on Jan. 17, but some of her responses created more questions than they answered. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) At her contentious confirmation hearing as Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be education secretary on Tuesday, Betsy DeVos was asked a question by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) about an important education debate involving how student progress should be measured. The query essentially rendered her speechless as she appeared\u00a0not to know how to answer. When Franken told her he was upset she didn\u2019t understand it, she did not protest. That was just one of several moments during the hearing in which DeVos either displayed a lack of knowledge about education fundamentals or refused to answer questions that Democratic members of the Senate Education Committee believe are critical to her fitness for the job. [ Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s education pick, lauded as bold reformer, called unfit for job ] Here are some of the notable\u00a0moments: DeVos refused to agree with a Democrat that schools are no place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect against grizzly bears. (She really said this.) When Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) asked her whether she would agree that guns don\u2019t belong in schools, she said: \u201cI will refer back to Sen. [Mike] Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.\u201d And when asked whether she would support President-elect Donald Trump if he, as he has promised, moves to end gun-free zones around schools, she said: \u201cI will support what the president-elect does.\u201d She added: \u201cIf the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence.\u201d [ Do guns belong in schools? Trump\u2019s education pick declines to take a stand. ] DeVos seemed to have no understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. DeVos said that states should have the right to decide whether to enforce IDEA, but when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) later told her that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and asked DeVos if she stood by her statement that it was up to the states to follow it, DeVos responded, \u201cFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.\u201d Hassan then asked, \u201cSo were you unaware when I just asked you about the IDEA that it was a federal law?\u201d DeVos responded, \u201cI may have confused it.\u201d DeVos did not protest when Hassan said she was upset the nominee didn\u2019t understand the law and urged her to learn about it. [ Betsy DeVos apparently \u2018confused\u2019 about federal law protecting students with disabilities ] DeVos refused to agree with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) that all schools that receive public federal funds \u2014 traditional public, public charter or private schools that receive voucher money \u2014 should be held to the same standards of accountability. Kaine: \u201cIf confirmed will you insist upon equal accountability in any K-12 school or educational program that receives taxpayer funding whether public, public charter or private?\u201d DeVos: \u201cI support accountability.\u201d Kaine: \u201cIs that a yes or a no?\u201d DeVos: \u201cI support accountability.\u201d Kaine: \u201cDo you not want to answer my question?\u201d DeVos: \u201cI support accountability.\u201d Kaine: \u201cLet me ask you this. I think all schools that receive taxpayer funding should be equally accountable. Do you agree?\u201d DeVos: \u201cWell they don\u2019t, they are not today.\u201d Kaine: \u201cWell, I think they should. Do you agree with me? DeVos: \u201cWell no . . . \u201d Kaine, interrupting her, said: \u201cYou don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d And he moved on to another topic. [ In Senate hearing, DeVos stoked activists\u2019 fears that she will ignore education civil rights ] DeVos said she would review gainful employment regulations without committing to enforce them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked DeVos how she planned to protect waste, fraud and abuse from for-profit universities, citing Trump University, which President-elect Donald Trump founded; he ultimately paid $25 million to settle lawsuits by students who said they were cheated. Trump said he paid the money so he could focus on getting ready to run the country. DeVos said, \u201cIf confirmed, I will certainly be very vigilant.\u201d Warren persisted, \u201cI\u2019m asking how.\u201d When DeVos said \u201cindividuals with whom\u201d she will work in the department will ensure that federal money is properly used, Warren further dug in, and then explained to DeVos that there is actually a group of rules already on the books, the gainful employment regulations. \u201cAll you have to do is enforce then,\u201d Warren said, asking DeVos if she would do so. She wouldn\u2019t commit. The gainful employment regulations are meant to protect students and taxpayers by withholding federal student aid to career training programs that leave students buried in debt with few opportunities to repay. Asked by Warren if she would enforce the regulations, DeVos said: \u201cWe will certainly review that rule, and see if it is actually achieving what the intentions are.\u201d Warren: \u201cI don\u2019t understand about reviewing it. We talked about this in my office. There are already rules in place to stop waste, fraud and abuse. . . . Swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this.\u201d [ What we learned about Betsy DeVos\u2019s higher education positions \u2026 not much ] Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) at the hearing for\u00a0Betsy DeVos. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) DeVos appeared to have no idea what Franken was talking about when he referred to the accountability debate about whether to use test scores to measure student proficiency or student growth. Franken noted that the subject had been debated in the education community for years, and said, when she didn\u2019t weigh in and just looked at him without much of an expression on her face, \u201cIt surprises me that you don\u2019t know this issue.\u201d DeVos did not answer Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) when he asked her what she had learned about the failures of the Detroit traditional public and public charter schools that would inform her decision-making as the secretary of education. Bennet, a big supporter of charter schools, made the point that school choice isn\u2019t much of a choice when schools aren\u2019t held accountable and families have lousy choices wherever they look. He noted that the Detroit public schools \u2014 one of the country\u2019s most troubled systems \u2014 has low student achievement, and charter schools in Detroit score only minimally higher.\u00a0 He also cited a study that said charter schools across Michigan perform worse the traditional public schools do. But instead of answering his question, she told him she wanted to give him \u201ccontext\u201d about Detroit, to which he responded, \u201cWith respect, I\u2019m not asking for a history of Detroit.\u201d She also said, \u201cI think there is a lot that has gone right\u201d there, but she never answered his question. And here\u2019s a bonus: DeVos said her name should not have been included on tax forms for her mother\u2019s foundation, which has contributed to controversial causes. The forms say that she was vice president and a member of the board. \u201cThat was a clerical error,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cI have never made decisions on my mother\u2019s behalf.\u201d ",

Many white working class voters found a more natural home in the GOP as both parties swapped territory and became more ideologically consistent. But these voters might have stayed if Democrats had made more of an effort to retain them. In 2008, the Democratic base had been reborn. Obama\u2019s victory that year would have looked foreign to Jackson and even Roosevelt.\u00a0But as much as the Obama coalition was powered by young people, minorities, single women and educated urban dwellers, it also crucially included many blue collar whites. Union members helped him win Scranton, Pennsylvania,\u00a0by 26 points (Clinton eked out a 3-point margin in 2016), and farmers helped him carry Iowa by 9\u00a0percentage points (Clinton lost it by 9). In fact, Obama actually won more raw votes from non-college educated whites \u2014 because they are so numerous \u2014 than from African-Americans, Latinos, or educated whites. Obama lost non-college educated whites by large margins in both 2008 and 2012, but they were still crucial to his victory. In fact, he actually won more raw votes \u00a0from non-college educated whites \u2014 because they are so numerous \u2014 than from African-Americans, Latinos, or educated whites. They remain the single largest demographic voting bloc, even as their share declines slowly over time. But Obama\u2019s success obscured his party\u2019s decomposition further down the ballot as the Democratic Party completed its metamorphosis from a working class white party based in the South to a multiethnic one based in cities. Democrats once swept rural counties. Today their wins are concentrated in high-density, urban areas. Source: 2015 Density data from the American Community Survey 5-year. 1932 density data from the 1930 Census. 1932 election results from Dave Leip\u2019s Atlas of U.S. Elections. 2016 data from NBC News. Density values are log-scaled. Trendline is computed with a linear model. The last white Deep Southern Democrat in Congress, Georgia Rep. John Barrow, wasn\u2019t ousted until 2014. And it took until 2016 for Democrats to lose their final legislative chamber in the South, the Kentucky House of Representatives, which they had held without interruption since 1920. The day after the election, Democrats woke up to a party that had lost most rural areas of the country, leaving behind a map that today looks like an archipelago of blue cities swimming in an ocean of red. Once a mainstay of the white working class, the Democratic Party\u00a0experienced a dramatic shift in makeup through the decades, with\u00a0the civil rights era ushering in a profound change. Geography is destiny? Democrats\u2019 wipe out in rural areas is politically deadly. The party\u2019s most obvious problem in 2016 was geographic: They got more votes across the country, but in the wrong places. For the second time in 16 years, Democrats lost the Electoral College \u2014 and the presidency \u2014 even though they won the popular vote. And if you add up all 34 Senate races last year, Democrats won 6 million more votes, thanks largely to California and New York,\u00a0while failing to retake control of the chamber. In 2012, they won 1 million more votes in the House and didn\u2019t come close to winning it. Democrats are quick blame Republican gerrymandering. Obama\u2019s former Attorney General Eric Holder recently launched \u00a0a party-wide effort, backed by the outgoing president,\u00a0focused on turning the tables on gerrymandering by winning back state legislatures ahead of 2020, when they will redraw congressional districts. The effort is crucial to Democrats\u2019 ability to win back the House, since the party has only one chance to change the maps every 10 years. But Democrats a have a deeper, structural problem beyond gerrymandering. Democrats lost the House in 2010 before Republicans had redrawn the maps. The problem is quirky but its effects are profound: Electorally speaking, Democrats live in the wrong places. America\u2019s electoral system rewards the party whose voters are more spread out across the map and, for now, that means the GOP. Democrats are densely packed in major cities where they waste millions of votes winning inefficiently huge margins\u00a0that can\u2019t be effectively redistributed no matter which party is drawing the congressional districts. In Pennsylvania, for example, Republicans control 13 of the state\u2019s 18 congressional districts even though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state by close to 1 million voters. Republican gerrymandering is responsible for much of that mismatch. But GOP mapmakers were aided by the fact that Democrats tend to be inefficiently concentrated in the state\u2019s two major cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The divide between the coasts was sharp in 2016. But past Democratic candidates won the heartland. Source: Coastal distances computed over projected distance from the center of each county to the nearest East or West coast as defined by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration GIS files. 1932 results from Dave Leip\u2019s Atlas of U.S. Elections. 2016 data from NBC News. Trendline computed with a linear model. Jowie Chen, a professor at the University of Michigan, has run hundreds of computer simulations to compare real election results to hypothetical ones in\u00a0non-gerrymandered districts.\u00a0The results show Democrats\u2019 unintentional self-gerrymandering is arguably a bigger handicap than the GOP\u2019s intentional gerrymandering. In 2014, for instance, Republicans won 247 House seats with the help of Republican-leaning districts gerrymandered after the 2010 census. According to Chen\u2019s simulations, however, the GOP still would have won 245 seat if the election were run again in non-gerrymandered districts. Gerrymandering can have a big impact on individual states, like in politically divided North Carolina, where snaking districts help Republicans control 10 of the state\u2019s 13 congressional seats. But Democrats also play this game in states they control, offsetting Republican gerrymandering, according to Chen. Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate Tim Kaine delivered a speech entirely in Spanish to voters in Arizona (left) only days before the election \u2014 too late by some measures. Earlier in the year, the\u00a02016 Democratic National Convention (right) was held in Philadelphia, a city that exemplified the party\u2019s ineffective concentration of power. Of course Democrats don\u2019t want\u00a0non-gerrymandered districts \u2014 they want district maps doctored for their advantage. So the potential upside from retaking state legislatures is significant. But in the aggregate, their gerrymanders will never be quite as effective as their more rural opponents. Cities aren\u2019t the only problem. Far-flung Democratic clusters along\u00a0old industrial canals or small towns where universities happen to have been built a century ago\u00a0also lead to wasted votes. In conservative North Florida, for example, Democrats have pockets of support in Gainesville, home of the University of Florida, and in the state capital, Tallahassee. Clinton won Alachua and Leon Counties, home to both of those cities, respectively, by a 25-point margin. But geographically isolated\u00a0Democratic redoubts like these often get subsumed by their conservative surroundings\u00a0in congressional or state Senate elections with broad geographic districts. Fluky as it may be, the inefficient distribution of Democratic voters makes it harder for Democrats to win no matter how congressional districts, state legislative districts, and even state boundaries are drawn. The mere existence of political boundaries at all is the problem. \u201cBecause of the urbanization of the Democratic Party, any sort of geographic line-drawing is inherently going to value the rural party, and that\u2019s the Republicans,\u201d said Chen. \u201cThere is no level of geography that systematically favors Democrats over the Republicans. There is no state where Democrats are geographically advantaged.\u201d And when it comes to the presidency, what matters is winning states \u2014 as 2016 showed clearly \u2014 not the national popular vote, thanks to the Electoral College. So anything that makes it a little harder for Democrats to win individual states also makes it a little harder to win the White House. Democrats\u00a0have long grumbled about their\u00a0 disadvantage in the Senate , where the heavily populated blue states of California and New York get the same two senators as do tiny red Wyoming or Idaho. The Senate makeup compounds Democrats\u2019 disadvantage at the presidential level as well, since individual states receive the same level of representation in the Electoral College as they get in Congress, further empowering small states at the expense of large ones. If you don\u2019t hear much about this problem from Democrats, it\u2019s because the forces behind self-gerrymandering are more economic and cultural than political. Three-quarters of liberals say they prefer to live where \u201cthe houses are smaller and closer to each other, but schools, stores, and restaurants are within walking distance,\u201d according to a Pew survey.\u00a0An equal portion of conservatives say they prefer places where the houses are larger, but amenities are miles away. People with college degrees often move to cities to pursue economic opportunities while their non-college cohort stay home. So cities suck up liberals from the countryside, leaving behind vast swaths of unguarded territory for Republicans. And there\u2019s \u00a0 data \u00a0to suggest living in cities actually make people more liberal. Progressives are not sure how to address this problem other than to encourage hipsters to move to Iowa, as journalist Alec McGillis once suggested \u00a0in a New York Times op-ed. A sign showing support for then Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama next to a cornfield in Iowa in 2007. Charles Ommanney/Getty Images Making Des Moines \u2014 or Columbus, Ohio, or Raleigh, North Carolina, for instance \u2014 cool enough to attract would-be political homesteaders from Brooklyn may be outside the realm of traditional political strategy, but it might be one of the most effective ways for Democrats to secure their future. Des Moines and other small cities are becoming increasingly attractive places to live, thanks to growing knowledge industries and revitalized downtowns. And the rising cost of living in major metros like San Francisco and New York are pushing many millennials to look elsewhere. Forbes named \u00a0Des Moines the best city for Young Professionals in 2011, while Raleigh and Columbus both made the top 10 \u00a0last year. Without dramatic geographical shifts,\u00a0the trend will only get worse for Democrats as both parties\u2019 voters increasingly gravitate toward politically like-minded communities without even realizing it, a phenomenon laid out in Bill Bishop\u2019s 2004 book \u201cThe Big Sort.\u201d Politics is becoming a bigger part of people\u2019s identity, Bishop said, and a reliable indicator of what kind of car you drive, TV you watch, or food you eat. And with more mobility than ever, Americans naturally end up clustering together with people like them, leading to more politically polarized communities. Democratic voters have become even more inefficiently distributed since 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote by a narrower margin than Clinton, while also losing the Electoral College. And Democratic voters will distribute themselves even less efficiently in 2020 and 2024 and beyond \u2014 unless there\u2019s a sudden exodus from major cities and the coasts. Democrats\u2019 distribution problem is not a fatal curse, but they\u2019ll have to overcome the handicap and attract more voters in Republican-leaning areas.

Andrew Harnik/Associated Press Demographics Last year, two demographers influential in Democratic circles, Bill Frey of the Brookings Institution and Ruy Teixeira of the Center for American Progress, along with Center for American Progress statistician and policy expert Rob Griffin, explored a half dozen possible paths for each party in the 2016 election.\u00a0Most scenarios they ran through their rigorous statistical analysis \u00a0favored Democrats, given the country\u2019s underlying demographic change\u00a0in the party\u2019s favor.\u00a0But one represented the party\u2019s nightmare: Scenario F. Scenario F predicted a hypothetical surge of white working class voters for Republicans on Election Day, similar to the one that actually helped Trump win. Their prediction nearly nailed the results (they missed the regional nature of Trump\u2019s bump, assuming the surge would be more national), so Teixeira and Fry\u2019s other conclusions should worry Democrats. If they can keep those white working class voters in future presidential elections, \u201cRepublicans could obtain and keep an electoral vote advantage over a number of cycles, despite underlying demographic changes that favor Democrats,\u201d the simulations predicted. Worse,\u00a0even\u00a0if Democrats got a similarly sized surge in minority votes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Scenario E \u2014 \u201cDemocrats do not pick up any additional electoral votes,\u201d the researchers added. Unfortunately for Democrats, their geographic and demographic challenges overlap.\u00a0For instance, Latinos, among whom Democrats have the most\u00a0room to improve turnout, often live in politically unhelpful places. California alone is home \u00a0to more than a quarter of the nation\u2019s Latinos while another fifth\u00a0live in Texas. Midterm elections, like the upcoming one in 2018, remain a challenge for the Obama coalition. Young people, minorities, and single women don\u2019t come to the polls as reliably as Republicans\u2019 older and whiter voters, contributing to the massive losses Democrats suffered in 2010 and 2014. Democrats can win big in midterms, as they did in 2006. But that victory was fueled by a massive backlash against George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, making it more of a fluke than a model. Democrats may get another windfall next year if Trump\u2019s remains unpopular, but they\u2019ll need a more sustainable way to win elections without the boost of a presidential campaign. Part Two What lies ahead The Democratic Party has been written off before, even as recently as 2002, when Bush consolidated power with Republican gains in both the House and Senate. But just four years later, Democrats took back Congress, and six years later they retook the White House, too, in a landslide. Since the November election, the Democratic Party has been gripped by an existential dilemma: Does it try to win back white working class voters or cut them loose? While the choices aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, they involve trade-offs in how the party speaks to voters and which ideas it prioritizes. DeRay Mckessan Civil Rights Activist \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember, white people aren\u2019t the only working class voters in America.\u201d To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser                         that supports HTML5 video Photo by Patrick Semansky/Associated Press While Democrats will inevitably attempt to pursue some combination of both \u2014 \u201cWe don\u2019t need to decide between social justice and economic justice. We\u2019ve got to have all of that,\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair candidate Keith Ellison said \u2014 it\u2019s worthwhile to examine the choices separately to clarify the differences. 0. Baseline Democrats could always just call 2016 a black swan event\u00a0and carry on without major changes. Clinton won the popular vote, after all, and many Democrats think she only lost the Electoral College because of Russian hacking or FBI Director James Comey\u2019s last-minute intervention. In the 2020 presidential election, the electorate will continue to evolve in Democrats\u2019 favor as minorities and millennials make up a larger share of overall voters while non-college educated whites continue to decline. Indeed, four more years of natural demographic changes alone might be enough to give Democrats the relatively tiny number of voters Clinton would have needed in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College in 2016.

REUTERS/Marco Bello - RTSVRHG Venezuela may now be the country in the world with the most millionaires. There is, however, a caveat. That money isn\u2019t worth much anywhere else in the world. VENEZUELA'S MADURO: TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE CAN'T BE WORSE THAN OBAMA Amid rampant inflation, widespread shortages of everything from toilet paper to medicine and a failing economy, the Venezuelan government recently introduced three new bank notes into the market ranging from 500 to 20,000 bolivars. But while somebody in Caracas can now carry 1 million bolivars in his billfold, in terms of U.S. currency those 50 bank notes are only worth only about $300 on the country\u2019s black market and one bill is valued at less than $6. NEW VENEZUELAN VP'S ALLEGED TIES WITH HEZBOLLAH, RADICALISM RAISE CONCERNS \u201cThat won\u2019t get you very far,\u201d Chris Sabatini, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s like the government has almost given up. They are just adding zeros to the end of these bills and they don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Expand / Contract Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro sits quietly during a ceremony for the athletes that will participate in the upcoming Toronto Pan American games, at Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, June 16, 2015. (The Associated Press) Sabatini added: \u201cThere\u2019s going to come a time when they\u2019re going to run out of space on the bill for all those zeros.\u201d Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said the switch to the new bills was to combat smuggling along the country\u2019s border with Colombia. He added that transnational gangs hold \"entire warehouses full of 100-bolivar notes in the [Colombian cities of] Cucuta, Cartagena, Maicao and Buaramanga.\u201d The government also believes that the new bills will help make shopping easier for Venezuelans as they currently have to carry large wads of bank notes around with them to obtain even basic supplies. Before the new notes were introduced the highest bill in Venezuela was 100 bolivars, which is worth about 3\u00a2 on the country\u2019s black market. No official inflation data is available for 2016, but many economists believe Venezuela ended the year in triple digits, and it is forecasted to hit 1,600 percent this year. Despite government assertions that the new currency is meant to combat smuggling, many Venezuelans appear are skeptical. \u201cI think it is more of the same,\u201d one Caracas resident waiting outside a bank told the BBC earlier this week. \u201cEffectively what we are doing is putting more money on the street, attracting more inflation.\u201d Since global oil prices plunged in 2015, Venezuela hasn\u2019t had the funds to import basic goods such as food and medicine, creating acute shortages and stirring anger toward Maduro. Adding to the overall misery are a drastic rise in violent crime, especially in the capital city of Caracas, rolling blackouts and widespread and often times bloody protests against the government. There have been casualties and deaths on both sides of the protests and accusations from the international community of human rights abuses and political oppression. \u201cThe pressure that Venezuelans face every day is tremendous because of all the uncertainty,\u201d Sonia Schott, the former Washington, D.C., correspondent for Venezuelan news network Globovisi\u00f3n, told FoxNews.com. \u201cNobody knows what will happen the next day.\u201d Adding to the difficulties with the new bills is that 100 bolivar bill makes up to nearly 50 percent of the banknotes used in the country, according to Central Bank data released in November, with more than 6.1 billion of the 100 bolivar bills currently in circulation. The Maduro government initially imposed a 72-hour time limit for citizens to change or deposit their 100-bolivar notes for the newer, higher bills, but this led to long lines at banks and, in some cases, riots. Authorities said there were protests and looting in at least six cities last month, including Maracaibo, where police put down looting near a bank building, and the eastern state of Bolivar, where mobs sacked several businesses. Young men waved their 100-bolivar bills in the air and chanted \"they're useless,\" then turned and ran as police fired tear gas canisters. Dozens of people were arrested. The deadline for removing the 100 bolivar note from circulation has been extended multiple times since and, currently, the bill will remain in circulation until Feb. 20. \u201cThere is clearly no strategy in Venezuela but to surrender,\u201d Sabatini said.

A Chicago police officer who fatally shot an unarmed man on the Northwest Side on Monday has been stripped of his police powers by Superintendent Eddie Johnson , the department said Tuesday. The measure represents the \"strongest step a department can take\" during an open investigation, according... (Nereida Moreno) Van Dyke was on duty when he shot McDonald, but multiple recent efforts to try off-duty officers in shootings have ended disastrously for Cook County prosecutors. In the highest-profile case, former Detective Dante Servin was cleared in April 2015 by Judge Dennis Porter of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd on the West Side. The judge's ruling all but said that prosecutors should have charged him with murder, not the lesser charge of manslaughter. Just last month, Judge James Linn acquitted Officer John Gorman of all charges stemming from an incident in which he was accused of firing shots at a vehicle during a traffic altercation after he'd been drinking. Houser has been a focus of at least 20 disciplinary investigations since the early 1990s, department records show. The records provide scant detail on the allegations. Most of the complaints resulted in no discipline or a reprimand, but he was suspended several times, the records show. In 1994, for example, he received a five-day suspension in an incident described as a domestic altercation or disturbance that happened when he was off duty, according to the records. A search of a Tribune database of shootings by Chicago police from 2010 to 2015 showed no shootings involving Houser. Public records also showed he had not been sued in federal court before Nieves' shooting. Nieves had been arrested repeatedly, including on felony charges, but he was never convicted of any serious offenses in Cook County, according to court records. ",

Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush are now in a Houston hospital and will not attend Friday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. The 92-year-old former president on Wednesday was moved to intensive care at Houston Methodist Hospital after being admitted on Saturday, his office said in a statement. \"Shortly after our previous report on President Bush\u2019s condition, he was admitted to the ICU at Houston Methodist Hospital to address an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia,\" the statement read. \"Doctors performed a procedure to protect and clear his airway that required sedation. President Bush is stable and resting comfortably in the ICU, where he will remain for observation.\" Barbara Bush, 91, was admitted Wednesday morning as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing, officials said in a statement. The 41st president previously sent a letter to Donald Trump expressing his regrets he could not attend Friday's presidential inauguration, adding he and the former first lady \"will be with you and the country in spirit.\" In his letter -- penned Jan. 10, before he was hospitalized Saturday for breathing problems -- the former president quipped, \"My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under.\" \"So I guess we're stuck in Texas,\" wrote Bush. \"I want you to know that I wish you the very best as you begin this incredible journey of leading our great country,\" he wrote. \"If I can ever be of help, please let me know.\" Bush is the father of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ran in a heated -- and, at times, contentious -- contest against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Jeb Bush will not be attending the inauguration, but George W. and former first lady Laura Bush will be in attendance, as will Bill and Hillary Clinton. The elder Bush, who served as U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. He was hospitalized in Maine in 2015 after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck, and was hospitalized in Houston the previous December for about a week for shortness of breath. He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. Despite the loss of mobility, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump in Kennebunkport. Last summer, Bush led a group of 40 wounded warriors on a fishing trip at the helm of his speedboat, three days after his 92nd birthday celebration.

By Greg Jaffe By Greg Jaffe January 18 at 6:16 PM Follow @GregJaffe President Obama walked off the stage Wednesday sounding remarkably like the political newcomer who burst onto the political scene 13 years ago. That Obama, a neophyte state senator from Illinois, was striking mostly for his faith in America\u2019s institutions, its founding documents and its people. \u201cHope in the face of difficulty,\u201d he preached in a speech to the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. \u201cHope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope . . . a belief that there are better days ahead.\u201d That was the message that Obama returned to again and again in his final news conference as president. \u201cI believe in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the American people.\u201d President Obama walks away at the end of his final press conference at the White House on Jan. 18. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) Long before President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s surprising victory shook Washington, Obama was worrying about the threats to American democracy. In a series of speeches, starting with his State of the Union address last January, he spoke about the dangers of inequality, growing racial divisions, and how a dramatic decline in civility was hurting the country and weakening its democratic institutions. Those were some of the themes that dominated his farewell speech last week in Chicago. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life,\u201d Obama bluntly advised last week. Obama\u2019s final news conference included a few of those downbeat notes. He took questions on many of the normal hot-button issues that have defined the fourth quarter of his presidency: Russia, WikiLeaks, immigration, race, Cuba and his failed efforts to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians. He predicted that a move by Trump to deport \u201cdreamers\u201d \u2014 young undocumented immigrants who have spent most of their lives in the United States \u2014 would draw him back into the political scrum. But Obama\u2019s final news conference was most memorable for his hopeful vision, which has endured multiple wars, many mass shootings and the unmistakable sense that the country has grown more polarized and angry on his watch. When the president was asked if he was worried about whether progress on LGBT rights would endure under Trump, Obama insisted that the biggest changes during his tenure were spurred by activists outside of government and, in many cases, far from Washington. \u201cThe primary heroes . . . are all the individuals and activists and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, \u2018This is who I am, and I am proud of it,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat opened people\u2019s minds and opened their hearts and eventually the laws caught up.\u201d This was the kind of activism that Obama had long defined as uniquely American and cited as evidence of the country\u2019s exceptional nature. Later he was asked how he had explained the \u201cmeaning\u201d of Trump\u2019s victory to his daughters. The president took the opportunity to brag about this children. \u201cMan, my daughters are something,\u201d he boasted. Then he bragged about the country he has led. In his very first news conference as president in 2009, Obama described himself as \u201cthe eternal optimist.\u201d \u201cI think over time, people respond to civility and rational argument,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what . . . people around America are looking for.\u201d In his final news conference, Obama chose to ignore the ample body of evidence that he may have been mistaken. Instead, he returned to his core progressive belief that determined activism would inexorably produce a less divided and more just country. \u201cIf we work hard and if we are true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, the world gets a little better each time,\u201d he said. That was Obama\u2019s final message. \u201cThat\u2019s what this presidency has tried to be about,\u201d he said. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

On Twitter, he's boasted about his role in creating and keeping jobs in America. With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017 But is the president-elect, still days away from his swearing-in ceremony, actually behind what might appear to be a hiring bonanza? Economic evidence suggests otherwise, indicating instead that he did not cause most of the new hiring . GM announced it was creating 450 new American jobs on Tuesday, for example, and moving 6,000 existing technology jobs back to the United States. The company's official announcement does not mention Trump or the federal government. Instead, it casts the steps as part of a four-year efficiency plan. GM's financial materials and previous corporate statements support that assertion. Mary Barra, GM's CEO, is on President-elect Trump's economic policy team. Yet she has specifically rebuffed his argument, made in tweets and speeches, that American companies should move more car manufacturing into the U.S. Speaking at a car show this month, Barra said GM will continue to \"build where we sell,\" citing the company's supply chain of production and sales in China and the U.S. Prior to this week's announcement, Barra has emphasized that long-term global business fundamentals drive the company's personnel strategy. GM employs 215,000 people across 6 continents, including 97,000 in the U.S. and 15,000 in Mexico. As Barra told bankers on a conference call this month , profitability and efficiency considerations mean some GM \"products are in Mexico,\" while the company \"will continue\" to also hire in America. On the same call, Barra cited GM's ongoing effort to insource certain positions, touting \"11,000 IT jobs\" that returned to the U.S. \"over several years.\" In GM's Monday announcement, most of the jobs cited are actually from the long-term program for insourcing its existing IT jobs. The 450 new U.S. jobs comprise 0.46 percent of the company's domestic workforce. Related: Companies Are Recycling Their Old News to Avoid Being Blasted in a Trump Tweet Trump has repeatedly tweeted about companies that have announced new jobs since his election \u2014 and tweeted negatively about companies like Toyota, reported to be building a new plant in Mexico. NBC News reported on Tuesday that some companies, eager to avoid becoming a target , have preemptively \u2014 or retroactively \u2014 announced plans to create U.S. jobs. On Wednesday, after a Today Show fact check reported that GM's hiring was not a direct response to his tweets , Trump took to Twitter to respond. Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 Michael Hicks, an economics professor who studies the government's impact on the economy, says public companies do not typically make employment decisions on a Twitter timeline. \"Business expansion plans are probably the result of many months, if not years, of restructuring and business planning,\" says Hicks. He adds that many politicians exaggerate their influence over the economy. While corporate employment and manufacturing plans take a long time to develop, there have certainly been a series of jobs announcements since the election. Industry experts say that wave of P.R. looks like a response to Trump, even if the underlying hiring is not. \"Many of these moves we anticipated,\" says Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst for Autotrader.com. Car companies have simply began \"timing\" announcements, she says, to appease the president-elect. \"They are packaging their news that they otherwise might kind of dribble out,\" Krebs tells MSNBC, \"and doing some storytelling around it in an effort to get out of the crosshairs of Trump.\" Maryann Keller, another industry analyst, told Bloomberg News that car companies are clearly \"announcing investments that they would have made anyway.\" Play ",

The process has settled down in recent days with the arrival of Keith Kellogg, a retired three-star Army general whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff of the N.S.C. last month, and who is now running the transition. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a statement, Mr. Flynn said, \u201cMembers of our incoming team have held extensive meetings with their N.S.C. counterparts.\u201d He thanked Ms. Rice for her \u201ccooperation and assistance.\u201d Last week, the two engaged in a public display of harmony, shaking hands at a \u201cpass the baton\u201d conference sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. Still, officials from both the Obama and Trump teams acknowledged that the transition had been rocky, in no small part because Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton caught both the outgoing and incoming administrations so completely by surprise. Had Mrs. Clinton won, her staff planned to place a transition team in the N.S.C. within a couple of days. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, the first contact with the National Security Council did not come until Nov. 22, two weeks after Election Day. That delay was caused by the purge of the original transition team led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Among those swept out was Matthew Freedman, who had been chosen to run the N.S.C. transition but quickly came under scrutiny because of his foreign lobbying ties. Mr. Freedman\u2019s replacement, Marshall Billingslea, a former Pentagon and State Department official, arrived in the West Wing with six people, only two of whom had security clearances. The Obama administration began meeting with that team after Thanksgiving, but its lack of clearances meant that Mr. Trump\u2019s emissaries could not read the materials that the Obama people had prepared for them. The N.S.C. began creating unclassified versions of the papers. Then, in mid-December, there was another shake-up when Mr. Billingslea was replaced by General Kellogg, who began meeting with his Obama counterparts this month. Photo Ms. Rice said she was confident that the new administration would have the information it needed by the time President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Friday. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times By some accounts, the situation is even more fluid in the State Department and the Pentagon, where the Trump team has devoted much of its attention to lining up cabinet secretaries and will now have to win Senate confirmation for dozens of other senior officials. Officials in the State Department\u2019s transition office said that they had had only intermittent contact with Trump representatives, and that those people often changed. But the snags in the National Security Council transition may be more problematic, current and former officials said, because that is the organization that advises the president on the most urgent foreign policy issues, drawing together recommendations from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies. \u201cThis is the nerve center of the White House,\u201d said David J. Rothkopf, the chief executive and editor of the FP Group, who has written a history of the N.S.C., \u201cRunning the World: The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power.\u201d \u201cIf your brain isn\u2019t functioning, your arms and legs aren\u2019t going to function.\u201d Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mulvaney told\u00a0members of the Senate Budget Committee that he believed he was up to date on all of his taxes and found out about the debt during the vetting process for his nomination. The South Carolina Republican said he paid $15,583.60 in\u00a0back taxes to the federal government, but similar oversights brought down the nominations of several past nominees, including former senator\u00a0Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), President Obama\u2019s 2009 pick for secretary of health and human services. \u201cI have come to learn, during the confirmation review process, that I failed to apply FICA and federal and state unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000-2004,\u201d Mulvaney wrote in the disclosure. Mulvaney\u2019s disclosure, which came as part of the routine vetting process for all Cabinet nominees, was first reported by the New York Times. A spokesman for the Trump transition team said Wednesday that Trump stands by Mulvaney and his nomination, explaining that the employee was hired to assist with Mulvaney\u2019s newborn triplets. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that nobody is more qualified and more prepared to fight to rein in Washington spending and fight for taxpayers than Mick Mulvaney,\u201d the transition spokesman\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cCongressman Mulvaney raised the issue surrounding the care of his premature triplets immediately upon being tapped for this position, and has taken the appropriate follow-up measures. President-elect Trump fully stands behind Rep. Mulvaney and looks forward to his efforts to help make America great again.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) as his director of the Office of Management and Budget. Here's what you need to know about the conservative congressman. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) Tax issues are among the more common problems to emerge in vetting, causing at least three of Obama\u2019s picks to withdraw from the confirmation process. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Senate Democrats called on Republicans to encourage Mulvaney to follow previous custom and withdraw his name from consideration. \u201cWe say to our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle: What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, referencing Daschle\u2019s decision to step away from his nomination. Daschle was one of the most prominent nominees to withdraw from a nomination in recent years. He \u00a0paid\u00a0about $140,000 \u00a0in back taxes, interest and penalties for unreported consulting fees, a car and driver provided by a consulting firm that employed him and questionable charitable donations.\u00a0Like Mulvaney, Daschle said the missed payments were an oversight. Daschle withdrew his name anyway. A spokesman for Senate Budget Committee Republicans declined to comment on the status of Mulvaney\u2019s nomination. There is some precedent for Mulvaney to remain a nominee despite the tax issue.\u00a0Obama\u2019s 2009 nominee for treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, was confirmed after it was revealed that he did not fully pay his taxes while working at the International Monetary Fund. Geithner blamed \u00a0\u201ccareless mistakes\u201d for the underpayment and paid roughly $42,000 in back taxes and interest before he was confirmed.

By Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein By Juliet Eilperin and Amy Goldstein January 18 at 1:46 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @goldsteinamy Rep. Tom Price, President-elect Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services, attended a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, on Jan. 18 at the Capitol. Price will attend a second hearing, in front of the Senate Finance Committee, which will formally vote on his nomination. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services and one of Congress\u2019s most vehement critics of the Affordable Care Act, told senators on Wednesday that \u201cit is absolutely imperative\u201d for the government to ensure that all Americans \u201chave the opportunity to gain access\u201d to insurance coverage \u2014\u00a0a more modest goal than the incoming president has set forth in recent days. In a hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Price laid out the central elements of his years-long attempt to replace the ACA along conservative lines. His statement about access to coverage was in sync with widespread GOP thought about promising consumers a chance to get insurance, but he stopped short of Trump\u2019s comments this past weekend that he was seeking \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d in a nearly finished plan. The nominee\u00a0indicated that the plan would probably be ready by March but did not elaborate on its content. And while Trump vowed this past weekend to curb drug prices in Medicare and Medicaid by negotiating directly with pharmaceutical firms, Price shied away from a similar pledge. Under questioning from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who argued that the United States has the world\u2019s highest drug costs specifically because it does not negotiate with the industry, the congressman replied that \u201cthere are a lot of reasons for that\u201d and said he wanted to \u201cget to the root causes of that.\u201d Price said he would work to ensure that \u201cdrug prices are reasonable and individuals across the country have access\u201d to needed prescriptions. The courtesy hearing before the Senate panel marked the first time Price has appeared before lawmakers since being selected; his formal confirmation hearing, before the Senate Finance Committee, is set for Tuesday. This initial encounter gave the six-term congressman his first\u00a0opportunity to make a public case for his selection, while allowing Democrats to argue their case for why the incoming administration should preserve \u2014 not jettison \u2014 the 2010 health-care law also known as Obamacare. The committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), and top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), made it clear they were searching for more specific details on the president-elect\u2019s plans to replace the ACA. Alexander began the hearing by reading conflicting comments by Trump, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about how they planned to replace the existing law \u201csimultaneously,\u201d \u201cconcurrently\u201d and \u201cin manageable pieces.\u201d The law should be repealed only, the chairman argued, \u201cwhen there are concrete practical reforms in place that give Americans affordable access to health care. It\u2019s not about developing a quick fix.\u201d As Republicans in Congress gear up to repeal the Affordable Care Act, two Pennsylvanians reflect on their different experiences under Obamacare. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) Murray criticized Republicans for \u201crushing\u201d the confirmation process and told Price\u00a0that she had \u201cserious concerns about your qualifications and plans for the department you hope to lead.\u201d \u201cJust last week, you voted to begin the process of ripping apart our health-care system without any plan to replace it,\u201d Murray said. \u201cMy constituents are coming up to me with tears in their eyes, wondering what the future holds for their health care given the chaos Republican efforts could cause.\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) continued the theme later while pointing out that the ACA has slowed the rise in U.S. health-care spending. \u201cSo we throw this thing out at our peril,\u201d he told Price. \u201cAnd we throw it out with nothing to replace it. It\u2019s like being asked to jump out of an airplane without a parachute and saying: \u2018Trust us. We will build a parachute.\u2019 \u201d Whitehouse added,\u00a0\u201cI think the American people are entitled to know what they are going to be offered as an alternative.\u201d Price, who practiced as an orthopedic surgeon for nearly two decades before entering politics, said his\u00a0his first professional calling \u2014 \u201cto care for patients\u201d \u2014 convinced him that the current health-care system needed to be overhauled. The congressman recounted how at one point while he was practicing medicine, he noticed \u201cthat there were more individuals within our office who were dealing with paperwork, insurance filings and government regulations than there were individuals actually seeing and treating patients. It was in those moments that it became crystal clear that our health-care system was losing focus on the number-one priority \u2014 the individual patient.\u201d But Price\u2019s conservative vision is under fire from Democrats. 1 of 23 See photos from the second week of confirmation hearings of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees View Photos Hearings continue on the president-elect\u2019s choices for top jobs in his administration.

During questioning, he reiterated his support for what would be a fundamental change to Medicaid by requiring \u201cable-bodied\u201d people to be in work activities to qualify for benefits. Whitehouse pressed him repeatedly on whether people with addictions or mental health problems would be required to work. After dodging the question a few times, the nominee responded, \u201cI think people have an understanding of what able-bodied is, and it doesn\u2019t [involve] the things you described.\u201d Also under fire is Price\u2019s practice of\u00a0continuing to invest in the health sector while in office. Democrats have called for ethics investigations, while Trump transition officials have demanded apologies from at least one news organization over a story about Price\u2019s investments. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), President-elect Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services, repeatedly came under fire from Democrats questioning his financial dealings, during a hearing on Jan. 18 at the Capitol. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Some exchanges were particularly sharp. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) lectured Price so persistently on his stock trading that he declared himself\u00a0\u201coffended.\u201d In response, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.)\u00a0called the hearing \u201can anger-management\u201d exercise for Democrats, while Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) termed it \u201cgotcha management.\u201d [ Pressure mounts on GOP to come up with a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act ] On Tuesday, Democrats had highlighted some of Price\u2019s financial investments that have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and focused on uncertainty about Republicans\u2019 plans for replacing the health-care law they are vowing to repeal. Democrats on the Senate health committee demanded a delay in the hearing \u2014 a demand the committee\u2019s Republican majority ignored. Price told the committee Wednesday that he has had \u201cno conversations with my broker about any of my political activity at all, except for her congratulating me on my election.\u201d Some Republicans have acknowledged that many constituents are anxious about what will happen once\u00a0President Obama\u2019s signature health law is repealed have those concerns\u00a0did not justify a delay in overturning the ACA or acting on Price\u2019s nomination. In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News, Trump sought to reassure the public about the direction he intends to move the health-care system. \u201cNobody is going to be dying on the streets with a President Trump,\u201d he said. His remarks in the interview were similar in tone to an interview he gave The Washington Post over the weekend, but he added one more detail. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll probably have block grants of Medicaid back into the states,\u201d he told Fox, referring to a fundamental change many Republicans have favored for years to the state-federal insurance program for lower-income Americans. In a separate interview published Wednesday by the online publication Axios, Trump said he wanted to have more Americans insured \u2014 potentially through Medicaid block grants \u2014 but hinted that his plan might not translate into universal coverage. \u201cYou know there are many people talking about many forms of health care where people with no money aren\u2019t covered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that.\u201d Trump has pledged not to cut Medicaid or Medicare, but Price would not do the same. After Warren asked whether he had authored budget resolutions that would have cut the Medicaid program by $1 trillion over 10 years, he replied, \u201cYou have the numbers before you.\u201d Price dismissed the idea of using money as the sole \u201cmetric\u201d by which to judge federal support for Medicaid. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong metric,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we ought to do is put forward the resources in order to take care of the patient.\u201d The department Price would run is one of the government\u2019s largest, with a $1 trillion budget. It would place Price at the fulcrum of some of the most incendiary domestic issues facing the incoming administration. Beyond the future of the Affordable Care Act, the HHS secretary has a role in setting policy for reproductive health, major entitlement programs, vaccines and other public health matters. A Michigan native who went to medical school at Emory University in Atlanta, Price, 62, left his practice to serve in the Georgia state Senate. He became the first GOP majority leader in the chamber\u2019s history. While serving in the state Senate, he advocated for reducing jury awards when\u00a0physicians were found guilty of malpractice. Price, a former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee who has belonged to the House tea party caucus, took the helm of the House Budget Committee in 2015. While many Republicans shied away from Trump during the 2016 campaign, Price was an early and loyal foot soldier. In May, he organized a joint statement of loyalty to Trump by nine GOP House committee chairmen, calling on \u201call Americans to support him.\u201d His ideas for changing the health-care system reach further than those advocated by the president-elect. And he has wanted to make fundamental changes since before the Affordable Care Act came into existence. Starting early in his tenure on Capitol Hill, Price wrote commentaries\u00a0lambasting Medicare and exhorting changes along more conservative lines. \u201cIts flawed structure increasingly fails our seniors on all counts \u2014 responsiveness, innovation, access, cost and quality,\u201d he wrote in 2008 in the Washington Times. He has repeatedly introduced legislation that would have converted Medicare from the entitlement program it has been since its origins in the 1960s to a system of \u201cdefined contribution,\u201d with the government giving older Americans fixed sums to help them purchase private health plans. Like many Republicans, he contends that Medicaid, the joint state-federal program for lower-income Americans, should cease to be an entitlement covering everyone who is eligible. Instead, he favors giving each state a lump sum, or block grant, and freeing states from many federal rules, including ones that require certain health services to be covered. States would be allowed to compel \u201cable-bodied\u201d Medicaid applicants to meet work requirements \u2014 a requirement that the Obama administration has opposed. [ Facing long odds, Democrats launch a bus tour aimed at saving Obamacare ] In one exchange during his hearing, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) pressed Price on whether he will be willing to keep in federal law a popular feature of the ACA that guarantees that young adults up to age 26 can remain on their parents\u2019 insurance policies. Price responded that \u201cit\u2019s been baked into the insurance programs that are out there right now.\u201d Baldwin persisted, noting that insurers\u2019 benefits could change and asking whether Price would commit to retaining this feature as a federal mandate. Price reiterated that people deserve access to opportunity for coverage, saying, \u201cI am committed to making sure every single American has the coverage that they want.\u201d Price has drafted nearly half a dozen bills aimed at rolling back the Affordable Care Act in favor of an approach that would redirect power from the federal government to the states and the private sector. But in recent weeks, his own financial dealings have attracted as much attention as his policy positions. In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Price had traded more than $300,000 in shares in about 40 health, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies over a four-year period starting in 2012, while he was involved with legislation that might have affected those firms\u2019 stocks. Price said that he had already agreed to divest of any holdings that the\u00a0Office of Government Ethics recommended he sell. On Tuesday, however, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Price had violated any ethics law, including a statute that Gillibrand sponsored\u00a0that outlaws insider trading by members of Congress. Separately, CNN reported Monday that Price bought shares of stock in a medical device manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, shortly before he introduced legislation that would have helped the company. And a Kaiser Health News story said that the chief executive of a company, MiMedx, in the congressman\u2019s district \u2014 a top campaign donor to Price \u2014 wrote an email to company managers, directing them to \u201cIMMEDIATELY\u201d contribute to a political action committee that supports Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate the Zimmer Biomet trade, which he called possibly \u201cillegal.\u201d The transition team, which noted that the Zimmer Biomet purchase was made by a broker and the congressman learned of the trade after introducing the bill that would have affected the firm, has demanded CNN retract the story. Murray and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) sharply questioned Price on Wednesday on the fact that Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) suggested he invest in\u00a0Zimmer Biomet and last year purchased the stock at a discount rate in a private offering. Murray noted that Collins had been overheard recently boasting that he had helped other lawmakers make money by giving them stock tips. \u201cIs that a stock tip?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d Price replied. \u201cI had no access to nonpublic information.\u201d Price noted that his initial purchase in 2015 was through the stock exchange, while a subsequent trade in 2016 was through a \u201cprivate placement offering.\u201d Initially he said of the 2016 trade, \u201cI don\u2019t know that it was\u201d at a discount rate, but he later appeared to accept Franken\u2019s conclusion that a lower price is \u201cthe definition of a private placement offer.\u201d \u201cIt really begs credulity, sir, when you say that you did not know that you got a discount price,\u201d Franken said, noting that \u201cabout 20 people\u201d were able to participate in the private placement offer. \u201cThese sound like sweetheart deals.\u201d \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand [is] that once you found out your broker bought it, you kept the stock,\u201d Franken said of the Zimmer Biomet purchase. Throughout the hearing, Price \u2014 who said he was not aware of what precise stocks he held in the past or at present \u2014 said he had not sought to take advantage of his public position. \u201cEverything that we have done has been aboveboard, ethical, transparent and legal,\u201d he said. Price was introduced by a committee member and fellow Georgia Republican, Sen. Johnny Isakson, who praised the nominee\u2019s acumen and began the GOP effort to insulate him from Democratic lines of attack. \u201cSometime he\u2019s boring, but he\u2019s always knowledgeable,\u201d Isakson said, drawing a chuckle from committee members. Isakson also tried to tamp down concerns about the ethics of Price\u2019s investment, and he rebutted critiques that Price has not always supported the Social Security system. Isakson called Schumer\u2019s allegations \u201cpatently wrong,\u201d adding that he backed Price\u2019s nomination \u201cbecause I know he\u2019s the right man for the right job at the right time for America.\u201d \u00a0 Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

Bush remains in the intensive care unit of a Houston hospital after experiencing \"shortness of breath,\" the former president's wife, Barbara, has also been admitted for a separate health issue, the couple's spokesman said Wednesday. The former first lady was taken to Houston Methodist Hospital on Wednesday morning \"as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing,\" spokesman Jim McGrath said in a new statement following an update on her husband's condition. Former President George H.W. Bush, and former first lady Barbara Bush attend the Texas A&amp;M University commencement ceremony in College Station, Texas, December 12, 2008. Larry Downing / Reuters Her husband, 92-year-old Bush, was first admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital Saturday for shortness of breath, but on Wednesday underwent a procedure to treat an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia, McGrath said. \"Doctors performed a procedure to protect and clear his airway that required sedation,\" McGrath said. \"President Bush is stable and resting comfortably in the ICU, where he will remain for observation.\" McGrath said doctors believe the procedure, in which a tube was used to remove a blockage in a lung, was a success. Until Wednesday morning's issue, Bush was making great progress, McGrath said. \"Yesterday, he was telling everybody he'd be out by Thursday or Friday,\" he said. Bush chief of staff Jean Becker earlier said he's \"fine and he's doing really well,\" according to the Houston Chronicle . President Barack Obama was among those wishing George and Barbara Bush well. \"They are as fine a couple as we know. So we want to send our prayers and our love to them.\" Former President Bill Clinton wished a \"speedy recovery\" after learning about the Bushes hospital stays Wednesday. President-elect Donald Trump also tweeted his well wishes. 41 and Barbara\u2014thinking about you both and sending wishes for a speedy recovery. Love, 42. \u2014 Bill Clinton (@billclinton) January 18, 2017 Bush, who served as U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. He was hospitalized in Maine in 2015 after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck. In December 2014, he was hospitalized in Houston for about a week for shortness of breath. Previous to those stays, he spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. Despite the loss of mobility, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump in Kennebunkport. Last summer, Bush led a group of 40 wounded warriors on a fishing trip at the helm of his speedboat, three days after his 92nd birthday celebration. Play ",

Officer Abel Montes De Oca has been convicted of two misdemeanors in connection with distributing harmful matter to a female teen cadet in an LAPD youth program. A Los Angeles police cruiser in Hollywood in 2015. Officer Abel Montes De Oca has been convicted of two misdemeanors in connection with distributing harmful matter to a female teen cadet in an LAPD youth program. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Matt Hamilton Contact Reporter A Los Angeles police officer who worked in an LAPD youth program was convicted Tuesday of distributing harmful matter to a teenage girl, authorities said. After a five-day trial, a downtown L.A. jury convicted Abel Montes De Oca of two misdemeanor counts: destroying evidence and distributing \u201charmful matter\u201d to a juvenile, according to the L.A. city attorney\u2019s office. De Oca, 32, was acquitted of two counts of child annoyance. After the verdict was read, the judge remanded\u00a0De Oca into custody, and he is being held on $100,000 bail, prosecutors said. He faces up to 18 months in jail and mandatory sex offender registration at his sentencing scheduled for Friday. Prosecutors say that in September 2015, the officer met a then-16-year-old girl who was a cadet in the L.A. Police Department\u2019s Community Youth Program.\u00a0The program runs 18 weeks and provides physical training and criminal justice education to students ages 13 to 20,\u00a0 according to the program\u2019s website. Through October 2015, prosecutors alleged that De Oca sought an inappropriate relationship with the girl, sending her text messages and other missives via social media.\u00a0 But once the officer\u2019s mistreatment of the girl was disclosed, prosecutors alleged he tried to delete photos and messages from his phone and computer, according to the city attorney\u2019s office. He also told the girl to wipe out any evidence of his correspondence. Police arrested De Oca in August at the LAPD\u2019s downtown headquarters. \"This was an egregious breach of trust by an LAPD officer responsible for supervising student cadets,\u201d City Atty. Mike\u00a0Feuer said in a statement. \u201cIt is essential to hold the officer accountable for taking advantage of his position to victimize a minor. Our cadets commit to public service. They deserve our respect and our protection.\u201d De Oca was required to stay at home during the months-long investigation into his conduct by the internal affairs division.\u00a0 The officer has been with the department for about nine years. It\u2019s unclear how long he was assigned to be a youth services officer, the position in which he encountered the teenage girl. In a statement, the LAPD said it treats allegations of misconduct seriously, especially those involving youth programs. \u201cWhen we learned about Montes De Oca\u2019s actions, he was immediately relieved of duty and the LAPD\u2019s criminal investigation led to today\u2019s conviction,\u201d the LAPD statement said. An attorney for De Oca could not be reached for comment. It\u2019s unclear if De Oca remained employed by the LAPD or faced any disciplinary action. Under state law, officers' personnel records and disciplinary history are kept private.\u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the Chinese zodiac says about inauguration day ; Trump's popularity has dropped ; site of Aliso Canyon gas leak \u00a0can reopen; researchers are using lasers to hijack the brains of mice .

A forensic investigator walks outside a private school in Monterrey, Mexico, on Wednesday after a shooting. (Emilio Vazquez / Associated Press) Associated Press A 15-year-old student opened fire at a private school in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey on Wednesday, shooting a teacher and two other students in the head before killing himself. Another student suffered lesser injuries in the shootings, which were captured on a chilling video posted to social media. Nuevo Leon state Gov. Jaime Rodriguez said the shooter died at a hospital and that his three victims with head wounds were \"fighting between life and death.\" The boy wounded in the arm was out of danger. A video, apparently from the school's surveillance camera, shows a female teacher handing out materials and students seated at their desks when a boy opens fire with a pistol from a sitting position, hitting a boy sitting in front of him, who immediately slumps to the ground. He next shoots the teacher, who was looking in another direction, and she falls to the ground. The boy rises from his seat and walks around, firing shots at his classmates, before turning the gun on himself. His first shot apparently misses his head, and then he runs out of bullets. The shooter runs to his backpack, apparently to reload, as his classmates cower at their desks. He appears to say something to the surviving students, who begin to rush for the door, and then he shoots himself in the head and falls to the ground. The crowded classroom was left with a jumble of overturned chairs, blood and fallen students. State security spokesman Aldo Fasci said three of the injured had bullet wounds to the head and were in extremely serious condition. He said the student shot the 24-year-old teacher, a 14-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy in the head, and a 15-year-old classmate in the arm. Fasci said the boy then pointed the gun at classmates before shooting himself in the head. \"The classes were going perfectly well, the student stands up from his desk and pulls out a gun,\" Fasci said. He noted that photographs of the shooting had been posted to social media and said the person responsible would be punished. He also appealed to the news media to avoid using the images, which show children. Fasci said the shooter had been under treatment for depression, but that the motive was under investigation. The spokesman attributed it to \"the situation that is happening everywhere. The children have access to the Internet. This has happened in other countries.\" The website of the American School of the Northeast says it offers bilingual education for students from preschool through ninth grade. Fasci said the boy brought the gun from home. It was unclear how he got the .22-caliber pistol into the school. Mexico had once had a program to check book bags at school entrances, but in many places it has fallen into disuse. \"'There was a reason why book bags were checked. I think we are going to have to start doing it again,\" Fasci said. Mexico had been largely spared the phenomenon of school shootings that has hit the United States. In one of the few previous incidents, a 13-year-old student shot a 12-year-old classmate in the head at a Mexico City middle school in 2004, seriously wounding her. At the height of Mexico's drug war, between 2008 and 2011, schools in northern Mexico were more concerned about the possibility that stray bullets from drug gang gun battles outside schools might enter classrooms. Some schools conducted \"duck and cover\" drills to combat that possibility.

    "text": "Jan 18, 2017 6:30 PM EST By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto Trump on Issues, Campaign Promises Donald Trump campaigned on keeping jobs in the U.S. and six in ten Americans expect he will keep a significant number of U.S. jobs from moving overseas. Just under half think he will be able to get big money out of politics . About a third think he will build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border (something six in ten Americans oppose), or defeat ISIS . Overall, just 39 percent expect Mr. Trump will keep most of the promises he made during the presidential campaign, while over half the public thinks he will not keep those promises. Expectations are that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies will be most advantageous for large corporations, the rich and white Americans, and will be more detrimental to racial minorities and women. The U.S.-Mexico Border Wall Fifty-nine percent of Americans oppose building a wall along the Mexico border; 37 percent favor that. Views divide along party lines: 65 percent of Republicans favor building a wall, while 79 percent of Democrats oppose it. Seventy-nine percent of Americans expect that if a wall is built along the border, the U.S. will ultimately pay for it. Just 14 percent expect Mexico will pay, as Mr. Trump has claimed . Sixty percent of Republicans, and 91 percent of Democrats, think the U.S. will pay for the wall if it is built. Trump says taxpayers will be reimbursed for Mexican border wall Conflicts of Interest Mr. Trump intends to step down from the positions he holds at the Trump Organization and turn over operations to a trust controlled by his adult sons , but does not plan to give up ownership of the organization . Forty-six percent of Americans think these steps are adequate to prevent any conflicts of interest he may have during his presidency, while 50 percent think they are not adequate. There are large differences between Republicans and Democrats. More generally, Americans are divided as to whether Donald Trump will serve the interests of his family and businesses, or those of the American people, when he becomes president. Partisan differences also run large on this question. Among Republicans, 81 percent say that Mr. Trump will make decisions to further the interests of the American people, compared to only 19 percent of Democrats who believe the same thing. Mr. Trump has named his son-in-law Jared Kushner as senior adviser to the president . In general, 70 percent of Americans think it is not appropriate for presidents to appoint family members to senior White House positions, while just 26 percent think that is appropriate. Tax Returns Mr. Trump has yet to release his income tax returns, something that candidates for president generally do. Most Americans (57 percent) think it is necessary that he do so, but on this question as well, the public is divided along party lines. Twenty-nine percent of Republicans say it\u2019s necessary for him to release his returns, while 80 percent of Democrats say it\u2019s necessary. The Affordable Care Act Americans are now split in their views of the Affordable Care Act: 48 percent approve of the law, while about as many, 47 percent, disapprove, including 32 percent who disapprove strongly.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the percentage that approves of the law is the highest it has been since the CBS News Poll began asking about it nearly seven years ago.\u00a0 Tom Price grilled over Obamacare reform Sixty-one percent of Republicans strongly disapprove of the ACA; 44 percent of Democrats strongly approve. Just 22 percent of the public now think the health care law should be repealed entirely, the lowest that has been since the question was first asked in CBS News Polls in 2013. Among the 22 percent of Americans who want to see the law repealed, 47 percent want the law to be repealed immediately, while half \u2013 50 percent- think it should be repealed only after Congress has agreed on a new health care law to replace it. Six in ten Americans are very concerned that if the law is repealed before a replacement is enacted, individuals currently covered by the law would not have health insurance. Another 24 percent are somewhat concerned about that. Comparing Trump to past presidents After a contentious election, 56 percent of Americans are optimistic about the next four years with Mr. Trump in the White House, but that\u2019s the lowest level of optimism for any president-elect in CBS News polling going back to Jimmy Carter in 1977, when CBS began asking the question. Thirty-nine percent are pessimistic \u2013 a record high. info Close What\u2019s behind these numbers is a starker partisan divide compared to views of previous presidents-elect. Past presidents have received much more optimism across party lines. Republicans are especially optimistic about Mr. Trump in the White House (87 percent), while Democrats are pessimistic (62 percent), but eight years ago majorities across partisan lines were optimistic about President-elect Obama. \u00a0After George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 election, nearly half of Democrats \u2013 47 percent - were optimistic about George W. Bush taking office, compared to just 32 percent who say that about Trump today. info Close Americans\u2019 expectations about what kind of president Donald Trump will be are also more negative than expectations for his immediate predecessors. \u00a0Thirty-six percent of Americans think Donald Trump will be a poor president - far higher than either Barack Obama (4 percent) or George W. Bush (12 percent) just before each became president. Thirty-five percent think Mr. Trump will be a very good or good president, and another 23 percent say he will be average.\u00a0 Prospects for the kind of president Donald Trump will be also exhibit a partisan divide. Most Republicans expect Trump to be a very good or good president (71 percent), compared to just 9 percent of Democrats (67 percent think he will do a poor job). Looking back, Republicans about Barack Obama eight years ago. Qualities and Characteristics Bringing change to Washington was central to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, and a majority of Americans (59 percent) think he will do that. Most also view him as a strong leader (55 percent), but there are areas of concern. More than six in ten Americans are uneasy about how Mr. Trump would handle an international crisis (64 percent) and most think he will divide the country (61 percent) rather than bring people together.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The Vice President-Elect and the Incoming First Lady As Mike Pence prepares to become Vice President, more Americans view him favorably (29 percent) than unfavorably (21 percent), but like many incoming VPs before him, many are undecided or don\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion. Incoming First Lady Melania Trump plans to spend part of Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office in New York while their son finishes school.\u00a0 Americans are split in their overall views of Mrs. Trump; more than half are undecided or don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion. Previous incoming First Ladies were viewed more positively. Congress and the President-Elect After Donald Trump is sworn in as president, the Republican Party will control both the White House and Congress, leaving the Democratic Party in the minority. Eight in 10 Americans want Democrats in Congress to try and work with Mr. Trump and Congressional Republicans to get things done. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans didn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye. Looking ahead, Americans think Republicans in Congress will have more influence than Donald Trump over what gets done in Washington. info Close Overall, the public continues to give Congress overwhelmingly negative ratings, but 24 percent now approve of the job Congress is doing, up from 15 percent before the election and the highest it has been since September 2013.\u00a0 \u00a0 This poll was conducted by telephone January 13-17, 2017 among a random sample of 1,257 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

This excerpt from video released to the public shows the most complete version of the shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. It is edited for length by the Chicago Tribune. Warning: This video contains graphic images. Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The city Office of Inspector General, which earlier recommended the firing of 11 Chicago police officers in connection with the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald , had proposed suspensions for four additional officers at the scene in 2014, according to its latest report. The quarterly report from IG Joseph Ferguson's office, released Wednesday, didn't identify the four or give a reason for the recommended suspensions. But a Chicago police spokesman confirmed that police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has handed down one-week suspensions for the officers for failing to ensure the dashboard cameras in their squad cars were operating properly that night. A video from one dashcam showed Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times as he walked away from police with a knife. Fallout from the court-ordered release of the video in November 2015 has rocked the Police Department in the months since. Van Dyke faces first-degree murder charges, and just last week, the U.S. Justice Department issued a scathing report that portrayed the department as flawed from top to bottom, saying officers resort to excessive force too often, are rarely punished for wrongdoing and are poorly trained.

WikiLeaks posted on Twitter last week that Assange would \"agree to U.S. extradition\" if Obama granted clemency to Manning, who is serving a 35-year sentence for giving classified information to the anti-secrecy site in 2010. There no sign Wednesday of any movement from Assange, who has been holed up for more than four years at Ecuador's Embassy in London. If Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case https://t.co/MZU30SlfGK \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 12, 2017 He has refused to meet prosecutors in Sweden, where he remains wanted on a rape allegation, saying he fears being extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges if he leaves the building. However, the Department of Justice has never announced any indictment of Assange, and it's not clear that any charges have been brought that remain sealed. Julian Assange MAURIZIO GAMBARINI / EPA In a court filing last year about Manning's case, Department of Justice lawyers wrote that the investigation into the 2010 leak \"concerns potential violations of federal criminal laws, in the form of serious threats to the national security, and the investigation continues today.\" Assange lawyer, Melinda Taylor, said on Twitter that she was seeking clarification from the Justice Department and that U.S. authorities have \"consistently affirmed [there is an] ongoing national security prosecution\" against Assange but have refused to confirm or deny the existence of an extradition request. \"U.K. also refuse to affirm or deny that they have received an extradition request \u2014 not the same thing as there being no extradition request,\" she wrote. In a statement, Assange praised Manning as \"a hero, whose bravery should be applauded\" and called for an end to what he called a \"war on whistleblowers such as WikiLeaks and myself.\" Statement from Julian #Assange regarding decision of President Obama to commute the sentence of Chelsea Manning pic.twitter.com/HKtbs0pOpF \u2014 Melinda Taylor (@theMTchair) January 18, 2017 Elaine Pearson, Australia director for Human Rights Watch, said any U.S. case against Assange \"should be dropped.\" \"[The] Espionage Act shouldn't be used to punish those who publish leaks,\" she wrote.

Students on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Nov. 6, 2013. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Dawn Rhodes Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune University of Illinois is rolling out an ambitious effort to boost enrollment by 15 percent over the next five years, growing the three campuses to more than 93,600 students. School leaders are aiming to add around 12,150 students by 2021, pinpointing increases in undergraduate programs at the Chicago campus, and graduate and online programs in Urbana-Champaign. The move comes as the university system tries to attract more Illinoisans and underrepresented minorities. U. of I. President Timothy Killeen is scheduled to detail the plan at Thursday's board of trustees meeting in Chicago. All three campuses were directed to create enrollment strategies last summer, school officials said. University of Illinois trustees Thursday backed a quid pro quo deal that would secure funding for the university's three campuses. The proposal would guarantee state funding for the next five years, starting with $662 million... In an attempt to overcome unprecedented budget gridlock in Springfield, University of Illinois trustees Thursday backed a quid pro quo deal that would secure funding for the university's three campuses. The proposal would guarantee state funding for the next five years, starting with $662 million... (Dawn Rhodes) Urbana-Champaign would aim to create new online master's-level degree programs in subjects like computer science, accounting and business administration. A new medical degree also would be launched in step with the opening of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Enrollment would go from around 47,000 in fall 2016 to more than 53,000 \u2014 a jump of 6,300 students. UIC plans to attract nearly 4,800 more students by adding and expanding programs. Five new academic programs would be added: integrated health studies, nutrition and wellness, integrated health sciences, disability and human development, and data science. More enrollment also would occur by bolstering  an additional 18 existing programs, and filling other undergraduate, graduate and professional programs to capacity. School projections show student populations growing from 29,120 in fall 2016 to 33,905. Springfield would add more than 1,000  students by introducing new programs, improving marketing for its online courses and broadening its recruitment territory. Five new undergraduate programs, two new concentrations, two graduate certificate courses and one new master's-level program would be added. Officials also would scour downstate Illinois and the East St. Louis area for prospective students. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 18, 2017, 6:17 PM Janet Yellen says Fed will hike rates \"a few times\" a year Email WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says she expects the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate several times a year through 2019, as it moves closer toward to its economic goals of maximum employment and stable inflation. But in a speech in San Francisco on Wednesday, she said she can\u2019t say when the next interest rate will occur or how high rates will rise. She said that will depend on how the economy performs in the coming months. Last month, the Fed, in its compilation of rate-setting members\u2019 projections, indicated it aimed for three quarter-point increases in 2017 . The Federal Reserve voted unanimously Wed. to raise interest rates one quarter of one percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited falling unemployment ... Yellen said Fed officials, who boosted short-term rates for a second time last month, expect to raise rates \u201ca few times a year\u201d until they have pushed the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate close to 3 percent by the end of 2019. The rate now stands in a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. The first increase came in December 2015, after the central bank lowered the benchmark to near-zero to combat the economic downturn. The 3 percent level for the Fed\u2019s target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, is the point that the Fed currently believes is the so-called neutral rate -- the level where the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies are not spurring growth or holding it back. \u201cRight now our foot is still pressing on the gas pedal, though, as I noted, we have eased back a bit,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cOur foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make sure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an expected shock, given that we don\u2019t have much room to cut interest rates.\u201d Currently, Yellen said inflation is still running below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent objective, by its preferred measure of prices, and that some measures show that even though unemployment is below 5 percent, there could still be room to make further progress on jobs. \u201cFor instance, wage growth has only recently begun to pick up and remains fairly low,\u201d Yellen said. She said that, as the economy gets closer to the Fed\u2019s goals on employment and inflation, it will make sense to \u201cgradually reduce\u201d the level of support the Fed is providing by raising interest rates. \u201cWaiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road -- either too much inflation, financial instability or both,\u201d Yellen said in her speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco. During her appearance, Yellen made no mention of the incoming Trump administration. President-election Donald Trump was critical of Yellen during the campaign, accusing the Fed of being political and keeping interest rates low to help Democrats. Yellen has denied this charge. She has said she intends to remain as Fed chair until her term ends in February 2018. Yellen was asked how the Fed safeguards its political independence while at the same time strengthening policy coordination with the executive branch. One long tradition dating back decades, she said, is the Fed chair\u2019s regular meetings with the administration\u2019s Treasury secretary. \u201cDuring my time, I have had virtually a weekly breakfast or lunch with Jack Lew,\u201d Yellen said, referring to the current Treasury secretary. She said the meetings are used for exchanging views on the economy, but she said she has never felt pressure from the administration to follow a particular course on interest rates. \u201cWe share a common interest in the success of the U.S. economy, and the administrations, at least the ones I have experience with, respect the independence of the Fed,\u201d Yellen said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 18, 2017 2:35 PM EST Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Georgia Rep. Tom Price, fielded tough questions Wednesday from the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Price, an orthopedic surgeon-turned-lawmaker who once chaired House Budget Committee, faced a grilling over his positions on the Affordable Care Act, the Republican repeal efforts, funding for social security programs, and the latest contentious revelations about potential conflicts of interest in stock buys Price made while in Congress.\u00a0 Under questioning from HELP committee chair Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Price\u00a0 suggests that the Affordable Care Act \u00a0will be replaced piece-by-piece. Of the ACA, Price said, \u201cno one is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody\u201d about potential losses of health insurance under a repeal of Obamacare . Tom Price grilled over Obamacare reform \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage,\u201d Price continued. \u201cThat is not our goal nor is it our desire nor is it our plan.\u201d Price did not, however, commit to maintaining the current funding levels for Medicare and Medicaid programs, despite promises by Donald Trump during the presidential campaign not to touch those social safety nets.\u00a0 Sen. Bill Nelson praises commerce pick for divesting from businesses Just as Donald Trump faces his own potential conflicts of interest , Price also underwent intense scrutiny over his own stock trades and investments involving health care companies over the last four years. Price denied that he had engaged in any insider trading or other conflicts of interest, saying that his investment portfolio was managed by a broker and he had no knowledge about the stocks that were bought in his name. As the New York Times reported earlier this week, Price had bought and sold stocks worth more than $300,000 over the last four years -- including shares of at least two health companies that could have benefited from legislation Price championed while in Congress.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact of the matter is that I have had no conversations with my broker about any political activity at all other than her congratulating me on my election,\u201d Price told the committee.\u00a0 \u201cThe agreement that we have is that she\u2019d provide a diversified portfolio, which is exactly what virtually every one of you have in your investment opportunities, and make certain that in order to protect one\u2019s assets, that there\u2019s a diversified arrangement for purchase of stocks,\u201d Price said. \u201cI knew nothing about those purchases.\u201d He confronted the concerns just as some senators are calling for an investigation into those investments as a possible violation of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, which makes it illegal for legislators and their staff to trade stocks on information that isn\u2019t made public.\u00a0 The Georgia congressman will be subject to confirmation by the full Senate, and will also face another confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. The finance panel will vote on whether to recommend confirmation.\u00a0 Our live updates during the hearing were below: 2:00 p.m. ET Price\u2019s Senate hearing comes to an end. 1:40 p.m. ET Sen. Patty Murray called for an investigation into Price\u2019s stock buys.\u00a0 Later, the Washington senator hammered Price on past statements expressing skepticism at the need for birth control coverage in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBirth control is an essential part of women\u2019s health care,\u201d Murray said, adding that she was \u201cdeeply concerned about the impact of your policies on women.\u201d\u00a0 Asked whether he would commit to funding and keeping the HHS department\u2019s Office of Minority Health Resource Center, Price refused to say.\u00a0 1:00 p.m. ET Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, attempts to pin down Price on a promise not to roll back the budget for Medicare and Medicaid -- a promise Mr. Trump had repeatedly made during his presidential campaign.\u00a0 \u201cCan you assure...that you will not cut from either Medicare or Medicaid should you be confirmed to this position?\u201d Warren asked.\u00a0 Price dodged the question, saying he believed the fulfillment of those promises should be measured in whether patient care has suffered -- not measured in the dollars funding the programs.\u00a0 \u201cI think the metric should be care,\u201d Price said.\u00a0 Tom Price grilled over Obamacare reform Warren quipped that she had a suggestion for Price: Print out a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges not to cut funding from Medicare and Medicaid and \u201cpost that on your desk above your new office.\u201d When asked once more about his stock purchases and their possible conflicts of interest with legislation that he\u2019s sponsored in the past, Price replied that \u201cI wasn\u2019t making those decisions\u201d on what stocks to buy. He said they were \u201cbought by a broker,\u201d and though they\u2019re \u201cmade on my behalf,\u201d he did not direct the trades. To Warren\u2019s line of questioning, Price shot back: \u201cI\u2019m offended by the insinuation, senator.\u201d\u00a0 Later, Price clarified that he did direct his broker to buy stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics after discussing the company with Rep. Collins of New York.\u00a0 12:45 p.m. ET At least six senators have pointed to Tom Price\u2019s stocks in health care companies as problematic in his position as a congressman and also as a possible HHS secretary, with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, being the latest to bring it to the fore.\u00a0 12:25 p.m. ET Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, questions on Price on whether any of his campaign contributions have been from drug and health care companies.\u00a0 Price says he doesn\u2019t know for certain but he suspects that is the case, pointing to similar contributions from drug and health companies to the campaigns of other members of Congress.\u00a0 \u201cWould you support drug price transparency?\u201d Baldwin asked, expanding on a proposal to require drug companies to make public information that goes into pricing their products.\u00a0 \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of merit in every area,\u201d Price said, noting that he looks forward to working to ensure more transparent dealings when it comes to fluctuating drug prices. Price was also asked whether he would support Medicare negotiating drug prices -- a stance Trump has articulated.\u00a0 Price\u2019s response: \u201cIt depends.\u201d\u00a0 11:50 a.m. ET Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, attempts to pin down Price on a promise that any replacement plan by GOP legislators will not add to the nation\u2019s deficit and debt.\u00a0 \u201cI commit to working with you to making sure that happens,\u201d Price says in response, noting that \u201cthere are a lot of contributions to the debt.\u201d 11:36 a.m. ET Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota pressed Price further on his questionable stock buys, including some tobacco company stocks he held years ago.\u00a0 \u201cI have no idea what stocks I held in the \u201890s, in the 2000s, or even now,\u201d Price said, noting that mutual funds and pension funds decided where his money went.\u00a0 Sanders to HHS nominee: Is Trump lying about medicaid? Franken expressed skepticism at this, and went on to slam Price for the \u201cmore than 300,000 dollars in health-care related stocks\u201d he held while at the same time sponsoring legislation that could have impacted those stocks.\u00a0 And of Price\u2019s stance on repealing Obamacare, Franken said, \u201cI am very frightened about what you are going to do and so are millions of Americans.\u201d\u00a0 11:05 a.m. ET Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont questions Price on his differences with Donald Trump on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security . Sanders pointed out that Mr. Trump claimed repeatedly he wouldn\u2019t cut Medicare during his presidential campaign, but the HHS nominee has been in favor of making deep cuts to the policy. \u201cI haven\u2019t had extensive\u201d conversations with Mr. Trump about social security cuts, Price told Sanders. But the Georgia Republican said \u201cI have no reason to believe that that position has been changed.\u201d\u00a0 10:50 a.m. ET\u00a0Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pushes Price hard about his questionable stock investments.\u00a0 \u201cI believe it\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Murray said.\u00a0 According to Murray, Price told her in a meeting that Republican Rep. Chris Collins of New York gave him a stock tip on an Australian biotech firm. But Price says Collins had simply told him about the firm. 10:35 a.m. ET Tom Price gives his opening statement at his confirmation hearing.\u00a0 Tom Price, Trump's HHS pick: Our healthcare system is losing focus He expressed robust support for the \u201cpromise\u201d of Medicare to seniors. Later, under questioning from Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, Price suggests that the Affordable Care Act will be replaced piecemeal.\u00a0 Of the ACA, Price said, \u201cno one is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody\u201d about potential losses of health insurance under Obamacare repeal. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their families,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage,\u201d Price continued. \u201cThat is not our goal nor is it our desire nor is it our plan.\u201d Price also acknowledged that the ACA has had some benefits, saying that \u201cthe coverage has certainly improved.\u201d He laid out plans for Congress to focus heavily at the start on reshaping the marketplace for individual policies and on changing Medicaid, which covers low-income qualifiers. Price said the initial legislation should not change Medicare, which covers older people. 10:00 a.m. ET\u00a0Top Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennesse, who chairs the Senate\u2019s HELP committee, pushed for Republicans not to finalize a repeal of Obamacare until it has a replacement ready.\u00a0 Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the HELP committee, said in a statement at the beginning of the hearing that Price will face tough questions on Obamacare and his own investments and stock trades involving health care companies. Murray also voiced her concerns on how Price\u2019s policy stances could impact women\u2019s access to health care, including access to Planned Parenthood.\u00a0 Of Price\u2019s House vote last week easing the passage of legislation in the future that could completely nix Obamacare, Murray said people in her home state \u201chave tears in their eyes\u201d at the possibility of losing their heath care coverage.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 58.69 degrees Fahrenheit, 1.69 degrees above the 20th century average, NOAA said Wednesday morning. NASA and NOAA, which separately analyze global temperature data, have both found that global temperatures surpassed records for the past three years. Schmidt described the trend as remarkable. Related: 2015 Was Earth's Warmest Year on Record, NOAA Says \"This is not what we want, we don't want to be breaking new records every year,\" Schmidt said. He added that while scientists did not expect every year going forward to be record-breaking, the news was indicative of global warming patterns over the past few decades. The announcement comes on the same day as Senate confirmation hearings for President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. As attorney general, Pruitt fought hard against environmental regulations imposed by the EPA and even sued the very agency he has been asked to lead. Those actions, and his ties to the fossil fuel industry, have environmental activists and some scientists sounding the alarm. During his hearing, Pruitt questioned mankind's impact on climate change, but said his personal opinion was \"immaterial\" to his heading the regulatory agency. \"I believe the ability to measure with precision the degree of human activities impact on the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity is contributing to it,\" the Oklahoma attorney general said. NASA said in its findings on Wednesday that the planet's average temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.1 degrees Celsius, since the late 19th century, a change \"driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.\" Some scientists noted that global temperatures were coming \"dangerously close\" to levels agreed to in the Paris climate change agreement, which more than 190 countries signed in 2015 in an attempt to stave off the worsening impacts of climate change. The climate deal aims to keep the rise in global temperatures \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and attempt to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees. Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at the independent nonprofit Climate Central, told NBC News data showed that early last year \"temperatures were already very close to 1.5 degrees\" as a result of El Nino. While temperatures began to cool later in the year, Placky said the findings were incredibly significant. \"That matters because when you add all this extra heat to our climate system our ice melts, our sea levels rise, and our oceans change their chemistry,\" she said. Climate Central \"It's leading to an increase in certain cases of extreme weather that are costing lives and are costing a lot of money,\" she said. Before last year, NOAA said 2015 was the warmest year on record, after surpassing the previous record for warmth set in 2014. Most of the Earth's warming has occurred in the past 35 years NASA said, and 16 of the last 17 warmest years have taken place since the year 2001, NASA said. \"We're expecting those long-term trends to continue and that's really the point for concern,\" Schmidt said. Placky said science showed this escalation was a result of the greenhouse gases human beings were adding to the atmosphere. \"If our world did not have human-caused climate change, we would see those temperatures fall back below average or even record cold,\" she said.

Tribune news services Contact Reporter Bags and Rock and Pudge are heading to Cooperstown. After a vote that could prove to be a turning point how Steroids Era stars are viewed, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens could be joining them in the next few years. Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines and Ivan Rodriguez were elected to baseball's Hall of Fame on Wednesday, earning the honor as Trevor Hoffman and Vladimir Guerrero fell just short of the necessary 75 percent. Bonds and Clemens, their careers tainted by allegations of steroids use, were passed over for the fifth straight year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America but each received a majority of votes for the first time. \"They were just awesome,\" Bagwell said. \"Their demeanor, the way they went about their business, was just amazing, and I respect them.\" On the ballot for the seventh time after falling 15 votes short last year, Bagwell appeared on 381 of 442 ballots for 86.2 percent. Players needed 332 votes this year. \"Anxiety was very, very high,\" Bagwell said. \"It's a weird thing to be a Hall of Famer. I wrote it on a ball tonight. It was kind of crazy, so it was cool.\" In his 10th and final year of eligibility, Raines was at 380 (86 percent). He was just the fifth player elected in his final year of eligibility after Red Ruffing (1967), Joe Medwick (1968), Ralph Kiner (1975) and Jim Rice (2009). \"Last night was probably the worst night I've had out of the 10 years,\" Raines said. \"I knew I was close, but I wasn't sure.\" Raines started at 24.3 percent in 2008 and jumped from 55 percent in 2015 to 69.8 percent last year. He said modern metrics boosted his chances from days when voters considered primarily whether players had 3,000 hits, 500 homers or 300 wins. \"I think social media played a big role,\" he said. \"You've got these new stats. You've got WAR. You've all this stuff. People really didn't look at it back in the day. ... The more they looked, the better it turned out for me.\" Ivan Rodriguez ERIC GAY / ASSOCIATED PRESS \u00a0In this Oct. 4, 1996, file photo, Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez reacts after tagging out New York Yankees' Tim Raines, right, in\u00a0Game 3 of the American League Division Series.

Rodriguez joins Raines and Jeff Bagwell in the Baseball Haff of Fame Class of 2017.\u00a0 (ERIC GAY / ASSOCIATED PRESS) Rodriguez, at 45 the youngest current Hall member, received 336 votes (76 percent). \"I've been having trouble sleeping for three days,\" he said. Rodriguez, the 52nd player elected in his first year of eligibility, joins Johnny Bench in 1989 as the only catchers voted in on their first ballot. \"Johnny Bench was my favorite player growing up,\" Pudge added. Hoffman was five votes short and Guerrero 15 shy. \"Falling short of this class is disappointing,\" Hoffman said in a statement. \"I am truly humbled to have come so close. I hope to one day soon share a Hall of Fame celebration with my family, friends, teammates and all of San Diego.\" Edgar Martinez was next at 58.6 percent, followed by Clemens at 54.1 percent, Bonds at 53.8 percent, Mike Mussina at 51.8 percent, Curt Schilling at 45 percent, Lee Smith at 34.2 percent and Manny Ramirez at 23.8 percent. Players will be inducted July 30 during ceremonies at Cooperstown along with former Commissioner BudSelig and retired Kansas City and Atlanta executive JohnSchuerholz, both elected last month by a veterans committee. Some voters said the election ofSelig, who presided over the Steroids Era, transformed their view of whether tainted stars should gain entry to the Hall. Jeff Bagwell DAVID J. PHILLIP / Associated Press Houston Astros' Jeff Bagwell will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\u00a0 Houston Astros' Jeff Bagwell will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\u00a0 (DAVID J. PHILLIP / Associated Press) Bagwell was a four-time All-Star for Houston, finishing with a .297 batting average, 401 homers and 1,401 RBIs. Among 220 Hall of Fame players, he is the 50th whose entire big league career was with one club. Raines, fifth in career stolen bases, was a seven-time All-Star and the 1986 NL batting champion who compiled a .294 average and .385 on-base percentage. He spent 13 of 23 big league seasons with the Montreal Expos, who left Canada to become the Washington Nationals for the 2005 season, and joins Andre Dawson and Gary Carter as the only players to enter the Hall representing the Expos. Rodriguez, a 14-time All-Star who hit .296 with 311 homers and 1,332 RBIs, was never disciplined for PEDs but former Texas teammate Jose Canseco alleged in a 2005 book that he injected the catcher with steroids. Asked whether he was on the list of players who allegedly tested positive for steroids during baseball's 2003 survey, Rodriguez said in 2009: \"Only God knows.\" Rodriguez displaced Pedro Martinez as the youngest of the record 74 living Hall members. Bonds, a seven-time MVP who holds the season and career home run records, received 36.2 percent in in 2013 and jumped from 44.3 percent last year. Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner, rose from 45.2 percent last year. \"Barry Bonds was the best player I played against in my entire life,\" Bagwell said. A 12-time All-Star on the ballot for the first time, Ramirez was twice suspended for violating baseball's drug agreement. He helped the Boston Red Sox win World Series titles in 2004 and '07, the first for the franchise since 1918, and hit .312 with 555 home runs and 1,831 RBIs in 19 big league seasons. Several notable players will join them in the competition for votes in upcoming years: Chipper Jones and Jim Thome in 2018, Mariano Rivera and Roy Halladay in 2019, and Derek Jeter in 2020. Twelve players have been elected by the BBWAA in the past four years, the most over a span of that length since the first four ballots from 1936-39. Lee Smith, who had 478 saves, got 34 percent in his final time on the ballot. Jorge Posada, Tim Wakefield and Magglio Ordonez were among the players who got under 5 percent and fell off future ballots. Pete Rose, the career hits leader who has never appeared on a ballot because of a lifetime ban that followed an investigation of his gambling, received one write-in vote. Associated Press ",

    "text": "60 Democratic Congress Members Planning to Skip Inauguration By JENNIFER HANSLER Jan 18, 2017, 10:47 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Prepares for Inauguration as Others Plan to Skip Festivities 0 Shares Email Dozens of Democratic members of Congress have announced they will skip Donald Trump 's inauguration this Friday. While some of the 60 made their decision in previous weeks, many more have come forward in recent days, citing the president-elect's perceived insult of Rep. John Lewis as the final straw. Trump lashed out at the civil rights icon Saturday morning after Lewis said in a Friday interview he didn't view Trump as \"a legitimate president.\" Lewis, a Georgia Democrat from an Atlanta-area district who protested alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also said he would not attend the inauguration. \" Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\" Trump tweeted Saturday morning. \"All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\" Trump's comments have drawn outrage and messages of support for Lewis from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Yvette Clark, D-N.Y., said in a tweet Saturday that she would not attend the inauguration because of the comments, saying, \"When you insult @repjohnlewis, you insult America.\" I will NOT attend the inauguration of @realDonaldTrump . When you insult @repjohnlewis , you insult America. \u2014 Yvette D. Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) January 14, 2017 Democratic Reps. Mark Takano and Judy Chu, both of California, also tweeted Saturday they would be absent as a show of solidarity with Lewis, making them part of the more than one-quarter of House Democrats who plan to skip the ceremony. (SEE FULL LIST BELOW) \"All talk, no action.\" \u2014 Mark Takano (@RepMarkTakano) January 14, 2017 After much thought, I have decided to #StandWithJohnLewis and not attend the inauguration. \u2014 Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) January 15, 2017 Also, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., wrote in a statement released Saturday that \"while [he does] not dispute that Trump won the Electoral College , [he] cannot normalize his behavior or the disparaging and un-American statements he has made.\" \"Trump \u2014 who lost the popular vote \u2014 has made a series of racist, sexist and bigoted statements,\" Lieu continued. \"In addition, he has attacked Gold Star parents, veterans such as John McCain and now civil rights icon John Lewis.\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin reflected such sentiments in a statement released Sunday morning. \"I was planning on attending the inauguration on Friday out of respect for the office of president, while still making it back home on Saturday to attend the Women's March in Madison,\" he said. \"However, after long consideration based on reading the classified document on Russian hacking and the Trump candidacy on Thursday, the handling of his conflicts of interest and this weekend's offensive tweets about a national hero Rep. John Lewis, I am no longer attending the event.\" Several more representatives announced their absence at the inauguration on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and referred to Lewis. \"President-elect Trump, you have the undeniable right to take issue and disagree with John Lewis' opinion about the legitimacy of the election results,\" Rep. Anthony Brown, a Democrat from Maryland, wrote on Facebook Monday. \"But Mr. Trump, you need to think carefully about disparaging a civil rights icon such as John Lewis, let alone anyone exercising their freedom of expression that many of us fought for.\" Reps. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., and John Conyers, D-Mich., did not explicitly mention Lewis in their announcements Saturday but did go public with their decisions on the day of Trump's tweets. Among those who decided earlier this month not to attend the inauguration, the most common reason was an aversion to normalizing what they see as Trump's divisive rhetoric and agenda. \"When the new president denigrates Latinos or Mexicans or immigrants as drug dealers and criminals, I want to be able to say I did not condone or allow that type of speech to go mainstream. That was not normalized on my watch,\" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said in a speech on the House floor Jan. 10. \"Because the future president said the American-born children of immigrants were not capable of being American judges, I cannot sit there at his inauguration as if that is OK and I forgive him.\" Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said on Twitter on Jan. 5 she didn't believe she could \"contribute to the normalization of the president-elect's divisive rhetoric by participating in the inauguration.\" My statement on the upcoming inauguration: pic.twitter.com/dQXE0ztvTf \u2014 Katherine Clark (@RepKClark) January 5, 2017 Trump, however, said in an interview with Fox News that aired this morning: \"As far as other people not going, that's okay because we need seats so badly.

I will give them to other people.\" Below is the full running list of Congress members who are planning not to attend the inauguration: Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. ",

    "text": "Jan 18, 2017 6:30 PM EST By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto Russian Interference in the 2016 Election Most Americans - 57 percent - now think that Russia tried to interfere in 2016 presidential election , though not all think it was in order to help then-candidate Donald Trump.\u00a0 Of those Americans who think Russia did interfere, 44 percent think it was to help Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, while 13 percent agree that Russia interfered, but not to favor Mr. Trump. \u00a0Another 34 percent of Americans don\u2019t believe there was any Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats (71 percent) are far more likely than Republicans (18 percent) to think that Russia interfered in order to favor the Republican candidate.\u00a0 Just over half of Republicans \u2013 53 percent - don\u2019t accept the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election at all. info Close Sixty-five percent of Americans are at least somewhat concerned about the reports by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the election, including four in 10 who are very concerned.\u00a0 Two-thirds of Democrats are very concerned.\u00a0 \u00a0In contrast, 55 percent of Republicans are either not very concerned (25 percent) or not at all concerned (30 percent).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Still, even most Republicans agree that Congress should investigate further.\u00a0 Two-thirds of Americans - including majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents \u2013 think Congress should investigate whether Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election. Donald Trump and Relations with Russia Amidst these reports from U.S. intelligence agencies, the percentage of Americans who now think President-elect Trump will be too friendly towards Russia has risen seven points since last month \u2013 from 36 percent in December to 43 percent today. Just 6 percent think he will be too hostile, while nearly half \u2013 45 percent - think his approach will be about right.\u00a0 Views are largely partisan:\u00a0 78 percent of Republicans think his approach will be about right, while 66 percent of Democrats think he will be too friendly toward Russia. Mike Pompeo: Russia tried to impact U.S. democracy Half of Americans think that Russia is either unfriendly towards (27 percent) or an enemy of (23 percent) the United States, while fewer\u00a0 - 41 percent - think of Russia as either an ally (8 percent) or a friend (33 percent).\u00a0 While these percentages are roughly similar to what they were a couple of years ago, the partisan make-up of these opinions has shifted dramatically.\u00a0 Back in February 2015, 62 percent of Republicans thought of Russia as unfriendly or an enemy; now just 39 percent do.\u00a0 In contrast, the percentage of Democrats that views Russia as unfriendly or an enemy has risen \u2013 from 52 percent in 2015 to 67 percent today. Russia company minting Donald Trump coins declaring \u201cIn Trump we trust\u201d Rating the Intelligence Agencies Americans have mixed opinions of the two most prominent U.S. intelligence agencies - the CIA and the FBI.\u00a0 Views of the CIA have changed little since they were last measured in 2014: 40 percent of Americans give the CIA either a good or excellent rating, while 48 percent view the agency as either fair or poor.\u00a0 Meanwhile, positive assessment of the FBI has dropped considerably:\u00a0 now just 35 percent of Americans rate the FBI as excellent or good, down from 51 percent in 2014. The drop in positive assessment of the FBI is largely among Democrats, some of whom may have been influenced by the FBI announcement that the agency was re-opening an investigation into Hillary Clinton just days before the 2016 election.\u00a0 Now just 37 percent of Democrats rate the FBI favorably, down from 54 percent in October 2014. Cyber Security Despite partisan disagreement on the intent and scope of Russian hacking into the 2016 election, a large majority of Americans of all political persuasions think the specter of cyber-attacks against computer systems in the United States more generally is a very serious threat.\u00a0 Seventy-seven percent of Americans think cyber-attacks pose a very serious threat to the U.S. \u2013 up from 69 percent in September - and another 18 percent think the threat is somewhat serious. info Close Few Americans think the United States is adequately prepared to deal with a major cyber-attack. Most \u2013 63 percent - don\u2019t think the U.S. is prepared for such an event. This poll was conducted by telephone January 13-17, 2017 among a random sample of 1,257 adults nationwide.\u00a0 Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.\u00a0 Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

    "text": "CBS/AP January 18, 2017, 3:10 PM U.N. nominee Nikki Haley grilled on foreign policy issues at hearing Email Nikki Haley, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, answered questions on a range of foreign policy questions and issues during her 3.5-hour confirmation hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday morning -- and told lawmakers not to worry too much about Donald Trump\u2019s penchant for incendiary comments. Haley, the governor of South Carolina, told the committee that what Trump says after he\u2019s sworn and huddles with his national security team will be what matters. She sidestepped a question from Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, who listed a number of Trump\u2019s more provocative remarks, including calling NATO obsolete and downplaying Moscow\u2019s meddling in America\u2019s 2016 election. The nominee assailed the Obama administration for failing to block the U.N. Security Council from condemning Israel\u2019s settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. In her testimony, Haley said she won\u2019t go to New York and \u201cabstain when the U.N. seeks to create an international environment that encourages boycotts of Israel.\u201d Additionally, Haley said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump promised to shift the embassy during his campaign, a move that could prove highly contentious. And with the future of the U.S.-Russia relationship in question, Haley took a tough stance toward the country, saying she believes Russia committed war crimes by bombing Syrian civilians in the city of Aleppo. Haley says she doesn\u2019t think that the United States can trust Moscow right now. But she acknowledged there are areas, such as counterterrorism, where the two countries can cooperate. \u201cThe problem is there are no boundaries with Russia,\u201d she said, adding that the U.S. needs to let Russia know \u201cwe are not OK\u201d with its annexation of Crimea and incursion in Ukraine. Haley also says she opposed to lifting existing sanctions against Russia unless Moscow changes its behavior. In another break with the president-elect, Haley said the U.S. would be better off carefully reviewing the Iran nuclear deal rather than withdrawing from it completely. \u201cI think what would be more beneficial at this point is that we look at all the details of the Iran deal, we see if they (the Iranians) are actually in compliance. If we find that there are violations that we act on those violations,\u201d Haley told lawmakers. Playing to bipartisan concerns about a Muslim registry, Haley said that there should not be any registry based on the religion. And asked about the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines\u2019 war on drugs, Haley said the practice violates basic human rights. She vowed to speak up \u201con anything that goes against American values,\u201d saying the U.S. has always been \u201cthe moral compass of the world.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Leading Hypothetical Race for New York City Mayor By RYAN STRUYK Jan 18, 2017, 4:26 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Hillary, Bill Clinton to Attend Trump's Inauguration 0 Shares Email It's far from likely that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will run for mayor of New York City next year, but a new poll from Quinnipiac University today shows she'd be a strong contender for the job. The new poll shows the former secretary of state garnering 49 percent of the vote in an independent bid vs. only 30 percent for current Mayor Bill de Blasio . Most of the rest say they wouldn't vote or don't know who they would choose. Clinton hasn't given any indication she plans to run for the top spot in the nation's most populous city after her failed bid for the White House in November. And while some have speculated that she could make a successful run for the mayor's office, many believe she isn't likely to run for public office again. Hillary and Bill Clinton to Attend Donald Trump Inauguration, Aides Say The poll shows Clinton leading Democrats by roughly 30 percentage points. She leads in all five boroughs except Staten Island. Roughly half of New York voters -- 49 percent -- say de Blasio does not deserve re-election vs. only 42 percent who say he does. His job approval sits at 45 percent. And a poll of the Democratic primary race shows de Blasio at just 35 percent -- short of the 40 percent necessary to avoid a run-off election. Other candidates garnering noteworthy support include former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , City Comptroller Scott Stringer and U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. This poll from Quinnipiac University was taken from Jan. 11 to 17 and has a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Wife of Pulse Nightclub Gunman Omar Mateen Pleads Not Guilty By Liz Kreutz Jan 18, 2017, 2:30 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Widow of Orlando Nightclub Gunman Arrested 0 Shares Email Noor Salman, the wife of Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen, entered a not guilty plea to the federal charges against her, through her public defender John Paul Richmond, who represented her in court today. The U.S. attorney's office claims Salman aided and abetted Mateen's \"provision of material support\" to the terrorist group ISIS, also known as ISIL. Salman is also accused in the indictment of misleading federal agents and Fort Pierce, Florida, police officers who questioned her about Mateen's attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, 2016. The attack killed 49 people; Mateen was killed in a police shootout after the attack. Salman -- who was wearing a red prison jumpsuit today -- did not speak in court. As she was taken out, she waved and blew a kiss to her uncle, Al Salman, who waved and blew a kiss back. It was announced today that once certain paperwork is completed, Salman will be represented by attorney Charlie Swift, who was present in the back of the courtroom. Swift will, however, preside next to Salman during a pre-trial interview today. Salman's next hearing was set for Feb. 1. Until then, she will remain in custody in California. She is expected to be extradited to Florida, where the indictment was filed. Police's Play-by-Play of Orlando Shooting Revealed: From 'Shots Fired' to 'Subject Down' Salman was taken into custody by the FBI on Monday. On Tuesday, charges against her were read aloud in court. On count one, she was charged with aiding and abetting Mateen's attempted provision and provision of \"material support or resources\" to a foreign terrorist organization. For this count, she could face up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. \"She knew he was going to conduct the attack,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Handberg said in court. On count two, she was charged with obstruction of justice. She could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. When Judge Donna Ryu asked Salman Tuesday if she understood the charges, she quietly replied, \"Yes.\" Linda Moreno, another attorney for Salman, said in a statement to ABC News on Monday, \"Noor Salman had no foreknowledge, nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night. Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.\" Al Salman on Tuesday called his niece a \"very simple person\" who is \"not that smart.\" He was adamant that she was clueless about Mateen\u2019s plan. He told ABC News today that when his niece's son saw the news on TV of his mother's arrest, \"he hid behind the couch.\" He said he spoke to his niece last night on the phone. \"She said she needs some clothes because she's cold, and then she asked about her son,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "1st US Rules for Pot in Public Fire up Debate in Denver By kristen wyatt, associated press DENVER \u0097 Jan 18, 2017, 7:36 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Dec. 31, 2013, file photo, partygoers smoke marijuana during a Prohibition-era themed New Year's Eve party at a bar in Denver, celebrating the start of retail pot sales. Denver is starting work on becoming the first city in the nation to allow marijuana clubs and public pot use in places like restaurants, yoga studios and art galleries. Voters narrowly approved the \"social use\" measure last November. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File) 0 Shares Email Denver started work Wednesday on becoming the first city in the U.S. to allow marijuana clubs and public pot use in places such as coffee shops, yoga studios and art galleries. Voters narrowly approved the \"social use\" measure last November. But the ballot proposal didn't spell out many rules for how the marijuana could be consumed, beyond saying that the drug can't be smoked inside and that patrons must be over 21. Since then, the state Liquor Control Board has decreed that no businesses with a liquor license can allow marijuana use. That leaves it to restaurants that don't serve alcohol and other event spaces. A workgroup made up of Denver business owners, city pot regulators and marijuana opponents met to discuss the details, debating even the simplest topics. For almost an hour, they debated whether kid-friendly venues such as museums or zoos could host adults-only marijuana-friendly events at night. The measure includes a caveat that public pot use not occur near schools and places kids congregate. \"We don't want this around children, we all agree,\" said Emmett Reisistroffer, a cannabis consultant who ran the public-use campaign. But he urged regulators not to be too restrictive, pointing out that there's no law saying adults can't drink alcohol in front of children, such as at a professional football stadium. \"We do tolerate alcohol use by adults in front of people under 21,\" he said. Supporters hope to see the city start accepting applications from businesses by this summer, but regulators could easily drag out decision-making for months. It won't be an easy job, if the initial meeting was an indication. City officials had to double the size of the room to accommodate the crowd, and a long white board for questions filled quickly with subjects such as \"Hours of operation?\" Another hot topic: how patrons at the new weed-friendly clubs and coffee shops will get their marijuana. The measure does not allow participating businesses to sell pot, so patrons would have to bring their own. Some neighborhood groups expressed doubt about allowing a pot club to open next door to a pot shop, but a police officer on the panel liked the idea. \"If the people going to these places don't have anywhere to buy it, you're going to attract a black market,\" Deputy Police Chief David Quinoness said. The workgroup plans to submit regulations to city marijuana regulators, who make the ultimate decision on which businesses get licenses, costing $2,000 a year. Businesses can start requesting license applications Friday. Meanwhile, a bill to allow pot clubs statewide is pending at the state Legislature. It has bipartisan support but uncertain prospects, especially as Colorado and other legal pot states await word on whether Donald Trump's administration will tolerate pot businesses in states flouting federal drug law. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Kristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt . \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to show that people can bring pot to smoke outdoors at some businesses. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "AP January 18, 2017, 5:12 PM The secret behind African \"fairy circles\" In this photo provided by Jen Guyton, one of the mysterious \u201cfairy circles\u201d in the Namib desert that dot the area with circular barren patches.\u00a0 Jen Guyton, AP Email WASHINGTON -- The forces behind the mysterious \u201cfairy circles\u201d that dot a desert in southern Africa do not appear to be supernatural, but they are intricate and complex. The formations are circles of land dozens of feet wide that create a stunning pattern in the Namib desert and have mystified locals and scientists for ages. Inside the circles it looks like nothing is growing, while plants grow well on the land surrounding them. Similar patterns have also been seen in Australia. Paranormal powers like fairies and even dragon breath have been credited with creating them. But Princeton University ecologists have come up with a much less shadowy \u2014 and maybe less charming \u2014 explanation for what\u2019s afoot. Using computer simulations, they say an intricate combination of animals and plants cooperating and competing help explain the unusual patterns, according to a study in the journal Nature Wednesday. Corina Tarnita, the study\u2019s lead author, calls it \u201csimple and elegant geometry on such enormous scale.\u201d Until this study, there were two competing explanations: Termites created the pattern or plants surrounding the circles did it. Tarnita\u2019s theory borrows from both. The giant circles -- from six to 100 feet in diameter -- are mostly from termites that cooperate with others in their colony, but compete against other colonies, she said. The unusual patterns seen between circles are plants that establish an orderly root system so they don\u2019t compete too much for limited water. \u201cOut of all these processes, where each is doing what they need to, emerges this large scale pattern,\u201d Tarnita said. The circular shape is a result of termites venturing as far as possible from their own colony\u2019s nest without encroaching on a competing colony . It\u2019s not quite a conspiracy, says co-author Robert Pringle, because the creatures aren\u2019t trying to make the patterns. \u201cThere\u2019s no master plan, there\u2019s no kind of blueprint for what\u2019s supposed to emerge,\u201d he said. Several outside experts contacted by The Associated Press weren\u2019t convinced by the study, because they weren\u2019t comfortable with the author\u2019s assumptions about rainfall and especially termite colony lifespans. They did not, however, argue that it was fairies at work. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

Segal agreed to a $200,000 settlement with the Federal Aviation Administration over alleged airspace violations by his drones. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) Robert Channick Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A pioneering Chicago aerial photography company has agreed to pay the Federal Aviation Administration $200,000 to settle charges it violated airspace regulations with its drones. SkyPan International, which has been using drones for 20 years to shoot aerial views for proposed high-rise developments, had been facing a $1.9 million penalty for what the FAA said were 65 unauthorized drone flights in New York City and Chicago between 2012 and 2014. Mark Segal, who launched SkyPan in 1988, agreed to the settlement Tuesday, ending a yearlong legal battle with the FAA that may have implications for the booming commercial drone industry. \"We've suffered enough and I just wanted to get it off our back at this point,\" Segal, 60, said Wednesday. Federal Aviation Administration limit small unmanned commercial aircraft to 55 pounds and require that they be used in daylight in most cases, but also give operators a way to fly higher than under initial regulations.

New drone rules from the Federal Aviation Administration limit small unmanned commercial aircraft to 55 pounds and require that they be used in daylight in most cases, but also give operators a way to fly higher than under initial regulations. The final rules, made public Tuesday, help govern a... (Becky Yerak) In October 2015, the FAA proposed the record $1.9 million fine against Segal and SkyPan for allegedly violating regulations in the congested airspace over New York City and Chicago. The flights occurred before specific regulations governing commercial drone operations were adopted by the FAA in June 2016. \"There really wasn't any law when we were shooting,\" Segal said. SkyPan also agreed to pay an additional $150,000 if it violates FAA regulations in the next year, and is subject to an additional $150,000 fine if it fails to comply with the terms of the agreement. Under the current FAA regulations, commercial operators must register each drone, and adhere to restrictions such as the speed, altitude, time of day and flight path. There are 47,329 individual commercial drones registered with the FAA, and the industry is taking off, according to FAA spokesman Les Dorr. Beyond aerial photography, he said commercial applications include everything from insurance claims to using drones to inspect bridges. Last month, Amazon tested commercial drone package delivery in England. \"It's almost like somebody comes up with a new use for the technology almost every week,\" Dorr said Wednesday. The FAA also oversees recreational drones under separate model aircraft regulations, and has required recreational owners to register since December 2015. There are 649,554 owners registered with the FAA, which translates to about 1.6 million recreational drones across the U.S., Dorr said. Segal has a fleet of three 5-foot miniature helicopters, which weigh up to 19 pounds each. He shoots two to five projects per month and works with a long list of major real estate developers looking to get their high-rise projects off the ground. The 360-degree aerial shots provide \"real views\" that help developers plan their buildings, Segal said. SkyPan's annual billing is between $1 million and $2 million, Segal said, but business has been hurt by the FAA allegations. \"It encouraged our competitors to try to swoop in and take ... our clients away,\" Segal said. \"There's no doubt it affected our business.\" SkyPan International John J.

SkyPan has agreed to pay the Federal Aviation Administration $200,000 to settle charges it violated airspace regulations with its drones. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) SkyPan recently completed aerial photography for a new transit-oriented apartment building being developed by Vequity at 1920 N. Milwaukee Ave. in the Bucktown/Logan Square area. Segal's first client was Sam Zell, the billionaire real estate developer, who hired the photographer to get aerial shots of several Chicago developments. Segal originally used full-size manned helicopters to take the aerial shots, but began using drones in 1996, and switched to them exclusively in 2002. One of Segal's more prominent clients is the Trump Organization, which hired SkyPan in 2003 to shoot aerial views for the Trump Tower development in Chicago. SkyPan went on to do work for Trump in Las Vegas and New York City. \"They were very happy with what we did in Chicago,\" Segal said. \"It really helped them with the planning and layout of the building by examining the views in advance.\" President-elect Donald Trump owns the Trump Organization, but has ceded control of the company to his sons during his tenure in office. Segal said the biggest challenge in working with the Trump Organization came after the jobs were finished. \"We never got stiffed, but we did run into issues with the Trump Organization,\" he said. \"It's hard to get paid.\" ",

Brown / Chicago Tribune Brenda Barnes, then CEO of Sara Lee Corp., speaks at a 2007 luncheon at the Chicago Hilton in downtown Chicago. Barnes died Jan. 17, 2017. Brenda Barnes, then CEO of Sara Lee Corp., speaks at a 2007 luncheon at the Chicago Hilton in downtown Chicago. Barnes died Jan. 17, 2017. (Milbert O. Brown / Chicago Tribune) Corilyn Shropshire Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Former Sara Lee CEO Brenda Barnes, a longtime executive perhaps best known for putting her career in the executive ranks on hold to focus on her family, has died. She was 63. Barnes, who suffered a stroke, died Tuesday at Edward Hospital in Naperville surrounded by her three children and other family members. Barnes made headlines in 1997 when she left her job as president and CEO of Pepsi-Cola North America after 18 months to become a stay-at-home mom. A debate ensued in the media about the tug-of-war working women face when balancing their professional lives and their families. Barnes' children were then 10, 8 and 7 years old. Barnes told the New York Daily News at the time that \"You have to make choices. Maybe I burned (the candle) at both ends for too long.\" But Barnes didn't completely leave the corporate world. She stayed engaged, serving on seven corporate boards, including of The New York Times and Sears, according to her daughter, Erin Barnes. \"The board opportunities gave the ability to stay connected in a meaningful way, but it didn't keep her away from home as frequently,\" Erin Barnes said. She still traveled, Erin Barnes said, but she also drove her kids to soccer practice and the movies. In 1999, for about six months, she served as interim president and chief operating officer of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, where she had served on the board, according to Erin Barnes. In 2004, with her children teenagers and preparing for college, Barnes was lured back to a full-time job by Steve McMillan , then the chairman and chief executive of Sara Lee Corp. In February 2005 she succeeded McMillan as CEO and added the chairman title in October of that year, serving until she suffered her first stroke in 2010. Notable deaths in 2017 Open link When Barnes arrived at Sara Lee, the company owned Hanes apparel brands, as well as a host of household and body care brands. Jon Harris, who worked alongside Barnes as chief communications officer at both PepsiCo and Sara Lee, remembered her as an executive who was \"tough as nails,\" he said, and authentic. Barnes was petite, he said, and visiting the company's plants \"she would stand on a box and talk to the bottlers because it was real and straightforward. Everybody took to that. \"She would walk the halls regularly and knew everyone's names,\" he added. During her tenure, Barnes took Sara Lee from a massive holding company to a company focused on food and beverages. She focused on restructuring the company and sold off 40 percent of Sara Lee's businesses. Hanes was spun off in 2006. Sara Lee was renamed Hillshire Brands in 2012. After her stroke, Barnes spent the last 6\u00bd years working on her recovery and serving on the board of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago , where she was a patient. \"She lived a wonderful, happy life for the past seven years,\" said Erin Barnes. \"She never complained about what happened to her ... one day, after a particularly difficult day at rehab she only said, 'This stinks.''' Brenda Barnes started her career sorting mail on the night shift at a Chicago post office, according to her daughter. \"She knows every ZIP code in the city,\" Erin Barnes said. She later joined Wilson Sporting Goods and then Frito-Lay, which segued into her 22-year career at PepsiCo, where she rose to CEO in 1996. The job required a lot of travel and a year and a half later, she left. Barnes graduated from Augustana College and later earned an MBA at Loyola University Chicago, according to her daughter. She is also survived by two sons, Jeff and Brian. Services for Barnes are pending, her daughter said. crshropshire@chicagotribune.com ",

The president also pardoned retired Marine Gen. James E. Cartwright , who pleaded guilty... President Obama on Tuesday reduced the 35-year prison sentence of Chelsea Manning , the Army private convicted of leaking thousands of classified reports to WikiLeaks, to the nearly seven years she has served. The president also pardoned retired Marine Gen. James E. Cartwright , who pleaded guilty... (W.J. Hennigan and David S. Cloud) The message will likely be his last one in public for a while. Obama said he reserves the right to speak up, especially if what he called America's \"core values\" come under assault. Short of that, however, he plans now to go into a period of \u201cquiet\u201d and \"not hear [himself] talk so darn much.\" He\u2019ll devote himself to writing and contemplation, he said, taking time for reflection that he hasn\u2019t had under the pressures of the Oval Office. His departure on Friday comes at a time of anxiety for many of his fellow Democrats. Dozens of Democratic members of Congress are planning to boycott Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0inauguration. Women\u2019s groups and unions are organizing demonstrations for the coming weekend. Obama has not repudiated the criticisms he leveled at Trump during the campaign.\u00a0But since the election,\u00a0he has also looked for positive things to say, focusing on Trump\u2019s willingness to listen to him and, perhaps, to change his mind when persuaded. On Wednesday, as he took his final round of questions, Obama said he would wait to see whether Trump had accepted any of his thoughts. He also\u00a0said he was sure he wouldn\u2019t be the last nonwhite man to hold the presidency. \u201cI think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith, corner of this country, because that's America's strength,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen we have everybody getting a chance and everybody's on the field, we end up being better.\u201d He added:\u00a0\u201cYeah, we're going to have a woman president. We're going to have a Latino president. And we'll have a Jewish president, a Hindu president. You know, who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed-up presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them.\u201d Much of his optimism, he said, stemmed from watching a\u00a0younger generation that is much more open to differences of all kinds. As evidence, he cited his daughters, Malia and Sasha, one headed to\u00a0college and the other now in high school. The two have grown up in an environment where they couldn\u2019t help but be patriotic, Obama said, to see the country\u2019s flaws and to feel a sense of responsibility to fix them. And they were well-aware of their parents\u2019 concerns about Trump and the movement behind him. Their father campaigned hard for fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, and their mother delivered a speech in October in which she addressed Trump\u2019s vulgar words about women, disclosed on a videotape,\u00a0saying she was \u201cshaken \u2026\u00a0to [her] core\u201d\u00a0by his remarks. \u201cThey were disappointed,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it because it's consistent with what we have tried to teach them in our household, and what I've tried to model as a father with their mom, and what we've asked them to expect from future boyfriends or spouses.\u201d Still, he said, his daughters hadn\u2019t gotten cynical. \u201cThey have not assumed because their side didn't win, or because some of the values that they care about don't seem as if they were vindicated, that automatically America has somehow rejected them or rejected their values,\u201d he said. Instead, they have \u201cappreciated the fact that this is a big, complicated country, and democracy is messy;\u00a0it doesn't always work exactly the way you might want. It doesn't guarantee certain outcomes,\u201d he said. But, he said, his daughters know that \u201cthere's a core decency to this country and  that they got to be a part of lifting that up. And I expect they will be.\u201d For months, Obama has said he would relish the moment when he could set aside the responsibilities of governing\u00a0and return to thinking and analyzing and talking about the country like a citizen. He told friends he looked forward to being able to see the world not through the gloom and doom of the presidential daily briefing. That moment seemed to dawn at the end of the news conference Wednesday\u00a0as he was channeling the optimism of Malia and Sasha Obama. \u201cSometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does, but at my core, I think we're going to be OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to fight for it;\u00a0we have to work for it and not take it for granted.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the Chinese zodiac says about inauguration day ; Trump's popularity has dropped ; site of Aliso Canyon gas leak \u00a0can reopen; researchers are using lasers to hijack the brains of mice .

    "text": "advertisement It's already been another big week for President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees as six more nominees appeared before Senate committees. Some have been more controversial than others. Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross seemed to sail through his hearing as did Interior secretary nominee Rep. Ryan Zinke. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is nominated to United Nations Ambassador, broke with Trump on a number of foreign policy issues. And the three most contentious hearings were for Health and Human Services Secretary, Education Secretary and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Two more hearings will take place on Thursday, for Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and Energy Secretary nominee Rick Perry. After two weeks of hearings on the Trump nominees, the senate's Democratic Leader made his attempt to size up the group as a whole late Wednesday, calling it \"a swamp cabinet full of bankers and billionaires.\" But, so far, none appear to be in immediate danger of being rejected by the GOP-controlled senate. In case you couldn't catch them all, here are some of the main takeaways from the last two days of hearings: Tom Price Under Fire for His Stocks Democrats pounded Rep. Tom Price, nomine to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who is expected to be a critical player in the overhaul of the current health care system put in place under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats, eager to see Price and his views on health care defeated, pounded him over his financial activity pertaining to the health industry when he was legislating health related legislation.

Texas sued the federal government more than 40 times in recent years, moving to block an influx of Syrian refugees and to stymie air pollution regulations and Mr. Obama\u2019s health care plan. Earlier this month, Democrats in the California state legislature hired Eric H. Holder, the former attorney general, in anticipation of a run of legal battles with the Trump White House. \u201cWe will definitely not sit by idly as the Trump administration tries to deport immigrants, throw people off health care, ignore climate change and steal our water,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a former member of the San Francisco board of supervisors who was just elected to the State Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing defense to whatever the administration throws at us \u2014 but also offense in terms of continuing California\u2019s push for progressive social change.\u201d Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles who is running for governor, said threatening to actually secede was the wrong response to what he described as policies that could be devastating for this state. \u201cI hear a lot of talk about Calexit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last time a state tried to leave the union there was a civil war. I think it would be a lot more productive for us just to double down on what we do well.\u201d For all the talk of defiance, and political considerations are certainly at play in the early war footing taken by leaders in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, there are great risks to assuming this confrontational stance from the outset. For one thing, it could invite retribution from Mr. Trump, who has not seemed inclined to turn the other cheek.

Credit Mike Nelson/European Pressphoto Agency For another, California could find itself at the end of the line should Mr. Trump proceed with the extensive infrastructure program he has pledged. It might also find itself in a difficult position in the event of the kind of natural disaster where states need to turn to the federal government for assistance; some Republicans in Congress opposed giving federal aid to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina . Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cYou don\u2019t want to paint yourself into a corner where you lose your ability to negotiate,\u201d said Ted Gaines, a Republican senator who represents a rural district east of Sacramento. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off offering an olive branch rather than setting down a pathway that may make it difficult to back off.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s premature,\u201d Mr. Gaines said. \u201cIf they want to come out fighting, I think that hurts the relationship in the long term.\u201d Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former aide to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor, said that he thought Democrats were \u201cplaying to the crowd.\u201d But he described the approach as a short-term strategy with risky long-term implications. \u201cTrump likes to bully. He does not like to be bullied. And he likes to have the last word,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be millions of dollars to be spent across the country on infrastructure. Why would you want to end up on Donald Trump\u2019s blacklist? You could end up on that list anyway. But why pick a fight?\u201d All of this has unnerved some in the business community. \u201cThis is all based on the president-elect\u2019s campaign messaging,\u201d said Allan Zaremberg, the chief executive of the California Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how that is going to manifest in action.\u201d Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic assemblyman running for Congress, said he was not worried about any kind of retribution. \u201cThat would be an overreach for one president to punish one state,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they do political payback not based on policy, but based on whether you are with them or against them, we will use that against them. If California doesn\u2019t do well economically, the country doesn\u2019t do well economically.\u201d California\u2019s economy is the sixth-largest in the world. There are parts of this state, however, that showed considerable support for Mr. Trump, and that would applaud efforts, for example, to roll back air pollution regulations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District \u2014 which regulates air quality in one of the dirtiest areas of the nation \u2014 is looking to President Trump\u2019s transition team to amend the federal Clean Air Act , said Mark Keppler, a professor of public affairs at the California State University in Fresno, noting one example. And there are limits to what the state can do. Mr. Brown, in a budget he presented last week, projected a $1.6 billion shortfall by next summer, which means it will be difficult for California to promote the kind of spending program lawmakers want to make up for cuts in Washington, particularly on health care. The legal efforts being threatened \u2014 by Mr. Holder for the legislature and by Xavier Becerra, whom Mr. Brown just tapped to be attorney general \u2014 could delay some actions by the Trump White House, but won\u2019t necessarily block them. Still, Democrats overwhelmingly control California, and the thinking about Mr. Trump appears to be uniform: The state is entering rough waters. Mr. Trump could move to cut off funds for so-called sanctuary cities accommodating illegal immigrants, such as San Francisco; sharply cut federal aid that was part of President Obama\u2019s health care program; or use regulatory powers to try to halt this state\u2019s aggressive policies to reduce carbon emissions. \u201cThe impact of anything coming out of Washington is going to be so difficult for California that we are almost thrown into survival mode,\u201d said Ms. Kuehl, who has been in public office since 1994. She said she had urged people \u2014 \u201ceveryone: local and state governments, staff of federal agencies, nonprofits, neighborhood groups\u201d \u2014 to aggressively try to impede any policies pushed by Mr. Trump that undercut California laws or policies. \u201cI said \u2018If you have to lie, cheat and steal, do it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Kuehl said. \u201cTake federal money and just tell them you are going to do whatever they want.\u201d ",

(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) Owners who lost their homes to mortgage foreclosures by a bank previously run\u00a0by Steven Mnuchin urged the Senate on Wednesday\u00a0to reject his nomination as President-elect Trump's Treasury secretary. Speaking at a Capitol Hill forum\u00a0convened by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u2014 \u00a0a frequent Trump critic \u2014\u00a0the homeowners said OneWest Bank or an affiliate\u00a0intensified the financial hardships they faced amid\u00a0the 2008 financial crisis by foreclosing on their homes. Christina Clifford said she paid the mortgage for her $162,000 condominium in Whittier, Calif., on time from 2001 until 2008\u00a0when her acupuncture business foundered\u00a0along with the national economy. Although Clifford said she followed the bank's instructions for seeking a lower monthly repayment, OneWest twice said it had not received her paperwork\u00a0\u2014 even though the documents had been\u00a0included with payment checks the bank cashed. OneWest foreclosed in 2009. \"It felt as if they saw\u00a0an opportunity to make a good chunk of money and they took it,\" Clifford\u00a0said during a phone interview in which she accused the bank and Mnuchin of unfairly profiting from her\u00a0misfortune. \"I think it's very frightening prospect to have a man like that in the seat of power at the U.S. Treasury,\" added\u00a0Clifford, who fought back sobs as\u00a0she described her experience during the forum. Responding to a request for comment on Clifford's comments and similar personal stories and criticism from three other forum participants who struggled with OneWest\u00a0foreclosures, spokesman Barney Keller said \"Treasury Nominee Mnuchin has his official hearing on Thursday and he looks forward to answering questions from the members of the Senate Finance Committee.\u201d \u00a0 CIT Bank , which now includes\u00a0OneWest as a division, did not return a phone message seeking comment. However, foreclosures on troubled subprime mortgage loans originated by the previous incarnation of OneWest had started rising before Mnuchin took over. Foreclosures similarly spiked at other large financial institutions. In a Jan.10th blog post for The Hill , Casey Crawford, a co-founder of Movement Mortgage , a large, North Carolina-headquartered\u00a0mortgage bank, cited a Treasury\u00a0record\u00a0that showed OneWest offered delinquent borrowers more than 100,000 mortgage modifications \u00a0through September 2013 via a federal program. In contrast, HSBC last year agreed to a\u00a0 $470 million federal and state settlement \u00a0to address alleged mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure abuses. \"Mnuchin\u2019s critics want us to focus on the tiny percentage of mortgages that couldn\u2019t be feasibly restructured or under various circumstances were not saved,\" wrote Crawford. \"We cannot let such tactics distract us from the more important issues.\" Risk-takers Mnuchin, Ross poised for Trump Cabinet posts Kept out of confirmation hearing Warren convened the session after reporting that Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the\u00a0Senate Committee on Finance, rejected a request to hear the homeowners stories as part of Mnuchin's scheduled confirmation hearing on Thursday. Hatch said Mnuchin's \"wealth of private sector experience will serve him well\" at Treasury. \"Unfortunately, judging by Mr. Mnuchin's tenure as the head of OneWest Bank, there is significant evidence that he has no interest in working for the benefit of all Americans,\" Warren countered. She charged that the bank gained a reputation as a \"foreclosure machine\" under Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, hedge fund executive, and movie industry executive who last year served as Trump's national campaign finance chairman. OneWest, based in Pasadena, Calif.,\u00a0foreclosed on more than 36,000 California families and 24,000 additional households around the country, according to a study of banking data by the Urban Strategies Council, an Oakland-based anti-poverty organization, and the California Reinvestment Coalition, an advocate for low-income areas and communities of color. The foreclosures occurred\u00a0after Mnuchin led wealthy investors who\u00a0bought the failed IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the U.S. financial crisis and transformed it into OneWest.\u00a0He and the other investors, including international financier George Soros,\u00a0hedge fund manager\u00a0John Paulson, computer manufacturer\u00a0Michael Dell, and private equity investor\u00a0Christopher Flowers more than doubled their investment by\u00a0selling OneWest to CIT Group for $3.4 billion in 2015. CRC Executive Director Paulina Gonzalez said 2013 Treasury Department data showed\u00a0that One West had one of the highest denial rates for applications to the Home Affordable Modification Program, the federal government's chief foreclosure prevention effort. Bank tied to Trump adviser accused of discrimination Other consumers who told the forum about OneWest\u00a0experiences\u00a0included: Colleen Ison-Hodroff, an 84-year-old Minneapolis resident whose husband got a reverse mortgage on their fully-paid home through OneWest subsidiary Financial Freedom. Days after her husband died, she received OneWest\u00a0notification to either repay the reverse mortgage in full or face foreclosure. Heather McCreary, from Sparks, Nev., who joined her husband in trying to obtain a loan modification after they lost income during the financial crisis. She said the bank kept her family, including twin boys, dangling, and then abruptly foreclosed. She said Senate confirmation of Mnuchin would be an \"insult to my family\" and others. Sylvia Oliver, a Scotch Plains, N.J., resident who said she unsuccessfully tried for years to get a lower loan payment. OneWest was originally scheduled to foreclose on her home on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0but granted a 30-day extension. Mnuchin will sell investments, quit boards, if confirmed for Treasury \"Some may note that other banks had more foreclosures in California and nationally, and this is certainly true,\" said Gonzalez in a statement\u00a0prepared for the forum. \"But we have labeled OneWest a 'foreclosure machine' not only because it foreclosed on more than 60,000 American families and because of its aggressive foreclosure practices, but because it seemed to do little else.\" Follow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc 5 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jA7Cee NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

(Photo: Otto Greule Jr, Getty Images) 828 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE A\u00a0former unanimous MVP, an elite leadoff hitter\u00a0and one of the game\u2019s most complete catchers were elected Wednesday into Baseball\u2019s Hall of Fame. Iconic Houston Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, base-stealer extraordinaire Tim Raines\u00a0and 13-time Gold Glove winner Ivan \u201cPudge\u2019\u2019 Rodriguez earned baseball\u2019s most coveted distinction when they were named on more than 75% of the ballots cast by eligible members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. Raines (86%) was on his 10th and final year of eligibility, while Bagwell (86.2%) made it on his seventh attempt and Rodriguez (76%) on his first one, earning 336 of 442 votes - four more than necessary. Closer Trevor Hoffman fell five votes short.\u00a0Vladimir Guerrero was named on 317 ballots (71.1%), 15 votes shy of induction in his first year. And the Hall of Fame\u00a0continues to slowly open its doors to players linked to performance-enhancing drugs. Baseball Hall of Fame: How USA TODAY Sports voted Bagwell overcame years of crowded ballots and an electorate wary of power hitters who played through the heart of the so-called steroid era. While Bagwell was never linked to steroid use, he did acknowledge using androstenedione, a substance now banned by Major League Baseball. Both Rodriguez and Bagwell were suspected of using PEDs because of the dramatic physical transformations they underwent during their careers, but no conclusive evidence has been found of their involvement with such substances. Rodriguez received the rare honor of first-ballot election after setting the record for most games played behind the plate, winning the 1999 AL MVP and compiling a .296 career batting average with 311 home runs. He and Bagwell's strong showings on the ballot and the surge in support for the steroid-tainted Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens \u2013 both of whom surged from the mid-40% range to 53.8% and 54.1%, respectively\u00a0\u2013 provide the latest indications that the current Hall of Fame electorate has become more amenable to voting for suspected PED users with Hall-worthy credentials. Former catcher Mike Piazza, who fits that profile, was elected last year on his fourth try. The cloud of doubt over Bagwell\u2019s accomplishments was likely the only reason he had to wait so long to be admitted into Cooperstown, considering he put together eight seasons with at least 30 home runs, 100 runs scored and 100 RBI, a feat matched by only nine other players. A .297 career hitter, Bagwell belted an Astros-record 449 home runs, posted a .948 on-base plus slugging percentage and averaged better than 100 RBI over his 15 seasons. Three times he finished in the top three in the NL MVP voting, including his runaway victory in 1994, and he was also chosen the league\u2019s rookie of the year in 1991. The Boston Red Sox certainly never envisioned that kind of output when they sent Bagwell, a fourth-round pick who never hit more than four homers in the minors, to the Astros in a 1990 trade for journeyman reliever Larry Andersen. Bagwell reached the majors the next year and eventually became a four-time All-Star and a three-time Silver Slugger award winner. He was also an excellent fielder, earning a Gold Glove in 1994. Bagwell will become the 50th Hall of Famer to spend his whole career with the same club, joining former teammate Craig Biggio \u2013 elected in 2015 \u2013 in that group. ",

By Anne Gearan and Sean Sullivan By Anne Gearan and Sean Sullivan January 18 at 12:35 PM Follow @agearan Follow @WaPoSean (Reuters) South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley departed sharply from President-elect Donald Trump on a range of foreign policy issues Wednesday, creating some awkwardness as she fielded questions from senators on Capitol Hill. During her confirmation hearing to be the next United Nations ambassador, Haley voiced heavy skepticism about Russia and optimism about NATO, both deviations from some of Trump\u2019s statements. She unequivocally shot down the idea of a Muslim registry or ban, which Trump has never fully disavowed. Under questioning from Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Haley appeared to struggle at times to balance distancing herself from some of Trump\u2019s most controversial positions without appearing overly critical of her new boss. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put her on the spot, noting that on some issues Trump has outlined a world view that is \u201cthe exact opposite of what you are articulating it to be.\u201d Trump has already modified some positions and more changes are likely once Trump is in office, she said. (AP) \u201cNot all of it will change after Friday, but I will control the part of it I can,\u201d at the United Nations, she said. Wednesday\u2019s hearing which came after a string of others in which Trump\u2019s nominees were at odds with him over some of his signature stances, highlighted the potential for deep discord in the new administration. For her part, Haley framed the disagreements as a positive development. \u201cThat\u2019s how an administration works, You surround yourself with people who don\u2019t just say \u2018yes\u2019 to what you think,\u201d she said. Haley was supposed to be one of Trump\u2019s least-contentious choices for a top government job despite little direct experience handling the global issues and negotiations she would face as the ambassador to the United Nations. Haley entered her confirmation hearing with the likelihood of at least some Democratic support. But the stakes for Haley, a Republican rising star and one of the party\u2019s few women of color in high office, rose after the problematic audition last week for the man who would be her boss \u2014 secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson. [ As U.S. ambassador to U.N., Nikki Haley would face world\u2019s most intractable conflicts ] She pledged to forcefully advance American interests at the U.N. after what she called a retreat from global leadership under the Obama administration. Haley questioned the priorities and effectiveness of the world body, which Trump has called a toothless debating society, but said she intends to \u201cfix\u201d what doesn\u2019t work. \u201cI have no problem calling people out,\u201d Haley said. The United Nations is \u201coften at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers,\u201d Haley said, adding that she would use the \u201cleverage\u201d of potential cuts in U.S. funding to demand reform. She expressed skepticism about working with Russia. \u201cRussia is trying to show their muscle right now. It\u2019s what they do,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we can trust them,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to continue to be very strong back and show them what this new administration is going to be.\u201d (AP) She said she agrees that Russia invaded and seized Ukrainian territory in 2014 and that U.S. and international sanctions were an appropriate response. She said she would consider additional sanctions, something Trump has suggested he may oppose. Haley said she has not had a detailed conversation with Trump about the U.S. relationship with Russia. [ First sign of enhanced U.S.-Russia relations under Trump: An invite to Syria talks ] Russia, like the United States, holds a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. and Russian ambassadors must work closely together, even if they rarely agree. Haley would probably work more directly with Russia than any other top U.S. official apart from the secretary of state. She said she believed Russia\u2019s bombing in Aleppo, Syria, constituted a war crime. Tillerson declined to call Russia President Vladimir Putin a war criminal during his hearing last week. Haley harshly criticized the Obama administration for allowing the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israel and pledged never to let it happen again if confirmed as the next U.N. ambassador. \u201cI will not go to New York and abstain when the U.N. seeks to create an international environment that encourages boycotts of Israel,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the United States.\u201d She also questioned the priorities of the United Nations in other areas and whether the United States is getting its money\u2019s worth for its contribution and investment. Haley said she looks forward to representing the United States in the international forum, but her skepticism about the United Nations\u2019 value echoes Trump\u2019s and aides who have said the New York-based body is biased, bloated and ineffectual. \u201cWe contribute 22 percent of the U.N.\u2019s budget, far more than any other country. We are a generous nation,\u201d Haley said. \u201cBut we must ask ourselves what good is being accomplished by this disproportionate contribution. Are we getting what we pay for?\u201d (AP) Haley is best known nationally for her handling of the 2015 racially motivated killings of black worshipers at a historic Charleston church, for which she got generally high marks. She spoke at memorials and ordered the Confederate flag removed from the state Capitol grounds. In 2016 she was chosen to give the Republican response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, and used the platform to indirectly criticize Trump. She backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) during the primaries, and her selection by Trump for a Cabinet-level job bucked a trend against welcoming former political foes. Haley, who turns 45 on Inauguration Day, is the South Carolina-born daughter of Indian immigrant parents. She was a member of the state legislature before her election as the state\u2019s first female and first minority governor. Haley was mentioned as a potential vice presidential pick in 2016 and is seen as a potential future Republican presidential candidate. The U.N. job would add critical national security experience to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and raise her national and international profile. Tillerson angered Democrats and at least one influential Republican, Rubio, with fuzzy or equivocal answers. He ran into trouble when asked about his former employer, oil giant ExxonMobil, sanctions on Russia, climate change and some human rights issues. Tillerson won praise and criticism for refusing to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and disagreed with Trump on several issues, including blunt denunciation of Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of the Crimea region of Ukraine. (AP) Tillerson\u2019s nomination remains in limbo, with Rubio a potential spoiler. If approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week, he could be approved by the full Senate as soon as Friday. Haley would succeed U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, whose farewell address Tuesday was a prosecution of Putin\u2019s Russia for what she called a systematic subversion of international rules, including an effort to \u201cundercut the credibility of international institutions like the U.N.\u201d She blamed the Russian leader for the deaths of opposition figures and journalists in Russia and called the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea a \u201cland grab.\u201d \u201cI know some have said that this focus on Russia is simply the party that lost the recent presidential election being \u2018sore losers,\u2019 \u201d Power said. \u201cBut it should worry every American that a foreign government interfered in our democratic process. It\u2019s not about the leader we chose \u2014 it\u2019s about who gets to choose that leader. That privilege should belong only to Americans.\u201d Read more: ",

Bush told President-elect Donald Trump that he has to skip the inauguration on Friday because sitting outside during the winter would be too risky to his and his wife\u2019s health. \u201cBarbara and I are so sorry we can\u2019t be there for your inauguration on January 20th,\u201d Bush wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump last week, which surfaced Wednesday. \u201cMy doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSame for Barbara, So I guess we\u2019re stuck in Texas.\u201d info Close Bush, 92, said that the former president and former first lady will be there \u201cin spirit\u201d and offered to help if he ever needs it. Coincidentally,\u00a0 Bush has been hospitalized since Saturday for shortness of breath , his spokesman Jim McGrath confirmed Wednesday on Twitter. He was admitted to the ICU at Houston Methodist Hospital to address an issue stemming from pneumonia, his office said in a statement.\u00a0 The statement also said that former first lady Barbara Bush was admitted to the hospital after experiencing fatigue and coughing.\u00a0 \u201cDoctors performed a procedure to protect and clear his airway that required sedation. President Bush is stable and resting comfortably in the ICU, where he will remain for observation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAdditionally, Mrs. Bush was admitted to the Houston Methodist Hospital this morning as a precaution after experiencing fatigue and coughing.\u201d Bush suffers from a form of Parkinson\u2019s disease and in 2015, he spent a week in a Maine hospital after falling and breaking a bone in his neck. Mr. Trump responded on Twitter Wednesday afternoon, thanking George and Barbara Bush for the letter.\u00a0 Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush, both hospitalized.

Rick Perry to Face Congress in Confirmation Hearing By ALANA ABRAMSON Jan 18, 2017, 7:30 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Rick Perry's 'Oops' Moment at 2011 Primary Debate 0 Shares Email Donald Trump 's former GOP primary rival, former Texas Governor Rick Perry , will come before Congress tomorrow for his confirmation hearing for Secretary of the Energy Department . Trump selected Perry to serve as his Secretary of Energy on December 14, nearly a year-and-a-half after a contentious primary season where the two ran against each other. When announcing Perry for Secretary of Energy, Trump praised his gubernatorial record in Texas, saying he had produced millions of jobs and lower energy prices when he ran the state. Perry is likely to face tough questioning from Democrats about the Keystone pipeline, the controversial oil transportation plan that President Obama rejected last November, but Perry supported during both of his presidential runs. Perry was one of the first in the 2016 race to attack Trump, calling him a \" cancer on conservatism.\" The Department of Energy was one of the federal agencies Perry said he wanted to eliminate during his first Presidential run in 2012. 0 Shares ",

Lynch was in Chicago to announce the release of a report which cited widespread abuses by officers in the Chicago police department following a 13-month investigation. (Photo: Scott Olson) CHICAGO \u2014 A Chicago Police officer was charged on Wednesday with first-degree murder for an off-duty shooting earlier this month that left a 38-year-old man dead, according to prosecutors. Lowell Houser, 57, a veteran officer\u00a0assigned to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s public transportation unit, was taken into custody Wednesday and will appear in bond court on Thursday afternoon, said Tandra Simonton, a spokeswoman for the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office. Simonton did not provide further information about the incident, but police have previously said that the victim \u2014 Jose Nieves \u2014 was not armed and that the two men had argued in the past. The police department said in a statement shortly after the Jan. 2 shooting on the city's Northwest Side\u00a0that the officer, who was off-duty at the time, was involved in some type of altercation with the victim prior to the shooting. The incident escalated, and the off-duty officer discharged his weapon, striking Nieves multiple times. The family of Nieves, who juggled jobs as a construction worker and security guard,\u00a0filed a federal lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department days after the incident, alleging that Houser \"illegally detained and threatened to arrest and physically harm\" Nieves before shooting him. \"It was an unjustified, unreasonable use of excessive force by a Chicago Police officer operating within his police powers against an unarmed man,\" Andrew Stroth, a Chicago civil rights attorney representing the Nieves family, told USA TODAY after the murder charge was\u00a0announced Wednesday. Chicago police use excessive force, scathing Justice Department report finds The murder charge against Houser comes just days after the U.S. Department of Justice released the findings of a 13-month long investigation of Chicago\u2019s police force, in which they found that the city\u2019s cops are poorly trained, often use excessive force, and rarely face discipline for misconduct. The DOJ probe was launched in December 2015 following widespread outrage and protest in the city after\u00a0the court-ordered release of police video that showed a police officer fire 16 shots at 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The officer in that incident, Jason Van Dyke, was charged with first degree murder for the fatal shooting of McDonald on the same day as the video\u2019s release \u2014 400 days after the incident. Anita Alvarez, who was the Cook County County State's Attorney at the time of the McDonald incident, faced fierce criticism from Black Lives Matter activists for taking more than a year to file charges against Van Dyke. The former prosecutor\u00a0also faced derision from activists for her handling of the prosecution of off-duty police officer Dante Servin, who fired his service weapon into a crowd and killing an unarmed woman, Rekia Boyd. Servin was found not guilty after a judge found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter after a judge found that Alvarez's office did not properly charge the former police officer. Kim Foxx, the current prosecutor\u00a0who defeated Alvarez in a Democratic primary last year, made Alvarez's handling of Van Dyke's prosecution a centerpiece of her successful\u00a0campaign. ",

Yellen said she anticipates a few interest rate hikes per year through to the end of 2019. Proof of an economy nearly running on its own came in the form out the Beige Book out this afternoon. The six-week report touted \"modest\" growth in the U.S. economy as labor markets tightened and price pressures increased. General Motors was hit with a $1 million fine from the SEC to settle accounting failures tied to its ignition switch defect. Recalls for that safety issue began in 2014. JPMorgan has reportedly agreed to a $55 million fine to settle a lawsuit with the Department of Justice. The U.S. government filed a lawsuit alleging that the bank discriminated against minority mortgage borrowers. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Still waiting for Dow 20,000: A hat made by trader Peter Tuchman is seen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 6, 2017. (EPA/JUSTIN LANE) (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) This is not a kiss and tell story: The fact is the on-again, off-again romance between the Dow and the 20,000 milestone\u00a0is officially on hold. The Dow Jones industrial average\u2019s flirtation with 20,000 has cooled since Jan. 6 when the stock index\u00a0faced a football-style fourth-and-inches market moment but was stopped 0.37 points short of its history-making milestone. What postponed the Dow 20,000 party? In the seven trading days since the Dow was turned back just shy of the 20,000 mark, the 30-stock index has been in retreat. It has finished lower six of the past seven sessions. And after Wednesday\u2019s drop of 22\u00a0points to 19,804.72, it is nearly 200\u00a0points away from the milestone. So what gives? * \u201cTrump rally\u201d matures. Dow 20,000 is just a number. But the near-miss milestone coincided with a stock market that had run far and fast since Election Day. From the first day of trading after Donald Trump won\u00a0the White House until Jan. 6, when the Dow came within a whisker of topping\u00a020,000, the Dow\u00a0surged nearly 1,700 points, or 9.1%. The bulk of those gains were driven by hope. Investors began pricing in a stronger economy and better corporate earnings based on Trump\u2019s business-friendly policy proposals. Profit-taking was bound to kick in, especially since\u00a0the Dow was at its most \u201coverbought\u201d level since November 1996, according to Mark Arbeter, president of Arbeter Investments. \u201cThe sugar high is wearing off,\u201d Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management, wrote in a recent report. * Stocks go flat after downgrade. On Jan. 9, the first trading day after the Dow came closest to 20,000 Goldman Sachs slowed its climb\u00a0further when it downgraded fellow Dow components Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble to \u201csell\u201d investment recommendations. That helped push\u00a0shares of the stocks lower. * Financials fizzle. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and other Dow financial shares shot up after Trump\u2019s win. The idea of less regulation of banks, a better economy and the prospect for rising interest rates put banks in the \"Trump Rally\" sweet spot. But the bank-fueled rally has stalled since Jan. 6, the same day the Dow came within a single point of 20,000. Goldman Sachs ran up 35% from Election Day until Jan. 6, and was the Dow\u2019s top performer in that span. But since then, it has been among the Dow\u2019s worst performers, tumbling more than 4%. In a sign of how the bank rally has stalled, Goldman shares fell 0.6% Wednesday despite reporting quarterly earnings and revenue results that exceeded analyst expectations. \u201cThe first leg of the \u2018Trump trade'\u00a0is largely over,\u201d Jason Trennert of Wall Street firm Strategas Research Partners, said\u00a0in a note. \u201cThe next leg of the Trump trade will come when we learn more about specifics of corporate tax reform and deregulation.\u201d * Imaginary ceiling halts rise. Big round numbers like Dow 20,000 often act like an impenetrable ceiling that take time to break through and then act as a magnet for a period of time. The best example might be what happened to the Dow around 1,000, says Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal. He notes that the Dow came within five points of topping 1,000 back in February 1965. But the Dow didn\u2019t close above 1,000\u00a0until Nov. 14, 1972, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Dow didn\u2019t say goodbye to 1,000 for good until 1982, or 10 years later. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jAnDkm NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

A brief FBI statement Wednesday says it and the Justice Department's civil-rights division are investigating \"possible civil rights violations in connection with threats.\" The statement from the agency's Washington headquarters doesn't characterize the threats. But the Anti-Defamation League the same day issued a statement citing \"a series of bomb threats to Jewish community centers in at least 17 states.\" The ADL's Jonathan Greenblatt adds about actual explosives that \"so far these threats do not appear to be credible.\" But the statement says centers should still take them seriously. The ADL says it's received reports of threats in New York, New Jersey , Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, California, Maine, Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri, Texas and Kansas. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Obama Talks About Chelsea Manning Commutation, WikiLeaks and His Daughters' Reaction to the Election By Meghan Keneally Jan 18, 2017, 3:24 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Barack Obama Holds His Last Press Conference 0 Shares Email President Barack Obama defended commuting Chelsea Manning 's prison sentence during his final news conference as commander in chief. The commutation was announced Tuesday, prompting questions about what will happen to other people who leak government information. \"I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent that when it comes to our national security ,\" Obama said today, \"that wherever possible, we need folks who may have legitimate concerns about the actions of government or their superiors or the agencies in which they work that they try to work through the established channels.\" Former President George HW Bush Admitted to ICU, Barbara Bush Hospitalized \"Chelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence,\" Obama said. \"So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital classified information would think that it goes unpunished \u2014 I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.\" Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, and she will now be released on May 17. Her lawyer released a statement after the announcement that her sentence was commuted saying that her time in prison included \"long stretches of solitary confinement \u2014 including for attempting suicide.\" Obama was asked about a tweet from WikiLeaks that said that if Manning was granted clemency, the site's founder, Julian Assange , apparently offered to be extradited from the U.K. to the U.S. \"despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case.\" \"I don't pay attention to Mr. Assange's tweets,\" Obama said. \"And I refer you to the Justice Department for any criminal investigations, indictments, extradition issues that may come up with him.\" In the wide-ranging press conference, Obama touched on a number of topics, starting with the importance of a free press, then fielding questions about immigration policy, voting rights and his plans for post-presidential life, among others. \"I want do some writing. I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much. I want to spend precious time with my girls. So those are my priorities this year,\" he said. He also spoke about possible political changes during the Trump administration or news that could prompt him to speak out about proposals after he leaves office. Those situations, Obama said, would be only in \"certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake.\" He said some of his concerns could include \"efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else when they love this country\" and \"institutional efforts to silence dissent for the press.\" Obama also said at the start of his remarks that he had been in touch with the Bush family about former President George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, who are both hospitalized. \"They have not only dedicated their lives to this country \u2014 they have been a constant source of friendship and support and good counsel for Michelle and me over the years,\" Obama said. \"They are as fine a couple as we know, and so we want to send our prayers and our love to them. Really good people.\" The final question was a personal one, with Obama weighing in on how his daughters reacted to the presidential election, starting with some admitted bragging. \"Man, my daughters are something,\" Obama said. \"And they just surprise and enchant and impress me more and more every single day as they grow up.\" \"It was really interesting to see how Malia and Sasha reacted. They were disappointed. They paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it because it's consistent with what we have tried to teach them in our household and what I've tried to model as a father with their mom and what we've asked them to expect from future boyfriends or spouses. But what we've also tried to teach them is resilience and tried to teach them hope and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

(Jan. 18) AP Donald Trump's penthouse in Trump Tower in Manhattan, photographed in January 2012. (Photo: Scott Frances, OTTO) 2107 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 53 COMMENTEMAILMORE Nervous questions are being asked in Washington\u00a0about all sorts of super-serious matters\u00a0with the coming of the Donald Trump administration, but one that might resonate in the rest of America is this: What will the gilt-loving collector of luxury homes do to redecorate the White House? \"This is the really sexy topic \u2014\u00a0people are desperate to know,\" says Kate Andersen Brower, author of The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House, about the staff of ushers, painters, carpenters, florists and other craftspeople who keep the White House running smoothly no matter who is president. \"Reading the tea leaves and talking with people in touch with the residence staff, I don't think (the Trumps) are going to do that much, this is not a priority for them,\" Brower says. In fact, so far there is not the usual coordination between the outgoing first family, the staff and the new family.\u00a0\"This is unprecedented, that there's not that coordination by this point.\" Still, it's a clue to Brower and others familiar with the running of the White House, that Trump has other matters on his mind rather than redecorating, and certainly not anything that would fundamentally alter the historic character of the public state rooms on the first floor and some on the second floor. Because that part of the People's House belongs to the people, not the president, and is protected by law, custom and guardian White House curators and historians from meddling, even by the brash likes of Trump. \"You can't redo the Yellow Oval Room in pink,\" says Brower. \"You have to go through the Office of the Curator, who fiercely guards the White House. You can bling out the family bedrooms and the sitting rooms but not the (rose-colored) Queen's Suite (named for all the royals who have stayed there) or the Lincoln Bedroom (named for the 16th president).\" First Lady Michelle Obama meets with Mrs. Gursharan Kaur in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House, in November 2009, after room was redone for the Obamas by designer Michael Smith. \u00a0(Photo: Subhash Chander Malhotra, AP) Michael Smith, the nationally\u00a0noted interior designer who redid the Oval Office and the family quarters for the Obamas in 2009, says he doesn't expect radical change from the Trumps. \"The house is very adaptable, there is no reason to radically upend it, it works really, really well and it\u2019s really beautiful,\" Smith says. \"You wouldn\u2019t go in and say, 'I want to move Lincoln's\u00a0bed.' And why would you? \"You do stuff (in the family quarters) personal to you, that makes it a home to you.\u00a0You add your imprint, your style, your personal aesthetic mixture, but still a large piece of the White House is part of a continuum...You are conscious (as a designer) of\u00a0becoming a part of the great sweep of history rather than starting from scratch.\" Trump is already on record about this: Before the election,\u00a0he was interviewed by\u00a0 People ,\u00a0which ran a story under the headline, \"Will It Be the Gold House? Donald Trump Reveals His Plans for the Most Famous Home in America.\" Not to worry, Trump said.\u00a0\u201cIf I were elected, I would maybe touch it up a little bit, but\u00a0the White House is a special place...You don\u2019t want to do too much touching.\u201d In\u00a0an ABC\u00a0 interview\u00a0 in November 2015 at his Trump Tower three-level penthouse\u00a0\u2014 the one designed to look like the interior of Versailles, the gaudy palace of the doomed French monarchy, interviewer Barbara Walters suggested the White House might be a \"step down\" from what she could see\u00a0\u2014 the\u00a0gold and diamond accents, miles of marble and hand-painted ceiling murals.Trump said the White House is a\u00a0\u201cspectacular place\u201d that \u201crepresents something very special.\u201d Anyway, Trump might not even be at the White House as much as his predecessors, and for the first six months, incoming first lady Melania Trump will be in New York taking care of her 10-year-old son. When it comes to living large, Trump is already well-equipped. The family has access to at least five\u00a0other luxury abodes, including Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach;\u00a0the Seven Springs summer retreat in\u00a0Bedford, N.Y.\u00a0and a mansion on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills;\u00a0the\u00a0 Trump Vineyard Estates , a 23,000-square-foot mansion,\u00a0winery and vineyard in Charlottesville, Va.; and Le\u00a0Chateau des Palmiers , another sprawling estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. Mar-a-Lago Club on December 30, 2016 in Palm Beach, Fla. \u00a0(Photo: DON EMMERT, AFP/Getty Images) But \"touching up\" the family quarters on the second floor of the White House is perfectly acceptable and every new first family usually does it. Their touch-ups are designed and supervised by an interior designer working with the first lady, the White House curator and the chief usher, to remake the space for the new family's needs and to its specifications. The Obamas' instructions to Smith: Make their new home feel like a home, full of \"elegant and simple things,\" Smith says.\u00a0\"The family quarters are a complete apartment upstairs, including bedrooms, sitting rooms, a study, and they're generally personalized in some way. Some presidents do very little, some presidents, like the Reagans,\u00a0they brought their own household furniture and redid the rooms to be cozy and warm. There are no hard and fast rules.\" Le Chateau des Palmiers on Plum Bay in St. Martin, here in 2004, features a five-bedroom oceanside villa and a four-bedroom garden-side villa. \u00a0(Photo: Bobby Gibson @ Villas Caribe) Congress supplies a $100,000 budget for renovations\u00a0; the Obamas opted to pay for their redecorating themselves. Other presidents have raised funds privately to pay for some projects. The key word is \"private\"\u00a0\u2014 the public doesn't get to see the refurbishing until the first family is leaving, when the pictures appear in some prominent home or architectural magazine in the last month of the last year of the administration, Smith says. See the Obamas' White House private quarters for the first time Smith says the White House has a way of overpowering the strongest personalities, and not just decorators' egos. \"No matter who you are in the world and whatever your own aesthetic and style, there is something extra humbling about the White House,\" he says. \"It\u00a0has so much history that occurred in that building. You\u2019re kind of haunted by that and it\u2019s wonderful. You're conscious, if you move a chair or change a curtain, you're adding your own stamp\u00a0and the first\u00a0family's to a profoundly documented piece of American history.\" 2107 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 53 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k1lECk NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

By Manuel Roig-Franzia By Manuel Roig-Franzia January 18 at 1:12 PM Follow @RoigFranzia Mary Rich, the mother of slain DNC staffer Seth Rich, gives a press conference in Bloomingdale on August 1, 2016. Seth Rich was gunned down in the DC neighborhood in July. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) The first instinct was to fight. He\u2019d call their bluff. Come out swinging. \u201cProve it,\u201d Joel Rich wanted to say. Prove my boy died because he was some kind of a mole, an email hacker, a cog in a conspiracy, a patsy in an international political intrigue. Prove it! Yet Joel Rich knew he wouldn\u2019t get anywhere trying to knock down each new Internet rumor about the death this past summer of his son, Seth. \u201cPeople don\u2019t care about the truth anymore,\u201d the father lamented. Seth Rich, the 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer with the straw-colored hair, American flag shirts and goofy grin, wasn\u2019t just another D.C. murder victim. No. He was a meme in the weirdest presidential election of our times. Somehow the bullets that took Rich\u2019s life early that morning in July \u2014 two loud pops in the darkness \u2014 have continued to echo long after police officers found him bleeding in the streets of the District\u2019s Bloomingdale neighborhood, chattering away but confused, unaware that his life was seeping away. In an era of reckless information, this is what it\u2019s like when the fire hose gets turned on your family. Joel Rich wanted to move on to the next stage of grief, but it was too noisy out there, the allegations getting more and more far-fetched. Seth was ordered killed by Hillary Clinton because he knew something about her email scandal. Seth was killed by Russians posing as FBI agents investigating the Clintons. Seth was killed because he slipped DNC emails to WikiLeaks. Seth Rich was shot and killed July 10, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Democratic National Committee) What seems painfully obvious to his family is that Seth Rich was, instead, the victim of a botched holdup, one of a series of armed robberies in the neighborhood around that time. Interviews with more than a dozen people who knew Rich well, including several who spoke to him in the final hours of his life \u2014 as well as a previously unreported minute-by-minute log of Rich\u2019s phone calls \u2014 fill in some of the blanks of that night. But they offer no hint that a conspiracy was at play. Still, there are the curiosities \u2014 a nearly three-hour walk in the wee hours before his death, the valuables left untouched on his body, a surveillance tape that Rich\u2019s family says gives a glimpse of his possible killers\u2019 legs but that police have yet to show to the parents or to the public. Enough to make people wonder. Enough to draw the interest of a D.C.-based Republican lobbyist, Jack Burkman, who has become a Rich family ally and is offering a $130,000 reward, bringing the total dangling out there for clues to $175,000. Burkman has been canvassing the neighborhood while asserting that the \u201cpolice have no theory of the case\u201d and that \u201cyou can effectively rule out attempted robbery.\u201d For all the musing and speculation, the amateur sleuthing and the six-figure reward, the breathless news reports and the vitriol-soaked commentating, no one has been able to answer two basic questions \u2014 not the police, not his friends, not his neighbors, not his co-workers. Who killed Seth Rich? And why? Neighbors, friends and colleagues remembered 27-year-old Seth Rich at a vigil held in his Bloomingdale neighborhood on July 14, 2016. (Perry Stein/The Washington Post) Candles and flowers and photo of Rich left in tribute to him in the neighborhood where he was killed. (Perry Stein/The Washington Post) Shaken by a headline Seth Rich didn\u2019t come from a politics-obsessed family. But, growing up in Omaha, the son of parents who worked in sales, he watched C-SPAN for fun and volunteered for political campaigns as a teenager. As a kid, Seth tried a bit of acting and did some fashion modeling. He excelled at debate. Seth Rich was a talker. \u201cWhen he decides to, he\u2019ll talk your ear off,\u201d his brother, Aaron Rich, said in an interview. The Jewish kid from Nebraska chose to attend a Jesuit college, Creighton, because he liked its political science curriculum. \u201cHe\u2019d sometimes call himself a Jew with Jesuit values,\u201d his father said. After graduation, there was little doubt that he was headed for Washington, D.C. He landed a job at the polling and strategy firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. He worried that he wouldn\u2019t know anyone in the capital. It wasn\u2019t long, though, before it was obvious to everyone that Washington was a perfect fit for him. He fell in with the swarm of 20-somethings who populate the city. Wednesday night softball games. Weekend soccer. Nights playing the board game the Settlers of Catan in shared rowhouses. Rich was the outsize personality, the guy who showed up in panda suits, who went over-the-top with flag-themed clothing on the Fourth of July. A big American flag hung over his bed. He wanted to be everywhere all the time. Within just a few weeks of meeting Michael Cass-Anthony, another young staffer at GQR, Rich was organizing a big outing to a New York Giants football game to celebrate his brand-new friend\u2019s birthday. He tutored everyone in the proper rituals of tailgating. At the office, Rich was thriving, but restless. He worked as a programmer, sorting through data gathered in surveys. One of the underpinnings of the conspiracy theories about Rich is that he was some kind of technical whiz, capable of bypassing security systems. But Andrew Therriault, a PhD data scientist who mentored Rich at Greenberg and later helped him get a job at the DNC, said his protege \u201cwanted to learn more from a technical standpoint. But that wasn\u2019t his background.\u201d At the DNC, Rich dove into a voter-expansion project aimed at making it easier for people to find their polling places. He felt like he\u2019d arrived in the \u201cbig leagues,\u201d Cass-Anthony recalled. Rich had become a regular at Lou\u2019s City Bar, a sensory-overloading sports pub amid the big-box stores in a redeveloped section of Columbia Heights. From his usual corner seat, hard against a wooden pillar, Rich would banter about politics for hours over his favorite drink, Bell\u2019s Two-Hearted Ale. But he wouldn\u2019t budge when the bar manager, Joe Capone \u2014 who had become a good friend \u2014 tried to get him to reveal his favored candidate. The pressures of the job were taking a toll on his relationship with a young woman he\u2019d met at Greenberg. But Rich was in love, and he wanted to make it work despite the rocky patches, Capone said. Something else was bugging him, too. In June, an explosive story made headlines: A cybersecurity firm had determined that hackers associated with Russian intelligence had broken into DNC computers. \u201cHe was so upset,\u201d a person who was very close to Rich said on the condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by cyberbullies and conspiracy theorists. \u201cIt was crazy. Especially for Seth. He said, \u2018Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?\u2019 That made him so angry.\u201d (Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post) The night\u2019s timeline On July 9 \u2014 less than a month after news of the DNC hack had broken \u2014 Seth Rich sat at his usual spot in Lou\u2019s. It was Saturday night, and his girlfriend was out of town. He was alone, but not really. The staff at the bar knew him well, and they\u2019d slide him a Bell\u2019s from time to time on the house. He wasn\u2019t the biggest drinker; sometimes he\u2019d sit for long stretches nursing a Bell\u2019s and staring into a laptop. They knew him so well that when he ordered the chicken wings, he didn\u2019t have to tell them to hold the bleu cheese. They knew he was lactose intolerant. The bartender would yell out: \u201cDo it Seth-style.\u201d When Capone, the general manager, was struggling to find the right wording for a portion of his daughter\u2019s college application, Rich helped with the rewrite, Capone said. Rich had a lot on his mind. He\u2019d gotten another job opportunity: a position with the campaign of Hillary Clinton, who had by then won the Democratic nomination. There was only one problem: The job was in Brooklyn. The girlfriend was in D.C. This was causing friction. \u201cHe was having some problems with his girlfriend,\u201d Capone said. \u201cMostly about moving away and seeing if they could survive it. He was upset. He loved her.\u201d Sometimes he\u2019d join bartenders for drinks at after-hours places, but more often than not he\u2019d walk the 1.8 miles home alone, using the time to catch up on phone calls because he got poor cellphone reception in his house. On the last night of his life, Rich stayed at the bar until it closed around 1:30 a.m., according to a Lou\u2019s bartender. Two hours and 49 minutes later he would be lying on a sidewalk, dying. A log of Rich\u2019s phone calls, compiled by the family, accounts for a large chunk of that time \u2014 about two hours 15 minutes. But it doesn\u2019t explain why he took so long to make a walk home that should have taken about 40 minutes. There\u2019s been much speculation that Rich went to another bar, the Wonderland Ballroom, after leaving Lou\u2019s. But a person who spoke to him that night and agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity said he did not go there. Rich placed at least five calls and received two incoming calls, according to the log. The first three were placed before closing time \u2014 two to his father, who\u2019d gone to bed early and didn\u2019t hear the ring, and one to a friend; they lasted only a minute. Rich seems to have been on the phone with another friend, who had called him, when the bar closed. That 12-minute call ended at 1:33. At 2:05, he called his girlfriend, who was in her home state of Michigan. They spoke for 89 minutes. Then the call dropped. A few minutes later, he called her again, and they spoke for 43 more minutes. At about 4:19 a.m., Rich told his girlfriend he was almost home and said, \u201cI gotta go,\u201d according to Rich\u2019s father, who has spoken with his girlfriend. (She asked not to be named or quoted because of continuing harassment of those connected to the case.) Rich didn\u2019t sound alarmed. His girlfriend, according to a person familiar with the events of that night, went to bed thinking there was nothing amiss. Mary Rich and Joel Rich talk about the loss of their son in their home in Omaha, on Jan. 11, 2017. (Matt Miller/For The Washington Post) A crime scene, and unanswered questions Later that morning, Joel Rich got a call from Washington police. Seth was dead. The father learned his son was found around the corner from his house, at the intersection of Flagler Place and W Street NW \u2014 about 300 steps from his front door in the rapidly gentrifying Bloomingdale neighborhood. By Tuesday, barely 48 hours after Seth Rich\u2019s death, his name was being spoken on the presidential campaign trail, as Clinton referenced him while arguing for legal steps to limit the spread of guns. Pieces of what might have happened were starting to come into focus as the family spoke to police, who suspected a botched robbery, and other emergency responders. The parents saw bruises on Rich\u2019s face when his body was sent home to Omaha to be buried. They surmised there\u2019d been a struggle. Police told the family, Joel Rich said, that a security camera from a small convenience store across the street captured a grainy image of their son collapsing and the feet or legs of two other people \u2014 possibly his killers. Officials with D.C. police declined an interview request. A police spokesman would not confirm the existence of a video or reveal what Rich may have said after he was shot, saying that that information could compromise an ongoing investigation. The Riches also learned that their son\u2019s watch and wallet had not been taken, although the watchband was damaged. There was something else that wasn\u2019t taken: an expensive Jewish chai pendant that Mary Rich had initially given to Joel, inscribed with the word \u201cditto,\u201d an inside joke from their courtship. Officials told the Riches that their son, who died at a nearby hospital less than two hours after being shot, didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been hit in the back by two bullets. He wasn\u2019t in pain, they were told. But he was confused. When Seth Rich was asked where he lived, he gave a previous address, Joel Rich said. \u201cThey were very surprised he didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Aaron Rich said emergency responders told him. \u201cHe was very aware, very talkative. Yep, that was 100 percent my brother.\u201d Seth Rich at age 2 wearing his father's \"Goofy\" slippers. (Courtesy of the Rich family) Seth Rich with his parents during a family trip to Washington on the spring of 2013. (Courtesy of the Rich family) \u2018Don\u2019t dare them\u2019 Their voice mail was clotted with calls from reporters from all over the world. Everyone wanted to talk to Joel and Mary Rich. It was almost a month to the day since their son breathed his last. And now this? The reason for the deluge was a tweet. WikiLeaks, the organization that had published thousands of hacked DNC emails less than two weeks after Seth Rich was killed, had announced on Twitter that it was offering a $20,000 reward in the killing. Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks editor, further stoked speculation that Rich might have been involved in the DNC hack by referencing the murder, unprompted, on a Dutch news program. \u201cOur whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often [face] very significant risks. A 27-year-old that works for the DNC was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons, as he was walking down the street in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Assange said. Assange wasn\u2019t the only one spinning dark theories. Roger Stone, the Donald Trump confidant and self-proclaimed Nixon-era dirty trickster, took to Twitter to suggest Rich and three other men might have been murdered at the behest of Clinton. \u201cFour more dead bodies in the Clinton\u2019s wake. Coincidence? I think not. @ClintonsWar,\u201d Stone tweeted beneath a photo of Rich and the other men. Joel Rich felt overwhelmed. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a different league,\u201d he said. The family was referred to Brad Bauman, a Washington public-relations professional with a knack with experience as a \u201ccrisis manager,\u201d Joel Rich recalled. This, he was certain, qualified as a crisis. \u201cHow hurtful this is to think that you\u2019re getting ready to go to the next phase of grieving and now they\u2019re going through the legacy and the integrity of our son,\u201d he said. The father wanted to confront WikiLeaks and others who speculated about Seth \u2014 to demand they back their claims. Bauman, who would himself later become the object of conspiracy theorists who claimed he was brought in by nefarious liberal factions to silence the family, gave Joel Rich a piece of advice: \u201cDon\u2019t dare them.\u201d While Joel seethed, Aaron Rich found solace in laughter. As the conspiracies became more and more elaborate, he chuckled. There was nothing else he could do. \u201cWhen facts aren\u2019t required, how are you supposed to counter any argument?\u201d he said. But everything had changed. The family started worrying about each word they uttered, fearful that even innocent-seeming remarks could be twisted. They were getting phone calls from people claiming to be private investigators, offering help. But they didn\u2019t know who was legit and who was a fraud. Jack Burkman, the lobbyist who has put up a sizable donation to solve the murder of Seth Rich, shakes hands with a area resident after a short discussion of the case as he canvasses the neighborhood on January, 10, 2017. (Bill O'Leary/Washington Post) An unlikely ally This fall, the Riches got a call from a Republican lobbyist and political strategist: Jack Burkman, who hosts a Newsmax cable program and has represented corporate clients in Washington for years. He might best be known for his failed crusade to ban gay men from playing in the NFL, a proposal that he made after the St. Louis Rams signed a gay college player, Michael Sam. \u201cWe were saying, \u2018What do we know about this guy?\u2019 \u201d Joel Rich recalled. \u201cHe\u2019s Republican. He\u2019s been associated with at least one crazy amendment with the NFL and gays. So he may have his own agenda.\u201d But Burkman, who says he\u2019s motivated by empathy for the Rich family, won them over. He has offered $130,000 of his own money as a reward, adding to the $25,000 offered by D.C. police and $20,000 from WikiLeaks. And he tugged at their hearts, telling them about how his mother used to warn him about safety on the streets of the District when he was a law student two decades ago. On a recent afternoon, Burkman searched for clues, speed-walking among the Victorian-style rowhouses in the neighborhood where a young man he had never met once lived. \u201cWe\u2019re just desperate,\u201d Burkman told a federal worker who happened by. The printing had been delayed for Burkman\u2019s fliers, and he\u2019d forgotten to bring business cards. But, undaunted, he scribbled his phone number on the backs of blank envelopes he happened to have in his notepad, handing them out to people with quizzical looks on their faces. He banged on a church door, thinking he heard someone inside. No one answered. \u201cWe\u2019re in politics. We\u2019re campaigners,\u201d he said, bounding down the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep shootin\u2019.\u201d Peter Hermann and Alice Crites contributed to this report. lifestyle ",

That put the nation's first African-American president 45 pressers behind his predecessor George W. Bush, who held 210 press conferences during his two terms, according to the APP. Martha Joynt Kumar , who heads the White House Transition Project, said that doesn't mean Obama has kept reporters at arm's length. \"President Obama has given reporters plenty of access,\" said Kumar. \"In terms of one-on-one interviews, he has done more than (George W.) Bush and (Bill) Clinton combined.\" Kumar said she tallied 1,070 through September \"and he's certainly done a hundred since then.\" But Obama has not done many of the short question and answer sessions with the media that Clinton preferred doing, said Kumar. And, to the frustration of the White House press corps, he rarely took more than a handful of questions at formal press conferences. \"The thing about Obama is that he talked long,\" said Kumar. \"What he liked to do is deal with a particular issue or area and answer questions at length.\" Obama \u2014 like other presidents before him \u2014 often preferred to take his message directly to the people. \"For example, when he wanted to get young people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, he went to Zach Galifianakis,\" Kumar said, referring to the comedian's \"Between Two Ferns\" show. Also, said Kumar, \"for Obama social media was important.\" Like his predecessors, Obama left dealing with the White House press corps to press secretaries like Josh Earnest , who presided over his final briefing on Tuesday. Obama crashed the briefing and thanked Earnest for his service. Corky Siemaszko ",

In response to a News Sentinel\u00a0request, the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance on Wednesday disclosed its first figures on the claims. \u201cThe most recent figures (Jan. 6, 2017) show that the Sevier County/Gatlinburg wildfires resulted in 3,947 claims and an estimated $842,245,997.98 combined residential and commercial property losses,\u201d the department stated. The\u00a0claims figure does not include damages to structures that were not insured. Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters at a Dec. 13 press conference announced the estimated damages at $500 million. Obama declares Tennessee wildfire a major disaster The number of claims is also well above the 2,460 estimated structures damaged or destroyed. The fires swept into Gatlinburg on the evening of Nov. 28 when gale-force winds blew flames from the top of the Chimney Tops trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Entire subdivisions were leveled by the fires as embers flew throughout the area, igniting structure fires where they landed. For several weeks after the fire a tent village of insurance companies was set up in Pigeon Forge to take insurance claims. More than 400 claims were filed the first morning it was open. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been offering assistance for businesses and home owners in Gatlinburg that had structures either uninsured or under-insured. As of Tuesday, more than\u00a0$2.5 million in grants were approved by FEMA, agency spokesman Michael Peacock said. Of that figure, more than $1.3 million was for housing assistance, with more than $1.1 million for other needs. A total of 345 applications were approved. In addition, the Small Business Administration has approved 35 loans for $3.7 million, SBA spokesman Richard Daigle said, adding that SBA has received 173 applications for loans. ",

    "text": "Email CHICAGO -- A Chicago police officer has been charged with murder in the off-duty shooting of a 37-year-old man earlier this month, reports CBS Chicago . Jose Nieves was shot and killed on Jan. 2 by transit officer Lowell Houser after a verbal confrontation, the station reports. Police have said Nieves and the officer had argued in the past, and that Nieves was not armed at the time of the shooting. Houser was stripped of his police powers a day after the shooting, amid ongoing investigations by the Internal Affairs Division and the Independent Police Review Authority, reports CBS Chicago. He was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder. Nieves\u2019 family filed a federal lawsuit against the city and Houser after the shooting, alleging Houser \u201cillegally detained and threatened to arrest and physically harm\u201d Nieves on the morning of the shooting. The lawsuit also alleges the Chicago Police Department was warned about Houser\u2019s interactions with Nieves on one or more occasion before the shooting, the station reports. Nieves\u2019 sister, Angelica Nieves, told the station the same officer who killed her brother had pulled a gun on him in the past. Police told the station they were called to Jose Nieves\u2019 home Dec. 11 for an alleged assault he was committing, and Nieves said a Chicago police officer pointed a gun at him during the response. The department\u2019s internal affairs unit was trying to determine if that officer was the same one who fatally shot Nieves, according to CBS Chicago. Police couldn\u2019t tell the station whether Nieves was charged with a crime after the alleged December assault. According to the Chicago Tribune, Houser has been the focus of 20 disciplinary investigations since the 1990s. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Bush flipped the coin for the kickoff between the Detroit Lions and Houston Texans at NRG Stadium in Houston on Oct. 30, 2016. Bob Levey/Getty Images Former President George H.W. Bush has been placed in intensive care for an acute respiratory problem, his spokesman says, and Barbara Bush has been hospitalized \"as a precaution.\" The former president had breathing problems \"stemming from pneumonia,\" spokesman Jim McGrath says, and was sedated before a procedure to clear his airway. He is in stable condition, McGrath says. The former first lady was experiencing fatigue and coughing, he says. Bush was brought to a Houston-area hospital on Saturday after experiencing shortness of breath. Earlier on Wednesday, McGrath said Bush had \"responded very well to treatments\" and expressed hope that he would be released from the hospital soon. Bush, 92, is the oldest living U.S. president. (Jimmy Carter is a little more than three months his junior.) As The Associated Press notes, Bush \"has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility.\" Reuters reports that the elder Bush was hospitalized twice in 2014 and fell and broke a bone in his neck in 2015. His public appearances have been rare over the past two years, although he still attends Houston-area sports events (and occasionally throws the first pitch or flips the coin for a kickoff).

Gen. Scott Pruitt, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, testifies Wednesday at his Senate confirmation hearing. Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, testifies Wednesday at his Senate confirmation hearing. (Michael Reynolds / EPA) Evan Halper Contact Reporter Donald Trump \u2019s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency kicked off a contentious confirmation hearing Wednesday, expressing doubt about mainstream climate science and harshly criticizing the agency he seeks to lead. Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt was defiant in the face of questioning from Democratic senators who attacked his record on environmental protection, skepticism about the impact of global warming and financial ties to some of the nation\u2019s biggest oil and gas companies. Pruitt said the EPA\u2019s aggressive enforcement of federal anti-pollution rules during the Obama administration reflects\u00a0inappropriate overreach that he would change. \u201cRegulators are supposed to make things regular,\u201d Pruitt said at the start of the hearing, \u201cto fairly and equitably enforce the rules and not pick winners and losers.\u201d He charged that the issue of climate change had\u00a0been overtaken by emotion and incivility. \u201cWe should not succumb to personalizing matters,\u201d he said. Although Pruitt said that he accepts that human activity is affecting the climate, he expressed doubt over the mainstream scientific consensus that the warming is happening at a catastrophic pace that must be confronted with aggressive actions. \u201cThe ability to measure with precision the extent of [human] impact and what to do about it are subject to continued debate and dialogue,\u201d Pruitt said. Pruitt\u00a0has been unabashed in his disdain for the agency he is seeking to run. He has worked with big corporate polluters to challenge the agency in court more than a dozen times, charging that federal rules aimed at protecting the environment are an abusive overreach. He has helped lead the movement to unravel President Obama\u2019s signature effort to confront climate change. And he questions mainstream science on global warming. The hearing follows a weeks-long assault by environmental groups against Pruitt that began the day Trump named him to lead the agency.\u00a0One of them, the Environmental Defense Fund , says it had\u00a0never lobbied against an EPA selection until now. Donald Trump \u2019s transition to the presidency has seen his popularity decline, not expand,\u00a0and he will enter the White House on Friday far weaker in that regard than any president in decades. Trump is unique among the last seven presidents-elect: He is the only one whose popularity dropped between... Donald Trump \u2019s transition to the presidency has seen his popularity decline, not expand,\u00a0and he will enter the White House on Friday far weaker in that regard than any president in decades. Trump is unique among the last seven presidents-elect: He is the only one whose popularity dropped between... (Cathleen Decker) Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee took up the fight on Wednesday, accusing Pruitt of ignorance of climate science, a disregard for millions of Americans whose health is being harmed by air pollution and an inappropriately cozy relationship with big energy companies. \u201cThe reality that our climate is changing is not up for grabs, not up for debate,\u201d said Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware. \u00a0He then noted that Christine Todd Whitman, who led the EPA under President George W. Bush, has said she cannot recall a previous appointee for the job who has shown as much disdain for the agency as Pruitt. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island detailed how climate change is damaging the shellfish industry in his state, before skewering Pruitt for his suggestion that climate science is unsettled. \u201cI see nothing in your career that you would care at all about our Rhode Island shell fishermen,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Pruitt\u2019s close ties with energy companies were repeatedly brought up by Democrats as the hearing got underway. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon presented a letter Pruitt sent to the EPA protesting its enforcement of methane rules. The letter was written almost entirely by Devon Energy. Pruitt had changed just a few words. \u201cA public office is about serving the public,\u201d Merkley said. \u201cYou used your office as a direct extension of an oll company rather than a direct extension of the public health of the people of Oklahoma.\u201d Pruitt said sending the letter written almost entirely by an oil firm was appropriate. \u201cThe letter sent to the EPA was not sent on behalf of any one company;\u00a0it was particular to an industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was concern\u00a0expressed by many in the industry about the overestimating that occurred in relation to that methane rule.\u201d The confirmation fight over Pruitt has become a test case of how far Congress is willing to go in backing Trump\u2019s push to curb environmental protections and to allow\u00a0oil, gas and coal companies to drill and mine where clean air and water rules don\u2019t allow it, or at least make it too complicated and costly. Environmental groups have unleashed advertising campaigns and teams of opposition researchers against Pruitt. They have targeted the lawsuits he filed against the EPA and the letters that energy lobbyists drafted for Pruitt to send to the Obama administration complaining about the hardships of environmental regulation. \u201cHe is literally the worst nominee ever tapped to run the EPA,\u201d said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a single environmental achievement to his name, he doesn\u2019t believe in the agency\u2019s mission, and he has made a career of suing the EPA to try to block it from doing its job.\u201d The Environmental Working Group published a report this week detailing how Pruitt mostly backed off a lawsuit filed by his predecessor against poultry companies in neighboring Arkansas over water pollution caused by the dumping of chicken manure. Executives at the companies donated heavily to Pruitt\u2019s campaign as the matter was pending in court. \u00a0 Pruitt\u2019s allies argue that environmentalists and progressive groups are unfairly demonizing him, painting an inaccurate picture of his record. A letter from more than 20 conservative groups, including the Heartland Institute and Heritage Action, rejects the argument that Pruitt is an enemy of clean air and clean water. \u201cMr. Pruitt respects and upholds the Constitution\u00a0and understands that many of the nation\u2019s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe federal government is not the end-all, be-all solution.\u201d Caption President Obama's farewell address President Obama delivered his farewell speech Tuesday in Chicago.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 18, 2017 1:08 PM EST WASHINGTON -- Scott Pruitt, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be EPA administrator, said Wednesday at his confirmation hearing that he does not believe climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d but indicated the extent to which human activity contributes to climate change is unclear. Asked early in the hearing whether he agrees with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s past statements about climate change being a \u201choax,\u201d Pruitt replied: \u201cI do not believe that climate change is a hoax.\u201d Still, during a heated exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Pruitt did not say that human activity is causing climate change. \u201cAs I indicated in my opening statement, the climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in some manner,\u201d Pruitt said. When Sanders replied, saying 97 percent of climate scientists have named human activity as the leading cause of climate change, Pruitt said the extent of that correlation is \u201csubject to more debate.\u201d \u201cI believe the ability to measure with precision the degree of human activity\u2019s impact on the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity is contributing to it,\u201d Pruitt said. Sanders then asked Pruitt for his personal opinion as to whether human activity is the primary cause of rising temperatures. \u201cMy personal opinion is immaterial,\u201d Pruitt replied, to which Sanders fired back: \u201cReally?\u201d After the hearing, Sanders indicated to reporters that he would vote against Pruitt\u2019s nomination. However, Republicans on the committee defended Pruitt\u2019s actions on behalf of the environment. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who protected the environment, he\u2019s also someone who has stood up for state rights and strengthened the economy all at the same time,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyoming). Pruitt also faced accusations during the hearing that he collected \u201cdark money\u201d from anonymous sources to steer his work as Oklahoma attorney general. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island says Pruitt has collected money from energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Devon Energy, but also has benefited from front groups that do not have to disclose their donors. Whitehouse said a political action group Pruitt leads is \u201ca complete black hole into which at least $1 million goes.\u201d Whitehouse said Americans deserve to \u201cknow exactly who he\u2019s working for\u201d if Pruitt is to lead an agency charged with protecting the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans. Pruitt said he did not found the organization cited by Whitehouse and hired outside groups to raise money for it. Also likely to be a topic of questioning for Pruitt -- his move as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general to disband the unit responsible for protecting the state\u2019s natural resources. He reassigned his staff to focus on filing lawsuits against the federal agency he\u2019s now selected to lead. Records also show that Pruitt, a Republican, failed to push a legal challenge initiated by his predecessor to protect Oklahoma\u2019s rivers from pollution caused by animal waste, after receiving tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from individuals connected to the poultry industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that he disbanded the unit and moved those people around. He created a whole new unit specifically to fight the EPA, among other things,\u201d said Mark Derichsweiler, who retired last year as a water-quality engineer at Oklahoma\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality. Derichsweiler worked on a lawsuit that Pruitt\u2019s predecessor as attorney general, Drew Edmondson, had filed against more than a dozen poultry companies that include industry giant Tyson Foods. \u201cI think it\u2019s become more clear that he\u2019s more of an advocate for the big energy companies and utilities than he is for the general population of Oklahoma that have to breathe the air and drink the water,\u201d Derichsweiler, a Democrat, told The Associated Press last week. The nomination of Pruitt, 48, to lead the EPA is being fiercely opposed by environmental groups that point to fundraising ties with corporations he has sued to protect. In Oklahoma, he joined with other Republican attorneys general in opposing the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt also sued over the agency\u2019s recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the federal Clean Water Act, which has been opposed by industries that would be forced to clean up polluted wastewater. Though Pruitt ran unopposed for a second term in 2014, campaign finance reports show he raised more than $700,000, much of it from people in the energy and utility industries. Among those who gave the maximum contribution of $5,000 to Pruitt\u2019s campaign was Continental Resources Chairman and CEO Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma oil tycoon who has been advising the president-elect. Like Trump, Pruitt has also publicly cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are to blame. Pruitt has declined repeated requests for interviews since first meeting in November with Trump about the top job at the EPA. His spokesman, Lincoln Ferguson, said responsibility for environmental enforcement cases was simply moved to a newly created unit, the solicitor general\u2019s division. \u201cUnder the leadership of AG Pruitt, this team has held bad actors accountable and protected stewardship of Oklahoma\u2019s natural resources,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement. However, court records show that in recent years the unit cited by Ferguson has primarily focused on litigation against the federal government in cases of perceived regulatory overreach. Ferguson provided the AP a list of environmental cases Pruitt\u2019s office has handled. A check of court records shows many of those cases were actually initiated by Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, a Democrat who did not run for re-election in 2010. Of 14 lawsuits in which Pruitt challenged federal environmental regulations, in all but one of those cases his co-litigants included companies whose executives had made campaign donations supporting him, according to an analysis by EDF Action, the political advocacy arm of the Environmental Defense Fund. It found such contributions to Pruitt\u2019s campaigns and associated political action committees amounted to about $240,000. \u201cOur research identified a remarkably sustained pattern of contributions flowing to Scott Pruitt\u2019s political causes at the same time he was taking action to oppose clean air and clean water for Americans,\u201d said Martha Roberts, an attorney with EDF Action. Pruitt\u2019s office declined to comment on his past fundraising, instead referring inquiries to Trump\u2019s transition team, which didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for two political action committees tied to Pruitt told AP earlier this month they would be dissolved before any move to Washington. Pruitt has faced similar criticism over his handling of the poultry case initiated by his predecessor that has been languishing in federal court for more than six years. During his campaign in 2010, Pruitt received nearly $38,000 in contributions from executives with the poultry companies named in the lawsuits and their lawyers. \u201cRegulation through litigation is wrong in my view,\u201d Pruitt told The Oklahoman newspaper in 2015. Pruitt let expire a 2003 agreement between Arkansas and Oklahoma aimed at reducing pollution from poultry waste and approved a new deal that called for more water-quality testing while agreeing not to institute any new enforcement actions or judicial proceedings against the industry. Despite a lack of resolution in the case, the water quality in northeastern Oklahoma has improved during Pruitt\u2019s tenure, said Ed Fite, longtime administrator of Oklahoma\u2019s Scenic Rivers Commission. Still, other Oklahomans who work to protect the state\u2019s waterways say they have grave doubts about Pruitt\u2019s commitment to environmental enforcement. Pruitt also has faced sharp criticism from environmentalists for failing to take any action to help curb a dramatic spike in earthquake activity that scientists have linked to the underground disposal of oil and gas wastewater. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "WATCH Nikki Haley: 'United Nations Could Benefit From a Fresh Set of Eyes' 0 Shares Email South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, outlined a forceful policy for countering Russian aggression, becoming the latest Trump Cabinet pick to take a more confrontational approach to Russia than he has personally recommended. \"I don't think we can trust them,\" Haley said of Russian leaders. \"Russia is trying to show their muscle right now, it is what they do.\" Testifying in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Haley said she believes Russia committed war crimes in Syria when it indiscriminately bombed hospitals in Aleppo. \"We need to let them know we are not OK with what happened in Ukraine, in Crimea and what is happening in Syria, but we\u2019re also gonna tell them that we do need their help with ISIS and with some other threats that we all share,\" she exclaimed. Trump has said better relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin would be an asset to his presidency. He has repeatedly doubted the intelligence community's assessment that Russia hacked the 2016 presidential election. Haley also rejected the need for any Muslim registry in the United States, as well as a registry for any subset of Americans. However, she seemed to support the president-elect's latest proposal to ban individuals arriving from countries known to be home to terrorists, saying, \"We need to watch which countries have terrorists.\" After the Security Council passed a resolution calling for an end to Israeli settlements, Trump lashed out on Twitter, calling the U.N. a \"club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.\" He has said the U.N. is not a friend of Israel. Haley also blasted the U.N. for that vote, which the Obama administration chose not to veto, and said that \"nowhere has the U.N.\u2019s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel. ... Last month\u2019s passage of U.N. Resolution 2334 was a terrible mistake, making a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians harder to achieve.\u201d The Obama administration has argued that more settlements impede the chances of a two-state solution. At today's hearing, Haley called the resolution \"a kick in the gut to everyone.\" \"When we basically abstained from 2334 we made Israel more vulnerable. We made America more vulnerable in that we don\u2019t stand by our allies,\" she said. \"We need to let the two bodies resolve this themselves. That is what has always taken place and I think it\u2019s dangerous when the U.N. starts to tell two different bodies what should and shouldn\u2019t happen.\" She added the U.N. Security Council has an \"obsession\" with Israel. Regarding North Korea, Haley said the hermetic nation is \"getting to be a very dangerous situation\u201d and that she would seek to use China's influence to help address the nuclear threat. On the Iran nuclear deal, Haley did not say she would rip it up, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence has promised to do in the administration. But she said she would hold Iran accountable to any violations of the deal. Many observers believe that's one way the Trump administration could potentially scuttle the deal -- by proving Iran violated the terms. In her prepared remarks, Haley vowed to be \u201ca strong voice for American principles and American interests, even if that is not what other U.N. representatives want to hear. The time has come for American strength once again.\u201d She said she believed the U.N. could \u201cbenefit from a fresh set of eyes. I will take an outsider\u2019s look at the institution.\u201d Nimrata \u201cNikki\u201d Haley, (born as Nimrata Randhawa) is the daughter of Indian immigrants and the first female governor of her home state, South Carolina. She drew national attention in 2015 for her work to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state's Capitol grounds following the Charleston church shooting. Key Moments From Rex Tillerson's Confirmation Hearing for Secretary of State She also delivered the Republican response to President Obama's final State of the Union speech in January 2016. Despite her popularity in the Republican Party , Trump's decision to ask her to serve in his administration was somewhat surprising given their frequent spats during his presidential campaign. Haley campaigned for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and actively campaigned against Trump in South Carolina. \"I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK,\" Haley once said on the trail with Rubio of Trump. (Trump has since repeatedly disavowed their support.) \"That's not who we want as president.\" Trump shot back on Twitter, saying \"the people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\" The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2016 Haley tweeted back, \u201cBless your heart.\u201d After her 2016 State of the Union response -- which was critical of Trump's brand of politics -- Haley told ABC News' Jonathan Karl that Trump is one of the \"angriest voices\" and should not \"throw stones\" over political disagreements. \"The one that got me, I think, was when he started saying ban all Muslims,\" she said after Trump proposed barring all foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. \"When you've got immigrants that are coming here legally, we've never in the history of this country passed any laws or done anything based on race or religion.\" But after Trump won, she agreed to meet with him on Nov. 17 and the next day, speaking at the Federalist Society, she said his election was a rejection of both parties. \u201cWe must accept that Donald Trump\u2019s election was not an affirmation of the way Republicans have conducted themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did not do it by celebrating the Republican Party.\u201d Outgoing U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power , who was appointed by Obama in 2013, delivered her final address to the U.N. on Tuesday and directed much of it at the incoming Trump administration and its relationship with Russia. \"I know some have said that this focus on Russia is simply the party that lost the recent presidential election being 'sore losers,' but it should worry every American that a foreign government interfered in our democratic process,\" Power said, referencing the intelligence community belief that Russia hacked the election and Trump's seeming reticence to take a harder stance on Russian President Vladimir Putin . Power also advocated continued allegiance to NATO, a Western alliance Trump has labeled \"obsolete.\" \"We must reassure our allies that we have their backs, and ensure that Russia pays a price for breaking the rules. That means maintaining our robust support for NATO, and make clear our nation\u2019s steadfast commitment to treat an attack on any NATO member as an attack on us all.\" Today, Haley agreed the U.S. needs to support NATO. \"NATO has obviously been an alliance that we need to keep and I think that we continue to talk to [Trump] about these alliances, about how they can be helpful and strategic in the way that we move forward,\" Haley said. \"I do anticipate that he will listen to all of us and we can get him to see it the way we see it.\" 0 Shares ",

AP Scientists are trying to determine why a group of at least 95 false killer whales stranded themselves on a remote coast in Florida's Everglades National Park. At least 82 of the animals have died, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \"This is the largest mass stranding ever for this species in the United States,\" NOAA Marine Biologist Erin Foug\u00e8res said, \"And one of the largest mass strandings we've ever had in the southeast.\" The event was first reported on Saturday and rescue efforts to herd the animals to safety have seen \"minimal success,\" she said in a Facebook Live video with the Weather Channel on Wednesday.

The president notably did not grant a pardon to Snowden, as The Associated Press reports: \"Snowden hasn't formally applied for clemency, though his supporters have called for it. Yet the White House drew a distinction between the unapologetic Snowden and Manning.

The question of \u00a0which artists would and would not perform at the official Inaugural events has been fraught since Trump\u2019s election in November, with many artists publicly declaring they would not perform and others receiving backlash for agreeing to appear. The performers have been announced sporadically and some have backed out since the initial announcements. Here\u2019s everything you need to know know about who will be performing at the weekend\u2019s events. Which Inaugural events include\u00a0 performances? Official Inaugural festivities will take place from Thursday  through Sunday  in Washington, D.C., but not all will include entertainment. According to the Inauguration website, these are all the official events for the weekend: Thursday Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration Friday Saturday National Prayer Service Performances are scheduled for the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration, the swearing-in ceremony and the official Inaugural balls. What is the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration? It\u2019s a concert event on Thursday evening that will take place on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and will feature celebrity performances and remarks from Trump. The free show will also include fireworks and military bands and will be available for live broadcast, and according to the official website, will be \u201cproduced and directed by Emmy Award winners and nominees,\u201d although the committee did not clarify who those people are when USA TODAY reached out for comment. It will take place following the \u201cVoices of the People\u201d event at 10:35 a.m. ET, which will feature marching bands, choirs and other groups from around the country. Who is performing at the Welcome Celebration? Country singers Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood, rock groups 3 Doors Down and The Piano Guys, DJ RaviDrum and The Frontmen of Country featuring Tim Rushlow, Larry Stewart and Richie McDonald have all been announced as performers by the Inaugural Committee . Keith's publicist, Elaine Schock issued a statement on his behalf after his participation was announced, defending his decision. \"I don\u2019t apologize for performing for our country or military,\" it said, noting the artist\u2019s previous performances for George W. Bush, Barack Obama and the USO. Actor Jon Voight, who recently appeared in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, will be attending but not performing, according to a statement his publicist Siri Garber sent to USA TODAY. Who is performing at the swearing-in? Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old classical/pop singer, will sing\u00a0the National Anthem at the ceremony. Evancho came in second on America\u2019s Got Talent in 2010 and has also sung for President Obama. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Missouri State University Chorale and the United States Marine Band will be also be performing. The swearing-in ceremony has occasionally featured the reading of a poem, but no poem is listed on the official program . Several religious leaderswill be \u201coffering readings,\u201d according to the official site. Jackie Evancho \u00a0(Photo: Paul Morigi, Getty Images for Capital Concerts) What about the balls? While there are many official and unofficial balls and parties during the weekend, Trump will only be attending Liberty and Freedom: The Official Presidential Inaugural Balls and the Salute to Our Armed Services Ball.

The committee also announced that Tony Orlando and Josh Weathers will perform at the Armed Services ball. Are there entertainers at the unofficial balls? Yes. The list of balls and unofficial events over the weekend is extensive, and a few big-name celebrities have confirmed their performances. Solange and Esperanza Spalding will perform\u00a0at the Peace Ball, organized by D.C. restaurateur Andy Shallal and hosted at the National\u00a0 Museum for African American History and Culture.

Multiple artists, including British singers\u00a0 Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Church and DJ Moby, publicly rejected invitations to perform. Several artists have pulled out including singer Jennifer Holliday and Bruce Springsteen cover band The B Street Band . A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir resigned from the group rather than perform and MSG Entertainment, the organization that owns the Rockettes, said it was each dancer\u2019s choice to perform after a dancer expressed concern on social media. 6 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k1r9AT NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

    "text": "Feds sue nation's largest student loan servicer, accusing it of cheating borrowers Richard Cordray Ron Sachs/CNP / TNS Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, testifies on Sept. 20, 2016, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, testifies on Sept. 20, 2016, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. (Ron Sachs/CNP / TNS) Andrew Khouri Contact Reporter The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the nation\u2019s largest servicer of student loans Wednesday, alleging that Navient Corp. cheated borrowers,\u00a0resulting in higher payments for Americans struggling to payback their student loans. The federal consumer agency said that Navient, formerly part of Sallie Mae, \u201cfailed to provide the most basic functions of adequate student loan servicing at every stage of repayment for both private and federal loans.\u201d Navient, the agency claimed, provided student borrowers with inaccurate information, ignored complaints and processed payments incorrectly. \u201cFor years, Navient failed consumers who counted on the company to help give them a fair chance to pay back their student loans,\u201d consumer bureau director Richard Cordray said in a statement. \u201cAt\u00a0every stage of repayment, Navient chose to shortcut and deceive consumers to save on operating costs. Too many borrowers paid more for their loans because Navient illegally cheated them and today\u2019s action seeks to hold them accountable.\u201d The lawsuit claims Navient violated the Dodd-Frank reform act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act\u00a0and the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. The agency is seeking redress for borrowers harmed by the practices and to prevent any future harm. In response, Navient called the bureau\u2019s allegations \u201cunfounded\u201d and questioned the timing of Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit, noting it came just days before the Obama administration is set to leave office. \u201cThe timing of this lawsuit \u2014 midnight action filed on the eve of a new administration \u2014 reflects their political motivations,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on its website. The filing of the lawsuit comes amid a flurry of new rules and regulations in the waning days of the Obama Administration and as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is likely to come under renewed threat from long-time Republican critics, who have complained the bureau holds too much power over financial products and its attempts to help consumers have led to restricted access to credit. Some Republican senators have even asked\u00a0President-elect Donald\u00a0Trump to remove Cordray as\u00a0director, which if under taken would likely set up a legal showdown over Trump\u2019s\u00a0right to do so. A major focus of the bureau under Cordray has been education, specifically high-cost for-profit colleges such as the now defunct Corinthian Colleges, which the agency sued in 2014 alleging the Orange County company\u00a0deceived tens of thousands of students through an \"illegal predatory lending scheme.\" Consumer advocates have praised the agency for its aggressive actions, including Wednesday\u2019s suit against Navient. \u201cThe action by the CFPB against Navient demonstrates the importance of having a strong and independent consumer watchdog on the side of students and working families,\u201d \u00a0said Persis Yu, director of\u00a0National Consumer Law Center\u2019s student loan borrower assistance project. \u201cWe call on President-Elect Trump to reject calls from Wall Street to fire CFPB Director Rich Cordray or to weaken the consumer watchdog.\u201d In its lawsuit, the consumer agency specifically alleged that Navient misapplied or misallocated borrowers\u2019 payments and steered struggling borrowers into payment options that saddled them with higher costs. Navient also failed to provide enough information on critical deadlines to renew income-driven repayment plans that lowered costs, the agency claimed. That caused\u00a0students to miss enrollment, which \u201ccould have caused their monthly payments to jump by hundreds or even thousands of dollars,\u201d the bureau said in a news release.

The script is from married filmmakers Aron Gaudet and Gita\u00a0Pullapilly and appears to be an\u00a0account of Operation Greylord, an extensive undercover project focused on corruption in the courts, resulting in 93 people indicted. At least one half of the screenwriting team spent some time percolating in Cook County; Pullapilly received her masters degree at Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism.\u00a0 (The script is not to be confused with the\u00a0 non-fiction book by the same \u00a0name that came out in May by criminal justice academic\u00a0Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve.) \"They've written a script about systemic corruption and justice that will be very relevant,\" McKay told Deadline . McKay himself is a former Chicagoan, having come up through the comedy ranks at iO Theater and Second City. \"Production will begin in the spring, in Pittsburgh,\" according to the Deadline report.\u00a0 nmetz@chicagotribune.com Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.

Eight marijuana state legalization initiatives passed on Election Day in November. And the legal weed industry grew 30 percent last year, according to Arcview Market Research. If the new administration doesn't change anything, the marijuana market is slated to grow 25 percent per year and will be worth more than $20 billion by 2021, according to the group. Eidinger came around to the idea of a mass giveaway because he wanted to elicit a reaction from the incoming administration. But since announcing their plan, Trump's team has been silent. Related: What Will a Trump Administration Do About Marijuana Legalization? \"What I'm hoping, what I have my fingers crossed for, is that Donald Trump will reach out to us,\" Eidinger said inside his home that doubles as the DCMJ office. \"I'm hoping that Donald Trump will reach out to me personally and invite me up and the leaders of the major marijuana groups up to Trump Tower and have a green panel and ask us what we want to see happen.\" Members of the DC Marijuana Coalition that plan on handing out approx 4,200 joints of legally grown cannabis on Jan. 20 roll joints on Jan. 5 inside their home in Washington, D.C. Paul J. Richards / AFP - Getty Images The morning of the inauguration, Eidinger and his more than 200 volunteers will drive out to Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. and park Eidinger's Jeep. As long as they're not stopped, they will then set up a folding table and create two lines: one for the joint givers and another for joint takers. From 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., all of the marijuana will be shared freely. Don't forget #Trump420 is a give away for people 21+ but families are welcome as it's not a smoke out, there will be speeches too. #Mmot pic.twitter.com/wrGvd0lsMQ \u2014 Adam Eidinger (@aeidinger) January 8, 2017 Volunteers will check IDs to ensure that everyone complies with the law. More than 40 people will be required to carry the marijuana to the folding table to adhere to D.C. law's, as individuals are only allowed to carry two ounces of marijuana at a time. DCMJ protesters will then march from the circle to the National Mall, handing out joints along the way. At the appointed time, those who are keen will light up. The number 420 is a well-recognized code for marijuana, as well as a time stamp for when smokers often partake. Related: With Trump in White House, Criminal Justice Reformers Will Look Elsewhere Eidinger doesn't see the scheme going through without interruption, believing that law enforcement wouldn't allow a group of people to smoke marijuana on federal property intentionally. But he said he would support those who were willing to try. \"Anyone who is arrested on the mall, if they get a fine or have legal costs, I'm willing to pay that for them,\" Eidinger said, adding that he'd want to share their story. At a press conference in preparation of the inauguration, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said arresting individuals for smoking pot \"wouldn't be our first priority.\" Members of the DC Marijuana Coalition that plan on handing out approx 4,200 joints of legally grown cannabis on Jan. 20 roll joints on Jan. 5 inside their home in Washington, D.C. Paul J. Richards / AFP - Getty Images It remains to be seen how other security forces might react. More than 3,200 police officers are expected at the inauguration, some coming from outside of the D.C. metropolitan area. DCMJ said it is also fine if people accept the marijuana and don't participate. \"It's for the Trump era,\" Eidinger explained. \"The Trump era is beginning that day. Four minutes and 20 seconds in, you'll know what your other marijuana friends are doing at that moment \u2014 they'll all be blazing. \"We're going to watch his speech high, and I think that's a good thing.\" Nevertheless, it's a long road before they're prepared. Just days ahead of show time, DCMJ's kitchen table was still covered with copies of old newspapers while the volunteers ground up weed to pack within translucent rolling papers. Members of the DC Marijuana Coalition that plan on handing out approx 4,200 joints of legally grown cannabis on Jan. 20 roll joints on Jan. 5 inside their home in Washington, D.C. Paul J. Richards / AFP - Getty Images \"It's been overwhelming to see the generosity of people coming forth and willing to give to this cause,\" said RachelRamone Donlan with a pile of pungent green plant matter in front of her. Donlan came down from Boston to help organize the event. \"It's pretty cool,\" she said. Multiple groups beyond DCMJ are contributing to the total number of joints, which is rising high above 4,200. Big thanks to #KingWeedy of #WashHydro for hosting multiple joint rolling sessions for #Trump420 They put total to over 5,500 joints rolled Of the four pounds needed to make the original goal of 4,200 joints, Eidinger has donated two. He said if that weed were to be sold legally in Colorado, it would be worth $5,000 to $6,500 per pound. Another joint rolling session is happening today. More scheduled for this weekend around DC! #Trump420 pic.twitter.com/Kk5RIOL1kO \u2014 DCMJ (@DCMJ2014) January 12, 2017 Eidinger said the point of the protest is to show that marijuana smokers are there and shouldn't be ignored. The smell alone is a statement. Though DCMJ was able to meet with Sen. Sessions' communications director Chris Jackson, the group is still worried that the Alabama senator will come after them once he assumes office as the government's chief law enforcement officer. They have had a large presence at all of Sessions' hearings. \"Everything from potentially leaving the country to opening up legal dispensaries are in my mind for the future, but it's so uncertain,\" Eidinger said. \"I'm hopeful we'll be able to work with this administration or they'll want to work with us.\" Nevertheless, he provided a word of warning: Marijuana smokers wouldn't disappear without a fight. \"There will be a lot more protests if they come after us,\" he said. \"Maybe we'll have to start smoking inside of congressional hearings.\" Phil McCausland ",

Dismissing concerns that he was sending the wrong message to others who then might divulge classified information, Mr. Obama pointed out that Ms. Manning had already served seven years in prison. A president who transformed the country and learned the limits of the possible. \u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cChelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence. So the notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don\u2019t think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served.\u201d He added: \u201cI feel very comfortable that justice has been served.\u201d Mr. Obama leaves with rising approval ratings but an eight-year legacy that is already under attack even before Mr. Trump is inaugurated. He declined to comment on the decision of dozens of congressional Democrats to boycott Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cAll I know is I\u2019m going to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo\u2019s Michelle.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama\u2019s final news conference \u2014 his 165th, according to the American Presidency Project \u2014 gave reporters one last chance to ask the president about the news of the day. He spoke out on Russia, Middle East peace, gay rights, race relations and other major issues one final time. The president used his final appearance as president before reporters to implicitly urge Mr. Trump not to impose harsh new restrictions on the press. Mr. Trump has had a volatile relationship with reporters for years, and his aides suggested recently that they might move the news media out of the White House briefing room, but have since backed away from the idea for now. Although he did not mention that directly, Mr. Obama said the presence of reporters inside the West Wing was important for democracy. \u201cHaving you in this building has made this place work better,\u201d he told the reporters. \u201cIt keeps us honest.\u201d Mr. Obama has frequently clashed with news organizations, and he was aggressive in prosecuting leaks of government information. He also regularly sought to communicate with the public by going around the traditional news media, using social media tools and sitting down for interviews with the hosts of online-only programs.

Got it (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) By Brady Dennis and David Weigel By Brady Dennis and David Weigel January 18 at 6:02 PM Follow @brady_dennis Follow daveweigel Scott Pruitt, who repeatedly has sued the Environmental Protection Agency during his tenure as Oklahoma attorney general, declined to say Wednesday whether he would recuse himself from those ongoing cases if confirmed as the agency\u2019s new leader. Questioned by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) about whether he would avoid involvement in a series of ongoing cases against the EPA that he has been party to while in Oklahoma, Pruitt said he would rely on the advice of agency ethics lawyers. \u201cIf directed to do so, I will do so,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree to recuse yourself,\u201d Markey said, \u201cthen you become plaintiff, defendant, judge and jury on the cases you are bringing right now as attorney general of Oklahoma against the EPA.\u201d The exchange was among several tense moments Pruitt encountered Wednesday about his fitness to run the agency, his close ties to the oil and gas industry, his views on climate change and even the water crisis in Flint, Mich. Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee grilled the 48-year-old former state lawmaker about his financial support from fossil fuel companies, which have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Pruitt and political action committees associated with him. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) displayed a 2011 letter Pruitt sent to the EPA saying it had overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling \u2014 a letter largely written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of Oklahoma\u2019s largest oil and gas companies. He accused Pruitt of acting as \u201ca direct extension of an oil company\u201d rather than on behalf of ordinary Oklahomans. Pruitt countered that he was not representing any one company but, rather, expressing the concerns of an entire industry in the state. Pruitt also sought Wednesday to head off critics who call him a \u201cclimate denier\u201d by acknowledging that \u201cscience tells us that the climate is changing.\u201d But he added that precisely how much humans are contributing to the problem and what policy actions to take remain open \u201cto debate and dialogue.\u201d It was a debate that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) embraced, challenging Pruitt about his lack of urgency regarding climate change, and on the role of the oil and gas industry in causing widespread earthquakes in the state of Oklahoma. \u201cWhy is the climate changing?\u201d Sanders asked, requesting Pruitt\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d about the matter. \u201cMy opinion is immaterial,\u201d Pruitt replied. (Reuters) \u201cReally?\u201d Sanders countered. \u201cYou are going to be the head of the agency to protect the environment, and your personal feelings about whether climate change is caused by human activity is immaterial?\u201d Pruitt said the EPA has a \u201cvery important role\u201d to perform in regulating carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 an intriguing statement from a man who led the charge against the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration\u2019s main effort to cut carbon emissions. He said he would respect EPA\u2019s \u201clegal obligation\u201d to tackle the issue. He also said \u201cthere is a time and a place\u201d for EPA to use its authority to enforce regulations if states refuse to do so. At the same time, he declined to commit to whether he would allow California to set its own emissions standards for automobiles that exceed federal limitations. Pressed by Markey and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Pruitt promised only that he would \u201creview\u201d such a policy. Asked about the water crisis in Flint, Mich., Pruitt said he had not \u201clooked at the scientific research\u201d about what constitutes dangerous levels of lead exposure. (Health officials have long said there is no safe level of lead, especially in children.) \u201cThat\u2019s something I have not reviewed nor know about,\u201d Pruitt said, though he added, \u201cI would be concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water or, obviously, human consumption.\u201d [ \u2018If I could afford to leave, I would.\u2019 In Flint, a water crisis with no end in sight. ] Pruitt told lawmakers Wednesday that, if confirmed, he plans to steer the agency away from what he sees as an era of overzealous and unlawful regulation during the Obama years. He said his EPA would be one that respects the authority of states and is open to a \u201cfull range of views.\u201d Pruitt also dismissed the idea that if someone supports oil and gas interests, he can\u2019t also favor environmental protection. \u201cI utterly reject that narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not an either-or proposition.\u201d Pruitt\u2019s tenure as attorney general in Oklahoma has been marked by his role in opposing the Obama administration\u2019s key initiatives, often arguing that the executive branch was overstepping its constitutional authority and circumventing the role of Congress. Pruitt has been a leading voice among a group of Republican attorneys general who also sued over issues including the Affordable Care Act, Wall Street reforms and immigration. But he has been particularly aggressive in attacking the EPA\u2019s efforts, suing the agency to challenge its authority to regulate toxic mercury pollution, smog, carbon emissions from power plants, and the quality of wetlands and other waters. Pruitt received broad support Wednesday from Republicans in the Senate, who are expected to approve his nomination. The committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), said Pruitt would help to quell the \u201cregulatory zeal\u201d of the past eight years. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) called Pruitt the right person to provide the \u201ccourse correction\u201d EPA needs. [ At EPA nominee\u2019s hearing, money becomes a weapon for both parties ] Meanwhile, Pruitt\u2019s nomination has galvanized environmental advocacy groups, who note that Pruitt dismantled a specialized environmental protection unit that had existed under his predecessor and poured resources into a new \u201cfederalism unit\u201d aimed at challenging \u201cunwarranted regulation and systematic overreach\u201d from Washington. They argue that his close ties to the oil and gas industry and his hostile history with the EPA make him a disastrous choice to run an agency created to protect ordinary Americans from pollution. Even as Pruitt spoke, scientists on Wednesday were declaring 2016 the hottest year on record , making it the third year in a row to earn that title. [ U.S. scientists officially declare 2016 the hottest year on record. ] The small hearing room had just a few seats open for the public on Wednesday, frustrating a large group of protesters who\u2019d shown up. Protesters dressed as a BP technician and an oil-stained bird did make it inside, grumbling about the security. The protester in BP get-up, carrying a fake can of oil, was removed by security after shouting that Pruitt would gut the EPA. Throughout the day, a flood of social media posts, emails, online ads and television commercials from advocacy groups, lawmakers and industry representatives urged senators to reject Pruitt because he will fail to protect the environment, or to confirm him because he will end the EPA\u2019s overaggressive regulations. Pruitt has repeatedly framed his EPA opposition as driven not by ideology but by constitutional questions over the separation of powers: Congress makes the laws. Agencies administer them. And states enforce them. \u201cRule of law matters,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cRegulators are supposed to make things regular, to fairly and equitably enforce the rules, and not pick winners and losers.\u201d Chris Mooney contributed to this report. national ",

    "text": "Follow @ogtedberg Look: This site, and in particular this author, has already spilled way, way too many words explaining why Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens deserve entry to the Baseball Hall of Fame. I have no particular interest in repeating myself more than I already have, so if you\u2019re fired up over the mere possibility of their enshrinement and want something to rail against, please go here or here or here or here . To summarize, for those too lazy to click: The Hall of Fame should be for celebrating great baseball players, not necessarily great men, everything Bonds and Clemens did on baseball fields still counts in the record books, and their performance-enhancing indiscretions came during an era in which the Major League Baseball\u00a0and Hall of Fame commissioner Bud Selig did next to nothing to police them. This post is not about that, though. This post exists to share this\u00a0fact: Bonds and Clemens are going to get in. It\u2019s happening. Both players fell well short of election in 2017, their fifth season on the ballot. But for the second straight year, both Clemens and Bonds saw big spikes in their balloting totals and, perhaps most importantly, 13 out of the 14 new Hall of Fame voters who made their ballots public voted for Bonds and Clemens both . Hall voting privileges come with 10 years\u2019 tenure in the Baseball Writers Association of America, and presumably the high totals for Bonds and Clemens among new voters reflects the voting tendencies of younger baseball writers who came of age watching Bonds and Clemens in their primes and seeing how awesome they were. Roger Clemens (PHOTO: AP Photo/Charles Krupa) It\u2019s almost impossible to understand how a voter could justify voting for Bonds and not Clemens or vice versa, as both players stand among the most valuable in the game\u2019s history and both represent the faces of the sport\u2019s so-called \u201csteroids era.\u201d But Bonds landed on 53.8% of ballots this year and Clemens on 54.1%, and historical trends show that players who get at least 50% of votes almost always end up enshrined by the end of their run on the ballot. To date, only Gil Hodges, Jack Morris and, now, Lee Smith have ever appeared on more than half of all ballots in any given year and not ultimately made the Hall. Curt Schilling may eventually join them, but it won\u2019t be because of his actual merits (or lack thereof) as a baseball player . Moreover, Bonds and Clemens have both seen strong upticks in balloting from veteran voters in recent years. On ballots made public, Bonds gained 22 net votes from returning voters and Clemens gained 23. As debate over their candidacy rages on, more and more voters seem to be coming around to a logical conclusion: Because it\u2019s impossible to fully know which players from their era took steroids and which didn\u2019t, it\u2019s silly to punish only those that got caught and reward their contemporaries for managing to maintain\u00a0a clean reputation. And it\u2019s patently absurd for the Hall of Fame to continue including a \u201ccharacter clause\u201d when Cooperstown already includes plenty of straight-up bad dudes (not to mention countless guys who used amphetamines to enhance their performance), and when baseball writers \u2014 this one most certainly included \u2014 are not in any way qualified to judge others for the quality of their character. (PHOTO: Barry Bonds/Instagram) It\u2019s going to happen: Unless the Hall itself intervenes in some way, Bonds and Clemens are going to get in, perhaps within the next two years. And once you\u2019re done wringing your hands about it, maybe celebrate the fact that the two best players of their era will be represented in Cooperstown just like all the tainted superstars of yesteryear, and that fans of a certain generation \u2014 my generation, as it happens \u2014 may again recognize the Hall of Fame as a worthwhile Mecca of baseball greatness and not an arbitrary pageant hellbent on excluding Barry Freaking Bonds and all 762 of his dope homers. People will lament their entry as an indication of our society\u2019s loosening moral standards and its inability to distinguish right from wrong, and we\u2019ll all be forced to endure some livid and pointless takes trumpeting\u00a0bygone Golden Ages of baseball integrity that never really existed. But in truth, their well-deserved inclusion in the pantheon of baseball greats will mean a victory for logic and our understanding of humanity, and\u00a0the surest way to keep Cooperstown relevant to all of us who grew up appreciating the incredible on-field achievements of the two\u00a0most valuable players of the past half-century.

    "text": "Twitter YouTube President Obama's final press conference was one of both reflection and subtle rebuke toward incoming President-elect Donald Trump, defending voting rights and a free press, all while reassuring the American people that \"at my core, I think we're going to be OK.\" Obama did show some deference toward Trump \u2014 sidestepping a question about the more than five dozen Democrats in Congress who are boycotting the inauguration on Friday. \"All I know is I'm going to be there, and so is Michelle,\" he said. And striking an upbeat tone at the end, Obama maintained that despite being disappointed that Democrat Hillary Clinton hadn't won, there shouldn't be dread ahead. \"The only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world,\" Obama said, quoting advice he had given his own daughters after the election. \"I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad,\" Obama said. But he did have some advice for his successor, warning Trump not to become isolated in the Oval Office and to rely on his advisers. Article continues after sponsorship \"This is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself,\" the president said. \"You are enormously reliant on a team.\" And Obama said that while it was appropriate for the incoming Republican administration to make shifts in policy, he also warned that, \"if you're going to make big shifts in policy, just make sure you've thought it through.\" Obama said his post-presidential plans including wanting \"to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much.\" But he did say there would be issues he wouldn't hesitate to speak out on after he leaves office, if he believes the country's \"core values may be at stake.\" Obama said that would include \"systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion,\" an assault on voting rights, \"institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press\" and \"efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and, for all practical purposes, are American kids, and send them someplace else.\" Obama greatly defended the rights of a free press, seeming to be directly addressing tensions between the press corps and the incoming administration, which has floated moving reporters out of the White House and denying credentials to some reporters or publications. Obama acknowledged that at times he hasn't been pleased with some of his coverage, but he told reporters that \"America needs you, and our democracy needs you.\" \"You're not supposed to be sycophants,\" Obama said. \"You're supposed to be skeptics; you're supposed to ask me tough questions.\" But the subject on which Obama grew most passionate and the most defensive was the issue of voting rights. \"This whole notion of voting fraud is something that has been constantly disproved,\" the president said forcefully. \"This is fake news.\" He argued there was a racial component to such efforts \u2014 \"The reason that we're the only country that makes it harder to vote is that it traces exactly back to Jim Crow\" \u2014 but did also argue that while racial issues have gotten better during his presidency, \"we've got more work to do on race.\" Obama also expressed hope that there would be more diverse chief executives to follow him in the White House, along with another black president. \"I think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith and corner of the country,\" he said. \"We're going to have a woman president, a Latino president, a Jewish president, a Hindu president.\" And he praised the \"transformation\" that has taken place over LGBT rights over the past decade and said he was proud that his administration in some places had \"provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance.\" Obama said that while he knew there would be challenges, he was hopeful those advancements weren't \"reversible, because American society has changed [and] the attitudes of young people in particular have changed.\" He also defended some of his final moves in office, including the controversial decision on Tuesday to commute Chelsea Manning's 35-year prison sentence. The president said that the Army private, who was convicted of leaking secret military information to WikiLeaks, had served a \"tough prison sentence\" and that 35 years was \"very disproportionate\" relative to sentences given to individuals in other similar cases. As for the U.S.'s decision last month to abstain from a U.N. Security Council vote that eventually passed condemning Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Obama said that the status quo in the region was \"unacceptable.\" \"I don't see how this issue gets resolved in a way that maintains Israel as both Jewish and a democracy,\" the president said. \"Because if you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation; functionally, you end up having one state in which millions of people are disenfranchised and operate as second-class residents.\" ",

Mui By Ylan Q. Mui January 18 at 2:30 PM Follow @ylanmui President-elect Trump's commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross testified before the Senate commerce committee Jan. 18. Here are highlights from that confirmation hearing. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross singled out changes to the nation\u2019s free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada on Wednesday as \u201cthe first thing\u201d he would address if confirmed to lead the Commerce Department in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Speaking before the Senate Commerce Committee, Ross said that the United States should open its economic borders to countries that \u201cplay by the rules.\u201d But those that do not, he said, \u201cshould be punished \u2014 severely.\u201d \u201cI am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut I am pro-sensible trade, not pro-trade that is to the disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community.\u201d [ In West Virginia coal country, voters are 'thrilled' about Trump ] Several of Trump's Cabinet nominees are facing potentially bruising confirmation battles. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who is under consideration to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has been embroiled in controversy over his ownership of healthcare stocks while crafting legislation that could have affected those businesses. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), the nominee to lead the White House budget office, failed to pay more than $15,000 in taxes in the early 2000s related to a worker hired to help care for his newborn triplets, according to federal disclosures. Cabinet nominees must undergo routine vetting and disclose their financial holdings as part of their confirmation process. During Wednesday's hearing,\u00a0Ross\u00a0acknowledged that one of his household employees recently was not able to provide proof of legal residency but said that the person had presented a valid Social Security card and driver's license at the time of hiring in 2009.\u00a0A Senate aide said Ross told the committee that\u00a0the driver\u2019s license the employee recently produced had expired. Ross said Wednesday that the employee has been fired. He also said he paid all taxes required under that person\u2019s employment. Still, Ross appeared to face an easy path to confirmation, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle praising his testimony Wednesday. Commerce Chairman Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) called Ross's stance on trade \u201creassuring\u201d even though it broke with Republicans' free-trade orthodoxy. Ranking Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Ross's answers were \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cnon-evasive\u201d and called the hearing \u201ca piece of cake.\u201d Trump made renegotiating trade agreements a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, tapping into the frustration of many middle-class workers who have felt left behind by globalization. Since his election, Trump has already begun wielding the power of the bully pulpit, repeatedly calling for a border tax on U.S. companies that offshore jobs and sell their products back home. President-elect Trump's nominee for commerce secretary Wilbur Ross gave opening remarks, Jan. 18, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. (Reuters) He has taken to task individual companies such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota for investing in Mexico, sending their stock prices plummeting. But he has touted new U.S. jobs created by telecom giant Sprint and pharmaceutical maker Bayer AG. [ How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety and moved markets ] Ross was a close adviser to Trump during the election campaign, and he is slated to take the leading role in setting trade policy in the new administration. Trump has named economist Peter Navarro to head a new manufacturing council within the White House and picked trade veteran Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative, in charge of negotiating agreements. On the campaign trail, Trump called for a blanket 35 percent tax on Mexican imports and a 45 percent tariff on goods from China. In a recent interview with the German newspaper Bild, he also suggested imposing a 35 percent tax on German cars sold in the United States. \u201cWhen you start out with the adverse party understanding that he or she is going to have to make concessions, that\u2019s a pretty good background to begin\u201d negotiations, Ross said Wednesday. At his confirmation hearing, President-elect Trump's commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross spoke about some of the international trade challenges he wants to tackle in the Trump administration. (Reuters) It is unclear whether those measures are part of the border tax that Trump has pushed, and international trade experts say they are likely a violation of long-standing treaties. In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Trump criticized a tax plan by House Republicans intended to discourage imports known as \u201cborder adjustment.\u201d Ross indicated Wednesday that tariffs were an essential component of U.S. trade policy. However, he acknowledged that protectionist measures implemented during the Great Depression only served to deepen the nation\u2019s economic distress. \u201cI think tariffs play a role both as a negotiating tool and to punish offenders that don\u2019t play by the rules,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s top trade advisers have also raised concerns about China\u2019s growing power in the world economy. Navarro has been particularly dire in his warnings, writing a book entitled \u201c Death By China .\u201d Ross, who collects Chinese art and has extensive business interests in the country, sounded a stern but less strident tone in his testimony Wednesday. He said countries manipulate their currencies as a strategy for \u201cattacking\u201d the American economy, though he did not mention Trump\u2019s pledge to label China a currency manipulator on the president-elect\u2019s first day in office. \u201cChina is the most protectionist country of very large countries,\u201d Ross said. [ How will Trump change trade relations with China? Here's what you need to know ] Ross amassed his fortune by investing in the industries that were hit hardest by the forces of globalization -- including steel, coal and textile. He recently announced he would step down down from his position on the board of directors at ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel producer, in advance of his confirmation. According to Bloomberg, Ross\u2019s financial disclosures revealed assets of more than $330 million, with\u00a0his net worth estimated at $2.9 billion. During his testimony, Ross said he would be \u201cscrupulous in recusal\u201d to prevent any conflicts of interest with his vast business empire. But he said his wide-ranging investments also provided him insight into the minutiae of trade law and said his companies have been the victims of unfair practices. 1 of 23 ",

But his offer came with a hefty price \u2014 $200,000. The ongoing litigation involving suburban Chicago man Triano Williams and the Indianapolis-based American College of Education highlights a situation that cybersecurity experts warn could occur more frequently. As companies and individuals outsource the development and operations of their websites and tech programs to others, they're also giving up control and putting themselves at risk, said Gene Spafford, founder and executive director emeritus of Purdue University's Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security. It's similar to any business or school entrusting just one employee with the responsibility of maintaining an account or knowing how something internal works, Spafford added. \"Think of it this way: Would you have only one person writing checks or one person holding the key to the factory?\" he asked. Play On Assignment: Growing Threat 'Ransomware' 2:04 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170119000147if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/681663043970\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> In the case of American College of Education, or ACE, Williams was the only employee in IT at the time with administrative access to the school's Google-hosted domain account. After he was fired from the school last February and returned his computer equipment, officials in June learned they could not access the Google account, which had about 2,000 student emails and course work accounts. At that point, Williams, who sought legal aid, refused to help unless the school wanted to rehire him as a consultant and pay him accordingly. \"In order to amicably settle this dispute, Mr. Williams requires a clean letter of reference, and payment of $200,000,\" his attorney, Calvita Frederick, wrote to ACE's attorney. The school filed a lawsuit against Williams for intentional interference with a contractual relationship, among other accusations, and sought court action to compel him to provide the user name and password for the Google account. Related: Simple Cyber Security Tips to Protect Your Online Accounts Against Hackers Frederick told NBC News on Wednesday that her client never even knew the password because it was autosaved in the school's laptop computer. While Williams did have the ability to help figure out how to access the Google account, she advised him that he was under no obligation to be \"fixing it for free.\" Frederick blamed the school for creating its own \"monstrous situation\" when other employees with IT expertise were let go before Williams. She also filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, claiming that Williams, who is black and had been with ACE since 2007, was being retaliated against for complaining to supervisors that the \"racial climate was uncomfortable.\" Before he was terminated, Williams was told that he would have to move from the Chicago area to Indiana to maintain employment. But Frederick said he refused because he was under a joint custody agreement with his daughter's mother and was unable to relocate. Frederick said the requested $200,000 compensation was meant to settle the discrimination case and was not a form of blackmail. \"Mr. Williams didn't do anything intentional to them,\" Frederick added. The school has since been able to have Google unlock the account for them, although that took time because the tech giant generally only provides account information to the designated administrator. In ACE's case, that had been Williams. Yesterday, press reports were published regarding a case that involves ACE information technology.

Steroids-tainted stars Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens were passed over for the fifth straight year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. But they received a majority of votes for the first time and could be in position to gain election in coming years. Bagwell , on the ballot for the seventh time after falling 15 votes short last year, received 381 of 442 votes for 86.2 percent. Players needed 75 percent, which came to 332 votes this year. The Associated Press RAINES \"Anxiety was very, very high,\" Bagwell said. \"I wrote it on a ball tonight. It was kind of cool.\" In his 10th and final year of eligibility, Raines was on 380 ballots (86 percent). Rodriguez received 336 votes (76 percent) to join Johnny Bench in 1989 as the only catchers elected on the first ballot. Hoffman was five votes shy and Guerrero 15 short. Edgar Martinez was next at 58.6 percent, followed by Clemens at 54.1 percent, Bonds at 53.8 percent, Mike Mussina at 51.8 percent, Curt Schilling at 45 percent, Lee Smith at 34.2 percent and Manny Ramirez at 23.8 percent. Players will be inducted July 30 during ceremonies at Cooperstown along with former Commissioner Bud Selig and retired Kansas City and Atlanta executive John Schuerholz, both elected last month by a veterans committee. Bagwell was a four-time All-Star who spent his entire career with Houston, finishing with a .297 batting average, 401 homers and 1,401 RBIs. Raines, fifth in career stolen bases, was a seven-time All-Star and the 1986 NL batting champion. He spent 13 of 23 big league seasons with the Montreal Expos, who left Canada to become the Washington Nationals for the 2005 season, and joins Andre Dawson and Gary Carter as the only players to enter the Hall representing the Expos. Raines hit .294 with a .385 on-base percentage, playing during a time when Rickey Henderson was the sport's dominant speedster. Rodriguez, a 14-time All-Star who hit .296 with 311 homers and 1,332 RBIs, was never disciplined for PEDs but former Texas teammate Jose Canseco alleged in a 2005 book that he injected the catcher with steroids. Asked whether he was on the list of players who allegedly tested positive for steroids during baseball's 2003 survey, Rodriguez said in 2009: \"Only God knows.\" Bonds, a seven-time MVP who holds the season and career home run records, received 36.2 percent in his initial appearance, in 2013, and jumped from 44.3 percent last year. Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner, rose from 45.2 percent last year. Bonds was indicted on charges he lied to a grand jury in 2003 when he denied using PEDs, but a jury failed to reach a verdict on three counts he made false statements and convicted him on one obstruction of justice count, finding he gave an evasive answer. The conviction was overturned appeal in 2015. Clemens was acquitted on one count of obstruction of Congress, three counts of making false statements to Congress and two counts of perjury, all stemming from his denials of drug use. A 12-time All-Star on the ballot for the first time, Ramirez was twice suspended for violating baseball's drug agreement. He helped the Boston Red Sox win World Series titles in 2004 and '07, the first for the franchise since 1918, and hit .312 with 555 home runs and 1,831 RBIs in 19 big league seasons. Several notable players will join them in the competition for votes in upcoming years: Chipper Jones and Jim Thome in 2018, Mariano Rivera and Roy Halladay in 2019, and Derek Jeter in 2020. Lee Smith, who had 478 saves, got 34 percent in his final time on the ballot. Jorge Posada, Tim Wakefield and Magglio Ordonez were among the players who got under 5 percent and fell off future ballots. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "(Tribune news services) The working group is scrutinizing the activities of a few Americans who were affiliated with Trump's campaign or his business empire and of multiple individuals from Russia and other former Soviet nations who had similar connections, the sources said. U.S. intelligence agencies not only have been unanimous in blaming Russia for the hacking of Democrats' computers but also have concluded that the leaking and dissemination of thousands of emails of top Democrats, some of which caused headaches for the Clinton campaign, were done to help Trump win. Trump and Republican members of Congress have said they believe Russia meddled in the U.S. election but that those actions didn't change the outcome. However, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a former chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that she believes that Russia's tactics did alter the election result. The Senate Intelligence Committee has opened its own investigation into Russia's involvement in the campaign. That panel will have subpoena power. FBI Director Comey refused at a recent Senate hearing to comment on whether the bureau was investigating Russia's hacking campaign for possible criminal prosecutions. Spokespeople for the FBI, the Justice Department and the national intelligence director declined to comment. The BBC reported last week that the joint inquiry was launched when the CIA learned last spring, through a Baltic ally, of a recording indicating the Russian government was planning to funnel funds aimed at influencing the U.S. election. Another source of information was the former longtime British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, who was hired to gather opposition research about Trump for a Republican client and later a Democrat. Early last summer, Steele became alarmed about information he was receiving from a network of Russian sources describing a web of Trump's business relationships with wealthy Russians and alleged political ties to the Kremlin, according to two people who know him. These sources also declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Steele's reports also alleged that Russian consulates in New York, Washington and Miami were used to deliver \"tens of thousands of dollars\" to Kremlin-hired operatives using fictitious names as if they were legitimate Russian-American pensioners. That \"ruse\" was designed to give Russia \"plausible deniability,\" Steele's reports suggested. However, Russia does not operate a consulate in Miami. Steele, who had worked previously with the FBI and was well-regarded, fed the bureau information in July and September suggesting collusion between Trump associates and Moscow in the hacking of Democratic computers, they said. Eventually, he met in Italy with an FBI official to share more information alleging that a top Trump campaign official had known about the hacking as early as last June, the sources said. About a month after the election, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona gave FBI Director Comey a copy of a 35-page compilation of Steele's reports. BuzzFeed posted the 35 pages of allegations online, acknowledging the report had obvious errors and had not been corroborated. Several news organizations, including McClatchy, had the document earlier but had resisted publishing any of the allegations because of the lack of verification. Trump and Putin have branded Steele's dossier as \"fake news.\" On Jan. 11, at his only news conference as president-elect, Trump dismissed it as \"nonsense\" and \"crap.\" On Tuesday, Putin accused soon-to-depart Obama administration officials of trying to undermine Trump's \"legitimacy,\" suggesting that the White House had released Steele's dossier. The Russian leader said those who had prepared the dossier were \"worse than prostitutes.\" Steele's information has been treated as unverified intelligence by the working group because most of it came from purported Kremlin leaks and virtually all of it is extremely difficult to corroborate, the people familiar with the investigation said. The BBC reported that the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia. One of McClatchy's sources confirmed the report. Susan Hennessey, a former attorney for the National Security Agency who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said she had no knowledge that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant had been issued. However, she stressed that such warrants are issued only if investigators can demonstrate \"probable cause\" that a crime has been committed and the information in Steele's dossier couldn't have met that test. \"If, in fact, law enforcement has obtained a FISA warrant, that is an indication that additional evidence exists outside of the dossier,\" she said. One episode that Steele's reports described from multiple sources referred to a late-summer meeting in Prague between Russian government representatives and Michael Cohen , a lawyer for the Trump Organization, the president-elect's vast business operation. But the FBI has been unable to establish that Cohen was in Prague during that period, the two sources familiar with the working group said. Cohen has denied ever traveling to the Czech Republic, although he told The Wall Street Journal that he did so in 2001. For months, Trump has voiced positive sentiments toward Putin. In early January, he tweeted that \"only 'stupid' people, or fools\" would think it's bad to have good relations with Russia. \"When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!\" he tweeted last week. During the campaign in July, he displayed ignorance that Russian-backed separatists had invaded Crimea in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and he called on Russia to hack away to uncover thousands of emails that Clinton had never made public after using a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July, Trump's campaign associates successfully changed the Republican Party's platform to weaken a provision advocating more military support for the Ukrainian government in its fight to defend itself against the Russian-backed incursion in Crimea.

When asked by Sen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn., during the hours-long hearing Tuesday night whether she thinks guns have any place in or around schools, DeVos said the issue is \u201cbest left to locales and states to decide.\u201d Murphy, who represents Newtown, the site of the 2012 deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, pressed on, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t say definitively today that guns shouldn\u2019t be in schools?\u201d In her answer, DeVos mentioned something Sen. Mike Enzi , R-Wyo., said earlier about a school in Wyoming that has fences surrounding it to protect against grizzly bears. The remark garnered some laughs and raised eyebrows in the room. \u201cI will refer back to Sen. Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies,\u201d DeVos said. Murphy later took to Twitter to express outrage at DeVos\u2019 answers regarding guns in schools, saying he was \u201cshaken to the core\u201d and \u201cso should every American parent.\u201d Tonight #BetsyDeVos would not oppose putting guns in our schools. I was shaken to the core by her answer. So should every American parent. Trump\u2019s Education Secretary Pick Betsy DeVos Grilled on Public Education When asked about Trump\u2019s pledge to ban gun-free school zones, DeVos told lawmakers she would support him if he moves forward with the plan. \u201cIf the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence,\u201d she added.

Rain clouds move over downtown Los Angeles on Jan. 12, 2017. (Robyn Beck / AFP / Getty Images) Joseph Serna Contact Reporter A trio\u00a0of storms now headed for Southern California will bring dangerous surf, strong winds and up to 6 inches of rain by early next week, according to the National Weather Service . The storms\u00a0are similar to those that rocked Northern California recently by flooding rivers, blocking mountain passes and causing several deaths. This\u00a0latest round, however, is expected to pack less of a wallop, forecasters say. The first storm should arrive\u00a0Wednesday night and is expected to drop between 0.75\u00a0and 1.25 inches of rain in the foothills and valleys through Thursday, said Stuart Seto of the National Weather Service in Oxnard. The second storm will arrive later Thursday night and could drop another 2\u00a0inches of rain and up to 3\u00a0inches in the San Gabriel Valley foothills by Saturday, Seto said. (Rong-Gong Lin II and Joseph Serna) The third storm is is predicted to be the strongest and will arrive\u00a0Sunday, Seto said. Fueled by warmer moist air, the storm could dump up to 3 inches of rain in the valleys and foothills, and up to 5 inches of rain in the mountains, he said. The storms will also create windy and dangerous surf conditions along the coast. Waves along the beaches Los Angeles and Ventura counties\u00a0could hit 15 feet this weekend while the Orange County and San Diego County coastlines could be slammed with 16-foot waves, forecasters said. People should stay off rocks and jetties, Seto said. The waves could damage piers as a powerful winter storm did in December 2015 . The storms are part of\u00a0a banner water year for California. Several months into its sixth year of drought, California is now on pace to mark\u00a0its wettest year in recorded history. Recent storms have created deep piles of snow in the Sierra Nevada and sent hundreds of billions of gallons of water coursing into lakes and reservoirs. More than 40% of the state \u2014\u00a0all of it in the north \u2014\u00a0is no longer considered to be in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Although recent rains have improved conditions in the southern part of the state, drought conditions persist.
