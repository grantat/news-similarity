Charles Manson, right, and Susan Atkins, at a Santa Monica courthouse in 1970. (Associated Press) Richard Winton , Matt Hamilton and Hailey Branson-Potts Contact Reporters The long saga of Charles Manson , the cult leader whose murder spree more than four decades ago made him a subject of hate, fear, revulsion and fascination, moved to a hospital in downtown Bakersfield this week. Inside Mercy Hospital, Manson was being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding related to his colon, and according to one source with knowledge of his condition, was seriously ill. Manson was rushed there Sunday from Corcoran State Prison, and it remains unclear when his medical treatment will end. Manson, 82, was under heavy security, with officials concerned about the public getting into his room or causing disruptions. TV news crews stationed themselves outside the hospital awaiting word on the killer\u2019s condition. Two California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation vehicles sat at the curb. The scene also drew some onlookers who could be seen roaming outside the hospital, occasionally filming the scene. Manson\u2019s declining health has once again thrust him into the headlines \u2014 where he has appeared with regularity over the years amid his disciplinary problems, romantic engagements and parole hearings. Manson\u2019s grandson, Jason Freeman, told The Times that he had spoken to his grandfather about two weeks ago via telephone and that he seemed to be in good spirits. Freeman, who said his father is Charles Manson Jr., received word via family friends that his grandfather was hospitalized and said that he is trying to petition correctional officials to allow for a visit. \u201cI think at age 82, he\u2019s in pretty good shape. For being 82 and locked up,  he\u2019s kept himself together well physically,\u201d said Freeman, a married father of three who works in construction and Christian ministry in Florida. \u201cOld age is setting in. Nature is taking its course. There will be a day where he doesn\u2019t wake up again.\u201d Manson\u00a0and other members of his so-called family were convicted of killing actress Sharon Tate and six other people during a bloody rampage in the Los Angeles area during two August nights in 1969. Prosecutors said that\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers were trying to incite a race war that he believed was in the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter.\" Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was 8\u00bd\u00a0months pregnant when she was killed at her hilltop home in Benedict Canyon on Aug. 9, 1969. Besides Tate, four others were stabbed and shot to death: Jay Sebring, 35; Voytek Frykowski, 32; Abigail Folger, 25, a coffee heiress; and Steven Parent, 18, a friend of Tate's caretaker. The word \"Pig\" was written on the front door in blood. The next night,\u00a0Manson\u00a0rode along with his followers to the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, then left three members\u00a0to kill the couple. Manson has incurred more than 100 rules violations since 1971.\u00a0Over the years, he has been cited for assault, repeated possession of a weapon, threatening staff and possessing a cellphone, Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department\u00a0of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an email Wednesday. \u201cSuffice it to say that he cannot be described as a model prisoner,\u201d she said. In 1982, while Manson was housed at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, prison guards discovered a hacksaw blade, marijuana and LSD in Manson\u2019s cell. Guards said they found other items in the facility that indicated Manson may have been trying to escape, including nylon rope and a catalog\u00a0that showed how to order hot-air balloons. Two years later, Manson was doused with a flammable liquid and set ablaze by a fellow Vacaville inmate, who told guards he attacked Manson in retaliation for threats the cult leader made against him for practicing the Hare Krishna faith. Manson was treated for second- and third-degree burns, and his scalp, hair and beard were singed. In 1985, he\u00a0 tried to smuggle \u00a0a hacksaw blade into San Quentin State Prison in the sole of his shoe, days after being transferred to that facility from Vacaville.\u00a0 During his sixth bid for parole in 1986, he described himself in a hearing as a \u201ccaged, vicious animal\u201d and said he didn\u2019t like to read and preferred to spend his time making dolls in his cell.\u00a0 In the decade between his 1981 and 1992 parole hearings, he accumulated 60 prison violations. Parole transcripts chronicling his prison offenses show that female officers bore the brunt of his verbal abuse. Manson has been housed at Corcoran State Prison since 1989. He has obtained illegal cellphones in the facility at least three times, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In March 2009, prison guards found\u00a0 an LG flip phone hidden \u00a0under Manson\u2019s prison mattress. He made calls and sent text messages to people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia.\u00a0 Recordings of Manson\u2019s raspy, high-pitched voice, broadcast by the entertainment news show \u201cInside Edition,\u201d featured him singing, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the world spinning on fire, I\u2019ve danced and sang in the devil\u2019s choir.\u201d Prison officials found Manson with a\u00a0 second cellphone , equipped with a camera, in January 2011. Manson obtained an illegal cellphone again in 2016, Thornton said.\u00a0 After the last cellphone incident, Manson was punished with the loss of 90 days\u2019 \u201cgood time\u201d credit toward parole, Thornton said.\u00a0 In 2014, Manson and Afton Elaine Burton, a 26-year-old\u00a0Manson devotee,\u00a0were\u00a0 granted a marriage license , but it expired before the two could marry. She had faithfully visited him in prison for seven years.\u00a0 Manson\u2019s next parole hearing is scheduled for 2027, when he will be 92. State prison officials declined this week to discuss Manson\u2019s condition, citing privacy rules. For loved ones of Manson\u2019s victims, the latest twist in the saga has revived old feelings. Tate's sister Debra Tate told the Associated Press she\u2019s waiting to learn more about Manson\u2019s condition. \"I would probably say a prayer for them and shed a tear and ask God to have mercy on their souls, but so far I haven't allowed myself to feel anything because it's unsubstantiated,\" Tate said. \"I'm not allowing myself to feel anything until I know that it's true.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss California's bracing itself for the Trump administration , California's drought looks to be easing as snow piles up in the Sierras , protesters are shutting down Mexico's streets over a sudden spike in gasoline prices , and nationwide, more than 84% of undergraduate computer science majors are men.

USA TODAY, Collin Brennan Fox News' Megyn Kelly moderates a primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa Jan. 28, 2016. (Photo: Chris Carlson, AP) Megyn Kelly had one hell of a year. The former Fox News anchor found herself in the news rather than just reporting it, a dual role she managed during one of the most contentious presidential elections in history. Perhaps most famously, President-elect Donald Trump attacked her after she posed a question about his comments on women. She also was attacked by former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and fellow Fox News anchor Sean Hannity. Experts say it was this ability to challenge conservative diehards while leading a right-leaning cable network that made her a star. \"A lot of her popularity has to do with the context as much as content,\" said John Carroll, a mass communication professor at Boston University. \"She's at Fox News and she doesn't adhere to the party line at all times, and that gives her a freshness that many other personalities don't have.\" Her ability to find herself in the news drove her momentum, said Ben Bogardus, an assistant professor of journalism at Quinnipiac University. \"It made her a character instead of an anonymous news anchor,\" he said. Trump called Kelly overrated and off-base after her famous question. The two, however, later made nice. She again made the news when she told investigators that her boss, Roger Ailes, sexually harassed her in the past. Kelly also relayed her experience to\u00a0Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox,\u00a0shortly after former Fox host Gretchen Carlson sued Ailes for sexual harassment. In her book Settle for More, Kelly said Ailes first started harassing her in 2005. \"She didn't just cover the presidential election, \" Carroll said. \"She was a player during the presidential election and that gave her a status that went beyond the normal news profile or journalistic profile that others had.\" But Carroll questions whether Kelly will maintain atop the media landscape as she leaves\u00a0Fox News for NBC. \"It may be that in the Fox News environment, that's where her appeal is greatest,\" Carroll said. \"If you put her in a more general environment, one that's less agenda-driven, what makes her unique becomes less of a factor than it is at Fox News.\" These 10 execs, newscasters shook up media in 2016 At NBC, Bogardus said, Kelly may experience the same struggles other news anchors experience when jumping networks. Others like Katie Couric, Sam Champion, and Keith Olbermann have attempted such a move unsuccessfully. \"There's also no guarantee Kelly's conservative-leaning audience at Fox will follow her to the parent company of left-leaning MSNBC, or that NBC viewers will accept a former Fox News personality,\" he said. \"Newscaster-led daytime talk shows have been a difficult sell recently. Viewers seem to want more Ellen-style entertainment shows, instead of harder-edged shows.\" Follow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Dangerous levels of air pollution continued into the new year.</p> Close WANG ZHAO/AFP/Getty Images BEIJING \u2014 As the world welcomed 2017, Beijing and other cities across northern and central China were shrouded in thick smog , prompting authorities to delay dozens of flights and close highways. Air pollution readings in northern Chinese cities were many times above the World Health Organization-designated safe level of 25 micrograms per cubic meter of PM 2.5, the tiny, toxic particles that damage lung tissue . The readings exceeded 400 by Monday afternoon in several cities in the northern province of Hebei. Expressways in Shijiazhuang, Hebei\u2019s capital, and more than a half-dozen other cities there were temporarily closed, according to notices posted on the official microblog of the province\u2019s traffic police. In the central city of Zhengzhou, authorities ordered students from kindergarten through high school to stay home on Tuesday because of the smog. Authorities have deployed teams of inspectors to check on polluting factories, reports said. Dramatic time-lapse video posted on Twitter and Instagram captured the smog rolling in and filling the streets of Beijing on Monday. A video posted by Chas Pope (@china_chas) on Jan 1, 2017 at 7:52pm PST China has long faced some of the worst air pollution in the world , blamed on its reliance of coal for energy and factory production, as well as a surplus of older, less efficient cars on its roads. Researchers at Germany\u2019s Max Planck institute have estimated that smog has led to 1.4 million premature deaths per year in China, while the nonprofit group Berkeley Earth in California has had a higher figure, 1.6 million. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The credit-card sized unit fits into your wallet (or purse), and when pulled out, has two prongs and a smartphone cable to plug into A/C for a quick charge. The company makes a great point. Phones are getting slimmer, but chargers remain the same. \u201cIt\u2019s time we have chargers that fit our mobile lifestyle,\u201d says Kado chief marketing officer Yariv Ganor. Kado, which claims the phone charger would be the world's thinnest,\u00a0is looking at a mid-2017 release.

Rand Paul using Obamacare repeal to protest debt Mary Troyan , USA Today 5:19 p.m. ET Jan. 4, 2017 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul voted Wednesday against the first step in repealing the Affordable Care Act because the underlying budget proposal increases the federal debt over 10 years. Paul, a Kentucky Republican with a history of casting protest votes, was the only GOP senator opposed. After the 51-48 vote in the Senate, the budget resolution, which includes the mechanisms to start repealing the 2010 health care law in addition to general spending levels for the federal government over the next decade, will be debated for the next week. Paul announced his opposition earlier in the day on MSNBC. \u201cI won\u2019t vote for a terrible budget just to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Paul said. Paul\u2019s opposition illustrates that even strong Republican critics of the Affordable Care Act have concerns over how to kill it without doing damage to the health insurance market, consumers and the larger American economy. The proposed Republican budget \u2014 a key piece to the repeal effort \u2014 increases the federal debt by more than $9\u00a0trillion over 10 years, Paul said. \u201cIf I have to weigh the two problems, I actually think the debt is a more important problem than Obamacare,\u201d Paul said. Read more: Fact check: Trump pulls quotes on ACA out of context Paul is so far the lone Republican dissenter in the Senate, but some of his fellow deficit hawks are also protesting the projected debt increase. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas said they supported the 2017 budget resolution in order to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they want the spending levels to be revisited in the 2018 budget. \u201cOur votes in favor of the \u2018Obamacare Repeal Resolution\u2019 do not indicate in any way our support for the revenue, and deficit numbers therein, nor for the use of those numbers as the basis for future federal budgets,\u201d they wrote to Republican leaders. Paul is also part of a growing Republican sentiment to have an alternative health insurance plan ready to immediately replace the repealed law. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, Obamacare continues to unravel and there are many health care experts and analysts predicting bankruptcy for insurance companies and a massive insurance company bailout within six months of repeal,\u201d Paul said. If the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate for individuals to buy health insurance is repealed, for example, there will not be enough healthy people buying insurance to keep the plans solvent. \u201cIt will be a huge mistake for Republicans if we don\u2019t vote for a replacement the same day as the repeal,\u201d Paul said. Paul took to the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon to defend his vote and criticize the GOP for taking control of the House, Senate and White House and proposing a budget that doesn't dramatically cut federal spending. \"It's not a popular stand that I take today,\" Paul said. \"The debt threatens the very foundation of our country.\" Paul said he plans to introduce his own budget proposal, as in past years, that balances within five years. 5 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hTZjbE NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Mark Lennihan/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark Lennihan/AP An injured passenger is taken from the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn on Wednesday after a Long Island Rail Road train hit a bumping block. Mark Lennihan/AP A crowded commuter train crashed into a bumper block and partially derailed as it pulled into Brooklyn's Atlantic Terminal on Wednesday morning, according to N.Y. officials. The FDNY says at least 103 people sustained non-life-threatening injuries. \"It appears that the train was heading into the station, at 10 or 15 miles per hour, and did not stop,\" WNYC's Stephen Nessen tells our Newscast unit. \"It hit a bumper block; the front two cars were lifted off the tracks. One of the rails actually pierced the bottom of the front car.\" 103 injuries reported at scene of Atlantic Terminal LIRR train derailment, all non-life-threatening pic.twitter.com/t5p78cAFlU \u2014 FDNY (@FDNY) January 4, 2017 The crash happened during peak morning commuting time, when between 600 and 700 people were on the Long Island Rail Road train originating from Far Rockaway, Queens, Nessen adds. \"People just went flying,\" passenger Donette Smith told The New York Times . \"Bodies were everywhere. It was very scary.\" The @LIRR train was supposed to stop at a bumper & didn't, but glad to report there were no deaths; the most serious injury was a broken leg \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 4, 2017 The injuries reported so far have been largely minor: WNYC reports that the most serious is a broken leg. The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Thomas F. Prendergast, told the Times that most of the injuries were sustained when the train \"came to an abrupt stop after crashing into the bumper block at the end of the track.\" Article continues after sponsorship Nessen says it's still unclear what caused the train to crash: \"Trains pulling into the station do automatically slow down but it is up to the conductor to hit the brake finally for the train to stop and in this case, it appears that didn't happen. Investigators are still looking into what happened.\" Prendergast also suggested that responsibility may lie with the train's conductor. \"At that speed, it's pretty much the locomotive engineer's responsibility to stop the train,\" he said, according to Reuters. 'It Was Going Full, Full Force': Train Crashes Into Hoboken Terminal, Killing 1 Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters at the scene that it could have been worse. The crash is drawing comparisons to September's train crash in the nearby Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey, which killed one person and injured more than 100 others. The Times quotes Cuomo as saying that the train in the Hoboken crash \"was coming in much faster, did much more damage, hurt many more people.\" ",

Buzz60 Shoppers walk into a Macy's department store. (Photo: Stephan Savoia, AP) After seeing sales drop during the holidays, Macy's said Wednesday it has either closed or will shutter 68 stores and cut an additional 6,200 positions\u00a0at a time when shoppers are going online to buy everything from scarves to lipstick. Of the 68 stores\u00a0out of 730 in total, nine closings had been previously announced and three locations have already shut down. But the retail giant revealed the locations of the remaining 59 stores, which will be shuttered by the middle of this year\u00a0and affect 3,900 employees, some of whom may be offered jobs at other locations. Macy's identifies 68 stores that will close The locations span the country, from Florida to Oregon. Some of the stores are relatively new to the chain. The Macy's store in the Eastland center in Columbus, Ohio, opened in 2006, and has 73 employees. Some, however, are historic or have been around for decades. Macy's said it will shutter its store in downtown Minneapolis opened in 1902, where it has 280 employees. Expect more store closings despite big holiday sales Additionally the retail giant says that it will be cutting \"layers of management'' at its central operations, and paring the number of managers supporting stores, making up the bulk of 6,200 jobs that will be lost. \"We\u00a0continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,'' Terry Lundgren, Macy's CEO said in a statement. \u00a0In regard to the store closings he added, \"we are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape. . . .These are never easy decisions.'' The news did not seem to sooth investors, with Macy's shares plunging 8.7%, to $32.70, in after hours trading. \"It's a big reduction in space and a lot of stores aren't pulling their weight,\" says Neil Saunders, analyst for Conlumino, a firm that follows the retail industry. who called the action \"harsh, but necessary.\" Having stemmed some of its losses, he says Macy's can now pour some of the savings into improving stores that show more promise. \"In stores where they think they have potential, they will invest more,\" Saunders says. \"That is the right direction. They\u00a0want to make sure the ones they have are really great stores and that requires money.\" But the bloodletting probably isn't over. \"I\u00a0don't think this is the end of it,\" he adds. The announcement was in keeping with Macy\u2019s guidance to investors\u00a0in August that it would be shutting about\u00a0100 stores to try to reverse sliding sales and profits. The chain also mapped out a strategy to boost revenue, ranging from hosting in-store events to woo foot traffic to enhancing the experience of searching online. But efforts fell short in the all-important holiday shopping period.\u00a0Sales at stores open at least 12 months that include licensed businesses dropped a combined 2.1% in November and December compared to last year, while sales at stores that do not include licensed businesses and open at least 12 months dropped by 2.7%. Macy's\u00a0is now reducing its full-year earnings guidance, expecting diluted earnings, not counting special charges, of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, rather than the previously forecast $3.15 to $3.40. Meanwhile, it maintained its full year\u00a0guidance predicting a 2.5% \u00a0to 3% drop in comparable sales at stores with licensed businesses. The retailer is one of many traditional store chains fighting the headwinds of a retail environment that has been transformed by the surge in online shopping. Sears for instance has shuttered dozens of stores, terminating the leases on 19 under performing locations just this week. ",

(Photo: Lynne Sladky, AP) Tiger Woods will try to win for the first time in more than 40 months at a place where he\u2019s triumphed a record eight times. Woods, who hasn\u2019t won since the 2013 World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational, will make his 2017 debut in the Farmers Insurance Open on Jan. 26-29 at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego. Woods, who announced the commitment to play Wednesday, won the Farmers in 1999, 2003, 2005-08 and 2013. He also won his last major at Torrey Pines in the 2008 U.S. Open in a 19-hole playoff against Rocco Mediate. Woods last played on the PGA Tour in the 2015 Wyndham Championship, where he tied for 10th. The winner of 79 Tour titles and 14 majors made his return to competitive golf a month ago in the Hero World Challenge at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas. He finished 15th in the field of 18 but he, along with winner Hideki Matsuyama, led the field with 24 birdies. Also on the commitment list are world No. 1 Jason Day, defending tournament champion Brandt Snedeker, reigning U.S. Open champion Dustin Johnson, reigning PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker, Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose, Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler and three-time Farmers champion Phil Mickelson.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a resource-dependent town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island\u2019s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B.C.), the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to \u201csmoke of the world,\u201d was taken into ownership \u2014 both private and national \u2014 by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art \u2014 work that was celebrated by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss as among the most sophisticated in the world \u2014 has meant that much of the community\u2019s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl\u2019s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her co-workers, two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island\u2019s productive old-growth forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come.

Clear-cut in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill\u2019s daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary role-playing games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the \u201cprisoners\u201d to fight oppression with noncooperation \u2014 a practice that ended after a disastrous fake \u201cinvasion\u201d by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. Photo Credit Jonathan Bartlett I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the mid-1980s, attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps\u2019 explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmers\u2019 unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me: red-diaper babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant \u201cone-two-three-four\u201d with the facility of lifelong practice. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the \u201980s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher\u2019s Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I\u2019ve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the co-op\u2019s board. When the co-op\u2019s finances crashed with the late-1980s recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant \u2014 museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I\u2019d made there and the dreams we\u2019d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners; when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the island\u2019s upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color they\u2019re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif., now, and I take my 8-year-old daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that I\u2019ve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family.

Photo KIM FU Dawson City, Yukon The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful, two-engine turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, Yukon\u2019s capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape \u2014 gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere \u2014 before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed \u201cParis of the North\u201d during the late 19th-century Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the one-room airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp. Fat-breasted black birds pecked at the exposed edges. \u201cIf you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,\u201d the volunteer said. Photo Credit Jonathan Bartlett The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of off-grid cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger, snow-covered chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and stopped-up at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the river\u2019s beach; sheets of ice overlapped where they\u2019d heaved onto the shore, their exposed cross-sections resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, I\u2019d been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we\u2019re a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. It\u2019s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me \u2014 like most \u2014 you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the freeze-up. The temperature dropped below minus-30 degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on cross-country skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. \u201cJust picking up my mail!\u201d he called.

His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and Opa\u2019s seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me \u201cSarah Nicole,\u201d while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but \u201cSarah.\u201d At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one; but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into \u201cZAH-ra Nie-KOLL.\u201d This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Photo Credit Jonathan Bartlett Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane, lace-edged in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate Oma\u2019s bread with havarti cheese and livid-skinned summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a mouth-burst of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they\u2019re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my aunt\u2019s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed.

Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that Opa\u2019s jam can make you forget what a fruit is.

Photo \u00c9LISE TURCOTTE Eastern Townships, Quebec A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bay\u2019s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, I\u2019d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I\u2019d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. Photo Credit Jonathan Bartlett When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Mystic; between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town\u2019s 12-sided barn , and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who\u2019d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.-Armand on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn\u2019t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and others\u2019; looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I\u2019m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers; farms and cornfields; a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house; old Anglo-Saxon cemeteries that pop up at every turn; leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch; a few wayside crosses; old churches and train stations and checkpoints; and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot.

En fran\u00e7ais: Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de s\u00e9journer dans un petit village de mon choix afin d\u2019y \u00e9crire des po\u00e8mes. J\u2019ai choisi la vall\u00e9e de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l\u2019est en Qu\u00e9bec, parce que j\u2019aimais la signification du nom donn\u00e9 par les Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e0 la baie: beaucoup d\u2019oiseaux aquatiques. D\u00e9j\u00e0, je voyais des oiseaux partout, dans mes r\u00eaves, autour de ma t\u00eate, derri\u00e8re les fen\u00eatres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger \u00e0 travers les champs de ma\u00efs. Cette r\u00e9gion me ramenait aussi \u00e0 mon amour de la Nouvelle-Angleterre. Afin de choisir le village de mon s\u00e9jour, j\u2019avais point\u00e9 mon doigt sur un petit village appel\u00e9 Mystic. Ce nom m\u2019attirait. J\u2019avais aussi d\u00e9couvert une ville homonyme aux \u00c9tats-Unis o\u00f9 il y avait, dans un mus\u00e9e, une salle d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les co\u00efncidences pour \u00e9crire. J\u2019inventais d\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 des liens entre Melville et le Mystic qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois; entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier lou\u00e9e, et ces d\u00e9fricheurs de territoires r\u00e9els et fictifs que sont les grands \u00e9crivains am\u00e9ricains du 19e si\u00e8cle. J\u2019imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange \u00e0 douze c\u00f4t\u00e9s, et cr\u00e9ais une num\u00e9rologie intime \u00e0 moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route, les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques, les maisons \u00e0 fa\u00e7ade victorienne; je pensais \u00e0 la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord, aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine, \u00e0 tous ces immigrants ayant laiss\u00e9 leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu\u2019en m\u2019aventurant plus loin, aux abords du grand lac Memphr\u00e9magog, je penserais aussi aux d\u00e9serteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Ab\u00e9naquis des Premi\u00e8res Nations, qui ont donn\u00e9 les noms aux lacs et aux rivi\u00e8res, \u00e0 notre ignorance. \u00c0 Pike-River, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 mon s\u00e9jour commen\u00e7ait, j\u2019ai compris cependant que j\u2019\u00e9tais sur une route o\u00f9 chaque arr\u00eat menait \u00e0 un autre. Je suis entr\u00e9e dans le bureau du tourisme, j\u2019ai pos\u00e9 mille questions \u00e0 une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 sur la carte o\u00f9 se trouve Chemin Saint-Armand, la deuxi\u00e8me plus belle route du Qu\u00e9bec. (Je n\u2019ai pas jamais appris o\u00f9 se situe la premi\u00e8re). Et je ne suis pas rest\u00e9e \u00e0 Mystic: d\u00e8s que j\u2019ai aper\u00e7u le vieux cimeti\u00e8re de Hunter Mills, c\u2019est la zone frontali\u00e8re entre le Qu\u00e9bec et les \u00c9tats-Unis qui m\u2019a fascin\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait l\u2019illustration de l\u2019\u00e9tat dans lequel je me trouvais, dans l\u2019esprit de l\u2019errance, \u00e0 la recherche de fant\u00f4mes, les miens, ceux des autres; \u00e0 la recherche de mes mots, ma terre promise, ma maison construite pierre apr\u00e8s pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019appel\u00e9e \u00e0 s\u00e9journer dans un petit village, je me suis retrouv\u00e9e \u00e0 ramasser les grains d\u2019un chapelet de hameaux dispers\u00e9s sur le chemin de la fronti\u00e8re. Le d\u00e9cor que j\u2019y ai trouv\u00e9 m\u2019enchante toujours: villages enclav\u00e9s dans l\u2019ombre des montagnes, dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivi\u00e8res; fermes et champs de ma\u00efs; une Mercedes sur quatre blocs \u00e0 travers le d\u00e9barras devant une maison \u00e0 l\u2019abandon; de vieux cimeti\u00e8res anglo-saxons qui surprennent \u00e0 chaque d\u00e9tour; des arbres feuillus, \u00e9rables, noyers, \u00eatres, ch\u00eanes, bouleaux; quelques croix de chemin; d\u2019anciennes gares et \u00e9glises, de vieux postes de fronti\u00e8re; et le matin, \u00e0 l\u2019auberge, un petit chat noir perch\u00e9 sur une branche d\u2019arbre \u00e9coutant le bruit des chutes et de la cafeti\u00e8re qui ronronne.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story While a cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country, it has not stopped the fighting everywhere, nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies, as appears to be the case with Damascus\u2019s water. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Historically, most of the water for the capital, which is controlled by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, has come from the Barada Valley north of the city, which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22, when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring, halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online , purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water, then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said by email Tuesday that the \u201cdeliberate targeting of the water infrastructure\u201d had caused the shut-off. \u201cBut we are not in a position to say by whom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area has been the scene of much fighting, so we have not been able to access it.\u201d Now, 5.5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water, which has raised the risk of waterborne disease, especially among children, he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the cease-fire. Antigovernment activists say that government forces, and fighters from Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah organization, have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria, said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and pro-government forces. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the cease-fire, saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble, they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis, making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city, and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about one-third of the city\u2019s daily needs, Mr. Laerke, the spokesman, said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers, while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A 50-year-old shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands, feet and faces, an option not available to the women of the house. At home, he said, they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One 60-year-old woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes, collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. \u201cMy family\u2019s dream is to get a warm shower,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. \u201cIt has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine.\u201d She expressed anger that Syria\u2019s state-run news media had said little about the water crisis, instead focusing on the military\u2019s battles with rebels. \u201cWe are fed up with the news of military operations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want news about water and water supply schedules.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Despite the water crisis, conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo, the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country, where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the cease-fire appears to be holding there, the formerly rebel-held eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands, United Nations relief officials said. \u201cNothing prepared us for what we saw,\u201d Sajjad Malik, the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria, told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. \u201cThe infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood.\u201d Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food, water, shelter and medical care in the city, where four million people once lived. He estimated 1.5 million people remain in Aleppo, mostly on the western side, including roughly 400,000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return, even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. \u201cThey\u2019re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,\u201d Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that \u201cAleppo\u2019s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Maher Samaan from Paris, an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story One story in the Turkish press, based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey, was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack, which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism, the nightclub attack, even with the gunman still on the run, appears to have only accelerated Turkey\u2019s shift away from the West, at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society. All of this is a reflection, many critics say, of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that, instead of unifying to confront terrorism, Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack. The West, symbolized by the United States, is the perennial boogeyman. While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days \u2014 by accusing it of supporting Turkey\u2019s enemies, including the Islamic State; Kurdish militants; and supporters of an outlawed Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup \u2014 Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office. Photo A security officer outside the Reina nightclub in Istanbul on Wednesday. Credit Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images \u201cOur expectation from the new administration is to end this shame,\u201d Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State, but are also an enemy of Turkey. \u201cWe are not holding the new administration responsible for this,\u201d Mr. Yildirim said. \u201cBecause this is the work of the Obama administration.\u201d Meanwhile, the nightclub assailant is on the loose. The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer, but refused to release any other details, although photographs of the man, from surveillance cameras, have been released. Also, a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in Istanbul\u2019s Taksim Square. A senior United States official, who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details, said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan, not Kyrgyzstan, as many reports this week had first suggested. The official expressed alarm at the growing anti-Americanism in Turkey, which seems to accumulate after each crisis here, and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy. The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on Istanbul\u2019s streets, with vehicle checkpoints, night raids on houses and low-flying helicopters. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere is significant fear in ordinary people,\u201d said Aydin Engin, a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was detained last year as part of the government\u2019s crackdown on the news media. \u201cFear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place, being in a crowd, going to a shopping mall, getting on the metro.\u201d With each passing day, public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity, with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life. In the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the Bosporus, nationalists staged a mock execution of Santa Claus in the name of defending Islam; a reporter for The Wall Street Journal was detained , strip searched and placed in solitary confinement \u2014 for, according to the newspaper\u2019s account, \u201cviolating a government ban on publication of images from an Islamic State video\u201d; and a well-known fashion designer was beaten up at the Istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s basically a breakdown of order,\u201d said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and academic, seeking to explain the tumult in society. \u201cEveryone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it.\u201d ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story But now, Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America\u2019s intelligence services. Julian Assange said &quot;a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta&quot; - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 4, 2017 Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Hannity Julian Assange FULL Interview 1/3/17 Video by MAKINGAMERICAGREATAGAIN Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday. Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have &quot;hacking defense&quot; like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible...... \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 4, 2017 things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 4, 2017 There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence \u2014 with \u201c100 percent\u201d certainty. As he has previously, Mr. Assange said: \u201cOur source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties.\u201d But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks.com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2.0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D.N.C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange\u2019s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that \u201cterrible\u201d information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city\u2019s lead-contaminated water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here , among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query \u2014 for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. &quot;Without Trump\u2019s ... false claims ... the Wikileaks material would have deflated of its own boringness.\u201d https://t.co/l7NBicHRjP https://t.co/aUrgPMgoJv \u2014         David Frum (@davidfrum) Jan. 4, 2017 The president-elect appears to be getting a jump on the news. Pence backs up Trump \u2014 and Republicans squirm Vice President-elect Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump\u2019s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administration\u2019s icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump \u201cexpressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,\u201d Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post, Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the president-elect, saying he would not be commenting on \u201cevery little tweet or Facebook post.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he called Mr. Assange \u201ca sycophant for Russia , \u201d who \u201cleaks, steals data and compromises national security.\u201d Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll get up to speed on what\u2019s been happening and what Russia has or has not done,\u201d he said. From \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 to the White House Ms. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. Trump\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. OMAROSA's OFFICIAL SIZZLE REEL Video by OfficialOmarosa Top White House jobs are going to political veterans Ms. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, as his deputy chief of staff for operations, a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security, among other things. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He named Rick Dearborn, who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill, as his chief liaison to Congress, heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh, who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, will become his deputy at the White House, overseeing senior staff, scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement, Mr. Priebus called the three a \u201cteam of doers\u201d who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to Mr. Trump, said she was thrilled to have \u201canother strong female leader\u201d on the team in Ms. Walsh. Trump finds timing of intelligence briefing \u2018very strange\u2019 First, Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election, but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then, on New Year\u2019s Eve, the president-elect promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday, he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. ",

Ahead of Pence's press conference with Congressional leadership, the president-elect went on a Twitter rant blaming Democrats for \"massive increases\" in premiums and saying the law will \"fall of its own weight.\" Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Simultaneously, Obama visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill to urge them to defend the law that has provided 20 million Americans with insurance. \"He said, 'Listen, don't mistake my cool demeanor for a lack of outrage. I'm angry just like you are about what has happened in the election and after the election.' And I think you could sense that he, you know, is maybe feeling a little forlorn that he's not going to be in this fight in the way that we are,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on MSNBC after the private meeting. Related: Replacing Obamacare Will Be Difficult, Repealing It Could Be Just as Hard Another source in the room said the president lamented that he will soon be a private citizen because \"I would love to be on the field.\" Republicans began what is expected to be an arduous process of following through on repealing and replacing Obamacare the same day a new Congress was sworn in. Though the GOP will soon control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, they have yet to rally behind a single replacement plan. Pence signaled the first steps the GOP will take is continuing to make the case against the Affordable Care Act, which Democrat Hillary Clinton also pledged to modify during the 2016 campaign.

    "text": "Twitter Amid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday. The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them. But there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data \u2014 the problem of scale. While there's a \"spike\" here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular \u2014 or unpopular \u2014 search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump. Here, for example, is the \"who is my representative\" search compared to searches for \"Obamacare\" in the U.S. over the past week. The spike nearly disappears here \u2014 as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, \"who is my representative\" registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare. Article continues after sponsorship But then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure. The Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure. The really striking comparisons come when you compare this \"spike\" to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie? What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV? OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that \"this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project.\" But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for \"who is my representative\" are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten. So searches for \"who is my representative\" spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time. None of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members. But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video. ",

By David Weigel and Joby Warrick January 4 at 7:22 PM Follow daveweigel Follow @jobywarrick President-elect Donald Trump tweeted some praise on Tuesday for a man most Republicans wanted nothing to do with. He had seen Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, defend himself during an hour of friendly, prime-time questions on Fox News. And he was impressed. \u201cJulian Assange said a \u201814-year old could have hacked Podesta,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhy was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had praised WikiLeaks. During his campaign for president, Trump had gleefully highlighted emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. By October, just the mention of WikiLeaks could start a roar of applause at Trump\u2019s rallies. Since then, Trump has continued praising the radical transparency group, harshly criticized by President Obama and other officials for what they describe as damaging national security leaks. He has defended its founder, who has lived in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London since August 2012 to avoid extradition on a rape allegation in Sweden. And Trump has been in sync with conservative media, once critical of WikiLeaks, which increasingly embraces Assange as a hero. Republicans have been slow to climb on board. In interviews, members of the congressional intelligence committees either declined to comment on WikiLeaks or made it clear that they wanted the organization shut down. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange prepares to speak on February 5, 2016 in London from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy where he continues to seek asylum following an extradition request from Sweden in 2012. (Carl Court/Getty Images) \u201cJulian Assange is no hero,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) \u201cSomeone who steals property is not bringing transparency \u2014 he\u2019s taking information that\u2019s not his to give.\u201d In a statement, Rep. Will Hurd (D-Tex.), a former CIA officer, said that Assange was not a \u201ccredible source\u201d for Trump or anyone else. \u201cThe same people who condemned Secretary Clinton for making sensitive and classified information vulnerable by using an unsecure server should be equally outraged that Assange continues to carelessly leak sensitive documents,\u201d Hurd said. On CNN, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u2014 a Trump critic who has asked for hearings into possible Russian meddling in the election \u2014 urged the incoming president to look more closely at Assange\u2019s tactics and motivations, and to take seriously U.S. intelligence estimates that contradict Assange\u2019s descriptions of the hacks. \u201cIt\u2019s the Democrats today; it could be the Republican Party tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us should be gleeful when a foreign entity hacks into our political system to interfere with our elections, and that\u2019s what the Russians did.\u201d Increasingly, reactions like those don\u2019t jibe with the way Assange is portrayed by the sort of conservative sources\u00ad that generally give Republicans glowing treatment. Assange\u2019s interview with Fox News was conducted by Sean Hannity, who had evolved from a critic to a frequent booster. From Assange\u2019s room in London, Hannity presented WikiLeaks in its favored terms \u2014 as a source of true, incorruptible journalism, bringing down the political elite. Hannity, who told Assange last month that he had \u201cdone us a favor,\u201d said Tuesday that he believes \u201cevery word\u201d Assange says. \u201cYou exposed a level of corruption that I for 30 years on the radio as a conservative knew existed, and I was shocked at the level of corruption, duplicity, dishonesty, ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion,\u201d Hannity told Assange. \u201cKnowing what WikiLeaks revealed about the Podesta emails on Clinton corruption, on pay to play, on Bernie Sanders being cheated, all of this is revealed. Not a lot of this was covered.\u201d With little pushback from Hannity and just as little demand for proof, Assange denied that Russian hackers had anything to do with its troves of hacked Democratic emails. With Hannity\u2019s urging, Assange said he was surprised that \u201celites\u201d had failed to elect Clinton; he had said, before the election, that Trump would \u201cnot be allowed\u201d to win. \u201cWe are happy to have credit for exposing the corruption and behavior that was occurring in that Clinton team and the DNC fixing things against Bernie Sanders,\u201d Assange said. \u201cWe are quite happy to accept that.\u201d The Fox interview won other fans: Sarah Palin, who had once compared Assange to the editor of an al-Qaeda magazine, apologized on Facebook and credited him with releasing \u201cimportant information that finally opened people\u2019s eyes to democrat (sic) candidates and operatives.\u201d At less-mainstream news outlets, where Trump\u2019s run and victory were celebrated, this praise had been echoing for months. The Drudge Report has linked videos with speculation that Assange has been aided by government insiders; Alex Jones\u2019s InfoWars, which once criticized Assange for slow-walking the stolen Clinton campaign documents, is rife with rumors that Assange has been silenced by the government, and full of mockery for the Republicans who criticize him. This treatment of Assange is a stark departure from what was, until recently, a near-universal condemnation of the Australian by conservative pundits and politicians as well as the national security establishment. Assange has inspired both admiration and hatred \u2014 sometimes by the same individuals \u2014 since his anti-secrecy organization first made global headlines in 2010. That was the year that WikiLeaks published thousands of stolen, heavily classified Pentagon documents that shed light on U.S. actions in the Iraq War. Most famous were the \u201cIraq War logs,\u201d which included cockpit video footage of American helicopter pilots opening fire on two Reuters journalists after mistaking them for insurgents. That same year, WikiLeaks published the first of more than 250,000 pilfered State Department cables containing sensitive and often candid assessments of foreign governments and politicians. Obama administration officials said publicizing the confidential records damaged relationships with key allies and put diplomats and intelligence operatives at risk. Assange, a former computer programmer and journalist who founded WikiLeaks in 2006, has defended the organization\u2019s tradition of publishing massive volumes of unfiltered intelligence, calling the release of confidential material a necessary antidote against excessive government secrecy. In a news release issued on the eve of last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, Assange said of his group\u2019s goals: \u201cWe publish material given to us if it is of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical importance and which has not been published elsewhere. When we have material that fulfills this criteria, we publish.\u201d The releases that started in 2010 prompted calls in conservative media for Assange\u2019s prosecution, or worse. Conservative commentator Jeffrey Kuhner, in a Washington Times op-ed piece that year, suggested that the U.S. government should have him assassinated. \u201cJulian Assange poses a clear and present danger to American national security,\u201d Kuhner wrote. \u201cThe WikiLeaks founder is more than a reckless provocateur. He is aiding and abetting terrorists in their war against America. The administration must take care of the problem \u2014 effectively and permanently.\u201d On Fox News, legal experts debated the best legal course against Assange, who was decried by one guest as a \u201cdeeply flawed individual.\u201d A column in the conservative publication National Review Online questioned why Assange wasn\u2019t dead already \u2014 perhaps \u201cgarroted in his hotel.\u201d Trump himself, in one of his then-frequent calls to Fox, called WikiLeaks \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and added that \u201cthere should be like death penalty or something\u201d for its releases. Lawmakers and national security officials were only slightly less harsh. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) described WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of Pentagon and State Department documents the \u201cgreatest, most damaging security breach in the history of this country.\u201d Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), who would become chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, suggested that WikiLeaks be designated as a terrorist organization. As recently as late 2015, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of classified documents had \u201ccertainly helped our primary adversaries\u201d and inflicted \u201cjust enormous\u201d damage to the country. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., who oversees U.S. intelligence collection, went further, accusing Assange of putting lives at risk, particularly intelligence operatives working abroad. Assange\u2019s most fervent praise in the United States did not come from Democrats. It came from libertarians. Then-Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), who ran for president in 1988, 2008 and 2012, asked in a floor speech \u201cwhich has resulted in the greatest number of deaths: lying us into war or WikiLeaks revelations or the release of the Pentagon Papers?\u201d Assange, who does not often talk about domestic politics, appeared to notice where his defenders were coming from. In a 2013 discussion, streamed live from the Ecuadoran Embassy, Assange brushed aside the idea that Democrats or political independents were capable of reforming the United States. \u201cThe Republican Party, insofar as how it has coupled together with the war industry, is not a conservative party at all,\u201d Assange said. \u201cThe libertarian aspect of the Republican Party is presently the only useful political voice in the U.S. Congress.\u201d In the 2016 Republican primaries, the party\u2019s libertarian wing lost badly. But elements of their ideas, especially Paul\u2019s criticism of the national security state, were adopted successfully by Trump. The rest of the Republican Party has been slower to adopt or adapt. In 2010, as the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, then-Rep. Pete Hoekstra had called for decisive action against WikiLeaks and Assange. In an interview Wednesday, he said it should still be a goal to \u201cdo everything we can, legally, to shut down his networks.\u201d But Hoekstra argued that Trump was not praising or egging on Assange\u2019s publication of hacked material. \u201cI feel bad for John Podesta that he got his emails hacked,\u201d Hoekstra said. \u201cI\u2019d feel bad if mine were hacked. The reality in today\u2019s world is that if you\u2019re not extremely careful, you\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

The worst injury is believed to be a broken leg, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference this morning. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said none of the injuries were life threatening. According to a representative for the New York Fire Department, \"One of the rails actually pierced the bottom of the train ... We are fortunate we didn't have more serious injuries.\" Andrew Gombert/EPA New York City Fire Department personnel treat injured passengers after an accident involving a Long Island Rail Road commuter train at the Atlantic Terminal Station in Brooklyn, New York, Jan. 4, 2017. WABC A Long Island Railroad train derailed in Brooklyn, New York, Jan. 4, 2017. Alex Wroblewski/Reuters Officials investigate after a Long Island Railroad train that derailed at Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, New York City, Jan. 4, 2017. Cuomo said the train hit the track's bumping block. \"When it hit the block, the block knocked it off the tracks,\" he said. \"It was a train that didn't stop when it was supposed to [and] hit the block at a fairly low rate of speed.\" \"As a result of the impact, the lead wheel assembly derailed, as did one additional axle,\" the MTA said in a statement. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Passenger Aaron Neufeld told ABC News, \"It didn't seem like we were going unusually fast ... I don't think it was anything out of the norm.\" He described the impact as a \"substantial jolt.\" He said he was thrown against the seat in front of him. A different passenger told New York ABC station WABC that after she heard a big thump, the scene was total pandemonium, with passengers falling on top of others, screaming and crying. Another woman told WABC she believed the train was traveling at a faster speed than usual right before the crash. About 430 passengers were on the train at the time of the derailment, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The incident happened on LIRR Track 6 around 8:15 a.m, the MTA said. The terminal is near the Barclays Center. WABC A Long Island Railroad train derailed in Brooklyn, New York, Jan. 4, 2017.

Jonathan Oatis/Reuters Emergency vehicles gather at the Atlantic Avenue Terminal after a commuter train derailed, Jan. 4, 2017, in Brooklyn, New York. Cuomo emphasized that today's incident was \"minor\" compared with the crash at Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey on Sept. 29, 2016, which killed one bystander and destroyed part of the historic train terminal. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration are involved in the investigation of this morning's crash. The MTA said there were no delays this morning as a result of the accident. Also today, in Philadelphia, at least 46 people were injured when two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority trolleys crashed. None of the injuries were life-threatening, an authority representative said. One trolley rear-ended the other, SEPTA said. No pedestrians were injured. The cause of that accident is under investigation as well. ABC News' Erin Dooley contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS News Jan 4, 2017 12:41 PM EST The report by the intelligence community on Russian hacking, ordered by President Obama in December , is expected to be completed soon and will be presented to Mr. Obama Thursday, U.S. officials tell CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues and Andres Triay. On Friday, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed on the report, with the participation of four of the intelligence chiefs: DNI James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers (ret.).\u00a0 Intelligence officials say they didn't delay Trump briefing Law enforcement sources tell Pegues that Friday\u2019s meeting will be the first meeting between Comey and the president-elect, and the meeting comes as Comey\u2019s future at the FBI is uncertain, after an election in which he himself was considered to have been a factor . Multiple law enforcement sources also tell Pegues there has not been any contact between Comey and the Trump team since the election.\u00a0 Comey has kept a relatively low profile since the election, which is perceived to be out of character for Comey, who has been one of the most outspoken FBI directors in recent history. He has a reputation among politicians and law enforcement alike for being honest to a fault, and some of those in the law enforcement community who have criticized him over the past few months now see that as a liability. But Comey is keeping the long view in mind, several sources tell Pegues. He is avoiding public appearances with the national media, and the FBI news conferences he would usually do himself he has delegated to subordinates. FBI officials are trying to determine how best to reintroduce Comey back into the public eye.\u00a0 A public version of the report is expected to be released on Friday, though the timing of this may slide until next week. The review is intended to provide some lessons learned after U.S. officials made an assessment that Russia\u00a0 not only tried to influence the 2016 presidential election , but also favored\u00a0 Mr. Trump \u00a0over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s a conclusion that\u00a0 the president-elect still seems to doubt . Just last week, in retaliation, the Obama administration\u00a0 announced a series of new sanctions \u00a0against Russian intelligence entities and agents they say are\u00a0 responsible for hacks \u00a0into the Democratic National Committee and related servers. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Jesse Jackson Jr. and wife Sandi Jackson arrive for their sentencing hearing Aug. 14, 2013, in Washington, D.C. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Jesse Jackson Jr. filed for divorce from his wife, Sandi Jackson , while she was still in federal prison this fall. But is their fight about to get even uglier? The disgraced former congressman's attorney, Brendan Hammer, said Wednesday that former alderman Sandi Jackson \"committed acts in Illinois\" that led to Jackson Jr. filing the case in Chicago, as opposed to in Washington, D.C. , where Sandi wants the case to be heard. Hammer declined to identify, specifically, what mysterious acts he was alleging. Hammer acknowledged that Jackson Jr. has subpoenaed emails, text messages and call records from his wife of 25 years, but noted that any number of acts other than adultery would, if committed by her in Illinois, also entitle Jackson Jr. to fight the case in Chicago. Neither Jackson was at the Daley Center on Wednesday for a brief hearing in the case, and her lawyer, Jessica Bank Interlandi, declined to comment while leaving court. Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. filed for divorce Monday from former Ald. Sandi Jackson , according to Cook County court records.

(Nereida Moreno) Hammer said that Sandi Jackson has the couple's two children in D.C. but that his client continues to live in Chicago. Jackson Jr., who has been treated for bipolar disorder, was convicted in 2013 of violating federal campaign law by using campaign funds to make personal purchases, including a fedora that once belonged to Michael Jackson and cashmere capes. Both he and his wife served time in the case. If the couple can't resolve the battle over jurisdiction soon \u2014 a hearing in the competing case filed in D.C. by her is scheduled for next month, and the Chicago case is due back before Judge Carole K. Bellows on March 8 \u2014 Jackson Jr.'s legal eagles will have to make it clear just what they're hinting at. \"There's always a chance that things can be resolved\" before then, Hammer said. kjanssen@chicagotribune.com Twitter @kimjnews Sandi Jackson released from federal prison Sandi Jackson, former Chicago Alderman and wife of ex-Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., has been released from federal prison.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the gunman \u2014 who killed 39 people during New Year's celebrations at the Reina club before reportedly escaping in a taxi \u2014 had been identified, but did not name him. Police set up checkpoints across Istanbul as security levels remained high. They stopped cars and taxis, with passengers and drivers holding up their identifications while officers inspected the vehicles. The city has been on edge since the attack on the upscale club popular with local celebrities, and on Wednesday residents beat up a man said to resemble the wanted gunman before handing him over to police, the Dogan news agency reported. Some 20 people, including 11 women, were taken into custody in police raids in the Aegean port city of Izmir, the state-run Anadolu agency said. The suspects, from the largely Muslim Russian republic of Dagestan, as well as members of China's Muslim Uighur minority and from Syria, were believed to have lived with the gunman in an alleged IS cell house in the central Turkish city of Konya, the agency reported. Some 20 children who were with the detainees were also taken to a police station. At least 16 people were previously detained in connection with the massacre. IS has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in reprisal for Turkish military operations against IS in northern Syria. Of those killed, 27 were foreigners \u2014 many from the Middle East . In his first public address to the nation since the killings, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the attack aimed to set Turks against each other and deepen fault lines, but warned the country would not fall \"for this game.\" His comments followed a campaign before the attack by some ruling party supporters and pro-Islamic groups who warned against New Year's celebrations they depicted as Western or Christian traditions, as well as some social media postings that seemed to support the attack on the New Year's revelers. The campaign and social media postings were condemned by more secular-minded Turks who said their lifestyles were being threatened. The government has said authorities were taking measures against social media accounts that allegedly \"support terrorism and foster divisiveness in society.\" \"I repeat once again: no one's lifestyle is under systematic threat in Turkey,\" Erdogan said in his address Wednesday. \"We would never allow such a thing. We didn't allow it in 14 years of governance. If anyone alleges differently they need to put forward concrete examples.\" Erdogan also dismissed accusations that Turkey has, in the past, given support to IS. \"To present the country \u2014 which is leading the greatest struggle against Daesh \u2014 as one that is supporting terrorism is what the terror organization wants,\" he said, using the Arabic alternate acronym for IS. \"To say Turkey has surrendered to terrorism is to take sides with the terrorists and terror organizations.\" Meanwhile, details about the suspected gunman's movements trickled in on Wednesday. The Hurriyet newspaper said he had previously entered Turkey twice, in 2014 and in 2015. He is believed to have slipped illegally into Syria, where he received training in the use of guns and bombs and fought. The pro-government Sabah newspaper identified the suspect as a Kyrgyz national who was born in 1988. It said he had been in contact with a chief IS operative in Istanbul whose aide \u2014 a Tajik national \u2014 was among those in custody. Among those detained Wednesday were seven Uighurs suspected of giving money to the gunman after the attack for him to pay his taxi fare, according to the Haber Turk newspaper. Semsettin Dursun, the owner of an Istanbul restaurant where the Uighurs worked, confirmed that some staff were detained but dismissed claims they were involved. \"They are innocent,\" Dursun told reporters. \"That is the taxi driver's claim. It is a single taxi driver's claim. We don't accept it. There is no other evidence.\" Turkey's European Union affairs minister, Omer Celik, said the attack was carried out in an \"extremely professional way\" and that the assailant appeared to have received training in the Middle East. He said the attacker was using methods \"that avoid all modern intelligence techniques,\" including acting alone, not contacting anyone and \"not using technology.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Fraser reported from Ankara. Associated Press reporter Mehmet Guzel in Istanbul contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Whether the music to your ears is pop, classical, jazz, country or another type of tune altogether, the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest , June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee , an 11-day bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festival\u2019s 50th, but other genres such as hip-hop, classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival , June 16 to 18 in Monterey , Calif., is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location \u2014 the Monterey County Fair and Events Center \u2014 where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, it\u2019s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual Monte-Carlo Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined), featuring performances by the world\u2019s top jazz players such as Manu Katch\u00e9, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Op\u00e9ra Garnier Monte-Carlo, an ornate 19th-century building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de Monte-Carlo and glitzy oceanfront bars. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival , a well-kept secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil\u2019s Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San Francisco-born guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows; Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and open-air Summer Night Concert Sch\u00f6nbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of Vienna \u2019s Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably \u201cAida,\u201d in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie , a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the \u00a1Viva Beethoven ! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal , traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall,\u201d on select dates from March 11 to 24; the production honors the city\u2019s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd \u2019s 1979 album \u201cThe Wall. The band\u2019s chief songwriter, Roger Waters, collaborated with Op\u00e9ra de Montr\u00e9al on the work, which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be drama-filled and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be.

Since the start of the Iraqi offensive to retake Mosul in mid-October, U.S. officials have not confirmed whether American advisers would operate in the city accompanying Iraqi forces while remaining behind the front lines. \u201cThey have been in the city at different times, yes,\u201d said Colonel John Dorrian, the U.S. military spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, in response to a question about whether American military advisers have entered Mosul as part of the Iraqi offensive. Dorrian made his comments today during a video briefing from Baghdad with Pentagon reporters. American military advisers are required to stay behind front lines at military headquarters assisting Iraqi and Kurdish forces involved in the Mosul offensive. However, American special operations forces might come closer to combat situations as they assist Iraqi special operations forces engaged in the fight. Why 200 More US Troops Are Going to Syria Speaking broadly about the adviser role in the Mosul operation, Dorrian said \u201cthey've advised the Iraqi Security Forces as they've moved forward. They remain behind the forward line of troops.\u201d Dorrian declined to provide specifics about when or where the American advisers entered the city at various times. Since the offensive began in mid-October, Iraqi forces have faced tough resistance from ISIS fighters as they pushed into the eastern part of the city. Despite significant casualties, Iraqi forces now control two-thirds of the eastern side of the city that is essentially divided in two by the Tigris River. Dorrian said the coalition has made adjustments in recent weeks to accelerate \u201cphase two\u201d of the push into Mosul, namely the doubling of advisers involved in the operation to 450. It was unclear how many of the advisers were American. As of today, there are 4,936 American military forces in Iraq and another 3,904 forces from other coalition countries, officials said. Last week, Iraqi forces started pushing into Mosul from three axes -- an operation that Dorrian said \u201cis starting to really make things very difficult for the enemy.\u201d He added that once Iraqi forces reach \"the river, they're going to go into the west side and then, you know, it will be another very tough fight there as well.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Its price? A cool $8,999. USA TODAY Acer's Predator 21 X. 6967 CONNECT TWEET 43 LINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORE Think Apple's new MacBook is expensive? It's got nothing on the latest laptop from Acer. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the computer maker unveiled the Predator 21 X, which its makers\u00a0say is the first notebook computer with a curved screen. But forget about the features: the real jaw dropper here is its price: $8,999. What does $9,000 get you? That curved screen is a 21-inch display with a 2560 x 1080 resolution, top-of-the-line Intel Core processors and a Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics processing unit. It also boasts five system fans to prevent overheating, 64 GB of\u00a0DDR4-2400 memory and up to four 512 GB solid state drives. Basically, it's the laptop equivalent of owning a Ferrari. Perhaps the most interesting feature on the Predator is eye-tracking technology through a partnership with company Tobii. Players can use the tech in games, identifying enemies or aiming by just looking at a spot on the screen. Acer says 45 games will support eye tracking. Acer's latest gaming laptop starts at $8,999. \u00a0(Photo: Acer) It will also include an ultra-durable hard-shell carrying case, because breaking a $9,000 laptop would really be the worst. The Predator 21 X launches in North America\u00a0next month. Acer's approach to the PC gaming market differs from other companies introducing devices aimed at gamers, particularly those on a budget. Earlier this week, Dell introduced an Inspiron laptop starting at a much more modest $799. Meanwhile, Lenovo unveiled its Legion gaming laptops starting at $900. But it's in step with an established trend in the PC market.\u00a0Although overall PC sales have fallen, the PC gaming market thrives. SuperData Research found PC gaming\u00a0drew nearly $36 billion in revenue last year, driven by interest in free-to-play online games as well as growing interest in both virtual reality and competitive video gaming, or eSports. Companies including Dell and Acer seeing fresh opportunities through the gaming market to increase sales of laptops and desktops at both the premium and\u00a0budget\u00a0categories. The Taiwanese computer maker is best known for selling computer products to price-conscious consumers, which makes the introduction of a $9,000 laptop intriguing. The majority of its laptops sell under $1,000. ",

    "text": "By John Wagner and Greg Miller January 4 at 9:09 AM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @gregpmiller Arriving at an annual New Year's Eve celebration at his Mar-a-lago, Fla., estate, President-elect Donald Trump left open the possibility of a meeting with Taiwan's president if she visits the United States after he is sworn in on Jan. 20. Trump also pushed back on intelligence claims about Russian hacking. (Reuters) President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday night to say that a planned intelligence briefing for him on \u201cso-called \u2018Russian-hacking\u2019\u201d had been delayed until Friday, a development he called \u2018very strange!\u201d -- but one that a U.S.\u00a0official said wasn't a delay at all. The tweet was the latest sign of Trump\u2019s skepticism about a case pressed by the Obama administration, based on the work of U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies, that Russia tried to influence the U.S. presidential election by hacking several Democratic email accounts, among other actions. Several leading Republicans have also endorsed that view. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Trump returned to the topic on Wednesday morning, sending out a new tweet referencing an interview of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange by Sean Hannity of Fox News. In the interview, Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked the email account of John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign. WikiLeaks published the contents of Podesta's emails without identifying the source of the hacking. Julian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Speaking outside a party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last week, Trump sounded dismissive of Russian's alleged role in the hacking, saying it was \u201ctime for the country to move on to bigger and better things.\u201d But he indicated that he was willing to listen to a briefing on the issue this week. Those remarks on Thursday came just hours after President Obama announced retaliation against Russia that included the removal of 35 Russian government officials and other sanctions against state agencies and individuals allegedly tied to hacking. [ Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election interference ] In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump's briefing would be \u201clater this week\u201d but did not specify a date. In his tweet on Tuesday night, Trump speculated that the reason for a delay of his briefing until Friday was \u201cperhaps more time to build a case.\u201d \u201cVery strange!\u201d the president-elect said in the tweet. A U.S. official disputed that there had been any delay in delivering the briefing that Trump requested on Russia, saying that high-level U.S. intelligence officials are scheduled to meet with the president-elect in New York on Friday. The official said that Trump did receive a regular intelligence briefing on Tuesday, and raised the possibility of confusion on the part of his transition team or schedulers. \u201cIt's possible that his team has some scheduling disconnect\u201d and that \u201cwhatever he received today didn't meet his expectations,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters. But, the official said, the fuller briefing on Russia's alleged election hacking was never scheduled to occur Tuesday, and that\u00a0plans for a fuller Friday briefing have been in place for several days. The officials expected to take part in that session include Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, Jr., CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James B. Comey and the head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Mike Rogers. U.S. intelligence agencies in recent days completed a draft of the comprehensive review of Russian hacking that Obama had ordered after the election. U.S. officials said the document would first need to be briefed to Obama before it is shared with Trump. The full report could be delivered to Obama as early as Thursday, allowing for the document and its principal findings to be shared with Trump shortly thereafter. U.S. spy agencies are also preparing a declassified version, stripped of the most sensitive intelligence information, that could be shared with the public. In December, during a closed door briefing with senators, the CIA shared a secret assessment. The agency concluded it was now \"quite clear\" that Russia's goal was to the help Donald Trump win the White House. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) That version could be ready as early as next week, but the U.S. official cautioned that the timetable on all of these events is subject to change because of the complexity of coordinating the meetings of multiple spy agencies and their top officials\u00a0with the White House and Trump's transition team. Leading Democrats were quick to criticize Trump on Tuesday night. When Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) was shown a copy of Trump's tweet during a television interview, he said Trump was \u201cbeing really dumb.\u201d \u201cLet me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,\u201d Schumer said on MSNBC's \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d \u201cSo even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he\u2019s being really dumb to do this. \u2026 From what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.\u201d In light of 2016 election losses, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) encouraged Senate Democrats to \"look forward\" during a speech on the Senate floor at the outset of the 115th Congress, Jan. 3, 2017. (Reuters) Meanwhile, Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, took to Twitter, saying he wished Trump showed \u201cmore . . . respect for our intelligence professionals.\u201d Proves the need for Congress to give the American people a timely bipartisan probe. (2/2) \u2014 Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) January 4, 2017 And on Wednesday morning, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said she found the \u201cdisrespect\u201d Trump had showed the intelligence community to be \u201cstunning.\u201d Intelligence community is the FIRSTLINE in our war against terror. The disrespect shown them by Trump is stunning.They're the best in world. \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 4, 2017 Trump also spoke briefly to reporters on Saturday about the situation, saying that \u201cno computer is safe\u201d and that, for intelligence officials, \u201chacking is a very hard thing to prove.\u201d \u201cYou want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier,\u201d Trump said. Trump also suggested at that time that he had additional knowledge to share about the situation, saying, \u201cI also know things that other people don\u2019t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d When asked what he knew that others did not, Trump demurred, saying only, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d It was unclear whether Trump was referring to Assange's upcoming interview with Hannity. For months, Trump has sounded skeptical about Russian responsibility for the hacks, which included the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump has suggested other countries could be involved or that it could be the work of \u201csomebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\u201d 1 of 55 ",

    "text": "Email CHICAGO -- Federal jurors at the biggest gang trial in recent Chicago history on Wednesday convicted the core leadership of the Hobos, who prosecutors billed as an \u201call-star team\u201d of the type of ruthless gangs police blame for an alarming spike in homicides last year. Accused Hobos boss Gregory \u201cBowlegs\u201d Chester, alleged hitman Paris Poe and four others were found guilty of a racketeering conspiracy. Prosecutors alleged the conspiracy included the murder of at least nine people, from gang rivals to government witnesses. Prosecutors said the Hobos cultivated a reputation for brutality, once even torturing robbery victims with a hot clothing iron, to extend their power on the city\u2019s South Side. This undated photo provided by the Violent Crimes Task Force, Chicago Division, shows Paris Poe.\u00a0 Violent Crimes Task Force, Chicago Division via AP After three months of testimony, 12 jurors deliberated for six days before reaching their verdicts. The most serious conviction was for racketeering conspiracy, a charge designed as a legal tool to go after all forms of organized crime. An additional nine counts included drug and gun charges. So feared are the Hobos that some witnesses were visibly nervous testifying with its alleged leaders looking on. One refused outright to speak against the gang, telling the judge, \u201cI choose not to testify for the sake of me and my family.\u201d The witness was held in contempt and given a 60-day sentence. Signifying the importance of the case, U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon, was in court when the verdicts were read. The Hobos leaders showed little emotion as the verdicts were read. Poe rubbed his brow and looked across the courtroom gallery. Their alleged crimes included the fatal shooting of government witness Keith Daniels in 2013 in front of his screaming step-children to stop Daniels from testifying, and the robbery at gunpoint of then-NBA player Bobby Simmons\u2019 $200,000 diamond-and-gold chain outside a nightclub. The convictions followed a bloody year on the streets of Chicago . The nation\u2019s third largest city logged 762 homicides last year, the highest tally in 20 years and more than the combined total of the two largest - New York and Los Angeles. More than 50 people were shot and 11 killed over the long Christmas weekend alone as some gangs sought out and shot rivals gathering at holiday parties, police said. There are more than 150,000 street-gang members in Chicago , though many aren\u2019t active, according to the non-governmental Chicago Crime Commission. The Hobos trial was considered so significant because so many purported gang leaders were on trial simultaneously, and also because of how prosecutors portrayed the Hobos as uniquely brazen and vicious. U.S. attorneys in Chicago have said for years that dismantling gangs was a key to reducing violence. They used racketeering laws to convict other gang bosses, including Latin Kings leader Augustin Zambrano in 2011. Racketeering laws enable prosecutors go after individuals, not necessarily for specific crimes, but for their leadership of groups that displayed patterns of illicit activity over years. ",

    "text": "GOP Leaders Ready To Pivot From 'Do-Nothing' To Doing A Lot In 2017 It was likely Obama's last visit to the Capitol before the inauguration of his successor. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama told the lawmakers he wished he were in their place. \"The word he used was 'envy,' \" Earnest said, \"for the opportunity they have\" to fight GOP repeal efforts. Pence told reporters that Trump will sign executive orders on his first day in office to begin implementing the repeal of Obamacare, saying it was \"the first order of business.\" The incoming administration, Pence said, is working right now on \"a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place even as the Congress appropriately debates alternatives to and replacement of Obamacare.\" He did not offer any specifics on what those orders would entail. He said Republicans will be taking a \"two-track approach\" with a combination of executive and legislative actions. Article continues after sponsorship Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by fellow congressional Democrats, brands what Republicans are trying to do when it comes to health care as \"Make America Sick Again.\" Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined by fellow congressional Democrats, brands what Republicans are trying to do when it comes to health care as \"Make America Sick Again.\" Evan Vucci/AP The new leader of Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer of New York, said GOP lawmakers seek \"to rip health care away from millions\" of Americans, \"which will create chaos.\" In his short, prepared statement, he repeated the word \"chaos\" four times. Schumer said Democrats in both the House and the Senate are united in their opposition to Republican attempts to \"make America sick again.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said Republicans asserted, however, that there would be \"an orderly transition, so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families,\" which he said are currently \"struggling\" under Obamacare. But replace it with what? Ryan offered no specifics, except to insist Republicans do \"have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it.\" But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, addressing reporters after hearing from Obama, said Republicans don't have the votes for a replacement plan. Pelosi blasted an approach that some Republicans have discussed, that would repeal the ACA but delay its effect to give lawmakers time to come up with a replacement. She called the strategy \"an act of cowardice.\" Trump himself weighed in today via his preferred method of communicating, tweeting that \"Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster\" and \"Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.\" He warned that \"massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess.

    "text": "Charles Manson's Cult Left 7 Dead and Killed a Dream, Too By john rogers and scott smith, associated press LOS ANGELES \u0097 Jan 4, 2017, 7:05 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Jane Doe Found Near Manson Killings Identified 0 Shares Email The seven grisly murders carried out by Charles Manson's disciples during the summer of 1969 did more than turn the hippie cult leader into the leering face of evil on front pages across America. To many, the bloodbath exposed the scary underside of the counterculture movement and seemed to mark the end of the peace-and-love era that burst upon the country just two years earlier during San Francisco's Summer of Love. \"The 'Summer of Love' was more a media event than anything else,\" Todd Gitlin, one of the nation's foremost historians of the 1960s, told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. \"But if hippie paradise was a myth, it was a myth that a lot of people believed in. Manson damaged it gravely.\" On Wednesday, Manson, now a grizzled, shuffling 82-year-old, lay hospitalized with an undisclosed illness after being taken from California's Corcoran State Prison, where he was serving a life sentence, according to news reports that correction officials would not confirm, citing privacy laws. His reappearance in the news conjured a turbulent period in U.S. history when the country seemed to be coming apart at the seams. A petty criminal who had been in and out of jail since childhood, Manson reinvented himself during the Summer of Love as a long-haired, Christ-like guru spouting Bible verses and Beatles lyrics. After attracting a few dozen followers from San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, many of them young women, runaways or other lost souls, he took them to an old movie ranch on the edge of Los Angeles that he transformed into a commune of sex, drugs and music. On Aug. 9 and 10, 1969, he sent some of his devotees out on a murderous mission to two of Los Angeles' wealthiest neighborhoods, where they killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate , several of her society friends and others. Most of the victims, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger, were stabbed. Tate's husband, Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski, was out of the country at the time. Authorities would learn that Manson had hoped the killings would touch off a race war. He had apparently gotten the idea from a twisted reading of the hard-rocking Beatles song \"Helter Skelter.\" The slayings shocked the country with their savagery. Messages like \"Pigs\" and a misspelled \"Healter Skelter\" were scrawled in the victims' blood on their walls and doors, and the city was paralyzed in fear. Residents of Los Angeles' nearby Laurel Canyon neighborhood, then a haven for musicians, began locking their doors. The youngest member of the original Manson Family, Leslie Van Houten, a teenage runaway and former homecoming princess from a Los Angeles suburb, said he had brainwashed her and others with sex, LSD, constant readings from the Bible, repeated playings of the Beatles ' \"White Album\" and rambling lectures about triggering a revolution. Like other surviving followers who took part in the killings, Van Houten is serving a life sentence for murder. A parole board recommended her release last year but was overruled by Gov. Jerry Brown. Another Manson Family member, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, was never charged in the so-called Tate-La Bianca murders but went to prison later for trying to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975. Fromme, whose gun didn't fire, was paroled in 2009 after 34 years behind bars. After Manson and his followers were caught, the nation got a front-page look at his piercing, demonic stare and the Nazi swastika he carved into his forehead during his trial. The killings \u2014 along with a deadly stabbing in December 1969 at a free concert headlined by the Rolling Stones at the Altamont Speedway outside San Francisco \u2014 contributed to the sense that the era of peace and love that seemed to reach a high point at Woodstock in the summer of 1969 was over, the dream turned into a nightmare. But in her book \"The White Album,\" writer Joan Didion indicated people living in Los Angeles at that time shouldn't have been that surprised. \"This mystical flirtation with the idea of 'sin' \u2014 this sense that it was possible to go 'too far,' and that many people were doing it \u2014 was very much with us in Los Angeles in 1968 and 1969,\" she wrote. \"A demented and seductive vortical tension was building in the community. The jitters were setting in.\" During a 2013 Rolling Stone interview, Manson had seemingly lost none of his attitude \u2014 \"If I can touch you, I can kill you,\" he told reporter Erik Hedegaard \u2014 but did not appear to be aging well. \"He's an old man with a nice head of gray hair but bad hearing, bad lungs, and chipped-and-fractured, prison-dispensed bad dentures,\" Hedegaard wrote, adding that Manson shuffled when he walked and used a cane. 0 Shares ",

Trump said on Twitter it had been delayed till Friday; U.S. intelligence officials and other Obama administration officials say it was always scheduled for Friday. A senior U.S. intelligence official who was not towing the official line told NBC News the Trump transition team was told it would happen \"early this week,\" which might explain the confusion. But Sean Spicer, Trump's spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday it would be \"later this week.\" All of which would seem to add up to a mundane dispute, but the fact that it is playing out in public represents an what is shaping up to be extraordinary breach between Trump and the intelligence agencies he is poised to lead--one that threatens to expose rifts between Trump and Congressional Republicans. In addition to the flap over the briefing, Trump doubled down on his skewering of U.S. intelligence officers Wednesday, appearing to grant more credibility to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange than to American spy agencies. Julian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 \"Julian Assange said `a 14-year old could have hacked Podesta' \u2014 why was DNC so careless?\" Trump said on Twitter. \"Also said Russians did not give him the info!\" Trump was referring to Assange's dismissive comments about the U.S. conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking and leaking of Democratic information, including the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chief. Assange, who lives in the Ecuadoran embassy in London to avoid extradition over a sexual assault charge, is widely loathed within the American national security establishment.

The president-elect's tweet came as part of a series of 140-character missives that appeared to cast doubt on the findings of the CIA, the FBI and other agencies regarding Russian interference in the presidential election campaign. The hope among some American national security officials that Trump would eventually accept the conclusion of the intelligence community on the matter has so far not been realized. Many intelligence officials have been concerned about Trump's skepticism regarding the Russia hack intelligence for some time. But several current and former officials told NBC News they believed Trump's stance was mainly driven by his fear that a finding of Russian interference in the election would impugn or undermine his victory \u2014 and they understood that.

They find it hard to believe that Trump's foreign policy advisers, including retired Gen. James Mattis and Rep. Mike Pompeo, will not accept the intelligence case that Russia was behind the hacks and leaks. Not only have the CIA, the FBI, the ODNI and DHS fingered the Russians, many private cyber security researchers have as well. But Trump hasn't come around \u2014 he has continued to voice expressions of skepticism, as have some of his allies in Congress. A Trump tweet reminding people about the mistaken conclusion that Saddam Hussein's Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction was seen as a mean-spirited swipe. Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters Wednesday that Trump has merely been expressing \"healthy skepticism\" about the intelligence. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 But intelligence officials are increasingly disturbed by Trump's approach. There are many Republicans in the spy agencies and a lot of Trump supporters, but there are few if any who support Julian Assange. To be sure, some spies are also concerned that the front offices of their agencies, run at the moment by Obama appointees, are playing politics and attacking Trump in anonymous press leaks. But most intelligence officers work in a world far from D.C. politics. They realize that Trump will soon be their elected leader, and that their job is to provide him the best intelligence they can to help him make good decisions, current and former officials say. Some of those people worry their work could become less relevant when Trump takes office. The CIA, in particular, likes to think of itself as serving the president above all, and CIA officers become very concerned about any notion that the White House does not trust or does not value the agency's work. Democrats who help oversee the intelligence agencies pounced on Trump's latest comments. \"Today, Trump sided with Julian Assange - an alleged sex offender who has hidden out in the Ecuadorian embassy for years and has dumped millions of classified State Department documents that put U.S. persons at risk \u2014 rather than our country's own intelligence professionals,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"That he would accept the transparently self-serving denials of the Kremlin is alarming enough, but that would now cite people like Assange who have demonstrated universal hostility to the United States and its interests takes him into new and even more treacherous territory.\" Schiff said that when Trump \"belittles the reputation of the brave and hard-working professionals in the Intelligence Community, he impairs our national security and the prospects for the success of his own Administration.\" Other Republicans were quick to bash Assange on Wednesday, even as Trump was quoting him. House Speaker Paul Ryan told MSNBC analyst Hugh Hewitt on his radio show that \"I think the guy is a sycophant for Russia\u2026He leaks, he steals data and compromises national security.\" And Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who served as an undercover officer in the CIA for nine years, added, \"Julian Assange is not a credible source\u2026 The same people who condemned Secretary Clinton for making sensitive and classified information vulnerable by using an unsecure server, should be equally outraged that Assange continues to carelessly leak sensitive documents.\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC: \"I have a lot more faith in our intelligence officers serving around the world and the very smart and experienced analysts that we have here in the nation's capital than I do in people like Julian Assange, I can tell you that much.\" A spokesman for Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the committee, declined to comment. Ken Dilanian ",

    "text": "Father denies video of toddler pushing dresser off twin brother was staged Published               January 04, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A Utah man said Wednesday that a nannycam video showing his 2-year-old son lifting a fallen dresser off his twin brother was legitmate after Internet skeptics claimed the harrowing incident was staged.\u00a0 \"I'm not sure how they would be able to think that it was a stunt after watching the full video,\" Ricky Shoff told FoxNews.com. \"It's obvious there isn't any editing to the video and to put my sons in a position where the dresser does fall on them on purpose is a horrible thought. How would you even stage that even if we were professionals with experience in such?\" CAUGHT ON VIDEO: 2-YEAR-OLD BOY PUSHES DRESSER OFF TWIN BROTHER STUCK UNDERNEATH In the video, which Shoff posted on YouTube over the weekend, twins Brock and Bowdy Shoff are seen\u00a0opening various dresser drawers and trying to climb up on the furniture. The dresser tipped over, trapping Brock underneath. Bowdy eventually managed to push the dresser off his brother.\u00a0 According to the New York Post, skeptics have pointed out that Ricky Shoff works for the company that sells the nannycam that recorded the incident. They also note that the dresser was empty at the time the twins were playing near it, and that the nannycam was pointed toward the dresser and not the twins' bed.\u00a0 When Ricky Shoff posted the video, he wrote on Facebook that he was \"a little hesitant to post this. But I feel it\u2019s not only to bring awareness, but it\u2019s also incredible. \"We are so grateful for the bond that these twin brothers share.\" FoxNews.com's Diana Falzone contributed to this report.

    "text": "Donald Trump, citing Julian Assange, again mocks intelligence officials\u2019 case for Russian hacking Donald Trump President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Wednesday in Palm Beach, Fla. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Wednesday in Palm Beach, Fla. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Noah Bierman and Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Despite Donald Trump \u2019s repeated calls for Americans to \u201cmove on\u201d from Russia\u2019s provocative cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential election, it won\u2019t be so easy \u2014 partly because the president-elect refuses to move on. Trump launched another barrage of mockery at\u00a0U.S. spy agencies Wednesday and aligned himself with Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks, a secretive group that has published millions of stolen U.S. military, diplomatic and intelligence documents. The odd alliance emerged as Congress plans its first hearing Thursday on the Russian election hacks and as U.S. intelligence officials scramble to craft a\u00a0convincing case for the skeptical president-elect and the public\u00a0that Russian intelligence agencies interfered with the election by stealing and leaking emails to WikiLeaks and other websites. On Friday, several top intelligence officials, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper , CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James B. Comey, are scheduled to meet with Trump in New York City to explain why they\u2019ve concluded that senior officials in the Kremlin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , authorized the hacking operation. Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s spokesman, said Wednesday that Trump questions U.S. officials\u2019 judgments about Russian interference in the campaign, and not the intelligence itself. \u201cWhat he wants to hear from them is, how does the raw intelligence justify the conclusion that is being presented?\u201d Spicer said. The intelligence officials also will brief Trump on the broader review that President Obama recently requested on Russian and Chinese hacks during the 2008, 2012 and 2016 U.S. elections and what was learned from those intrusions, two U.S. officials said. They said the classified report is nearly done and may be given to Obama on Thursday. The president\u00a0ordered it completed before he leaves office on Jan. 20 to ensure a full record is available, aides have said. Senior intelligence officials are grappling with how much of the report to make public without exposing sensitive surveillance systems and intelligence assets. They already have blamed two Russian spy services, the GRU and the FSB, for organizing the theft and release of sensitive emails last summer and fall, but haven\u2019t said exactly how they know. \u201cThere\u2019s no debate in the U.S. administration about the fact \u2014 and it is a fact \u2014 that Russia interfered in our democratic election,\u201d a senior U.S. official told reporters in a recent briefing on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe\u2019ve established that clearly to our satisfaction.\u201d New details may emerge Thursday when several of the nation\u2019s top spies \u2014 including Clapper and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, head of the National Security Agency \u2014 testify at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Russian hacks, the first since the November election. The committee chairman, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and many others in Congress are perplexed by Trump\u2019s deriding of the intelligence and by his praise for Putin, who has denied any Russian interference in the U.S. election. \u201cThis was done by the Russians, and I hope by Friday Mr. Trump will come to that realization,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the committee, told CNN. Trump\u2019s open disdain for U.S. intelligence judgments\u00a0has grown in recent weeks after the CIA and others concluded Russian leaders orchestrated the release of thousands of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton \u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta , to tip the election in Trump\u2019s favor. He has belittled the conclusions, comparing them to the CIA\u2019s inaccurate claims of Saddam Hussein\u2019s stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. And he questioned the motives of top intelligence officials, complaining Tuesday on Twitter that his briefing \u201con so-called \u2018Russian hacking\u2019 was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\u201d U.S. officials say the briefing was always scheduled for the end of the week, and was not delayed, to take advantage of the classified report prepared for Obama. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted praise for Assange for denying that Russians had provided the stolen emails to WikiLeaks. \u201cRussians did not give him the info!\u201d and \u201ca 14 year old could have hacked Podesta,\" Trump wrote, paraphrasing Assange. Assange made the claim to Fox \u00a0News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired Tuesday.\u00a0Hannity, Trump's biggest supporter in the media, flew to London to meet\u00a0Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has lived in exile for more than four years. \u201cOur source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party,\u201d Assange told Hannity. Assange didn\u2019t address whether Russian authorities conducted the original hacking\u00a0or how he knows Russian authorities were not behind the leaks. Assange remains in exile in the London embassy because he faces sexual assault allegations in Sweden. U.S.\u00a0officials have said Assange is under criminal investigation. The White House challenged Trump for aligning himself with a figure whom many in the U.S. intelligence community consider a threat to national security. \u201cThe president-elect will have to determine who he's going to believe,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cOn one hand, you've got the Russians and the aforementioned Mr. Assange. On the other side, you've got the 17 intelligence agencies of the United States government [and] outside cyber experts that have taken a look at this situation.\u201d Some Democrats all but accused Trump of supporting an enemy of the United States. \u201cThat he would accept the transparently self-serving denials of the Kremlin is alarming enough, but that would now cite people like Assange who have demonstrated universal hostility to the United States and its interests takes him into new and even more treacherous territory,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff of Burbank, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. U.S. intelligence analysts and cybersecurity experts concluded that the Podesta hack was part of a massive\u00a0\u201cspear-phishing\u201d operation that targeted more than 1,000 American politicians, academics and journalists and contained hallmarks of a Russian hacking ring working\u00a0at the behest of the government in Moscow.\u00a0 On Friday, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security released a report outlining some of the evidence pointing to Russia\u2019s role in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and on Clinton\u2019s campaign. At the same time, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats suspected of spying and the closing of two Russian-owned waterfront estates, on Long Island in New York and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, long used by Russian diplomats and believed to be\u00a0harboring spies, in direct response to the cyberattacks. On Wednesday, the State Department said that all 35 Russians had left the country by Sunday with their family members. Many of the children of the expelled officials were invited to the Kremlin\u2019s New Year\u2019s\u00a0 and Christmas parties when they arrived in Moscow on Monday, according to the official Tass news agency.

    "text": "Mexican Official Who Helped Arrange Trump Visit Returns to High Office By Ben Gittleson Jan 4, 2017, 4:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Mexican President Defends Trump Meeting, Accidentally Creates 'Hillary Trump' Trending Topic 0 Shares Email In a stunning reversal, Mexico's president said today that an official who resigned four months ago in the wake of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump 's visit to Mexico would now head the country's secretary of foreign affairs. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced that Luis Videgaray, who stepped down as finance secretary after helping set up a controversial meeting between Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto last year, would rejoin the government in a role crucial to the future of the U.S.-Mexico relationship. While Videgaray's ties to Trump's team were considered a liability before Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November -- Trump has been widely unpopular there -- his connections could prove useful to Mexican leadership jittery over Trump's pronouncements on immigration, a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and trade between the two neighbors. Pe\u00f1a Nieto today assigned Videgaray to working with Trump's administration, which takes office Jan. 20. Donald Trump and Mexican President Trade Barbs Over Money for Border Wall Trump's visit to Mexico City in August resulted in significant blow-back for Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who appeared at a joint press conference with Trump following a bilateral meeting. That day, Trump said the two did not discuss who would pay for his promised border wall -- he had frequently said during this campaign that Mexico would foot the bill. After not challenging Trump during their appearance together, Pe\u00f1a Nieto soon after took to Twitter to claim he told Trump Mexico would not pay. Videgaray, a longtime aide to Pe\u00f1a Nieto who helped arrange the meeting, resigned soon afterward. After Videgaray stepped down, Trump praised him in a tweet . \"Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe\u00f1a Nieto,\" Trump said at the time. \"With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted [sic.],\" Trump tweeted of Videgaray, a former investment banker.

    "text": "<p>This Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2016 photo provided by the Aiken County Detention Center, S.C., shows South Carolina Rep. Chris Corley, who authorities said  attacked his wife in their Graniteville home.</p> Close AP COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A South Carolina legislator accused of beating his wife was indicted Wednesday on charges that could net him up to 25 years in prison. An Aiken County grand jury indicted Rep. Chris Corley on felony charges of domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature and pointing a firearm, said state Attorney General Alan Wilson. The domestic violence charge alone can bring a maximum sentence of 20 years. The Graniteville Republican, who a year ago suggested his GOP colleagues should seek forgiveness for their sins, was arrested last week on a lesser charge: first-degree domestic violence, which carries up to 10 years. In a 911 call from Corley\u2019s home, young children could be heard screaming in the background. In the call to Aiken city police, no one talks to the operator but \u201cplease stop\u201d can be heard repeatedly in the audio released Friday by the Aiken County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cJust stop daddy. Just stop. ... Daddy, why are you doing this?\u201d Corley\u2019s wife can also be heard: \u201cChris, please stop.\u201d That prompted the dispatcher to call Aiken County 911. \u201cI had a caller, sounded a lot like children screaming for help and begging for their father to stop,\u201d the operator said. Wilson\u2019s office says Solicitor Strom Thurmond Jr. asked Wilson to take the case. Corley, an attorney, hasn\u2019t returned messages from The Associated Press. His attorney declined to give reporters his name at Corley\u2019s bond hearing last week. A judge barred Corley from contacting his wife and handling a gun. Corley\u2019s wife told deputies he stopped hitting her late Dec. 26 only after noticing she was bleeding and hearing the screams of two of their three children, ages 2 and 8. Corley said his wife tried to punch him after accusing him of cheating, and the police report noted a scratch on his forehead. House Speaker Jay Lucas suspended Corley soon after Wilson announced the indictment, effective immediately. That means he can\u2019t attend meetings, perform any other legislative duties or get legislative pay. State law requires the suspension of officeholders indicted on a felony charge. He will remain suspended until he\u2019s either cleared or must vacate his office. The 36-year-old Republican was easily re-elected to a second term last month with no opposition. Corley\u2019s mother-in-law also called 911. In the later call, she asks for deputies to be sent to the home of a man threatening to kill himself. The dispatcher says deputies are already on the way for \u201csome type of disturbance where the father is beating children?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d she responds. \u201cHe beat his wife and he\u2019s threatening to kill himself.\u201d\u00a0 Deputies can be seen in a dash cam video driving to the home where the incident occurred,\u00a0 CBS Charleston affiliate WCSC reported. Deputies also question dispatch about the firearm police Corley reportedly had. \u00a0 The police report says Corley\u2019s wife ran with the children to her mother\u2019s house across the street when he went to the bedroom. Corley may be best known in the House as a staunch defender of the Confederate flag.\u00a0 Rep. Christopher Corley, R- Aiken, shows his frustration by waving a white flag of surrender during debate over a Senate bill calling for the Confederate flag to be removed from the Capitol grounds  Wednesday, July 8, 2015, in Columbia, S.C.\u00a0 Close AP During the 2015 debate on whether to remove the flag from Statehouse grounds, Corley suggested replacing it with the white flag of surrender and held up a piece of paper taped to a pencil to illustrate his point. The debate followed the June 2015 massacre of nine black parishioners in a Charleston church by a white man seen in photos brandishing the rebel banner. In his Christmas card to House Republicans months later, he told his colleagues they lacked morals for voting to take down the flag. The card suggested Republicans \u201cask for forgiveness of all your sins such as betrayal.\u201d It began, \u201cMay your Christmas be filled with memories of a happier time when South Carolina\u2019s leaders possessed morals, convictions and the principles to stand for what is right.\u201d Corley called it a joke in his smart-aleck style. Democrats got a card with a photo of his children. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

The House Ethics Committee, which has an equal number of Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0lawmakers, will oversee the plan. Outside watchdogs, who helped mobilize a flurry of angry constituent calls to lawmakers this week to protect the independent ethics office, say they are readying for more battles over the future of the office, known as OCE. \u201cGroups will fight very hard in the next round to prevent the OCE from being neutralized,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, one of the independent groups that sounded alarms about House Republicans\u2019 actions. The House first created OCE in 2008 to address criticism that lawmakers on the House Ethics Committee had done\u00a0little to address congressional wrongdoing after a series of high-profile corruption cases landed\u00a0three House members to prison. But lawmakers in both parties often criticize\u00a0the independent watchdog, which investigates complaints against House members and their aides and has publicly released the results of their probes, even over the objection of the Ethics Committee. Member anger helped drive the House GOP to take a closed-door vote Monday night to strip the OCE of some of its powers and subject it to \u201coversight\u201d by the lawmakers on the ethics panel. By early Tuesday afternoon, House Republicans had reversed course \u2014 following public outcry and a pair of tweets from President-elect Donald Trump, who questioned whether weakening an ethics watchdog should be the first order of business for the new Congress.

Bruce Rauner, seen here at a luncheon in Chicago on Dec. 2, 2016, will not be attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Gov. Bruce Rauner, seen here at a luncheon in Chicago on Dec. 2, 2016, will not be attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner will not attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. Inaugurations typically are opportunities for members of the winning party to celebrate claiming the White House while hobnobbing and raising money for campaigns. But Rauner, already in campaign mode for his 2018 re-election bid, has been consumed with a battle here at home as he tries to sway public opinion in his corner during a prolonged budget stalemate with Democrats who control the General Assembly. In addition, Trump takes the oath Jan. 20, and Rauner has a State of the State speech scheduled in Springfield five days later. \"The governor is 100 percent focused on Illinois including passing a truly balanced budget and changing our broken political system,\" Rauner's office said Wednesday about the decision to skip the festivities. The governor spent much of last year declining to talk about Trump. As the GOP presidential primary season played out, Rauner pledged to support the party's nominee. Rauner also said he was \"horrified\" by the rhetoric of the campaign. Bruce Rauner praised President-elect Donald Trump 's choice for education secretary Thursday, saying the Michigan billionaire and school voucher proponent is \"a very talented and very passionate education advocate.\" Betsy DeVos , whose husband is an heir to the Amway fortune, was named... Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner praised President-elect Donald Trump 's choice for education secretary Thursday, saying the Michigan billionaire and school voucher proponent is \"a very talented and very passionate education advocate.\" Betsy DeVos , whose husband is an heir to the Amway fortune, was named... (Kim Geiger) Rauner steered clear of a Trump appearance in July in Chicago, having a news conference of his own down the street at the Thompson Center while Trump was raising money at his eponymous hotel. Rauner also skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland when Trump accepted the party's presidential nomination. Since the November election, Rauner has warmed a bit to the president-elect, praising Trump's choice of education secretary and predicting that he will have a \"good relationship\" with the new administration. Still, after the two spoke by phone in the days after the election, Rauner avoided even referring to Trump by name when he recalled that conversation to reporters. Like Trump, Rauner was a political novice when he won the governorship in 2014 after waging a campaign that drew heavily on his background as a successful businessman. But the governor has tried to avoid comparisons between himself and the president-elect. Even when relating his conversation with Trump, Rauner made a point of saying he'd \"never spoken with him before,\" and instead emphasized that he has relationships with unnamed people within the Trump administration.

By Adam Taylor January 4 at 4:05 PM Follow @mradamtaylor Workers clean the exterior of skyscraper Shanghai Tower at the financial district in Shanghai, China. (Aly Song/Reuters) SHANGHAI \u2014 Elevator rides are not usually worth documenting. But when you step into the elevator at Shanghai Tower, people often pull out their cameras. As the doors close, a screen at the elevator\u2019s front lights up to show you the car\u2019s location as it rises toward the building\u2019s newly opened observation deck. A neatly dressed attendant informs passengers that the elevator has now reached a top speed of 18\u00a0meters per second, approximately 40 mph. \u201cThis is really fast,\u201d one passenger said during a recent packed ride up the tower. It is, in fact, the fastest elevator in the world. At a ceremony in Tokyo in early December, the Shanghai Tower elevators and the company that made them, Mitsubishi Electric, were officially awarded the title by Guinness World Records. Yet many passengers may not even experience the top speed. To do so, you have to travel in a souped-up elevator car with a Mitsubishi technician who can flick a switch, making the speedometer on the screen turn red: 20.5\u00a0meters per second (45.8 mph). China is experiencing an elevator boom. Over the past decade, the vast majority of elevators installed around the world have been placed in China, where rapid urbanization has met with a desire for ambitious \u201csuper-tall\u201d skyscrapers. It has been estimated that by 2020, 40\u00a0percent of all elevators will be in China. And when it comes to speed, the rest of the world can\u2019t keep up. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the only skyscraper in the world taller than Shanghai Tower, but its elevators go at barely half the speed. The fastest elevator in the West, installed at 1\u00a0World Trade Center in Manhattan, runs at a paltry 23\u00a0mph. The Shanghai Tower\u2019s elevator goes even faster than the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a Disney haunted-elevator amusement-park ride that hurls thrill-seekers at 39\u00a0mph. Look at a list of the world\u2019s fastest elevators now, and five out of the top\u00a010 are in China. But China\u2019s vast elevator market is slowing. As it slows, elevator companies are becoming more cutthroat \u2014 at every level. Companies such as Mitsubishi are in competition for huge contracts with companies from all over the world. Another Japanese elevator company, Hitachi, came close to winning the Shanghai Tower contract. It was awarded one in Guangzhou instead and then announced plans to beat Mitsubishi\u2019s speed with its own 44.7-mph elevators. In the end, Mitsubishi installed new hardware on one of the elevators in Shanghai Tower, snatching the record back from Hitachi shortly after it was lost. Mitsubishi representatives said that the demands of the client, a consortium with links to the Shanghai municipal government, had prompted the decision. \u201cFor Shanghai city, it\u2019s their pride,\u201d said Ko Tanaka, the former head of Mitsubishi\u2019s China business. \u201cThey must be number one.\u201d Workers work inside the Shanghai Tower, at the financial district in Shanghai in 2015. (Aly Song/Reuters) The race for speed The world\u2019s first safety elevator was installed by the American company Otis in 1857 in a hotel in New York City. It traveled five floors at a speed of less than half a mile per hour. According to Lee Gray, an associate professor of architecture at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, speeds improved as elevators moved from potentially explosive steam engines to more-efficient hydraulic systems and on to electric traction systems. Visiting Europeans were soon unnerved by the speed of the elevators across the Atlantic. \u201cThe Brits would visit the United States and they would say, \u2018God, why is it going so fast?\u2019 \u201d Gray said. For much of the 20th century, the fastest elevators were installed in American cities. Then the speed race moved to Asia. In 1978, Mitsubishi \u2014 inspired by Otis\u2019s record-breaking elevators in New York\u2019s Pan Am building, now known as the MetLife \u2014 installed an ultra-high-speed elevator in Tokyo\u2019s Sunshine\u00a060 building that reached 22.3\u00a0mph. Mitsubishi beat its own record in 1993 with a 28-mph elevator in the Yokohama Landmark Tower. In 2006, the record was broken by Toshiba\u2019s Taipei 101 project. Why Japanese firms have dominated high-speed elevators is a matter of debate. Some have reasoned that it is because of the technology shared with high-speed \u201cbullet\u201d trains , which Hitachi and Toshiba also make. Others have suggested that it may be because Japanese consumers are notorious for insisting upon smooth elevator rides. (Comfort and noise issues with ultra-fast elevators are considerable; the Pan Am building\u2019s elevators were infamous for \u201chowling.\u201d) What is certain is that these elevators can cost fantastic amounts of money. They need to be tested in enormous, custom-built towers. They have to be pressurized to make their rapid ascent comfortable. According to Mitsubishi, 40\u00a0people worked exclusively on the Shanghai Tower elevators. Mitsubishi and Hitachi would not say how much their elevators cost, but Jim Fortune, an American elevator consultant, estimated each installation at up to $3\u00a0million. It would be hard for any elevator company to make any profit on installing these showstopper elevators, Fortune suggested: \u201cIt\u2019s all for . . . bragging rights or to get that maintenance contract.\u201d Many in the elevator industry say that while the technology is impressive, faster speeds do not serve a real purpose. But high speeds may be valuable as marketing tools, turning elevators into unlikely tourist attractions. And in an industry with its ups and downs, publicity can be important. \u201cElevators are going to be weak in terms of business,\u201d said Atsuya Fujino, the chief technology officer in Hitachi\u2019s global elevator and escalator division. \u201cThe fastest elevator in the world is going to be a very strong sales point for the company.\u201d The three elevators installed by Mitsubishi Electric in the Shanghai Tower. The elevator on the right is the fastest in the world, capable of reaching 20.5 meters per second; around 45.8 miles per hour. (Courtesy of Mitsubishi Electric) China\u2019s elevator gold rush The elevator industry may have never been as unforgiving as it is now. Why? China. Over the past two decades, China has rapidly urbanized . To boost urban density, hundreds of thousands of elevators and escalators have been installed each year. There are now more than 4\u00a0million units in the country \u2014 more than four times the number in the United States. Just over a decade ago, there were barely 700,000. There has also been a focus on super-tall buildings \u2014 100\u00a0stories or more \u2014 in the Chinese market. In a country where there are more than 160\u00a0cities with a population larger than 1\u00a0million, such a building can help a faceless city stand out. \u201cThey want to build these signature buildings just so people would know where they are,\u201d Fortune said. Analysts say China accounts for 60 to 80\u00a0percent of new installations globally each year. No one else compares. The second-largest elevator market, India, is less than one-tenth the size. The rest of the world may not have noticed, but those in the elevator world say it has been a boom like no other. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in an incredibly historic time for China, for our industry, in this country,\u201d said Bill Johnson, head of the Finnish firm Kone\u2019s China division since 2004. \u201cI feel very fortunate, very lucky.\u201d But there is also a feeling that the glory days of the market are over \u2014 and that record-setting elevators such as those installed in Shanghai Tower may mark the end of an era. China\u2019s economic growth has slowed dramatically over recent years, dropping from more than 10\u00a0percent to 6.7\u00a0percent in the most recent quarter. A growing corporate debt problem and a much-feared real estate bubble \u2014 not to mention a potential trade war with the new U.S. administration \u2014 add even more risk. As demand for new elevators falls, major international firms have more manufacturing capacity than they can use. Meanwhile, low-end Chinese manufacturers are fighting their high-end international rivals for an increasingly small number of projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a brawl,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that.\u201d According to the Shanghai Elevator Trade Association, around 5\u00a0percent of smaller domestic elevator companies have already gone out of business. Even for international companies, it has been difficult. In September, Kone announced that it expected the market for new orders to drop by 5 to 10\u00a0percent over the next year. Its shares immediately fell by 3.5\u00a0percent. American giant Otis has admitted to dropping prices to stay competitive, eating into its profit margin. For Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi and Hitachi, the Chinese market is especially vital. These companies lack the international footprint many of their American and European peers have. And while they came to prominence during Japan\u2019s own elevator boom in the late 20th century, they now face a stagnating economy and a shrinking population at home. Going down Hitachi is still smarting over Mitsubishi\u2019s surprise speed-record victory. When it won the contract for the elevators at Guangzhou\u2019s CTF Finance Tower, Hitachi released a video showing its executives proudly proclaiming that they would take the record. \u201cI get tears in my eyes,\u201d Akihito Ando, a Hitachi sales supervisor, said in the video. Workers stand inside an elevator at Shanghai Tower in the city\u2019s financial district in 2013. (Eugene Hoshiko/AP) The elevators are now operating, although the tower is not yet open. At the site, some staff members grumble about their short-lived record, suggesting that they could also modify the technology to make their elevators run almost 50\u00a0mph and reclaim the crown. However, a Hitachi representative later said that there were no current plans to increase the elevator\u2019s speed. If they don\u2019t, when will the record next be beaten? Mitsubishi says that it has no plans to break its own record at present. Toshiba, which until recently held the record with the Taipei 101 Tower, said that it\u2019s not focusing on ultrahigh-speed elevators anymore. \u201cThe competition for speed is over,\u201d said Yoshinori Inoue, a communications representative for Toshiba. But there could yet be new challengers. Hyundai, a South Korean elevator manufacturer, has plans to begin testing 50\u00a0mph elevators. Canny Elevator, a Chinese company based just outside Shanghai, is building a 3,100-foot test tower that it says will be the tallest in the world. How much further the record can be pushed is unclear. One recent study suggested that 51.4\u00a0mph would probably be the limit before passengers get sick. Traveling down quickly is even more difficult: Go too fast and the body thinks it\u2019s falling. Elevators in both the Shanghai Tower and the CTF Finance Tower go down at 22.3\u00a0mph, close to the limit. Most importantly, even the most advanced elevator still needs a big building to go in. Right now it\u2019s unclear where such buildings will be. While many say that India could one day be the next China , Rizk Maidi, an analyst with German bank Berenberg, doubts it will ever be as ambitious. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a repeat of the Chinese boom,\u201d he said.

McCarthy was fired by Emanuel fired in late 2015 in the aftermath of the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and then-Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, hold a press conference at Chicago Police Headquarters on Tuesday, Nov. 24, 2015. McCarthy was fired by Emanuel fired in late 2015 in the aftermath of the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Mayor Rahm Emanuel opted Wednesday not to get into a war of words over former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy 's comments to \"60 Minutes\" that the Police Department is in crisis and the city in a \"state of lawlessness.\" McCarthy, who was fired by Emanuel in late 2015 in the aftermath of the release of the Laquan McDonald police shooting video that roiled the city, was featured prominently on a segment that aired Sunday on the CBS news show about Chicago's soaring homicide numbers. \"We're reaching a state of lawlessness. That's what's happening,\" McCarthy said on the program about the city's gun violence and what he said was a feeling among many rank-and-file police officers that the department wouldn't protect them if they were accused of wrongdoing. Asked about those criticisms, the mayor wouldn't take the bait. \"Look, Garry McCarthy, he served five years here in Chicago and I know he is moving on,\" Emanuel said while appearing with police Superintendent Eddie Johnson at a ceremony at police headquarters to highlight a group of newly promoted detectives, lieutenants and field training officers. \"My focus is on the future. ... My view is on making sure 2017 not only is not a repeat of 2016, shows that what happened in 2016 is not the Chicago I know and see,\" Emanuel said. The segment also asserted police officers aren't being proactive enough to combat crime, citing statistics that showed an 80 percent decline in street stops in 2016. Emanuel, who in fall 2015 said police had gone \"fetal\" because they feared getting in trouble for actions during arrests, didn't directly respond to that contention. ",

    "text": "Jan 4 2017, 3:11 pm ET The Hunt For Alien Megastructures Is On by Shannon Hall This artist's concept shows the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE spacecraft, in its orbit around Earth. NASA/JPL-Caltech Share advertisement Last year, a single star found fame. It consistently made headlines and even appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert.\" The star (often referred to as Tabby's star) is located 1,200 light-years away toward the constellation Cygnus and has been inexplicably flickering and fading by such large amounts that it cannot be easily explained by natural causes. One astronomer has speculated that it's encased within a vast alien megastructure , and although scientists have yet to solve that particular stellar mystery, they are continuing to scour the sky in search of these colossal construction projects \u2014 both within and beyond our home galaxy. Related: The 5 Biggest Questions About the Universe It might sound like science fiction, but as early as 1959 physicist Freeman Dyson surmised that all advanced civilizations \u2014 including ours \u2014 would eventually build one of these megastructures. He predicted that any civilization could wake up one day to discover that they had consumed all of the energy available on their home planet. At this point, each civilization would naturally look toward their stars, giant nuclear furnaces that release torrents of energy every second, for a solution. Unfortunately, only a sliver of that energy, in the form of light, will fall on any orbiting planet. Most is simply lost to space. So any advanced civilization would likely build a series of solar panels to envelope the star, almost like scaffolding around a church's dome, collecting every available scrap of the star's energy and beaming it back toward their home planet. Today these megastructures are better known as Dyson Spheres, and from an engineering perspective they sound pretty wild. It's true that a sphere which completely encloses a star is impractical (one asteroid strike or stellar flare and the entire shell would become unstable) \u2014 but a swarm of mirrors that orbit the star like bees buzzing around a hive, or a ring of mirrors that could look as majestic as the rings of Saturn are practical. They're so practical, in fact, that human beings already have most of the tools to build one. Play Is an Alien Megastructure Causing this Distant Star's Strange Behavior? 1:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170105165932if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/826022979572\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \"Nothing requires any major technological breakthroughs for this,\" says Stuart Armstrong, a research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute. In 2012, Armstrong proposed a simple scenario in which humanity could build a Dyson Sphere by mining Mercury for its materials. The process would ultimately destroy the innermost planet. Roughly half of Mercury's mass is oxygen and iron \u2014 elements that can be combined to form an iron oxide called hematite, which has been used to build mirrors since antiquity. So it would be relatively straightforward to mine Mercury for those materials, fabricate them into energy-collecting mirrors and jettison them into space. The solar power harnessed would then supply the power to continue mining the rocky planet \u2014 creating a positive loop that would allow us to strip more material with each passing year. Armstrong speculates that it would only take 30 years to tear Mercury to shreds and create a Dyson Sphere. \"We're on the edge of being able to expand across the universe ourselves,\" he says. Related: If Aliens Call, Does Humanity Have a Plan? Once we do, such a dramatic change in the solar system will easily be noticed by an alien observer. First, the distant Sun will grow dimmer as more and more solar panels cover it. Second, those panels will radiate waste heat, just like your computer grows warm when it's running, causing the Sun to glow more in the infrared. For this reason, not everyone thinks that Tabby's star is enshrouded within a Dyson Sphere. The visible dimming signature is odd and it doesn't show excess infrared light. \"It doesn't walk and talk like a Dyson Sphere,\" says Erik Zackrisson from Uppsala University in Sweden. But Tabby's star is only one star out of the 100 billion dotted across our galaxy. With plenty of other opportunities to find a Dyson Sphere, many astronomers have been on the hunt. In 2008, for example, Richard Carrigan, a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, combed through the data from 250,000 astronomical sources found by the IRAS infrared satellite. (Launched in 1983, IRAS was the first space telescope to image the entire night sky and infrared wavelengths.) His team found a few objects within several hundred light-years of Earth that emanated more heat than one might suspect. So he turned the SETI Institute's Allen Array toward it to listen for radio signals, but found none. Other studies too have come up empty-handed. An illustration of a Dyson swarm, a variation on the Dyson sphere made up of independent constructs that orbit in dense formation around a star. Vedexent under CC-BY-2.5 License You might think that that's the end of the line, but a few astronomers actually think we could see a civilization in another galaxy \u2014 assuming that it has colonized the breadth of it. The idea is that the energy-hungry civilization would expand beyond its planetary system, overtaking the galaxy and encapsulating most of its stars within Dyson Spheres. This would drastically alter the light we receive from the galaxy and render its inhabitants visible. \"That's actually a really wacky idea,\" says James Annis, an astronomer at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. \"There's no good reason to expect an intelligent species to cover every star in the galaxy or even 99 percent of the stars in the galaxy. But if they did it, it would be a markedly visible thing.\" So as early as the late-90s, Annis searched the skies for galaxies that are darkened by so many Dyson Spheres. He didn't find any. \"I personally think that although most intelligent species will try to get out of their solar system, it's not at all obvious that they will cover every star in the galaxy in an attempt to extract all the energy the galaxy has to offer,\" Annis says. There are other astrophysical objects that harbor far more energy than stars. Take, for example, the supermassive black hole sitting at the centers of most massive galaxies. When these ravenous black holes gobble down gas and dust, they blaze light in the process. \"You have an object that is the size of a solar system that is as bright as a whole galaxy,\" Zackrisson says. \"If you can build a Dyson Sphere around that, then you would have an enormous amount of energy at your disposal.\" Perhaps the best method in searching for extragalactic civilizations is to search for Dyson Spheres around supermassive black holes, or any high-energy astrophysical object. This is why Annis thinks Jason Wright's latest study is brilliant. Wright, of Penn State University, examined some 100,000 nearby large galaxies in the all-sky catalog from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Although WISE is similar to IRAS in that they both imaged the entire sky in the infrared, WISE did so with 1,000 times better sensitivity. Wright and his team looked for galaxies that were bright in the mid-infrared \u2014 the expected signature from heat-emitting Dyson Spheres \u2014 but didn't correlate that information with galaxies that were dim in the visible \u2014 meaning that these Dyson Spheres didn't have to enshroud stars, but could enshroud anything. They don't even have to be Dyson Spheres, just some alien-made object that emits excess heat. NASA's Kepler and Spitzer space telescopes suggest that its unusual light signals are likely from dusty comet fragments, which blocked the light of the star as they passed in front of it in 2011 and 2013. JPL-Caltech / NASA Unfortunately, Wright's team didn't find a single galaxy that contains any obvious signs of highly advanced technological civilizations. Before you jump to any conclusions about our cosmic loneliness, know that the hunt is far from over. Zackrisson is currently digging through the first release from the Gaia spacecraft, which was launched in 2013 in order to pinpoint the positions of one billion stars on the sky to an accuracy that's hundreds of times better than today's catalog. By comparing the distances calculated by Gaia and those calculated based on a star's brightness alone, Zackrisson will be able to find stars that appear darker than typical. He's already discovered a handful. Annis too has many ideas for future projects, including one where he'd like to look at each and every star within the Large Magellanic Cloud, the brightest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Related: Why Space Miner's Are the Universe's Future Tycoons Armstrong, on the other hand, is ready to conclude that most of the galaxies in the universe (if not all) are empty. He thinks that just as advanced civilizations can easily build Dyson Spheres, they can easily colonize their galaxies, traversing the voids between stars at nearly the speed of light, and even reaching other galaxies, making their way from one end of the universe to the other. If extraterrestrial life were abundant, we should have come face to face with it (or at least the probes they sent out) on multiple occasions. The fact that we haven't likely means extraterrestrial life doesn't exist. So while most astronomers remain agnostic about the question, even hopeful, Armstrong thinks that we just might be \"the last hope for life in the cosmos.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

NBC News Sen. Bernie Sanders haunted Donald Trump and Republicans with the ghost of Twitter past on Wednesday. The Vermont senator printed an oversized tweet of Trump's to use as a visual aid during the Senate's debate over the future of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act. The president-elect's tweet from May 2015 claimed that he was the only Republican candidate to \"to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.\" Trump punctuated the tweet with a jab at former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015 \"I think it is interesting that we listen to what Donald Trump said during the campaign,\" Sanders said on the floor of the chamber, as the giant tweet was revealed. \"That Democrats hear what he had to say during the campaign \u2014 what he campaigned on \u2014 and more importantly Republicans listen and hear what their leader had to say about these issues.\" Republicans are fighting to repeal the legislation, an act that the Urban Institute said in a recent study would cause 24 million people to lose their health care coverage. Sanders said that Trump must be held accountable for his campaign promises, as they are what allowed him to win the presidency. Related: Pence and Obama Kick Off Obamacare Battle on Capitol Hill \"This is what he asked millions of elderly people and working class people to vote for him on \u2014 these are the principles that Donald Trump ran and won the presidency on,\" Sanders said. Sanders said in an earlier press conference with Democrats that there were two possible realities for the president-elect: either Trump should be considered a liar or the real estate mogul must proclaim clearly that he will veto any legislation that would cut any of the three entitlement programs that he mentioned. \"If he makes that clear to his republican colleagues we can save us a whole lot of time and start getting to work doing what this country desperately needs to have done.\" Mike Casca, Sanders' outgoing communications director, had the job of carrying the giant placards through Capitol Hill, and earned a grin from former GOP presidential candidate Sen.

Eric Holder to defend against Trump Holder, leading a team of attorneys from the firm Covington & Burling, will cover potential conflicts between California and the federal government. \u00a0 \u00a0 Holder, leading a team of attorneys from the firm Covington & Burling, will cover potential conflicts between California and the federal government. \u00a0 Melanie Mason Contact Reporter Bracing for an adversarial relationship with President-elect Donald Trump , the California Legislature has selected\u00a0former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to serve as outside counsel to advise the state\u2019s legal strategy against the incoming administration. The unusual arrangement was announced as the Legislature returned to session on Wednesday, underscoring the extent to which the action in Sacramento in the coming months will be shaped by Trump\u2019s presidency. The agreement will give Holder, leading a team of attorneys from the firm Covington & Burling, a broad portfolio covering potential conflicts between California and the federal government.\u00a0Former Los Angeles Rep.\u00a0 Howard Berman , a Democrat who is now a senior advisor to the firm, will also be part of the effort. \u201c[Holder] will be our lead litigator, and he will have a legal team of expert lawyers on the issues of climate change, women and civil rights, the environment, immigration, voting rights \u2014 to name just a few,\u201d Senate leader\u00a0Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) said\u00a0in an interview. Agreement between California Legislature and Covington & Burling Open link Such a task typically falls to the state attorney general. On Tuesday, Gov. Jerry Brown formally nominated Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra to replace former Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who now serves in the U.S. Senate. Becerra, whose nomination hearings in the Legislature begin next week, is expected to be easily confirmed. A spokesman for Brown declined to weigh in on Holder\u2019s hiring on Wednesday. Becerra could not be reached for comment. De\u00a0Le\u00f3n and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon began contemplating hiring outside\u00a0legal counsel\u00a0for the Legislature\u00a0almost immediately after Trump\u2019s election, in hopes of protecting existing state policies that are\u00a0at odds with the president-elect\u2019s stated positions.\u00a0Legislators have already signaled an emphasis on\u00a0protecting people in the country illegally, proposing legal aid\u00a0in anticipation of stepped-up deportation action by Trump. They have also indicated that fights are on the horizon over expanded healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act and policies to combat climate change, two issues that mark a major departure from Trump\u2019s positions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhile we don\u2019t yet know the harmful proposals the next administration will put forward, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, cabinet appointments and Twitter feed, we do have an idea of what we will be dealing with,\u201d Rendon said in a statement. \u201cThe Covington team will be an important resource as we work with the governor and the attorney general to protect Californians,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Despite the efforts of the last three American presidents, North Korea has continued advancing as a nuclear state. Can Donald Trump rein in the rogue state any better? In a televised New Year\u2019s Day address to his nation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u00a0announced his resolve\u00a0to develop a missile... Despite the efforts of the last three American presidents, North Korea has continued advancing as a nuclear state. Can Donald Trump rein in the rogue state any better? In a televised New Year\u2019s Day address to his nation, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u00a0announced his resolve\u00a0to develop a missile... (Matt Stiles) The two legislative leaders have taken an unabashedly combative posture against Trump in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin. Rendon, in remarks last month at a\u00a0swearing-in ceremony for lawmakers, described the incoming administration as a \u201cmajor existential threat,\u201d and asserted \u201cCalifornians do not need healing. We need to fight.\u201d The incoming Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment. Republicans, who are outnumbered by Democratic supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature,\u00a0chafed at the announcement.\u00a0Assembly GOP leader Chad Mayes of Yucca Valley dismissed the hiring as a stunt. \u201cThis is a distraction from the very real problems facing everyday Californians. Donald Trump did not cause California\u2019s transportation crisis, nor did he play a role in our state\u2019s sky-high housing costs. Democrats should focus on solving these real-world problems instead of wasting tax-payer money to score political points before the president-elect even takes office,\u201d Mayes said in a statement. He\u00a0noted that Becerra, \u201cthe state\u2019s incoming Attorney General[,] has spent decades in Washington working on federal policies. It\u2019s not clear why legislative Democrats needed to hire a DC insider to litigate the exact same issues.\u201d De\u00a0Le\u00f3n said the additional counsel would offer \u201cmore legal firepower\u201d that would complement and bring additional heft\u00a0to the state attorney general\u2019s efforts. Bringing on outside\u00a0counsel is not unprecedented for the Legislature. The state Senate hired special\u00a0counsel for a select committee investigating price manipulation in the wholesale energy market by Enron in the early 2000s. The Senate also sought outside counsel to sort through the federal investigation of former Democratic\u00a0state\u00a0Sen. Ron Calderon , who later pleaded guilty to corruption charges. Updates from Sacramento \u00bb But it is far more unorthodox\u00a0for both houses to join together in retaining counsel in a preemptive bid to prepare for as-yet-unknown\u00a0litigation and policy-making at the federal level. Much of the arrangement remains murky, including how Holder\u2019s efforts will differ from\u00a0or align with Becerra\u2019s. Also unclear: the ultimate cost to the state. The initial contract, according to an engagement letter between the firm and the Legislature, totals $75,000 for three months, with the tab to be split between the two chambers\u2019 operating budgets. The agreement is capped at a maximum of 40 attorney hours per month. A protracted legal battle would likely require far more manpower and resources, raising questions as to how the arrangement would proceed in the event of lengthy litigation. The cost of additional attorneys can quickly add up under an aggressive legal strategy. In Texas, former state Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott \u2014 now governor \u2014 sued the Obama administration at a relentless pace, racking up nearly $2.6 million in costs to the state in less than three years, according to the Associated Press. Of that, $1 million\u00a0went to outside counsel and expert witnesses. Holder, who was a partner at Covington from 2001 to\u00a02009 before rejoining the firm in 2015, will direct the efforts from the firm\u2019s Washington, D.C., office. The firm, which has a long-established presence in the nation\u2019s capital, has in recent years expanded its footprint in California. Covington\u2019s Los Angeles office, which will play a major role in working with the Legislature, was launched in part\u00a0by former federal prosecutor\u00a0Dan Shallman, whose brother, John Shallman, is a prominent Democratic strategist whose clients include De\u00a0Le\u00f3n. \u201cI am honored that the legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal advisor as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California\u2019s residents and policy priorities,\u201d Holder said\u00a0in a statement provided by\u00a0De\u00a0Le\u00f3n\u2019s office. \u201cI am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource for the legislature.\u201d Holder, a close friend of President Obama, left the Justice Department in 2015.

The Answer Could Be in Their Teeth by Alex Johnson advertisement In the novel \" Jurassic Park ,\" Dr. Henry Wu is explaining how dinosaurs are born. \"The incubation period varies with each animal, but in general it runs about two months,\" he tells the book's hero, Dr. Alan Grant. Close, but no cigar, according to research published this week. Baby dinosaurs stayed as long as six months in their eggs before they hatched \u2014 and that could have contributed to their extinction. Umanoide Researchers said they think they've cracked the mystery of how long it took for dinosaurs to hatch in a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . And like modern-day forensic specialists, they found that answer in dental records. They looked at \"rings\" in the teeth of fossilized embryos from two dinosaur genera: Protoceratops andrewsi, a pig-size plant eater, and Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, a duck-billed 30-foot-long giant that roamed Canada and Montana tens of millions of years ago. \"These are the lines that are laid down when any animal's teeth develops,\" said Gregory Erickson, a professor of biological science at Florida State University, who led the research team. \"They're kind of like tree rings, but they're put down daily. We could literally count them to see how long each dinosaur had been developing.\" Protoceratops embryos took about three months to hatch, the data show, while Hypacrosaurus took half a year. \"We suspect our findings have implications for understanding why dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, whereas amphibians, birds, mammals and other reptiles made it through and prospered,\" Erickson said. That's because the longer dinosaurs needed to develop in their eggs, the longer they were defenseless against weather and natural disasters. Not to mention predators \u2014 like the Velociraptors depicted hatching in the movie version of \"Jurassic Park.\" For them, the eggs of their cousins were especially favored snacks. Alex Johnson ",

    "text": "advertisement A national Latino civil rights group faced off with Texas officials in a federal appeals court Wednesday over a controversial law that makes it a state felony to conceal undocumented immigrants from the authorities. The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard oral arguments in a case challenging sweeping immigration enforcement measures that were tucked in an omnibus bill that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year . Migrants at Sacred Heart Catholic Church's temporary shelter in McAllen, Texas, in 2014. Reuters The legislation notably doesn't directly target undocumented immigrants. Instead, key provisions single out anyone who \"encourages or induces a person to enter or remain in this country in violation of federal law by concealing, harboring, or shielding that person from detection.\" And to match those enforcement measures, Texas lawmakers created a new classification of state felony offenses that didn't exist before. But the Mexican American Legal Defense Educational Fund, or MALDEF, sued last year challenging those provisions, naming Abbott, members of the state Public Safety Commission and state Public Safety Director Steve McCraw as respondents. Opponents argue that the harboring measures are sweeping enough to include anyone who shelters or even rents housing to undocumented immigrants. Two of the named plaintiffs, in fact, are San Antonio landlords, David Cruz and Valentin Reyes, who say they don't ask potential tenants to prove their immigration statuses. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott at the Texas Republican Convention in Dallas in May. L.M. Otero / AP Also included are Johnathon Ryan, executive director of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, which provides housing and services to immigrants in south Texas; and the Bishop Enrique San Pedro Ozanam Center, a homeless shelter in Brownsville. In April, U.S. District Judge David Alan Ezra blocked the state from implementing the controversial measures. The enforcement measures have remained on hold while the state's appeal works its way through the courts. Texas' appeal brings the case before a three-judge panel in what is considered to be one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country. Related: Latinx Activists Ready to Expand, Focus Efforts After Inauguration MALDEF, a national civil rights advocacy organization, argues that the state enforcement measures are unconstitutional because the federal government, not the state, has ultimate authority over immigration law. Lawyers for Texas, however, contend that the state law addresses smuggling \u2014 not immigration. The state law, they said in written arguments, \"leaves control over entry, removal, and immigration status with the federal government.\" Work under way on a U.S. Customs and Border Protection temporary holding facility near the Donna-Rio Bravo International Bridge last month. Eric Gay / AP Not only that, they also say that none of the plaintiffs has legal standing to bring the case. Cruz and Valentin aren't renting to unauthorized immigrants in the first place, and even they were, they wouldn't be breaking the law, the state's lawyers argued. That's because the law doesn't forbid \"sheltering\" undocumented immigrants \u2014 it criminalizes intentionally \"concealing\" them \"from detection,\" they stressed. Likewise, RAICES and the Ozanam Center provide services, not concealment, the state said. In fact, \"prospective clients of RAICES line up and wait outside the doors, where they are easily visible to state and local law enforcement,\" it said. As a result, the \"plaintiffs are not engaged in prohibited conduct, and they face no plausible threat of prosecution,\" the state said. The broader law sets aside more than $800 million to tighten border security. Amanda Sakuma ",

Meanwhile, a storm could also spread a stripe of snow across the South, all the way from Texas to Virginia, from late Thursday into Saturday. In the West, \"the combination of storms through this weekend has the potential to bring the biggest amount of rain and mountain snow to California since the drought began several years ago,\" according to AccuWeather meteorologist Jim Andrews . Storm total has now reached 4.5 FEET! Taken by #squawvalley patroller Ivan M. this morning #mysquawalpine pic.twitter.com/99MOBoEqJE \u2014 Squaw Alpine (@squawalpine) January 4, 2017 Several feet of snow has already\u00a0fallen in the Sierra Nevada from one storm, and several more feet is on the way from a second, more intense storm that should hit over the weekend. One ski area, Squaw Alpine, has recorded 4.5 feet, according to its Twitter account. Another 10 to 15 feet of snow could bury portions of the Sierra over the next 10 days, according to WeatherBell meteorologist Ryan Maue. Enormous snow totals still modeled:  10-15+feet from warm, very moist series of Atmospheric Rivers down-spouting over Sierra \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) January 4, 2017 Closer to the coast, heavy rain could lead to flooding, mudslides and debris flows in both the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas, the National Weather Service warned. The source of the heavy rain and snow in the West is what meteorologists call an \"atmospheric river,\" which acts like a fire hose to funnel\u00a0moisture from the tropical Pacific\u00a0toward California. These rivers transport huge amounts of water vapor \u2014 the gas form of liquid water \u2014 toward the West, where it's wrung out in the form of rain and snow, noted Mashable's Andrew Freedman . If one originates near Hawaii, it's\u00a0sometimes referred to the Pineapple Express. Southern snow?\u00a0 Any snow that falls in the South over the next few days will be measured in inches, not feet, but it doesn't take much to wreak traffic chaos there. After one round of snow Thursday in the Ohio Valley and Appalachians, more substantial snow could fall by Friday and Saturday in the South. According to AccuWeather, cities at greatest risk for some snow, a wintry mix or flash freeze Friday and Saturday include Jackson, Miss.; Birmingham, Ala.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, Winston-Salem and Raleigh, N.C.; and\u00a0Richmond, Va. \"The potential exists for difficult winter driving conditions in parts of the South beginning Friday,\" the Weather Channel said . In anticipation of delays or cancellations, Delta Airlines is allowing passengers to change flights without penalty in the Southeast.

Trump says his social media power key to victory Like Franklin Roosevelt did through radio and John F.

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) A 17-year-old was shot to death late Jan. 1, 2017,\u00a0by a DuPage County sheriff's deputy after the two got into a fight when the deputy responded to a domestic call. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) A DuPage County sheriff's deputy who fatally shot a 17-year-old while responding to a call of domestic violence Sunday near Villa Park has been place on paid administrative leave, the sheriff's office said Wednesday. In a one-sentence statement, the sheriff's office said the move was made \"per department policy.\" Trevon Johnson was shot to death after he and the deputy, who was not identified, got into a fight when the deputy responded to 911 calls about 11:30 p.m. from a home near Standish Lane and Ardmore Avenue, authorities said. Johnson died of multiple gunshot wounds, the DuPage County coroner's office said. The incident is being investigated by Illinois State Police. Chicago police officers. About two hours after the calendar flipped to 2017 on Sunday, an officer shot a man after a car chase on the Far South Side ended with the suspect... Less than two days into the new year, authorities already had opened investigations into two separate shootings of unarmed men by Chicago police officers. About two hours after the calendar flipped to 2017 on Sunday, an officer shot a man after a car chase on the Far South Side ended with the suspect... (Bill Ruthhart and Michael Hawthorne) The sheriff's office on Tuesday night released recordings of three 911 calls. In two of them, callers portray a scene at the house that is chaotic and violent. One caller said Johnson had \"knives\" and other weapons. \"He's destroying the whole house,\" the caller told a dispatcher, according to a Tribune review of the recording. \"He put his hands on me. He punched me in my head several, several times. He broke the glass table top in the dining room. He threw the Christmas tree into the TV. He needs, it's over \u2014 he needs to go to jail now.\" Later, the caller complained that police were taking too long to arrive. \"Ya'll need to come on! Where are you guys?\" the caller shouted as the dispatcher tried to offer reassurance that officers were responding as quickly as possible. \"Somebody could have been dead already!\" Meanwhile, another person in the home was on the line with a second dispatcher, saying that Johnson had a history of mental illness, and was holed up in an upstairs bedroom after threatening people inside the home with a large knife. \"He was picking up knives and glass and bottles and everything, throwing them,\" the second caller said, adding that Johnson was likely still armed with a knife, according to a review of the recording. 911 recordings prior to fatal police-involved shooting of Trevon Johnson Warning: The following 911 calls, made prior to the fatal police-involved shooting of Trevon Johnson, contain graphic language. Warning: The following 911 calls, made prior to the fatal police-involved shooting of Trevon Johnson, contain graphic language. See more videos But in a third tape, another caller downplayed the incident, telling a dispatcher that Johnson and another person had been fighting, but that Johnson had only been holding a butter knife. The first and second recordings capture the sound of a male voice ordering someone to drop something. Approximately 15 seconds later, the tapes captured the sound of a half-dozen gunshots, followed by distraught screams from someone in the house. Family members and their attorney dispute that Johnson was armed or that he fought with the deputy. Johnson's uncle, Alfonzo Singletary, said Wednesday that after listening to the second recording, he still wants to know how police could allege his nephew ever made contact with the deputy. \"His body was upstairs \u2014 he never made it downstairs to even have any contact with the officer,\" Singletary said. \"There is no way he could have had a fight with the officer.\" Scene of shooting Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Pastor Alfonzo Singletary, second from right, enters a home along with other family members on Jan. 3, 2017, where Trevon Johnson was shot and killed by a DuPage County sheriff's deputy a day earlier.

(Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) And, he said police did not recover a knife or other weapon from the scene. \"Where is the weapon? That's the millions dollar question: If he had a weapon, where is it?\" The sheriff's office did not return a call Wednesday from the Tribune requesting more information. State police are investigating the shooting at the request of DuPage County officials. Master Sgt. Matt Boerwinkle, a state police spokesman, declined Wednesday to provide details about where Johnson was in relation to the officer when the shooting occurred. He said that the agency's investigation was \"progressing quickly\" but that it was unclear when it would be complete. Singletary said funeral services for Johnson were expected to be held Jan. 14. mwalberg@chicagotribune.com ",

By Mike DeBonis January 4 at 7:21 PM Follow @mikedebonis A House panel formed by Republicans to investigate the procurement of human fetal tissue for medical research has recommended stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood, heralding a new congressional assault on the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortions and women\u2019s health care. The GOP majority on the Select Investigative Panel included the recommendation in the 471-page final report , which was issued Tuesday on the dissolution of the panel. It was formed in 2015 after antiabortion activists recorded a series of undercover videos that they said documented abuses by abortion providers and intermediaries that provide fetal tissue to researchers. Over strong objections from Democrats, medical groups and abortion rights supporters, Republicans issued subpoenas to dozens of clinics, procurement firms and research institutions. Their final report suggests that some clinics and firms are illegally profiting from fetal-tissue transactions and that their business arrangements could create an incentive to perform more abortions. [Dozens of groups targeted as House fetal-tissue probe accelerates] While GOP panel members denied targeting Planned Parenthood as they conducted their investigation, the report closely scrutinizes several of the organization\u2019s affiliates, accusing them of \u201ccareless management\u201d and \u201ca general disinterest in clinical integrity.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that this is going to provide the information that is necessary for action to be taken,\u201d Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the panel\u2019s chairwoman, said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cThis will be a Congress and an administration that will be known for standing for the women, for the protection of unborn children, and the protection of life.\u201d The panel\u2019s Democrats preemptively blasted the findings in a 114-page report of their own, released in December, that challenged the Republicans\u2019 key claims. They criticized the GOP members\u2019 \u201cMcCarthy-era tactics,\u201d accused them of relying on \u201cunsourced, unverified documents\u201d and argued that there is \u201cno legitimate basis\u201d to strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood\u2019s medical services. \u201cRepublicans spent nearly $1.6\u00a0million taxpayer dollars chasing inflammatory lies being peddled by antiabortion extremists,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), the panel\u2019s top Democrat, who said the body \u201cleaves behind a legacy of lies, intimidation and procedural misconduct.\u201d The panel has been sharply partisan from the outset: It was created on a party-line vote after some Republicans threatened a government shutdown unless Planned Parenthood was stripped of federal funding. Republicans have styled it as the \u201cSelect Panel on Infant Lives,\u201d while some Democrats preferred to call it the \u201cSelect Panel to Attack Women\u2019s Health.\u201d [In first hearing, GOP panel casts doubt on fetal-tissue research] One GOP recommendation is to ban federal funding for research on fetal tissue obtained through elective abortions while providing for the donation of miscarried fetuses for research through existing organ-donation programs. Another would have Congress direct the National Institutes of Health to develop new guidelines for the use of human fetal tissue. Other recommendations include having Congress \u201ctake appropriate measures\u201d to ensure that the Justice Department prosecute violations of the federal ban on profiting from the sale of fetal tissue and beefing up protections for \u201cborn-alive\u201d infants. But the most politically charged implications of the report are certain to surround Planned Parenthood, whose affiliates performed 324,000 abortions in 2014 among more than 9\u00a0million other discrete medical services. The group reported receiving $553\u00a0million in government funding that year, about half of its total revenue. Congress has barred federal funding for abortions since 1976, but health providers that offer abortions are eligible for Medicaid reimbursements and federal family-planning grants for other services. But antiabortion lawmakers have long challenged the notion of abortion providers getting federal funding of any sort. \u201cWhat we just want to do is just put that clear line there,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cIt is as simple as that: To be sure that [federal funds] are not going into abortion services.\u201d [Here\u2019s what happens if Congress ends funding for Planned Parenthood] Roughly 40 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding could be at risk with a Republican Congress willing to pass defunding legislation and an incoming Republican president willing to sign it. The panel\u2019s report stands to give antiabortion lawmakers a rallying point as they push to include that measure in a legislative package aimed at repealing President Obama\u2019s health-care reform law that is expected to pass this year. A Planned Parenthood executive on Wednesday called the GOP report \u201cnothing more than a partisan attack on Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s access to safe and legal abortion\u201d and noted that investigations in 13 states and by several other congressional committees found no wrongdoing. \u201cPlanned Parenthood has never profited while facilitating its patients\u2019 choice to donate fetal tissue for use in important medical research,\u201d said Dana Singiser, the organization\u2019s vice president for public policy and government affairs, who noted that only about 1\u00a0percent of its health centers offer the option to donate. Congress is not the only entity that Planned Parenthood and other organizations targeted by the panel have to be concerned about. Panel Republicans issued 15 referrals to federal and state law enforcement authorities over potential criminal violations, and Blackburn said she expects that the administration of President-elect Donald Trump will closely examine those. [GOP congresswoman meets with Trump as fetal-tissue investigation moves to a close] But it remains unclear how aggressive Trump will be regarding Planned Parenthood, an organization he has praised in the past, and whether he will push to defund it as part of his larger health-care plans. A bill repealing the Affordable Care Act that was vetoed by President Obama early last year included a provision targeting Planned Parenthood. Vice President-elect Mike Pence did not mention defunding the group when he went to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to discuss the GOP\u2019s health-care plans, according to several lawmakers. But Blackburn, a member of Trump\u2019s transition team, said she was confident he would sign defunding legislation. \u201cI truly think that Donald Trump is going to continue to speak on behalf of life and stand for life,\u201d she said.

    "text": "Republicans name first targets in drive to repeal Obama regs Published               January 04, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 House Republican leaders on Wednesday identified their primary targets in the long-standing effort to roll back President Obama\u2019s \u201cjob-killing\u201d regulations, vowing swift action to nix two environmental rules. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Republicans would roll back one rule reducing methane emissions and another meant to ease the environmental impact of coal mining on streams. McCarthy argued the regulations limit the nation's energy production, and said the GOP-controlled Congress will seek to invalidate the rules starting at month's end. Republicans for years have clamored in vain about Obama\u2019s attempts to move the country from fossil fuels to renewable energy using a mix of financial incentives and federal regulations. But with a Republican president coming into office, they will have the power to roll back some of those rules. In his first floor speech of the 115th Congress, McCarthy said GOP House leaders will take a \u201ctwo-step approach\u201d to federal regulations \u2013 first, passing legislation to give Congress more power to repeal, and then repealing rules that are \u201charmful to the American people, costing us time, money, and, most importantly, jobs.\u201d Industry groups already have filed suit to block Obama's regulations designed to reduce methane emissions, and other major regulations are currently tied up in court. But GOP leaders hope to bring about a more certain verdict through the so-called Congressional Review Act, a rarely used process that requires a simple majority of both chambers to approve a joint resolution of disapproval and the president's signature to make a regulation invalid. Lawmakers have successfully used the act only one other time to quash a new regulation. Generally, they cannot get the two-thirds majority necessary to overcome a presidential veto, but under GOP President-elect Donald Trump, they'll have a limited window to test his campaign promises to repeal various Obama administration regulations. McCarthy said the process won't be completed quickly, but likens the effort to \"draining the bureaucratic swamp that undermines the will of the people.\" Obama has pushed for rules to protect air and water as part of his focus on curbing global warming. He argues that the regulations enacted have benefited the economy more than they have cost. He has also said his administration's use of regulatory authority is also a reflection of the GOP's unwillingness to work with him on legislative solutions. Republicans will also seek to repeal regulations implementing an education reform bill that some state officials have complained erodes local decision-making, McCarthy's office said. Business groups are lining up to support the effort with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce saying the work done in the House over the next several weeks \"is a step in the right direction toward bringing greater accountability, transparency, and integrity to federal rulemakings.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

Now found guilty of 33 federal hate crimes charges, Roof is defending himself during the sentencing phase of the trial. Grace Beahm/AP hide caption toggle caption Grace Beahm/AP Dylann Roof appears at a court hearing in Charleston, S.C., in July 2015. Now found guilty of 33 federal hate crimes charges, Roof is defending himself during the sentencing phase of the trial. Grace Beahm/AP Dylann Roof delivered his opening statement in a South Carolina courtroom Wednesday, as the penalty phase of his federal trial got underway. Roof, who was convicted last month of murdering nine black churchgoers, will be representing himself as jurors weigh whether to give him the death penalty or life in prison. His remarks were brief, focused only on defending his decision to dismiss his lawyers for this phase of the trial. He said it's \"absolutely true\" that he chose to represent himself so that his lawyers would not present evidence of mental illness. \"The point is I'm not going to lie to you,\" Roof said. \"There's nothing wrong with me psychologically.\" Roof's opening statement was brief, just a couple minutes, here's what he said #RoofTrial : pic.twitter.com/oHYMA7fcyy \u2014 Mike Hayes (@michaelhayes) January 4, 2017 He did not address his crimes or the prosecution's opening remarks against him. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel approved the 22-year-old white supremacist's request to serve as his own counsel after a second hearing on his mental competency. The request for self-representation \u2014 and its approval \u2014 came over the protests of Roof's own lawyers. Roof has said he will not call witnesses or experts to the stand during this phase of the trial. Article continues after sponsorship Still, earlier this week, Gergel laid out strict rules for Roof's conduct while acting as his own lawyer. \"In an order, the judge detailed how Roof can behave while in court,\" Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio reports. \"He cannot approach witnesses, the jury or the bench and has to give opening statements from behind a podium.\" Court order filed about how Roof will interact with witnesses and jury during court proceedings. But no ruling on competency yet. pic.twitter.com/60iAfLD8t3 \u2014 Alexandra Olgin (@Alexolgin) January 2, 2017 Roof killed nine parishioners at Charleston's historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17, 2015. In a confession taped shortly after he was taken into custody, Roof made plain his racial motivations, adding: \"I am guilty. We all know I'm guilty.\" In Taped Confession, Charleston Church Shooter Says 'We All Know I Am Guilty' It took less than three hours last month for the jurors to concur. They found him guilty of charges ranging from murder and attempted murder to obstruction of religious belief and damage to religious property. Federal prosecutors, who are pursuing the death penalty, delivered a much longer opening statement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams focused his remarks on those who died in the shooting, and on what he called Roof's lack of regret. Central to the latter argument is a journal that prosecutors say Roof wrote in after his arrest. In the journal, excerpts of which were presented to courtroom reporters, Roof allegedly says that \"African-Americans have to pay for what they've done.\" \"I created the biggest wave I could,\" Roof allegedly wrote. \"I did all I can do, now it is in the hands of my brothers.\" More from Roof's journal, after lamenting he can't go to movies, eat good food... pic.twitter.com/7elGTbsEmH \u2014 Matt Zapotosky (@mattzap) January 4, 2017 In concluding his remarks, Williams warned that the testimony to come will be worse than what jurors have heard yet: \"It will be heartbreaking,\" the prosecutor said. The penalty phase of the trial resumed Wednesday with prosecutors calling their first witnesses. The prosecution plans to call up to 38 people as witnesses and experts during this phase of the trial, according to The Associated Press . This is not the only trial that Roof is facing \u2014 and not the only possibility for capital punishment. \"After the federal proceedings,\" reports NPR's Debbie Elliott , \"Roof is scheduled to be in state court early next year on murder charges that also carry the possibility of a death sentence.\" ",

Streams of particles ejected from black holes like this one are thought to be the brightest objects in the universe. ESO/M. Kornmesser hide caption toggle caption ESO/M. Kornmesser People think of black holes as nightmare vacuum cleaners, sucking in everything in reach, from light to stars to Matthew McConaughey in the movie Interstellar. But, in real life, black holes don't consume everything that they draw in. \"They're actually pretty picky eaters,\" says Jedidah Isler , an astrophysicist at Vanderbilt University. She spends most days chipping away at one of the universe's biggest mysteries: How do the huge, overactive black holes, known as quasars , work? \"They are billions of times the mass of our own sun,\" she says. \"I like to call them 'hyperactive,' in the sense that they are just taking on a lot more than an average black hole.\" And these monster black holes tend to do something strange. They not only reject material, but they use it to put on a space version of a fireworks show, shooting out shredded stars and other things in a stream of light and charged particles. \"Think of them as cosmic water hoses that are spewing out all kinds of particles and light,\" says Isler. Article continues after sponsorship These are some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed, causing chaos in their host galaxies. Theoretically speaking, if an unlucky planet happened to cross paths with one of those jets, Isler says, it would not be pretty. \"It would basically destroy the planet completely. It would completely eviscerate anything that got in its way,\" she says. She added, \"You know, things are being eviscerated in space all the time. It's part of what makes it fun.\" Isler specializes in the subset of quasars that happen to have their jet streams of material pointed toward Earth. These are called blazars , or \"blazing quasars.\" Telescopes built in the last decade, like NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope , have spotted a few thousand blazars. But don't panic. Enlarge this image An artist's rendering depicts what happened when a black hole devoured a star in 2011 and ejected some of the stellar remains in a jet of particles pointed at Earth.

This blazing quasar, or \"blazar,\" was far enough away that it posed no harm to Earthlings. NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center/CI Lab \"Thankfully, they are far enough away that they are not going to have any negative impact on us as human beings,\" Isler says. One of the closest blazars is 2.5 billion light-years away. \"But they do serve as really interesting laboratories to understand these really exotic systems,\" she says. \"They are able to accelerate particles to 99.99 percent of the speed of light,\" Isler says. \"How does that happen? So, I'm interested in where along that jet do we get this acceleration, and what is the physical mechanism that is responsible for the acceleration of particles that we see?\" By analyzing data from a large sample of blazars, she and her colleagues have found that some particles exhibit high-energy acceleration closer to the black hole than expected, suggesting that differences in blazar jets occur because of an internal process, like turbulence, as opposed to a more consistent factor, like how quickly the blazars draw in material. If the scientists can figure out how these natural particle accelerators work, they may begin to understand the physical laws that guide these unusual black holes, and maybe a lot of other systems out there that are capable of pulling things in and flinging them out. \"That process happens at many different scales across the universe with many different systems,\" Isler says. For example, when planets form, they pull nearby material into what are called protoplanetary disks . Sometimes, they shoot that material out in jets, too, though on a much smaller, weaker scale than blazars do. \"There may be some way that this process is universal in our cosmos,\" she adds. Understanding supermassive, hyperactive black holes could be a first step in figuring that out. ",

Midyear, the Brightline express train in South Florida is expected to open, linking Miami and West Palm Beach. When it\u2019s finished in 2019, travelers can make the trip between Miami and Orlando in three hours, while driving takes four. The terminus at the new downtown MiamiCentral station will include a food hall known as Central Fare. In Switzerland , the Gotthard Base Tunnel , the world\u2019s longest and deepest railway passage, ceremonially opened last June, but officially opened in December. Eventually the 35-mile tunnel through the Alps will cut 45 minutes off the trip between Zurich and Lugano. Offering more leisurely tours, the luxury sleeper train Belmond Andean Explorer will begin in May, linking Cusco, in the Peruvian Andes, to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. The itinerary takes two nights, but the company, which also operates the high-end Belmond Hiram Bingham trains to Machu Picchu, will offer one-night trips between Cusco and Lake Titicaca. Japan welcomed its newest high-speed train , Hokkaido Shinkansen , last March, traveling between Tokyo and the northern Hokkaido island in just over four hours. This spring, the 10-car Train Suite Shiki-Shima will offer 34-passenger luxury tours in sleeper cars that will travel from Tokyo to the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions. Among 2017 cruise ship launches in the mega class, the 4,500-capacity MSC Meraviglia from Europe\u2019s MSC Cruises, coming in the summer to the Mediterranean, will be among the largest at sea, with a 315-foot dome featuring light shows in the central promenade, a full-size bowling alley and entertainment by Cirque du Soleil. In November, the line will introduce another large ship, the 4,140-capacity MSC Seaside, sailing year-round between Miami and the Caribbean. In March, Celebrity Cruises plans to add two small ships to its fleet, both sailing in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . The 48-passenger Celebrity Xperience will offer trips lasting from seven to 13 nights, providing snorkeling gear, wet suits and binoculars to guests. A smaller craft, the Celebrity Xploration , will accommodate 16 guests. Lindblad Expeditions will introduce its first newly built ship, the 100-guest National Geographic Quest , in June in the Inside Passage of Alaska , with kayaks, paddle boards and landing craft for ventures into the wild. The square-rigged sailing ships of Star Clippers only look retro. The line\u2019s newly built Flying Clipper, making its debut late in 2017, will be powered by 32 sails, and it can carry 300 passengers.

Highlights include larger and connecting suites for friends and family, and eight restaurants, including French, Japanese and one that encourages diners to cook for themselves on heated lava stones. Among river launches, Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection will begin the art-and-antiques-filled 128-passenger Joie de Vivre in France in March. Crystal River Cruises will unveil the Crystal Bach on the Danube in June and the Crystal Mahler on the Rhine in August. Both will accommodate 106 guests and include butler service, five restaurants and lounges and a spa. Crystal has also announced it will start Crystal AirCruise in 2017: private jet trips aboard its 84-seat Boeing 777-200LR. The inaugural trip ($159,000 a person) circumnavigates the globe over 27 days, beginning Aug. 31, via Peninsula Hotels.

    "text": "Germany Arrests Tunisian Who Dined With Market Attacker By geir moulson, associated press BERLIN \u0097 Jan 4, 2017, 3:57 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Berlin Terror Attack Suspect Shot Dead in Milan 0 Shares Email An acquaintance of suspected Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri who dined with him the night before the rampage is under investigation for possible participation in planning the attack, German prosecutors said Wednesday. He was arrested, but in a separate case. The 26-year-old Tunisian had known Amri since the end of 2015 and the pair ate together at a Berlin restaurant the night before the Dec. 19 attack, said Frauke Koehler, a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors. His quarters at a refugee home were searched on Tuesday. The pair's meeting led prosecutors to believe that the man may have been involved in the attack or at least knew that Amri planned to commit one, Koehler said. She said that \"communications devices\" seized in Tuesday's search are being evaluated, but federal prosecutors do not currently have enough evidence to seek an arrest warrant against him. The man was, however, detained Tuesday in a separate case run by Berlin local prosecutors, Koehler said. Berlin prosecutors said the arrest was for allegedly falsely claiming benefits. A further search was conducted Tuesday at the home of a one-time roommate of Amri who is being treated as a witness in the case, Koehler said. Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, tried to reach that person on the morning and afternoon of Dec. 19, but it isn't clear whether they actually spoke, she added. Investigators say Amri drove the truck that plowed into a Christmas market in central Berlin. Twelve people were killed \u2014 including the truck's regular driver, whose body was found in the cab after the attack. Koehler said that the Polish driver apparently was fatally shot before the truck set off for the market from its parking place north of central Berlin. She said investigations have shown \"no indications that there was a third person in the cab at the time of the attack.\" Germany on Dec. 21 released a Europe-wide wanted notice for Amri, who used a string of different names and nationalities. He was killed in a shootout Dec. 23 with Italian police in a Milan suburb after they stopped him for a routine identity check. Surveillance footage from the Zoologischer Garten station, a few minutes' walk from the Christmas market, appears to show Amri shortly after the attack, Koehler said. The pictures \"suggest that Amri was aware that he was being recorded by this video camera,\" she said. She added that he turned to the camera and showed a \"tawhid finger\", or a raised index finger \u2014 an Islamic gesture sometimes used by jihadis. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack days afterward. On Dec. 21, footage from cameras in the Netherlands suggests that he was at the railway station in Nijmegen, Koehler said. Amri traveled by train from Nijmegen to Amsterdam the same day, then caught a train to Brussels, Dutch prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday. Belgian authorities said that he spent two hours at the Brussels North station coming from Amsterdam. He then traveled to Italy via France. Ballistics tests \"confirmed 100 percent\" that the .22-caliber, German-manufactured handgun, used by Amri to shoot one of the Italian policemen who had stopped him for a security check \"was the same one that was fired in Germany at the Christmas market attack,\" said Gianpaolo Zambonini, of the Rome forensic police. Zambonini said investigations are ongoing to determine whether the gun might have been used in other crimes in Italy or elsewhere. The bullet that lodged in the wounded policeman's shoulder was too damaged to be used for comparison, so Italian police ballistics experts used a simulator at a laboratory in Rome to fire another bullet from the gun. Then they compared scratches on the bullet with those found on bullet cartridges recovered in Berlin, police said. Koehler said investigators are still trying to figure out how Amri got hold of the gun, but that's difficult because manufacturer Erma went bankrupt at the end of the 1990s, she added. Amri, who had previously spent time in prison in Italy, arrived in Germany in July 2015. German authorities tried last year to deport him to Tunisia after his asylum application was rejected. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Mike Corder in The Hague , Netherlands, and Frances D'Emilio in Rome contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Fox . Offensive line coach Dave Magazu, Fox\u2019s longest-tenured assistant, was released as was... A day after running backs coach Stan Drayton announced he was leaving on his own with one year remaining on his contract, the Chicago Bears have fired two assistants with longtime ties to head coach John Fox . Offensive line coach Dave Magazu, Fox\u2019s longest-tenured assistant, was released as was... (Brad Biggs) On how he\u2019d assess Pace\u2019s performance after two seasons on the job I\u2019m pleased with the job he\u2019s done. He talked from the beginning about how this was going to take time, about how we needed to be patient. I told him I\u2019m not a patient person but I promised him that I would be patient. With all the adversity that we\u2019ve had, I like the steady hand that he and John have had on the team. These guys fought for each other all season. They never pointed fingers. And I think that\u2019s a credit to the type of player that we have. And I think it\u2019s also a credit to John and his coaching staff for keeping them together. On where his patience level is at now Like I said, I\u2019m not a patient person. But I promised Ryan that I would be patient. On the reaction of his mother, Virginia McCaskey, on the Bears\u2019 continued struggles She\u2019ll be 94 tomorrow. She has outlived her dad, her mom, her only sibling, her husband and a son. She\u2019s had her share of heartache. But she is a remarkably resilient person. I tell people that she\u2019s tougher than her dad was. And those who know her don\u2019t disagree. This is hard for her. Every loss is painful. But she supports what we\u2019re doing. She\u2019s on board. Like every Bears fan, she wants more wins. And we intend to get them for her. On how he and the organization will respond if the Bears go 3-13 again Well, there\u2019s a great line in the movie 'True Grit:' 'I don't deal in hypotheticals. The world as it is is vexing enough.' We\u2019re trying to get better every day. Every season is evaluated at the conclusion of the season on the merits of that season. On if he can quantify what improvement he\u2019ll need to see to stay the course beyond 2017 with Fox and Pace It\u2019s not a question of quantification. We need to get better. We need more wins. We want results. But we understand it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s painful at times, but under Ryan\u2019s leadership and with John\u2019s coaching, we think we can get there. On why he evaluated the end of this 3-13 season differently than he did the 5-11 campaign in 2014 that cost Phil Emery and Marc Trestman their jobs I don\u2019t think it would be productive to compare administrations. But the thing I like about Ryan and John is how well they work together. How they have stuck to the plan. How they have weathered adversity and kept this team together. On a midseason report from NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport that the Bears were talking to a consultant in regards to a potential front office shakeup A look at the faces at Halas Hall. I\u2019ll clarify it for all of you as I did with the reporter who authored that report. There is absolutely no truth to it whatsoever. On whether he has examined the structure of football operations at any point this season No. We think we have the right structure. We think we have the right people. On why the organization wasn\u2019t more proactive and assertive in debunking that erroneous NFL Network report Yeah, it\u2019s a good question. We talked about it internally. When you start responding to unsubstantiated reports, where do you stop? We talked about it internally. Everybody was on the same page. Ryan called the author of that report and told him it was erroneous. And he didn\u2019t believe it when Ryan said it. So I called him and told him: \u2018I don\u2019t know who your sources are. I don\u2019t care who they are. I can tell you right now they\u2019re giving you bad information.\u2019 On why he wasn\u2019t more concerned about the public perception that was shaped by that report I used to be in the news business. It used to be that a rumor was not news. It used to be fact, confirmed. If your mother says she loves you, check it out. Now it\u2019s just, \u2018I heard a rumor, so I\u2019m going to put it out there.\u2019 \u2026 If you assemble the press corps and say there\u2019s no truth to that rumor, that creates another story for the guy that started it in the first place. Then what about the next week and the week after that? There just doesn\u2019t seem to be an end to it.\u00a0 We knew that we were all on the same page internally, and that was good enough for us. On whether he remains a fan of quarterback Jay Cutler Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. Since you asked the question in the context of a fan, I\u2019ll answer in the context of a fan. I\u2019ve always been a fan of Jay Cutler. I love him as a player. I love him off the field. I think he doesn\u2019t get enough credit for what he does off the field. As far as the football evaluation, that\u2019s up to Ryan and John. On what he sees in the culture that Fox has instilled in the organization I think the culture\u2019s been excellent. Like I said, these players want to be here. They want to win for each other. They want to play for this coach. And I\u2019ve been very impressed with the improvement in the culture since Ryan and John have gotten here. \u2026 I think that\u2019s a big part of it, that they want to win for each other. On whether he\u2019s aware of the restlessness and anger amid some fans who are losing faith in the Bears I\u2019m sure there\u2019s restlessness, there\u2019s discontent, there\u2019s unease. People want to see their Bears do better. But I\u2019d like to invite you to walk around the South lot with me opening day next year. We\u2019ll see what they have to say. On whether Pace will be given free rein financially to attack free agency this spring if he so desires Absolutely. But I\u2019ve told Ryan, you should be criticized every spring for not being more aggressive in free agency. Because that means we are sticking to the plan of developing our own players, focusing primarily on the draft. If there is a special guy out there, do you do what it takes to go get him? Yeah. But I think he\u2019s taken a very measured approach to free agency thus far and I expect that to continue this offseason.\u00a0 On how much of a challenge it\u2019s been for him to remain patient Yeah it\u2019s been very challenging. I\u2019ve said many times, our entire family is huge fans. And we live and die with our Bears, just like everyone else does. And it has been very difficult. And that\u2019s where I think the important responsibility for me is to show the same kind of discipline with myself that Ryan is demonstrating in the draft and in free agency. You know, sometimes the best thing to do is to keep your mouth shut.\u00a0 ",

Four suspects are in custody after a disturbing live-streamed video of a duct-taped man allegedly being tortured on Chicago\u2019s West Side, CBS Chicago reported .\u00a0 In the video, the victim\u2019s clothes were cut, he was peppered with cigarette ashes, and then his hair cut with a knife until his scalp bled.\u00a0 Several people can be seen laughing and eating as the attack is going on.\u00a0 The incident took place Tuesday in an apartment on Chicago\u2019s West Side, a police spokesperson said. The victim, who has special needs, was a high-risk missing person from northwest suburban Crystal Lake. Police said he traveled to Carol Stream to meet a friend. They ended up in a stolen car, driven to the West Side, where the attack took place. \u00a0 Regarding the disturbing video that surfaced on social media of a battery: Incident is under investigation/suspects are being questioned pic.twitter.com/GGi3qs9rGv \u2014 Chicago Police (@Chicago_Police) January 4, 2017 Chicago police said in a statement that while on patrol, they observed the disoriented male walking outside.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 4, 2017 12:30 PM EST Over a century ago, when scientists were classifying the body\u2019s\u00a0 organs , one was short shrifted, according to researchers who say part of the digestive system deserves to be upgraded to organ status. In a new medical journal report, scientists say the mesentery \u2013 connective tissue that winds around our digestive organs, holding them in place \u2013 isn\u2019t a fragmented structure as once thought, but actually one contiguous structure. \u201cThe anatomic description that had been laid down over 100 years of anatomy was incorrect. This organ is far from fragmented and complex,\u201d said study author J. Calvin Coffey, from the University of Limerick, Ireland, in a press statement. \u201cIt is simply one continuous structure,\u201d winding from the small intestine down to the rectum. Medically speaking, an organ is self-contained and has a very specific vital job \u2013 think\u00a0 brain , kidneys and heart . Many, but not all, organs have a distinct functional unit, the study authors wrote in the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology journal. But there are still many questions about how the mesentery functions. \u201cThe functional unit of the mesentery is unknown, and whether a distinctive cell type is primarily responsible for its functionality should be investigated,\u201d they said. A digital representation of the small and large intestines and mesentery. Close The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Coffey, JC et al. 2016 The mesentery: structure, function, and role in disease. Dr. Kevin Campbell, assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina, told CBS News that the mesentery has been hiding in plain sight for centuries. In fact, artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s (1452 \u2013 1519) drawings suggest the structure\u2019s existence was known even then.\u00a0 The new findings, though, may help researchers consider it in a fresh way that could help them better understand abdominal and digestive diseases. \u201cWe\u2019ve known this has been part of our bodies. We just don\u2019t fully understand what role it plays. In the past, we\u2019ve known that the mesentery was there basically just to hold all the organs in place inside our abdomen. And now we think that it may be one contiguous\u00a0 organ that actually may play a role in disease,\u201d Campbell said. Campbell said that when he studied anatomy in medical school in the nineties, he was taught that the mesentery was a set of fragmented tissues that held the belly\u2019s organs in place. \u201cThis is the first we\u2019re hearing that it could be one contiguous organ. The researchers from Ireland looked at it under a microscope and really feel like it is one contiguous organ,\u201d said Campbell. That leads to the next big question: What exactly does it do beyond holding things in place? Mesentery researcher J. Calvin Coffey, professor of surgery at the University of Limerick, Ireland, Graduate Entry Medical School. Close Alan Place, courtesy of the University of Limerick, Ireland \u201cNow we can design studies and we can do things that better determine what its function is, what its role in digestion is,\u201d Campbell added. For instance, right now, cancer surgeons often remove portions of the mesentery. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not the right thing to do. There are a lot of questions that this brings about and we still have more questions than answers,\u201d Campbell said. For now, the mesentery\u2019s reputation is on the upswing. Last year, medical students started being taught that the it is an organ unto itself, and one of medicine\u2019s best known textbooks, Gray\u2019s Anatomy, now describes the mesentery as an organ. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images Several civil rights activists were arrested Tuesday night for staging a sit-in at Sen. Jeff Sessions' office in Mobile, Ala., to protest his nomination as U.S. attorney general. The sit-in was staged by the NAACP and portions were broadcast live online . The NAACP has sharply criticized Sessions' record on civil rights, voting rights and criminal justice reform.

Brooks (@CornellWBrooks) January 4, 2017 The NAACP highlighted Sessions' history with voting rights as a major factor in the protest. Brooks told The Associated Press that Sessions \"does not acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while mouthing faith in the myth of voter fraud.\" Racially Charged Remarks Derailed Trump's Attorney General Nominee 30 Years Ago He also noted that Sessions once prosecuted civil rights activists on charges of voter fraud. As NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported , those charges were dismissed by a jury, and civil rights groups described the prosecution as attempted intimidation of black voters. The NAACP cited Sessions' \"record of racially offensive remarks and behavior\" as another reason the group objects to his nomination. As Nina explained in November , Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship in the '80s. He was rejected by a Republican-controlled Senate after he acknowledged having made racially insensitive remarks and calling several civil rights groups \u2014 including the NAACP \u2014 \"un-American.\" He later denied making some of the remarks, which \"seemed to add a credibility problem to his troubles,\" Nina wrote. After making public statements objecting to Sessions' nomination, the NAACP turned to civil disobedience. Brooks tweeted on Tuesday that the activists with him in Mobile were prepared to be arrested for their protest.

Sessions was in Washington, D.C., as the protests in Alabama were unfolding, the AP writes. Is Sessions, Trump's Attorney General Pick, Trying to Paper Over His Record? A spokeswoman for Sessions said in a statement that \"false portrayals\" of Sessions \"will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited,\" the AP reports. Meanwhile, more than 1,200 law school professors have signed a letter urging the Senate to reject Sessions' nomination. \"Nothing in Senator Sessions' public life since 1986 has convinced us that he is a different man than the 39-year-old attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge,\" the professors write, citing his prosecution of civil rights activists and \"consistent promotion of the myth of voter-impersonation fraud,\" among other things. \"All of us believe it is unacceptable for someone with Senator Sessions' record to lead the Department of Justice,\" they write. Sessions' former chief counsel, who is black, told The Washington Post that the \"smear campaign\" accusing Sessions of racial insensitivity needs to stop. ",

By Sarah Halzack January 4 at 5:10 PM Follow @sarahhalzack Shoppers walk on the lower promenade outside Macy\u2019s at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y. (Kevin P. Coughlin/Bloomberg News) Department store giant Macy\u2019s said Wednesday that it plans to slash more than 10,000 jobs and will close its location at Landmark Mall in Alexandria, Va., as part of a previously announced plan to shutter 100 of its 730 stores nationwide, a coda to a disappointing holiday season. Early evidence suggests that the retail industry pulled down a solid holiday sales haul this year: Consumer confidence is high, growth in online spending was robust\u00a0in December, and a blast of cold weather encouraged people to get shopping. And yet Macy\u2019s struggled to get a piece of the action. The chain said Wednesday that it saw a 2.7 percent decrease during November and December in comparable sales, a measure of online sales and sales at stores open more than a year. The lackluster performance continues a long streak for Macy\u2019s in which store traffic and sales have been pummeled by shoppers\u2019 changing behavior: Women are opting to fill their closets with goods from fast-fashion outposts or off-price stores such as Marshalls. And many consumers are choosing to spend money on experiences instead of goods\u00a0or are shopping online instead of wandering the mall. These latest struggles underscore the challenges that Jeff Gennette will face in 2017 when he takes over the chief executive reins from longtime leader Terry Lundgren, a succession plan Macy\u2019s had announced last summer. During the holiday rush, the department store said that its apparel, furniture, bedding and fine jewelry businesses performed relatively strongly. But weakness in departments such as handbags and watches offset some of those successes. \u201cWe believe that our performance during the holiday season reflects the broader challenges facing much of the retail industry,\u201d Lundgren said in a news release.\u00a0 As it responds to this challenging shopping environment, Macy\u2019s said it will seek to cut costs by eliminating layers of management and \u201cmaking changes to the way stores are operated.\u201d Overall, these moves will result in 6,200 jobs being slashed. Meanwhile, an additional 3,900 positions will be lost as the retailer executes a plan it announced last summer to trim its store portfolio. Lundgren has said he believes the United States is \u201coverstored,\u201d meaning it has too many brick-and-mortar shopping outposts for the e-commerce era. Those closures, which will largely take effect in the next few months, so far appear poised to claim only one Macy\u2019s location in the Washington region: the store at the Landmark Mall in Alexandria. However, on Wednesday, Macy\u2019s\u00a0 named 68 outposts that it plans to close. In a statement, the company said it \u201cintends to opportunistically close approximately 30 additional stores\u201d as leases expire or sales transactions are completed. So it\u2019s possible the Washington area could lose more Macy\u2019s stores in the next few years. Based on the closures it has announced so far, Macy\u2019s said it expects its sales will take a $575 million hit in 2017. While many loyal shoppers may turn to Macy\u2019s website or another nearby location, some of those sales won\u2019t\u00a0be recovered. Macy\u2019s stock sank more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. While the retailer reaffirmed its sales guidance for fiscal 2016, it lowered its earnings estimates to $2.95 to $3.10 per share. The company will continue in 2017 to try to remedy its business by barreling ahead with new formats. It will open some 50 locations of its Bluemercury beauty chain, some of which will be standalone locations and some that will be shop-in-shops at Macy\u2019s stores. It will also add 50 more of its Macy\u2019s Backstage concept, an off-price area within existing stores. Save ",

Vice President-elect Mike Pence met Thursday at the Capitol with Republican lawmakers, rallying them around the goal of repealing Obamacare. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Noam N. Levey and Noam N. Levey Contact Reporters After demanding for six years that the Affordable Care Act be gutted,\u00a0Republican leaders refused Wednesday\u00a0to outline concrete steps to repeal and replace it,\u00a0even as members of their party voiced growing reservations about rolling the law back without a viable alternative. Neither President-elect Donald Trump nor Vice President-elect Mike Pence , who met with House and Senate Republicans at the Capitol, offered lawmakers details about their repeal plan \u2014 a centerpiece of their winning campaign \u2014 short of vague promises that Trump would take executive action after he assumes office in just over two\u00a0weeks. And GOP congressional leaders would not say how they will proceed or even how long they will take to develop a replacement for the current law, widely known as Obamacare. \u201cThis is going to take a little time,\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said after the meeting with Pence. The lack of detail underscored the complexities of undoing the biggest expansion of the social safety net in decades without interfering with healthcare for\u00a0tens of millions of Americans. Republicans\u2019 wavering just a day after the start of a new Congress also may\u00a0give\u00a0opponents additional\u00a0time to shore up support for preserving Obamacare in some form. Cornyn and other Republican leaders repeated assurances Wednesday\u00a0that consumers would not lose coverage while Republicans work to develop an alternative to the law. More than 20 million Americans have gained coverage though the law and many more depend on its key protections, including a guarantee that people can get coverage even if they are sick and limits on how much patients can be forced to pay out of their pocket for medical care. \"We don\u2019t want to pull the rug out from anybody,\" said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). \"We don\u2019t want people to be caught with nothing.\" After meeting with Senate Republicans, Pence told reporters at the Capitol that Trump\u2019s executive orders would \u201censure that there is an orderly transition during the period after we repeal Obamacare to a market-based healthcare economy in America.\u201d The assurances have not convinced patient advocates, leading medical groups or even many conservative health policy experts, who are urging the GOP not to roll back the law without first developing an alternative. Many are skeptical Republicans can craft one; they have failed to do so for more than six years. This week alone, leading physician groups, including the American Medical Assn., joined the push to slow the repeal campaign. Others urging caution include the American Diabetes Assn. and the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society. A growing number of Republican senators are also voicing reservations about the lack of a clear plan, jeopardizing GOP leaders\u2019 vision for swift\u00a0repeal in a chamber where just three Republican defections could torpedo\u00a0legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure exactly what direction we\u2019re going to go to have a full and careful transition period,\u201d said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, whose state has seen a dramatic drop its uninsured rate thanks to Obamacare. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a centrist\u00a0who is being closely watched, urged party leaders to make more progress on an alternative to the current law before voting to scrap it. \u201cIt would be far better to have a detailed framework of what replacement is going to include as we are moving toward repealing,\u201d Collins said. Republicans , despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act , are struggling with\u00a0what parts of the law to roll back\u00a0and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate ,\u00a0to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal... Congressional Republicans , despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act , are struggling with\u00a0what parts of the law to roll back\u00a0and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate ,\u00a0to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal... (Noam N. Levey) On Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has publicly criticized the repeal push, joined Democrats in voting against a motion to start debating a resolution that would set the stage for repeal. Outside Washington, state Republican officials are raising concerns about repealing Obamacare as well. Michigan Gov.\u00a0 Rick Snyder , who was among the first Republican governors to expand Medicaid coverage through the healthcare law, called his state\u2019s expansion a national model in an interview with the Detroit News . Under Republicans\u2019 current repeal plan, the House and Senate over the next couple weeks would pass a budget resolution directing Congress to develop a repeal bill through a process called budget reconciliation. The House would then craft the repeal legislation, pass it and send it to the Senate. Under budget rules, Republicans, who have a 52-48 edge in the Senate, would need only\u00a0a simple majority to pass the bill and send it to Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that the repeal package, which congressional committees are to draw up by Jan. 27, would hew closely to repeal legislation that Republicans developed in 2015 and sent to President Obama a year ago. Obama vetoed it. That bill removed the unpopular insurance mandates in the law that require Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. It also rolled back federal aid for Medicaid; scrapped federal insurance subsidies for low- and moderate-income consumers; and eliminated a Medicare surtax on high-income households and other taxes on medical device makers and health insurance companies that go toward funding\u00a0the law. To allow Republicans time to develop an alternative, the bill delayed implementation of the repeal for two years. If congressional Republicans stick to this repeal-and-delay\u00a0strategy, Trump could take steps through executive action that might help stabilize insurance markets while a replacement is being developed, said Larry Levitt, an insurance market expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Trump made promises to blue-collar voters. Democrats plan to make sure he follows through \u00bb These steps might include tightening rules on when people could sign up for coverage in Obamacare marketplaces or even loosening requirements on what benefits insurers must offer, which could lower premiums\u00a0though would likely leave consumers with fewer protections. But in case those steps prove inadequate, Republicans appear to be laying the groundwork to shift blame back to Democrats. Trump said Wednesday \u00a0that the current healthcare law would will \u201cfall of its own weight.\u201d And Pence outlined for lawmakers plans for the new president to barnstorm the country attacking Obamacare and keeping up momentum for the repeal-and-replace push. \"I'm promising you, you will not be doing it alone,\" Pence told House Republicans, according to a source in the closed-door meeting, which was described as more of a pep rally than a strategy session. \u201cWe'll be making the case all around the country.\" Democrats, meanwhile, are working on their own political campaign, which is designed to capitalize on growing reservations in Republican ranks and polls showing public unease over repeal. \u00a0 After meeting separately in the Capitol with Obama, Democratic leaders warned that the GOP was risking chaos by unraveling Obamacare. \"They seek to rip healthcare away from millions of Americans \u2014\u00a0creating chaos for our entire economy,\" warned Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cIt is their obligation \u2014 they are voting for repeal \u2014\u00a0it is their obligation to come with replace.\u201d In a twist on Trump's campaign slogan, Democrats warned that Republicans want to \"make America sick again.\" Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

    "text": "By Juliet Eilperin , Amy Goldstein and Kelsey Snell January 4 at 6:49 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @goldsteinamy Follow @kelsey_snell Congressional Republicans on Wednesday launched their long-promised effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even as they acknowledged that they may need several months to develop a replacement along conservative lines. Signifying how enormous a priority the issue is for the incoming administration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence met privately to discuss it with House and Senate Republicans. He offered no details afterward about what a new health-care law might look like but vowed to unwind the existing one through a mixture of executive actions and legislation. Meanwhile, President Obama made a rare Capitol Hill appearance, meeting behind closed doors with Democrats from both chambers. He urged members of his party not to help the GOP devise a new health-care law. The dueling high-level visits, on the same day that the Senate opened debate on a budget resolution that would begin rolling back the law, highlighted the sharp political fault lines that surround the future of the government\u2019s health policies. The president, who was accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) as he entered the Capitol, took no questions from reporters before or after the nearly two-hour meeting. But participants said he told members of his party that they did not have to \u201crescue\u201d Republicans and that they should \u201cstay strong\u201d as the GOP strives to replace the law. (Reuters) Pence told reporters that he and Trump would pursue a \u201ctwo-track approach\u201d to chip away at the ACA through executive powers and legislation. Trump is \u201cworking on a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place,\u201d Pence said, and is eyeing other policies that can be reversed. [ With Obamacare, GOP faces the \u2018Pottery Barn rule\u2019: You break it, you own it ] While Pence did not identify other policy targets, Republicans from Western states urged him Wednesday to undo some of the public land protections Obama has created through the 1906 Antiquities Act. Other executive actions, including those providing new safeguards for LGBT Americans and curbing greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change, also could come under fire. According to a lobbyist in touch with congressional aides on the ACA issue, the Trump transition team has been considering ways to strip down the health benefits that insurers must provide in plans that they sell to individuals and small businesses. This list of \u201cessential health benefits\u201d was envisioned by the law but was defined in a regulation written by the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, the incoming administration could alter it without help from Congress. [ Why Obamacare is unlikely to die a swift death ] Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to urge Republicans to \u201cbe careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster.\u201d In a dig at Schumer and his allies, Trump added: \u201cDon\u2019t let the Schumer clowns out of this web.\u201d Less than half an hour after Trump\u2019s social media messages, Schumer tweeted: \u201cRepublicans should stop clowning around with America\u2019s health care. Don\u2019t #MakeAmericaSickAgain.\u201d Schumer and other Democrats echoed Obama, saying they did not feel any responsibility to craft a substitute health-care bill. \u201cIf you are repealing, show us what you\u2019ll replace it with. Then we\u2019ll look at what you have and see what you can do,\u201d said Schumer, who met briefly with Pence on Wednesday. (Reuters) White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Obama told Democrats that they are well positioned to defend the law, which has extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans. However, Obama also told lawmakers that he recognized that he had not succeeded in selling the law to the public. \u201cThere was an acknowledgment that so many features were so popular, but there was a failure to communicate that,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. [ Donald Trump, meet your toughest hurdle: The U.S. Senate ] Pence, who was greeted by applause as he entered the House GOP meeting with Reince Priebus, Kelly Anne Conway and several other future White House aides, made it clear that Trump, starting on the first day of his presidency, intended to embark on an aggressive campaign to reverse executive actions made by Obama. \u201cThey didn\u2019t enumerate a list, just that which came by the pen can die by the pen,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.). The first bill Republicans introduced in the new Senate that convened Tuesday was budget legislation with instructions for House and Senate committees to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. The bare-bones spending outline requires members of four committees \u2014 Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce in the House; and Finance, as well as Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in the Senate \u2014 to produce bills just seven days after Trump\u2019s inauguration that each would save $1\u00a0billion over a decade by slashing elements of the heath-care law. [ Democrats: Trump will make America sick again ] House Republicans tasked with writing the repeal legislation said that no final decisions have been made on what it will include. Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R-Ohio) who chairs a House subcommittee that oversees health care, called the incoming administration\u2019s Jan. 27 deadline \u201ca challenging goal.\u201d Among the unanswered questions is whether Republicans will immediately end health-care taxes, such as an additional 0.9\u00a0percent Medicare payroll tax and a 3.8 percent investment income tax, that were created to help pay for the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans have insisted that the taxes should be eliminated immediately, even if lawmakers decide to delay the repeal of other parts of the law. Others worry that repealing the taxes will make it impossible to pay to keep Obamacare afloat while a replacement is finished. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure yet,\u201d Tiberi said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not consensus on this.\u201d Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a member the Trump transition team, said in an interview that \u201cwe have six months to work out the replacement plan\u201d for the sweeping health-care law. Senate rules allow budget resolutions to pass by a simple majority \u2014 a maneuver that guarantees that the chamber\u2019s Democratic minority will not have enough votes for a filibuster to block repeal. Only changes related to taxes, spending or the long-term federal budget are eligible for the simple-majority treatment, however. Other parts of the law, such as the structure of the insurance marketplaces, probably would require a veto-proof margin of 60 votes in the Senate, a trickier task since the new Senate has 52 Republicans. (The Washington Post) Since its passage by Congress in the spring of 2010 \u2014 entirely with Democratic votes \u2014 the ACA has spurred the most significant changes to U.S. health policy since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid during the Great Society legislation of the 1960s. It also has faced sustained opposition from Republicans, leading to two Supreme Court cases and a lawsuit over cost-sharing subsidies that is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The ACA is best known for having expanded insurance coverage, starting in 2014, in two ways: new marketplaces selling private health plans to Americans who do not have access to affordable health benefits through a job, and an expansion of Medicaid in about three-fifths of the states. The marketplaces got off to a shaky start because of computer dysfunction with HealthCare.gov, the federal enrollment website. [ Trump just met with super-influential health-care executives you\u2019ve probably never heard of ] Three years later, the U.S. Census reported that the nation\u2019s uninsured rate had declined to 9.1 percent , with most of a recent decrease coming from people who bought insurance on their own and more who had joined Medicaid. The president\u2019s visit to the Hill was part of a broader, last-ditch effort by his administration to preserve a central element of his domestic legacy. On Wednesday morning, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) drew attention to the stakes for his state by issuing a county-by-county breakdown of the estimated 2.7\u00a0million New Yorkers who would lose coverage if the law were repealed. He pointed out that New York would lose $595\u00a0million this year in federal money that has helped the state expand its Medicaid program. HHS officials have been trying to use to their advantage the fact that the change in administrations will take place while the fourth year\u2019s enrollment period for ACA health plans is underway. On Wednesday, HHS released HealthCare.gov enrollment figures showing that 8.8\u00a0million Americans chose or were automatically re-enrolled in ACA health plans between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 in the 39 states that rely on the federal exchange website. That is about 200,000 more than at the same time a year ago, although the proportion of new customers was lower. The new drive to unwind the health-care law will take time. Senate leaders must allow Democrats to offer a nearly unlimited number of amendments before a final budget vote. Democrats plan to use the process, known as a \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d to offer a long string of potentially toxic amendments that could make it difficult for Republicans to vote for the final legislation, Democratic leadership aides said. Mike DeBonis, Ed O\u2019Keefe, Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report. ",

    "text": "Classified Election Hacking Report Complete, President Obama to Be Briefed By JUSTIN FISHEL Jan 4, 2017, 4:53 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Saying Intel Briefing Was Postponed, Trump Continues Doubting Russian Election Hacking 0 Shares Email The classified report requested by President Barack Obama detailing Russia's alleged role in cyberattacks during U.S. presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete, and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials tell ABC News. President-elect Donald Trump , who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, is scheduled to receive his briefing on Friday. Both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency , the FBI and the CIA. U.S. officials denied claims from Trump that his special briefing was delayed so the U.S. intelligence community could strengthen its case against Russia. Officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the Trump transition team. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Officials familiar with the report say an unclassified version of its findings is not expected to made public until Monday, the same day Congress gets its classified briefing. Although the unclassified version will be far less revealing, pushing the public findings into next week will likely prolong the ugly spat between Trump and Democrats and the intelligence community over who is responsible for the cyberattacks. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly questioned the conclusions of the intelligence community, which on Oct. 7 stated publicly that it is \"confident\" Russia directed hacks of political organizations during the 2016 presidential election season. In doubting the claims, Trump referred to the intelligence community's false conclusions about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in the run-up to the Iraq War, and he has taken WikiLeaks founder and fugitive computer activist Julian Assange at his word that the Russians were not the source of the information leaked to his site. \"I know a lot about hacking,\" Trump said Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \"And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation,\" he said, apparently referring to the intelligence community. On Thursday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is set to hold a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing with testimony from ODNI and NSA officials, who are not expected to comment at length on the new report before Obama is briefed. 0 Shares ",

Current-Argus 7:21 p.m. ET Jan. 4, 2017 Waste Isolation Pilot Plant employees practice normal operations in June 2016 in preparation for the Carlsbad, N.M., nuclear waste repository's anticipated restart by the end of the year. (Photo: Nuclear Waste Partnership) CARLSBAD, N.M.\u00a0\u2014 Workers at the USA's only underground nuclear waste repository stowed two pallets of drums deep underground Wednesday for the first time in nearly three years. Since 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, about 25 miles east of Carlsbad, has been storing transuranic nuclear waste left over from weapons research and testing in 16 square miles of salt caves more than a third of a mile underground. But a section of the plant was contaminated in February 2014 because one canister of waste from Los Alamos National Laboratory about 55 miles of Albuquerque\u00a0ruptured in one of the storage rooms. More than 20 workers also were contaminated, and the plant that had almost 150 workers at the time\u00a0was forced to close. \"It went great,\" said Rick Fuentes, president of the local chapter of the United Steelworkers Union and a waste handler\u00a0who did not assist in moving the pallets. \"We're excited to be back to work.\" Mishaps at nuke repository lead to $54M in fines Twenty to 25 workers in protective clothing and respirators unloaded the two pallets of low-level radioactive waste at 12:45 p.m. MT Wednesday near Room 5 in Panel 7, he said. The waste already was\u00a0being stored above ground at the site, and no shipments of new waste have been received. The plant receives drums of radioactive material from defense-related sites around the country generally\u00a0consisting of clothing, tools, rags, debris, soil and other items contaminated with radioactivity, mostly plutonium. When federal money to build the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in western Nevada was cut in 2011, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant became the country's only underground storage facility. It does not accept spent nuclear fuel from power plants as Yucca Mountain was expected to do. Crews find suspected area of radiation leak \"It was never a question of us doing the emplacement. We've been doing it right since '99,\" Fuentes said. \"It was unfortunate that we received some waste that shouldn't have been in those drums.\" New Mexico's Environment Department initially fined the federal Energy Department $54 million because of the leak\u00a0\u2014 $36.6 million against Los Alamos and $17.7 against the\u00a0Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in December 2014. But the federal government contested the fines. In a deal that GOP Gov. Susana Martinez worked out in May 2015,\u00a0taxpayers across the country\u00a0instead will pay for about $73 million in state highway improvements, including a stretch between the nuclear waste repository and Carlsbad,\u00a0and projects near Los Alamos as the penalty. Feds want nuclear waste train, but nowhere to go Officials at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project had projected a December restart but always with the caveat that worker safety would trump any deadlines. \"It's the day we've all been working for,\" President Phil Breidenbach of Nuclear Waste Partnership, a private contractor that operates the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, wrote in email to employees. The reopening will be celebrated Monday at the site. Martinez; Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz; Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M.; and other dignitaries are expected to attend.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., on whether the health-care law should be repealed backfired big-time Wednesday as lots more people \u2014 a whole lot more people \u2014 tweeted \"No,\" rather than \"Yes.\" Blackburn posted the poll Tuesday, asking people their views on repeal, and requesting that they retweet their support for killing Obamacare if they favored repeal.

The Hill.com noted that Blackburn's cause probably wasn't helped by the fact that White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz retweeted the poll Tuesday to his more than 23,000 Twitter followers. Schultz's boss, President Barack Obama, lists the ACA as his signature legislative achievement, and on Wednesday visited Capitol Hill to encourage his fellow Democrats to defend it against Republican repeal-and-replace efforts. Also Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for the repeal of the ACA, warned his fellow Republicans in several tweets to \"be careful\" how they handle the issue. Trump's tweets said Democrats \"own\" the \"mess\" and \"disaster\" of Obamacare, implying that if Republicans repeal-and-replace efforts lead to spikes in uninsured rates and premium prices, they too could suffer political fallout. massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess.

Time A mesentery. (Photo: Time) An Irish surgeon's breakthrough overturned\u00a0more than a century of medical belief and may lead to improvements in digestive surgery and recovery. The mesentery, it turns out, is one connected organ, not a disjointed group of separate parts, a theory believed since the 19th Century. \u00a0The mesentery connects the intestine to the abdomen. J. Calvin Coffey, a professor at the University of Limerick, reclassified the mesentery after discovering it was contiguous. His findings were published in November in the medical journal\u00a0The Lancet Gastroenterology and\u00a0Hepatology. Although it has no identifiable function, clarifying the structure of the mesentery, the university said, makes way for better understanding of the organ.\u00a0The university said mesentery research may lead to less invasive surgeries, fewer complications, shorter patient recovery and lower costs. The findings suggest mesentery plays a central position in the body, which could lead to even more studies. \"Whether the mesentery should be viewed as part of the intestinal, vascular, endocrine, cardiovascular or immunological systems is so far unclear,\" the findings said, \"as it has important roles in all of them.\" Mesentery\u00a0research\u00a0goes back to the time of Leonardo DaVinci, who provided one of the earliest depictions of the mesentery, which was shown as contiguous. For centuries, the now-organ was\u00a0depicted that way until the findings of Treves in 1885. His description of the mesentery \u2014\u00a0which was disconnected \u2014\u00a0became the basis of medical literature over the next century. \"During the initial research, we noticed in particular that the mesentery, which connects the gut to the body, was one contiguous organ,\" Coffey said. \"Up to that it was regarded as fragmented, present here, absent elsewhere and a very complex structure. The anatomic description that had been laid down over 100 years of anatomy was incorrect.\" The next step, Coffey said, is to determine the mesentery's function. \"If you understand the function you can identify abnormal function, and then you hve\u00a0disease,\" he said. \"Put them all together and you have the field of mesenteric science... the basis for a whole new area of science.\" Follow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman 1878 CONNECT TWEET 20 LINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2j5DrI0 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 4, 2017 10:49 PM EST CHARLESTON, S.C. \u00a0- Convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof spoke to the jury for the first time at his death penalty trial Wednesday, telling them there\u2019s nothing wrong with him psychologically and that he is not trying to keep any secrets from them. But perhaps most important is what he didn\u2019t say: He didn\u2019t ask jurors to spare him from the death penalty. The jury last month unanimously found Roof guilty of hate crimes and other charges in the shooting deaths of nine black church members during Bible study. The jurors will now decide whether he should be sentenced to life in prison or death. WSC-Charleston live blog on sentencing phase of Dylann Roof massacre case \u201cMy opening statement is going to seem a little bit out of place,\u201d the soft-spoken 22-year-old white man said calmly as he stood in front of a podium, occasionally glancing at notes. \u201cI am not going to lie to you. ... Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn\u2019t and the fact that I\u2019m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who\u2019s ever existed, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me psychologically.\u201d Jennifer Pickney, the wife of Mother Emanuel pastor Clementa Pickney, testifed that while she hid under a desk in church office with her 6-year-old daughter, her daughter asked \u201cmama, is daddy gonna to die?\u201d By then, Pickney lay among the dead and the dying, CBS News\u2019 Mark Strassman reports. \u00a0 Dylann Roof in court on Jan. 4th, 2017. Close CBS News / Sketches by Robert Maniscalco At one point, Roof objected to the sheer number of people testifying, but the judge reminded him that is because there are so many victims.\u00a0 Roof\u2019s attorneys have indicated that he chose to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial because he was worried they might present embarrassing evidence about himself or his family. They have not said what that evidence may be, but as early as last summer, they had planned to introduce evidence that Roof suffers from a mental illness. Since then, many motions have been filed under seal, purportedly to conceal sensitive information, but it\u2019s likely more details on what lawyers planned to present. It\u2019s clear, from his own writings, Roof doesn\u2019t believe in psychology. In a journal read in court during his trial, Roof called the specialty \u201ca Jewish invention\u201d that \u201cdoes nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI want to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,\u201d Roof wrote six weeks after the murders. \u201cI do not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.\u201d\u00a0 Prosecutors said Roof deserves the death penalty because he painstakingly chose to target vulnerable people during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in June 2015. Roof sat with the church members for about 45 minutes and waited until their eyes were closed before opening fire. He told Polly Sheppard, one of the three survivors, that he wanted to leave her alive to tell the world why he attacked a historic African-American church. He said \u201cyou\u2019re raping our women and taking over the nation.\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams said the \u201chorrific acts justify the death penalty.\u201d \u201cHe killed nine people. ... He killed them because of the color of their skin. He killed them because they were less than people,\u201d Williams said. 17 Photos South Carolina church shooting victims Prosecutors plan to call up to 38 people related to the slain and the survivors. Williams told jurors they would hear extensive testimony about the nine victims, including pastor and state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, a \u201cprodigy of the ministry\u201d who was a man of faith, service and family dedication. Roof, who is representing himself, made no objections as photos of late church pastor Clementa Pinckney were introduced as evidence, reports CBS News affiliate WCSC-Charleston . As the photos were displayed, Pinckney\u2019s wife Jennifer described him as a family man who started preaching at a young age and loved to wear uniquely-patterned socks. He mostly wore slacks when they first met, but she eventually got him into wearing jeans and following football. \u00a0 While Clementa Pinckney \u2014 who started leading his first church at 18 \u2014 eventually became a senator, \u201che always made time for the family and he always made time for the girls,\u201d Jennifer Pinckney said. 50 Photos Charleston shooting The prosecutor also read a portion from a journal found in Roof\u2019s jail cell six weeks after his arrest in which Roof said he had not wept for any of the victims. \u201cI remember how I felt when I did these things and how I knew I had to do something and then I realize it was worth it,\u201d Roof wrote, as a handwritten page from his journal appeared on screens in the courtroom. \u201cI would like to make it crystal clear. I do not regret what I did. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.\u201d As their first witness, prosecutors called Pinckney\u2019s widow, Jennifer Pinckney. During more than an hour on the stand, Pinckney described her husband as an affable figure who garnered respect from all corners in his roles as legislator and preacher but was a goofy family man in private with his two young daughters. \u201cHe always made time for the family, and he always made time for the girls,\u201d said Pinckney, describing her husband\u2019s affinity for cartoonish neckties and socks. \u201cHe was the person I think that every mom would be happy that their daughter met and married. ... I know that he loved me. And he knew how much that I loved him.\u201d Prosecutors said they would question Pinckney about the night of the shooting when court resumed after a lunch break. Roof was found competent to represent himself during two different hearings, one before the trial and another one within the last week. He has said he doesn\u2019t plan on calling any witnesses or introduce any evidence. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The group will begin at 8 a.m. in Dupont Circle, then plans to march down to the National Mall in time for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. At exactly 4 minutes and 20 seconds into Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address -- 420 is the commonly known code for marijuana -- thousands of protesters will light up. Ultimately, organizers say, the stakes have never been higher for national marijuana legalization -- and their Inauguration Day plans will serve as a message to the country. \u201cThe main message is it\u2019s time to legalize cannabis at the federal level,\u201d Adam Eidinger, the founder of DCMJ, a group of D.C. residents who introduced and helped get D.C.\u2019s marijuana legalization initiative passed, told CBS affiliate WUSA. In the District of Columbia, initiative 71 -- passed in 2014 -- made the possession of up to two ounces of marijuana legal. It\u2019s legal to grow the plant or give it away, but it\u2019s still illegal to sell it. What isn\u2019t legal is lighting up on federal property -- which the National Mall is. Participants should be aware that they\u2019re risking arrest, Eidinger told WUSA, but he noted that the National Mall has always been a place for peaceful political protest. \u201cWe are going to tell them that if they smoke on federal property, they are risking arrest. But, that\u2019s a form of civil disobedience,\u201d said Eidinger. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good protest. If someone wants to do it, they are risking arrest, but it\u2019s a protest and you know what, the National Mall is a place for protest.\u201d Eidinger also said the protest isn\u2019t explicitly anti-Trump; all are welcome, and organizers are happy for it to be a joint effort between supporters of different political parties. The joints themselves will be completely free. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any money exchanged whatsoever, this is really a gift for people who come to Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Repeal Obamacare. Not everyone will be covered. His health care plan, released online in March, had far more in common with the kind of boilerplate health care proposals the rest of the Republican party touts than his earlier praise for Canada suggested it might. It would likely cause 21 million people to lose their health insurance and cost about $270 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan budget advocacy group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). It offers up unspecified amounts of grants to states to replace Medicaid, but it's not clear how or what those would look like, or how they would cover the millions of people that Trump's plan lets fall through the cracks. CRFB noted that block grants \"could generate a wide range of savings\" to the federal budget, but without details on them, it is \"impossible to score any savings\" from his plan. 6. I do want to keep parts of it, we might just amend it. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he would be OK with amending Obamacare instead of fully repealing it. He also indicated that he wanted to keep the protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, and the measure that allows parents to keep their children insured until age 26. \"Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\" Trump said in November in one of his first interviews as the president-elect. If they do repeal it, he said there would be no gap between the repeal of Obamacare and the replacement of it with something else. 7. Begin to repeal on day one. Vice President-elect Mike Pence told Congressional Republicans that Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare would begin day one . It's unclear, however, what if any plan there is for a replacement bill. 8. 'Be careful' -- don't take the blame! massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 Shortly after Pence indicated that repeal efforts were in the works, Trump warned Republicans to \"be careful\" about taking on the bill -- and its liabilities -- arguing that it would \"fall on its own weight.\" Jane C.

Hobos gang leader Paris Poe's back tattoo that states \"The Earth Is Our Turf\" with \"Hobo\" in the center. (Provided by U.S. attorney) Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A federal jury on Wednesday convicted six reputed leaders of the violent Hobos street gang of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging the gang carried out a slew of killings, kidnappings, robberies and shootings over the course of a decade. After a marathon 15-week trial that featured hundreds of witnesses and four days of closing arguments, the jury deliberated into a sixth day before finding all six defendants guilty of the main racketeering count that carries a sentence of up to life in prison, as well as nine other counts. Among those convicted was Gregory \"Bowlegs\" Chester, the gang's reputed leader who testified in his own defense last month. The jury also convicted alleged gang lieutenants Paris Poe, Arnold Council, Gabriel Bush, Stanley Vaughn and William Ford. As the verdicts were read in U.S. District Judge John Tharp's packed courtroom, Chester sat without expression, his elbow on the defense table and a hand resting on his right cheek. Behind him, Poe frowned and rolled his eyes, dressed in a gray suit and leather loafers with shackles on his ankles visible. Later, when the judge praised the jury for its \"extraordinary service,\" Poe appeared to smirk. Tharp set sentencing for June 23. The trial unfolded as skyrocketing gun violence in Chicago made embarrassing headlines across the country and even became an issue in the recent presidential election. Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump called for federal intervention if local authorities can't get a handle on a homicide rate that in 2016 reached levels not seen in two decades. Prosecutors alleged the Hobos' ruthless use of violence fueled the gang's rise to the top of the city's drug trade. Among the casualties were two gang rivals who had just attended a funeral, a semi-pro basketball player who was slain in a case of mistaken identity, an innocent bystander from Los Angeles visiting relatives and an elderly woman killed in a car crash as police chased a fleeing Hobo member, according to the charges. But the centerpiece of the case was the alleged murders of two informants who were cooperating with law enforcement against the gang. Jurors heard evidence that Poe and Council fatally shot Wilbert \"Big Shorty\" Moore outside a South Side barbershop in 2006 because they believed Moore had provided information to police that led to a raid on a Hobos residence. In April 2013, Poe cut off an electronic monitoring device and ambushed informant Keith Daniels outside his Dolton apartment, according to prosecutors. Dressed in all black and wearing a mask, Poe shot Daniels more than a dozen times in front of his fiancee and two young children as payback for Daniels' cooperation with the FBI in a drug conspiracy case against Chester, the charges alleged. In its verdict, which took nearly 20 minutes for the judge to read in the courtroom, the jury found that each of five murders was conducted by the gang in a \"cold and calculated\" and premeditated manner. The jury also found specifically that Moore and Daniels were killed to keep them from cooperating against the gang. The jury found the six defendants guilty on every count except one lesser charge against Ford of using a gun in furtherance of a gang crime. The verdict came after the jury indicated last week that it may have been deadlocked on at least one count. In a note to the judge after a fourth day of deliberations Thursday, the jury wrote that one person had refused to convict. \"There are some strong beliefs on both sides,\" the note said. Tharp advised jurors to continue deliberating. On the first day of deliberations, one juror had asked to be taken off the jury after he said he'd made up his mind and didn't want to continue. After questioning the juror further, though, Tharp said the man needed to remain on the panel. jmeisner@chicagotribune.com ",

    "text": "John Keilman and Annemarie Mannion Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Delaney O'Connell was no stranger to the slopes of Crystal Mountain, a ski resort in northern Michigan. Her family had gone there for years, a resort spokesman said, and on Sunday afternoon she was taking a lesson on a hill judged to be well within her capability. But as she took her run, something caused her to lose control and she slammed into a tree hard enough to damage the helmet she was wearing, the spokesman said. Two days later, Delaney, a 10-year-old from La Grange, died from what authorities determined to be a closed head injury. It was the first ski school death in the resort's 60-year-history, the spokesman, Brian Lawson, said Wednesday. \"This was just an instance where a string of variables came together in a tragic way and there was an accident,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean we won't take a look at what we do and see if there's something that could be done or if there's a better way. We'll certainly be examining it very closely.\" The death left some in La Grange heartbroken, from the church the O'Connells attend to the school where Delaney was a well-loved, artistic and bookish fourth grader. \"She was one who was always quick with a hug,\" said Michael Michowski, principal of Cossitt Avenue School. \"Hers were sincere and spontaneous. It was representative of who this child was, for sure.\" Through family friends, Delaney's parents declined comment. Lawson said the O'Connells have been frequent visitors to the resort, and not just in winter. Delaney was taking a lesson Sunday on an intermediate hill, but had already shown in other classes that she had the ability to handle the terrain, Lawson said. ",

The department store chain also lowered its full-year earnings forecast. The retailer said Wednesday that sales at established stores fell 2.1 percent in November and December compared to the same period last year. Macy\u2019s pointed to changing consumer behavior and said it reflects challenges facing much of the retail industry. The company said it plans to close by midyear the 68 stores that are part of 100 closings announced in August. It also plans to restructure parts of its business and sell some properties. The moves are estimated to save $550 million annually. Among the stores that will close is a shopping landmark in downtown Minneapolis. Macy\u2019s is selling the store, ending more than a century of department store retailing in the heart of Minnesota\u2019s largest city. The closing, planned for March, affects 280 employees. The Star Tribune reports the property, which consists of three buildings totaling nearly 1 million square feet along Nicollet Mall, is being sold to a New York investment firm for more than $40 million. Minneapolis City Council President Barb Johnson told the newspaper: \u201cWe have a lot of people living and working in our downtown, far more than used to. But buying habits are changing and that will impact what kind of retail we see in that building.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe certainly want to work with the company that is buying the building and find out more,\u201d Johnson added.

CBS2\u2019s Kara Finnstrom reports. \u00a0 Family members of Olivia Gonzalez and Brian Fernandez say they are fighting to find strength at this point. CBS2\u2019s Kara Finnstrom reports. \u00a0 Veronica Rocha, Matt Hamilton A body found Tuesday near a tan\u00a0sedan hundreds of feet below Highway 1 in San Luis Obispo County was identified as\u00a0a North Hollywood woman, who along with her boyfriend\u00a0went missing more than a week ago on a drive to Big Sur. The body of Olivia Hannah Gonzalez, 20, was discovered\u00a0325 feet below the coast highway, near the shoreline, according\u00a0Officer Patrick Seebart, a spokesman for California Highway Patrol. Her body was found next to\u00a0the vehicle and the remains\u00a0of a dog. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Gonzalez\u2019s sister, Vanessa Guzman, broke the news about the death.\u00a0 \u201cThe body they found on the rocks is that of my sister, Olivia ...she was a beautiful soul,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis pains me to even start this. Prayers for my family at this time is greatly appreciated, we are grieving at this time.\u201d Authorities had planned to search the site for additional bodies on Wednesday, but rain\u00a0and the \u201ctreacherous terrain\u201d were slowing efforts, according to Tony Cipolla, a spokesman for the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for crews to rappel down to that location,\u201d he said. Gonzalez\u00a0and her boyfriend, Brian Fernandez, 21, were last seen Dec. 23 when they left for a holiday road trip to Big Sur with two dogs, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. They were expected to return on Christmas Day. When they failed to return home, they were reported missing. The couple has not been seen or heard from since. On Tuesday, rescuers from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection searched the rugged area just 10 miles north of Hearst Castle, Cipolla said. Crews also peered inside the wrecked vehicle, which was unoccupied, he said. When the couple went missing, police had released a description of Fernandez\u2019s car. He was driving a 2002 four-door tan Honda Civic with California license plate 5VUD295. A helicopter crew surveyed the car\u2019s wreckage and spotted the bodies of the woman\u00a0and dog about 15 feet from the car, \u00a0 Although the vehicle has not been recovered, authorities are hoping to hoist\u00a0it up after the storm clears on Thursday or Friday. From there, Cipolla said, crews will search under the vehicle for possible remains. Rescuers will also scour the rocky area and Pacific Ocean for a possible body. Authorities, he said, are not sure if there is even a second body to look for. Sheriff\u2019s officials have not determined the breed of the dead dog, he said. A Go Fund Me page has been created by\u00a0Gonzalez\u2019s sister.

Brent Musburger made controversial comments about Joe Mixon during the Sugar Bowl broadcast. (Photo: Phil Ellsworth, USA TODAY Sports) Brent Musburger once was a very good sports broadcaster. He sensed and captured the moment as well as anyone of his era. As someone who has known Musburger\u00a0for many years through our alma mater, Northwestern, I always appreciated his contributions to the big event. If Brent was there, you wanted to be there too. Today, sadly, Musburger\u00a0no longer is that man. On Monday night on the Sugar Bowl broadcast, he repeatedly and aggressively minimized a college football player\u2019s brutal attack on a woman, a punch so devastating it broke four bones in her face. Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon\u2019s assault on Amelia Molitor in the summer of 2014 was captured on video\u00a0and has been seen hundreds of thousands of times online. One would hope that just hearing the news about this appalling act of violence would be enough to bring condemnation from a play-by-play man\u00a0when it came time to discuss Mixon\u2019s extracurricular activities, but Musburger had more information than that. He had the video. MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL COVERAGE: Oklahoma's Joe Mixon makes a public apology Excuse me if I break out a familiar phrase:\u00a0You are looking live, Brent, at one of the worst things a college football player has ever done. And this is what you did: After calling the video \u201cvery troubling to see,\u201d you charged right into the kind of full-throated defense of Mixon one would have expected from his attorney. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to the coaches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all swear that the young man is doing fine. \u2026 Folks, he is just one of the best, and let\u2019s hope, given a second chance by Bob Stoops and Oklahoma, let\u2019s hope that this young man makes the most of his chance and goes on to have a career in the National Football League.\u201d There was no mention of Molitor \u2014\u00a0how she\u2019s doing, if she\u2019s okay, what her own career might be like. There was no tirade against the scourge of violence against women. There was no discussion of whether Mixon should even have been on the field in our post-Ray Rice world. No, it was all football, all boys will be boys, all business as usual. The man who used to know exactly the right thing to say at the right time was embarrassingly out of his element on this one.\u00a0 After hours of preparation, the 77-year-old Musburger was still so unprepared that he addressed a vital 21st century issue the only way he could, with a 1950s answer. There was only one thing to think at that moment. Brent, it\u2019s time to go. But then along came a second chance. The social media outrage over Musburger\u2019s comments was so overwhelming that he came back in the third quarter to give it another try. He obviously hadn\u2019t had time himself to see the reaction, but he was told that there was trouble. Even then, if he truly didn't know what to do, he had the vast public-relations safety net of ESPN ready and waiting. The PR people simply could have written a sincere apology for him to read on the air. Broadcasters like Musburger read canned copy all the time to promote upcoming games and thank their advertisers. This would have been an easy fix. But no. Musburger came out with guns blazing. \u201cApparently, some people were very upset when I wished this young man well at the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me make something perfectly clear. What he did with that young lady was brutal, uncalled-for. He\u2019s apologized. He was tearful. He got a second chance. He got a second chance from Bob Stoops. I happen to pull for people with second chances, OK? Let me make it absolutely clear that I hope he has a wonderful career and he teaches people with that brutal, violent video. OK? Second down and 9.\u201d Musburger\u2019s combative tone was stunning. He made it crystal clear: this was all about protecting the young man, not the young lady. Musburger had no time for you people out there who care about violence against women. Second down and 9. There\u2019s a pattern here that should concern ESPN far more than it apparently has so far. During the national college football championship game in January 2013, Musburger couldn\u2019t stop himself from praising the looks of Katherine Webb, the then-girlfriend of Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron. The comments were embarrassing and totally out of place, and ESPN later apologized. Just a week later, Musburger was at it again, saying that a fellow ESPN staffer, reporter Holly Rowe, was \u201creally smoking.\u201d This is a sad column for me to write. I emceed Musburger's induction into our Medill School of Journalism Hall of Achievement several years ago. I like him and care about him. I tried to reach him for this column through ESPN\u2019s PR people, but never heard back from him. If he can\u2019t make this decision himself, then ESPN needs to make it for him.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A record number of endangered Florida panthers died again last year - 42 of the remaining big cats were killed, matching the 2015 record. Thirty-four were hit by vehicles in southwest Florida, where development is shrinking what\u2019s left of their habitat. The tally kept by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission includes six new litters, with a total of 14 cubs born in 2016. But the state estimates that only 100 to 180 of the big cats remain in the wild. Critics say government officials have failed to implement \u201ccoherent efforts\u201d to save the Florida panthers.

A Macy's store in west suburban Bloomingdale is one of 68 the retailer will close by this spring. (Brandon Chew / Chicago Tribune) Lauren Zumbach Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A Macy's store in west suburban Bloomingdale is one of 68 the retailer will close by this spring. In August, Macy's announced plans to close about 100 stores, a cost-cutting move made as customers' shopping habits change and sales shift online, but the retailer didn't specify which stores would shut down. \"We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate,\" Macy's Chairman and CEO Terry Lundgren said in a news release Wednesday. The Bloomingdale store originally operated as Marshall Field 's and opened in Stratford Square in 1981. Two additional Illinois stores, in Alton and Bloomington, are also among the 68 slated to close. Macy's said it expects to close about 30 more over the next few years. The retailing giant has been examining its portfolio of city flagship stores, including Chicago's State Street store. No plans for that location were announced, but Macy's said it signed an agreement to sell a downtown Minneapolis store open since 1902 to 601W Cos., which will redevelop the building with a mix of office and retail space. About 3,900 store employees, including 87 at the 149,000-square-foot Bloomingdale store, will be affected by the closings. Some may be offered spots at nearby stores where possible, and eligible employees will be offered severance benefits, Macy's said. ",

Powerful storms are set to drench California over the next few days, threatening floods and mudslides. Over a foot of rain is possible in low-lying areas in central California by Saturday and several feet of snow could accumulate in elevated regions, including the Sierra Nevada range and the Rocky Mountains, according to ABC News meteorologists. Thousands of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area were already left without power due to strong winds and heavy rain Tuesday night. ABC News Heavy rain is set to soak California this week, threatening floods and mudslides. ABC News The moisture drenching California will turn to snow in elevated regions, including the Sierra Nevada range and the Rocky Mountains. Meanwhile, an arctic blast is headed for the Midwest and the Northeast regions. ABC News meteorologists say wind chills, or feels-like temperatures, in Midwestern cities could dip as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday. \u201cFrostbite can set in in as little as 10 minutes,\u201d warned ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo. ABC News Wind chills, or feels like temperatures, could fall as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit in the Midwest on Wednesday morning. This frigid cold will begin to spread east, hitting cities in the Northeast down to the Southeast by Thursday morning. Wind chills could fall to -2 degrees Fahrenheit in Buffalo, New York, and 19 degrees Fahrenheit in Washington, D.C., according to ABC News meteorologists. ABC News The frigid cold will hit the Northeast and Southeast regions by Thursday morning. As the arctic air mixes with several weather systems brewing out west, ABC News meteorologists say snowfall is possible on the East Coast from north to south over the weekend. The first system could bring light accumulations of snow to the northeast Friday morning. ABC News The Mid-Atlantic and major Northeast cities could see snow this weekend. The second system could deliver rare heavy snow to northern Georgia and the Carolinas. This storm could then track close enough to the East Coast to dump some fresh snow on the coastal Mid-Atlantic and major Northeast cities, such as Boston and New York City. \u201cThis could change dramatically as we get closer to the weekend and the storm could go out to sea,\u201d Golembo said. \u201cStay tuned.\u201d 0 Shares ",

The officer exchanged gunfire with the man after he had shot at two others, authorities said. Chicago police officers process a scene near 63rd and Honore streets where an officer shot and killed 20-year-old Divonte Young on Aug. 9, 2012. The officer exchanged gunfire with the man after he had shot at two others, authorities said. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Stacy St. Clair and Jeff Coen Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's law department again has been sanctioned for withholding records involving a fatal police shooting, marking the eighth time in recent years a federal judge has formally punished the city for failing to turn over potential evidence in a police misconduct lawsuit. U.S District Court Judge Joan Gottschall on Tuesday ruled that the city acted in \"bad faith\" when it ignored a court order and made little effort to provide documents to the lawyer for the family of 20-year-old Divonte Young, who was shot and killed by police in 2012. In a sharply worded 24-page order, the judge criticized the city for its approach to discovery, the legal process that allows the two sides in a lawsuit to uncover relevant facts through the exchange of documents, depositions and other disclosures. When the process breaks down, plaintiffs can find themselves at a disadvantage, their lawyers uncertain they are working with all of the evidence. \"The City's cavalier attitude toward the discovery process ... warrant findings of willfulness, fault and bad faith,\" Gottschall wrote. In imposing her punishment, Gottschall took an admittedly \"harsh\" step and stripped the city of legal protections that would have allowed its lawyers to withhold some documents. Specifically, the city had argued that it could withhold some records because they were part of the \"deliberative process\" during the investigation. The city now has until next Tuesday to turn over all the records. Gottschall also will consider fining the city later this month. The punishment marks the city's third sanction in a police misconduct lawsuit in six months, and the eighth since Emanuel took office. It also renews questions about how the law department handles potential evidence in such cases, which are often high-profile, controversial and potentially costly for taxpayers. As part of reforms announced last year, the city sent about 60 cases \u2014 including Young's case \u2014 to an outside attorney for review of discovery practices. Stephen Patton, Emanuel's corporation counsel, told the Tribune that all the cases received \"a clean bill of health.\" That diagnosis, however, now appears premature. Gottschall specifically rebuked the city for engaging in \"bad faith foot dragging\" while the outside review was taking place.

Police claimed he was armed, but no gun was recovered. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) LaShawnda Young\u00a0talks about her son\u00a0DiVonte Young, who was shot and killed by Chicago Police in 2012. Police claimed he was armed, but no gun was recovered. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) Attorney H. Candace Gorman, who represents Young's mother, LaShawnda, said she offered to meet with the outside lawyer reviewing the Young case, but he declined. \"It was a rubber stamp for the corporation counsel,\" she said. A Tribune's analysis last year of nearly 450 cases alleging police misconduct since Emanuel took office found that a federal judge has had to order the city to turn over potential evidence in nearly 1 in every 5 cases. A law department spokesman disputed the court's finding but said the city would comply with the judge's order. \"The City believes it has fully complied with the subpoena in this case,\" spokesman Bill McCaffrey said in a statement. \"However, it will promptly comply with the current order and produce the documents that were previously withheld as non-responsive. We believe the production will demonstrate that these documents were properly withheld, and therefore sanctions in the form of an award of attorneys' fees should be denied.\" In the most recent sanction, Gorman has been seeking documents from the Independent Police Review Authority , the city agency that investigates all officer-involved shootings and other misconduct allegations.

Credit Tomas Munita for The New York Times For the 12th straight year, the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What\u2019s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes.com/52places ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017 . What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country? Canada has it all (O.K., maybe not tropical beaches). It\u2019s a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And, let\u2019s face it, clich\u00e9s of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It\u2019s a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you\u2019ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. \u201cTravel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place,\u201d said Maureen Towey, the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. \u201cWe ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle, a hot-air balloon or a ski lift, we say yes every time.\u201d On a computer, you\u2019ll also notice a stunning drone video, shot in Tofino, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. \u201cAfter many wet days, there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better,\u201d said Josh Haner, a staff photographer who shot the footage. \u201cAs my drone\u2019s batteries were running out, I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes.\u201d And print readers will notice something new as well: a special four-page presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall).

What are you looking for in those ideas? First, why now? That is, why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both well-known and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots; even though cities like London, Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting, they didn\u2019t make this year\u2019s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A marathon-length meeting, in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn\u2019t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are, of course, just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. We\u2019d love to hear your suggestions \u2014 use the #52places hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours. Correction: January 4, 2017 An earlier version of this article misstated where Banff National Park is located. It is in Alberta, not Calgary (which is a city in Alberta).

Obama ousted them as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the November 8 election. The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Donald Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe \"with a high level of confidence\" that Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign. Russian President Vladimir Putin Mikhail Klimentyev / Kremlin via EPA Many expected Putin to retaliate for the White House's move by booting out American diplomatic officials, a course of action recommended by his own foreign minister . Instead Putin turned the other cheek, not only allowing the Americans to remain in the country but inviting their children to the Kremlin's Christmas and New Year's party. \"We will not create any problems for U.S. diplomats \u2014 we will not expel anyone,\" Putin said in a statement. \"It is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner. Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family.\" London's Russian Embassy also tweeted a picture of a duck accompanied by the word \"lame,\" and denounced Obama's intervention as \"Cold War deja vu.\" President Obama expels 35  diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl  people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D \u2014 Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 29, 2016 According to analysts, Putin's play was clear: He aimed to emerge from this exchange as the more mature leader, focused on building bridges rather than tit-for-tat exchanges. \"It positions Putin as someone who seizes the moral high-ground,\" according to John Lough, an associate fellow at Chatham House , a London-based think tank. \"He's a streetwise person who knows how this game is played.\" Brassy as Putin's move was, however, experts say it likely had more to do with making overtures to Trump's incoming administration rather than dealing a blow to Obama.
