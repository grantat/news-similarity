    "text": "At Inaugural Rehearsal, Trump Sub Sports Military Haircut By jessica gresko, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 15, 2017, 4:17 PM ET 0 Shares Email The hair was the giveaway. The man in the black coat, white shirt and red tie who raised his right hand as if to take the oath of the nation's highest office on Sunday sported a military trim. And that was just one way to tell that Greg Lowery, a 53-year-old vocalist in the U.S. Army band, was no Donald Trump, and Sunday's inauguration rehearsal at the U.S. Capitol wasn't the real thing. But the sergeant major was a game stand-in for the soon-to-be 45th president as were other band members given prominent roles. The goal was to practice Inauguration Day events so everything goes off as flawlessly \u2014 and on time \u2014 as possible for the actual swearing-in on Friday. Lowery, who said his role was to \"look the part as much as possible,\" said the substitutes were chosen primarily because they are as tall as the people they were playing. He bought a new, red tie for the assignment, though he acknowledged it wasn't Trump brand. \"It's just a real honor for all of us to be here this morning,\" Lowery said. Spc. Sara Corry, who arranges music for the band, wore a white peacoat and nude pumps to stand in for Trump's wife, Melania. Corry, 28, said her shoes were new, and while Melania Trump's fashion choices will be a topic of conversation, Corry didn't know what designer she was wearing. Unlike Melania Trump, a native of Slovenia, Corry said she's from Capistrano Beach, California. Her husband-for-the-day, Lowery, has two sons, unlike Trump who has five children. The faux first couple was joined by Master Sgt. Neil Ewachiw, 47, and Master Sgt. Leigh Ann Hinton, 50, band vocalists who were standing in for Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. During Sunday's dry run, the stand-in president-elect and vice president-elect waved to rows of empty chairs and raised their hands as if they were being sworn in. They spent some time adjusting their positions so that cameras set to capture the real swearings-in could get the best angle, and then workers marked the spots for the actual players. Around them, the Capitol was still being readied for Inauguration Day. Workers unfurled a large flag between a pair of the Capitol's columns. Some red, white and blue bunting remained draped in plastic to protect it, and the sound of sawing and hammering could be heard intermittently during gaps in the patriotic music. Not everyone participating in the pageant needed to be a good match for the person they were playing, with men playing women and women playing men. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , who will swear in Pence and became the court's second African-American member when he joined the court in 1991, was played Sunday by a woman with long, blonde hair. One closer match for his counterpart was 12-year-old Charlie Blunt, the son of Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who was drafted to play Trump's 10-year-old son Barron. Asked after the rehearsal whether he had any pointers for Barron, Charlie said: \"just smile and don't slouch.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jessicagresko 0 Shares ",

    "text": "We Asked People What They Know About Obamacare. See If You Know The Answers Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and whose populist candidacy in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary was boosted by a strong online following and small-dollar donations, headlined the day. He was recently named to a leadership post among Senate Democrats as chairman of outreach. Sanders used his vast email list from the campaign to help organize support for Sundays rallies in support of Obamacare, which stretched from an event led by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco to one featuring Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Boston. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley even led a sing-a-long at the Utah State Capitol. \u2014 David Komatar (@davidkomatar) January 15, 2017 Warren told an energized crowd outside Faneuil Hall in Boston, \"We knew these fights were coming, and now the first one is here.\" In San Francisco, Pelosi insisted, \"We're not going back.\" Sanders and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer went to Warren, Mich., and although Schumer will soon be the most powerful Democrat in Washington, it was Sanders who was the star. Signs like, \"Don't blame me - I voted for Bernie\" dotted the crowd, and Schumer had to pause his speech for a chorus of \"Bernie, Bernie\" cheers when Sanders walked on stage in the middle of the New York senator's remarks. It's no accident that Sanders and Schumer chose to hold their event in Warren. Surrounding Macomb County tells the story of Democrats' 2016 woes. It went narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, but last year Donald Trump carried Macomb County by more than 10 points over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump's raw vote total in the largely white, working-class county - about 48,000 votes - was more than four times his margin of victory in the once-reliably Democratic state. Article continues after sponsorship Both Sanders and Schumer believe Democrats can recapture economy-focused working class voters, and holding a rally in Macomb County to defend a healthcare program is one way to show voters who supported Trump that the Democratic Party is attentive to their concerns. Sanders told NPR last week that he could have gone to a lot of places: \"But Michigan is a great state. It's a state where I did well in the Democratic primary. And is a state where Trump won.\" He beat Clinton in the state's 2016 primary. At Sunday's rally, Schumer challenged Trump to keep a campaign promise not to cut entitlement programs as he fired up the crowd in support of the ACA. \"We're gonna win this fight together \u2014 the American people and the Democrats in the Congress,\" Schumer said. In reality, Republicans have enough votes to dismantle large parts of the Affordable Care Act, particularly elements that help fund the law, through a process that allows the Senate to pass budget measures with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster on most legislation. The GOP has 52 seats in the Senate. Democrats can play a bigger role in an attempt to repeal and replace the law full-scale, which would require 60 votes. That's a dynamic Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow admitted when she spoke at the rally. \"They've got the U.S. House, they've got the U.S. Senate, they're going to have the presidency. If they want to rip health care apart, rip Medicare and Medicaid apart, they can do that,\" Stabenow said. Republicans point to big increases in health care premiums since the law was enacted, and the fact that many insurers are pulling out of healthcare exchanges created as part of the Affordable Care Act in some states. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also spoken in objection to the mandates on individuals and employers, as well as the taxes enacted to enforce and pay for the law, as evidence of \"bad policy that does not accomplish what it was designed to do.\" Republican leaders, including Ryan and Trump, say they will not repeal Obamacare without a replacement at hand. So far, there is no clear plan from Republicans for how to replace the law, but Ryan insists that will be hashed out at the end of January when congressional Republicans hold a retreat in Philadelphia. Stabenow pointed to the face that Democrats' best hope is to generate enough public support for Obamacare \u2014 or enough public concern about fully repealing it \u2014 for Republican lawmakers to see a repeal as politically dangerous. While Democrats point to the good the law has done, it's clear they have struggled on the messaging front. A poll released by NPR and Ipsos last week showed that less than half of Americans \u2014 including just 54% of Democrats \u2014 knew that the law reduced the number of people without health insurance. But, while they would rather control the agenda, Democrats are beginning to discover something Republicans have known for the entirety of the Obama administration: It's often easier to generate public support around a simplified voice of opposition, than it is to find the votes to create and pass a complicated piece of legislation.

Water slides down the whale's back as it leaps above the surface, shooting spray in the air and then crashing back into the water. The powerful ocean giants make their own waves with mighty, mid-air twists and turns. Every now and then, a powerful spray blasts into the air from the creature's blow hole. The average onlooker just sees a cloud of vapor, but marine biologists view it as important genetic material. Researchers at Ocean Alliance, a nonprofit dedicated to conservation efforts, are using drones capture the breathtaking image with aerial photography \u2014 as well as the genetic material in petri dishes. Ocean Alliance created the \"Snotbot,\" a drone they designed to capture both images of the whales and live biological samples of the \"snot\" the animals exhale through their blow holes. The team mounted petri dishes to the drone's base so that when the drone hovers above a breaching whale, the propellers create a vortex. This pushes the whale's spray down into the sample trays. Related: SeaWorld to End Breeding Program for Orcas \"We know this tool is replicable and powerful,\" Ocean Alliance CEO Dr. Iain Kerr said. He and his team have used the Snotbot to collect images and samples from blue whales in Mexico, right whales in Argentina and humpback whales in Alaska. This fresh approach allows biologists to gather new insight into the world's largest creatures without them even knowing it. Typically, scientists need to biopsy an animal in order to collect biological data. \"To do that you need to get pretty close to the whale and it's hardly a non-invasive procedure,\" Kerr said. \"When someone takes blood from us, we know it and we don't like it.\" In this Jan. 23, 2005 file photo, a humpback whale leaps out of the water in the channel off the town of Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii. AP Taking a blood sample from a blue whale, weighing in at 150 tons, is no easy task. They are so enormous that a human could stand up in the right ventricle of a blue whale's heart, Kerr said. Imagine trying to capture photos of these giants from the dock of a 13-foot research boat. The gray whale is 50 feet and the blue whale is 100 feet \u2014 only a drone, collecting images overhead, can put their size into perspective. Related: Japan's Whaling Fleet Set to Embark on Hunt for 333 Minke Whales The aerial point of view allows Ocean Alliance to capture identifying photos and intimate moments, like a mother nursing her calf. The animals are more likely to act natural because they probably think the drone is a bird, Kerr said. That means less stress for the whales and a more accurate biological sample. For the first time ever, the team is able to peer into the lungs of the world's largest animals without disturbing them. The samples they collect contain a biological treasure trove of mammalian DNA, microbiome, stress and pregnancy hormones. At Oregon State University, Professor Scott Baker is adding the information collected by the Snotbot to a catalog of 3,000 whales that he and his team have been studying for 35 years. He analyzes the whales' identities by looking at age, health and any signs of environmental threats. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about learning about this population now, but understanding it over the next 10, 20 or 50 years.\u201d \"The same way you would in the case of a human forensic analysis,\" Baker said, \"to tell us about its history in terms of its population, its associates and relatives.\" They compare the biological data to the aerial images captured by the drone and contribute the physical markings they see to the animals' identity profiles. As they continue to add information to the catalog, they can draw more and more conclusions about the future for the biggest animal on the planet. \"It's not just about learning about this population now, but understanding it over the next 10, 20 or 50 years,\" Baker said. In this July 11, 2008 file photo, a trio of humpback whales break the surface of the water as they work together in a group behavior known as \"bubble feeding\" off the coast of Cape Cod near Provincetown, Mass. AP Ocean Alliance doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. Kerr said that for whale biology, this innovative use of drones is just as groundbreaking as the 17th century invention of the microscope. He hopes other nonprofit groups will start using the technology responsibly in their research as well because it's a much cheaper option. \"There's probably a lot of charities in North America that can't afford a $50,000 research tool, but they can afford a $2,000 research tool,\" Kerr said. \"It's just amazing.\" While some whale populations are slowly recovering from near extinction, others are still in danger. Countries like Japan and Iceland still hunt whales, but Kerr said the new research could help save them. And hunting might not be the only problem. It's hard to know what has an effect on whales. There may be other human actions stressing them that researchers haven't even considered. \"We live on planet ocean,\" Kerr said. \"Humanity's future is in our oceans, so we want to know what human effects cause stress for these species. This Snotbot will help tell us that.\" Tom Costello ",

After its controversial use of the animals for its shows, the company retired the elephants to its 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida. Bill Sikes/AP After its nearly century and a half run, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus plans to shut down \"The Greatest Show On Earth.\" The historic American spectacle will deliver its final show in May, says Kenneth Feld, the chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, the producer of Ringling. Feld announced the news on the company website Saturday night, citing declining ticket sales \u2014 which dipped even lower as the company retired its touring elephants. \"This, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable business for the company,\" Feld says. 'Truevine' Tells The Tale Of 2 Black Albino Brothers Forced To Work For The Circus Ringling has been phasing out elephants as a result of shifting public tastes and criticism from animal rights groups over the well-being of the animals. The company held its last show featuring elephants in May, before completely retiring the animals to its 200-acre conservation center in Polk City, Fla., established by Feld Entertainment in 1995. Elephants had been a circus mainstay almost as long as the circus itself has been a staple of American entertainment, since Phineas Taylor Barnum introduced Jumbo, an Asian elephant in 1882. But before the traveling exhibition evolved into a regular destination for wholesome family fun, Barnum \"made a traveling spectacle of animals and human oddities popular, while the five Ringling brothers performed juggling acts and skits from their home base in Wisconsin,\" reports the AP. \"Eventually, they merged and the modern circus was born. The sprawling troupes traveled around America by train, wowing audiences with the sheer scale of entertainment and exotic animals.\" The Feld family bought Ringling in 1967 and employs about 500 people for both touring shows \"Circus Extreme\" and \"Out of This World.\" Those employees were told about the closure after shows in Orlando and Miami, on Saturday night. Article continues after sponsorship \"The Felds say their existing animals \u2014 lions, tigers, camels, donkeys, alpacas, kangaroos and llamas \u2014 will go to suitable homes,\" adds the AP. \"Juliette Feld says the company will continue operating the Center for Elephant Conservation.\" ",

President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. (Evan Vucci / AP) Robert CostaThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama 's signature health care law with the goal of \"insurance for everybody,\" while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid . Trump declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president would almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his party's congressional majorities. Trump's plan is likely to face questions from the right, following years of GOP opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans. In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and demand that they negotiate directly with Medicaid and Medicare. \"They're politically protected, but not anymore,\" he said of pharmaceutical companies. The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing --\u00a0or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill --\u00a0would address that tension. In general, congressional GOP plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the law's marketplaces and through states' Medicaid programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis., and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing \"universal access\" to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage. (David Weigel) Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the Mexican border. Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency -- and Twitter -- to usher his legislation to passage. \"The Congress can't get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,\" Trump said during the interview with The Post. Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Obama's health care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details -- \"lower numbers, much lower deductibles\" -- he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. R-Ky. Under mounting pressure from Donald Trump and rank-and-file Republicans , congressional leaders are talking increasingly about chiseling an early bill that dismantles President Barack Obama 's health care law and begins to supplant it with their own vision of how the nation's $3 trillion-a-year medical... Under mounting pressure from Donald Trump and rank-and-file Republicans , congressional leaders are talking increasingly about chiseling an early bill that dismantles President Barack Obama 's health care law and begins to supplant it with their own vision of how the nation's $3 trillion-a-year medical... (Tribune news services) \"It's very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven't put it in quite yet but we're going to be doing it soon,\" Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price . R-Ga., to be confirmed. That confirmation rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which has not yet scheduled a hearing. Trump's declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans -- moderates and conservatives -- expressed anxiety last week about the party's lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. Once his plan is made public, Trump said, he is confident that it could get enough votes to pass in both chambers. He declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats. So far, Republicans have used budget reconciliation -- where only a majority is needed -- on the initial steps to repeal the health care law. Removing or replacing other parts of the law is likely to require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. The GOP has a 52-to-48 edge in the Senate. The plan that Trump is preparing will come after the House has taken more than 60 votes in recent years to kill all or parts of the ACA to kill to adopt more conservative health care policies, which tend to rely more heavily on the private sector. Republican leaders have said that they will not strand people who have gained insurance under the ACA without coverage. But it remains unclear from either Trump's comments in the interview or recent remarks by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill how exactly they intend to accomplish that. \"I think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what's happened in the House in recent weeks,\" Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. As he has developed a replacement package, Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the law's insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. \"We're going to have insurance for everybody,\" Trump said. \"There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.\" People covered under the law \"can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.\" For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Trump pointed to several interviews he gave during the campaign in which he promised to \"not have people dying on the street.\" \"It's not going to be their plan,\" he said of people covered under the current law. \"It'll be another plan. But they'll be beautifully covered. I don't want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people,\" he said Saturday. Trump did not say how his program overlaps with the comprehensive plan authored by House Republicans. Earlier this year, Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House GOP's health care agenda. When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Trump said \"no,\" a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign. Timing could be difficult as Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Obama's law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge lawmakers on, Trump plans to attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia this month. Moving ahead, Trump said that lowering drug prices is central to reducing health care costs nationally -- and that he will make it a priority as he uses his bully pulpit to shape policy. When asked how exactly he would force drug manufacturers to comply, Trump said that part of his approach would be public pressure \"just like on the airplane,\" a nod to his tweets about Lockheed Martin 's F-35 fighter jet, which Trump said was too costly. Trump waved away the suggestion that such activity could lead to market volatility on Wall Street. \"Stock drops and America goes up,\" he said. \"I don't care. I want to do it right or not at all.\" He added that drug companies \"should produce\" more products in the United States. The question of whether the government should start negotiating how much it pays drug-makers for older Americans on Medicare has long been a partisan dispute, ever since the 2003 law that created Medicare drug benefits prohibited such negotiations. Trump's goal, however, with respect to Medicaid, the insurance for low-income Americans run jointly by the federal government and states is uncertain. Under what is known as a Medicaid \"best price\" rule, pharmaceutical companies already are required to sell drugs to Medicaid as the lowest price they negotiate with any other buyer. On his plan for tax cuts, Trump said that \"we're getting very close\" to putting together legislation. His advisers and Ryan met last week and have been working from his campaign's plan and from congressional proposals to slash current rates. \"It'll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,\" Trump said. On corporate tax rates, \"We may negotiate a little, but we want to bring them down and get as close to 15 percent as we can so we can see a mushrooming of jobs moving back.\" Trump said he would not relent on his push for increasing taxes on U.S. companies that manufacture abroad -- and insisted that the upcoming tax cuts should be enough reason for companies to produce within the United States. \"If companies think they're going to make their cars or other products overseas and sell them back into the United States, they're going to pay a 35 percent tax,\" he said. Briefly touching on immigration, Trump said that building a border wall and curbing illegal immigration remain at the top of his to-do list and that he is spending significant time looking at ways to begin projects, both with Congress and through executive action. He did not disclose what was to come on those fronts. ",

Long died from cancer-related causes at the age of 63. USA TODAY NETWORK Bishop Eddie Long speaks on Sept. 26, 2010, at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta. (Photo: Pool photo by John Amis) LITHONIA, Ga \u2013 Bishop Eddie Long , pastor of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, died Sunday morning. In a statement, the church confirmed Long's death from cancer-related causes. \u201cI am confident through my belief in God that my husband is now resting in a better place,\" said Long's wife, Vanessa. \"Although his transition leaves a void for those of us who loved him dearly, we can celebrate and be happy for him, knowing he\u2019s at peace.\u201d Long, 63, had been battling health issues for several months. In September 2016, Long released a statement that said he was recovering from a \u201chealth challenge\u201d in response to reports that he had been recently hospitalized. The church released a statement that said Long was not in the hospital, and quoted a statement from Long: \"I am recovering from a health challenge that I trust God to deliver me from. It is unrelated to the eating for life diet consisting of mostly raw vegetables that I am continuing, as part of a holistic approach to good health. At this time, my family and I are requesting that you respect our privacy. I truly appreciate your prayers and support for me, my loved ones and my beloved New Birth Church Family.\" Long was born May 12, 1953, in Huntersville, N.C. In 1987, he became the pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church which, at the time, had around 300 members. The church\u2019s current membership now totals more than 25,000. In 2010, Long was accused of coercion by four male members of his congregation. The men, now in their 20s, filed separate civil lawsuits. They each told similar stories of Long approaching them in their early teens, indoctrinating them as spiritual sons and offering them money, cars and trips to exotic locations.\u00a0When all young men turned 17 or 18, they claimed, their relationships with Bishop Long turned sexual. The lawsuits were eventually settled. Long delivered his final sermon to the church in early January. Besides his wife, Long is survived by four children and three grandchildren. 5961 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 34 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2izBUws NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Photo President Obama last month in the White House press briefing room. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times In the 1890s, journalists covering the president were forced to stand vigil outside the White House fence, querying visitors for scraps of information and appealing for audiences with presidential aides. Today\u2019s reporters are concerned that President-elect Donald J. Trump could send them back into the past. The White House press corps was stunned on Sunday by reports of a proposal by the Trump administration to eject reporters from their home in the West Wing \u2014 a move that, if carried out, would uproot decades of established protocol whereby journalists are allowed to work in the White House close to senior officials. Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, appeared to backpedal on the idea after it was reported by Esquire magazine , saying that only the location of the press briefing room was being discussed and that the administration was merely considering a larger area to accommodate the hundreds of journalists seeking to cover Mr. Trump. But for jittery Washington reporters, it was yet another salvo from an administration that has shown an unusual willingness to berate and belittle the news media, at the behest of a president-elect who has floated the idea of rolling back libel protections and, in a volcanic appearance last week, refused to take questions from CNN after it ran a story he did not like. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The sense of alarm was clear last week when more than 100 reporters showed up to a routine meeting of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. The group, which promotes reporters\u2019 access to presidential administrations, pledged to be vigilant about responding to any erosion of press freedoms. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d said Jeff Mason of Reuters, the group\u2019s president. Since the 1970s, reporters from broadcast, print and radio outlets have worked in small cubicles on the former site of a West Wing swimming pool . The reporters can walk, without a security escort, to the offices of White House press aides and the press secretary to check in on developments or to pick up the latest gossip. It was not clear on Sunday whether the administration\u2019s idea to relocate the White House press corps might extend to evicting reporters from their office space. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been determined,\u201d Mr. Priebus told Chuck Todd on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Later, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Mr. Priebus said, \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s been discussed is whether or not the initial press conferences are going to be in that small press room.\u201d Few presidents relish sharing their home with reporters who are responsible for questioning their every move. But journalists have been granted space in the White House since the William McKinley administration, and their presence as the public\u2019s representative is seen as a potent symbol of a president\u2019s willingness to be held to account. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, issued a statement on Sunday that did not address the issue of a dedicated work space. \u201cWhile no decisions have been made, there is enormous interest in covering Donald Trump,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe current briefing room only has 49 seats, so we have looked at rooms within the White House to conduct briefings that have additional capacity.\u201d Mr. Mason said he was planning to meet with Mr. Spicer on Sunday to seek clarity on the administration\u2019s plans. \u201cWe object strenuously to any move that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny of an on-site White House press corps,\u201d Mr. Mason wrote in an email. Mr. Trump\u2019s communications team has pledged to shake up the status quo, inviting nontraditional journalists \u2014 including talk radio hosts and conservative bloggers \u2014 to the West Wing and prohibiting television coverage of daily press briefings, an idea that is supported by some former press secretaries of both political parties. Mr. Spicer denounced the news media last week at a news conference , describing CNN and BuzzFeed News as \u201csad\u201d and \u201cpathetic\u201d for reporting on unverified allegations about Mr. Trump and Russia . Advertisement Continue reading the main story But initial discussions between the White House press corps and the new administration have been described as diplomatic, with Mr. Trump\u2019s team pledging to retain reporters\u2019 access to the president\u2019s motorcade and his flights on Air Force One . Bob Schieffer, a longtime CBS News anchor who has covered eight previous presidential administrations, said on Sunday that he was not surprised to see tensions between a new president and the news media. \u201cThey\u2019re not the first administration that\u2019s come to office thinking they can control every single word that\u2019s said about them,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s their call, they can do what they want to do, and if the public puts up with it, they\u2019ll continue to do it that way.\u201d But, he added: \u201cIf they think they\u2019re not going to get the same intense coverage, they\u2019ve been smoking something.\u201d ",

    "text": "advertisement Professional wrestler Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka died Sunday, only a few days after he was acquitted for the 1983 murder of his mistress. He was 73 and had been battling cancer. Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as \"The Rock,\" shared the news on behalf of Snuka's family on Twitter. Our family @TaminaSnuka asked me to share the sad news that her dad Jimmy Snuka has just passed away. Alofa atu i le aiga atoa. #RIPSuperfly \u2014 Dwayne Johnson (@TheRock) January 15, 2017 Once a legendary villain of the World Wrestling Federation who transformed into a hero character, Snuka used jeering audiences, acrobatic leaps and his famed \"Superfly Splash\" to rise to stardom during the wrestling craze of the 1980s. Related: World Wrestling Legend to Real-Life Villain: The Fall of Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka Born James Reiher, Snuka grew up in Hawaii and became a professional wrestler in the 1970s. He made his first WWF appearance in 1982, when the organization was just hitting its stride as a ratings juggernaut. \"Snuka is regarded by many as the pioneer of high-flying offense because of his Superfly Splash from the top turnbuckle,\" WWE, formerly known as the WWF, said in a statment. \"His dive off the top of the steel cage onto Don Muraco at Madison Square Garden as hundreds of flash bulbs went off will forever live as one of the most memorable moments in WWE history.\" Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka at SiriusXM studios in New York in January 2013.Images) Astrid Stawiarz / Getty Images Only a year after entering the WWF, while taping at the Allentown Fairgrounds, Snuka was embroiled in controversy . A married man, Snuka reported to investigators that he'd found his 23-year-old girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, unconscious in his hotel bed. The official investigation concluded that the death was accidental, but the murder would haunt the rest of Snuka's wrestling career and life. Though his popularity did not immediately plummet after the murder, he did develop a drug problem and lost a wrongful death case brought forward by Argentino's family. He reportedly said he did not have the money to pay the $500,000 civil judgment. Snuka then bounced around various independent wrestling organizations before returning to the WWF in 1989. He would remain there as a headliner until the mid-1990s. Snuka was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996. Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka in an undated photo. Joe Stevens / MediaPun via AP In 2013, the Argentino case returned. A local Allentown newspaper investigated the death and found that the death should have been prosecuted as a homicide. The case was reopened and Snuka found his name in the headlines again, but for the wrong reasons. He was charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Snuka's second wife said that he was receiving treatment for cancer and had portions of his stomach and lymph nodes removed prior to standing trial. The murder case against him was dropped only two weeks ago, in early January, after the judge learned that Snuka suffered from dementia and terminal cancer and would soon die. Phil McCausland ",

While some made their decision in earlier weeks, several have come forward today, citing the president-elect's insult of Rep. John Lewis as the final straw. Trump lashed out at the civil rights icon after Lewis said he didn't view Trump as \"a legitimate president.\" Lewis also said he would not attend the inauguration. \" Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\" Trump tweeted Saturday morning. \" All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\" Trump's comments have drawn outrage and messages of support for Lewis from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Yvette Clark, D-New York, said in a tweet that she would not attend the inauguration because of the comments, saying \"when you insult [John Lewis], you insult America.\" I will NOT attend the inauguration of @realDonaldTrump . When you insult @repjohnlewis , you insult America. \u2014 Yvette D. Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) January 14, 2017 Reps. Mark Takano and Judy Chu, both D-California also tweeted that they would be absent as a show of solidarity with Lewis. \"All talk, no action.\" \u2014 Mark Takano (@RepMarkTakano) January 14, 2017 After much thought, I have decided to #StandWithJohnLewis and not attend the inauguration. \u2014 Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) January 15, 2017 In a statement, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, wrote that \"while [he does] not dispute that Trump won the Electoral College , [he] cannot normalize his behavior or the disparaging and un-American statements he has made.\" \"Trump -- who lost the popular vote -- has made a series of racist, sexist and bigoted statements,\" Lieu continued. \"In addition, he has attacked Gold Star parents, veterans such as John McCain and now civil rights icon John Lewis.\" Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan reflected these sentiments in a statement released Sunday morning. \"I was planning on attending the Inauguration on Friday out of respect for the office of President, while still making it back home on Saturday to attend the Women's March in Madison,\" he said. \"However, after long consideration based on reading the Classified document on Russian hacking and the Trump candidacy on Thursday, the handling of his conflicts of interest, and this weekend's offensive tweets about a national hero Rep. John Lewis, I am no longer attending the event.\" Reps. Mark DeSaulnier, D-California, and John Conyers, D-Michigan, did not explicitly mention Lewis in their announcements, but did go public with their decisions on the day of Trump's tweets. Among those who made up their mind to skip earlier in January, the most common reason is an aversion to \"normalizing\" what they see as Trump's divisive rhetoric and agenda. \"When the new President denigrates Latinos or Mexicans or immigrants as drug-dealers and criminals, I want to be able to say I did not condone or allow that type of speech to go mainstream; That was not normalized on my watch,\" Rep Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, said in part in a speech on the House floor. \"Because the future President said the American-born children of immigrants were not capable of being American judges, I cannot sit there at his inauguration as if that is OK and I forgive him.\" Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Massachusetts, said on Twitter that she didn't feel that she could \"contribute to the normalization of the President-elect\u2019s divisive rhetoric by participating in the inauguration.\" My statement on the upcoming inauguration: pic.twitter.com/dQXE0ztvTf \u2014 Katherine Clark (@RepKClark) January 5, 2017 Several of the Congress members plan to attend the Women's March on Washington; others said they will do community organizing in their home districts. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Below is the full running list of Congress members not attending the inauguration: Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-AZ ",

USA TODAY Sgt.

(Photo: Andrew P. Scott, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2013 The stand-in for Donald Trump had a military haircut. The Mike Pence substitute wasn\u2019t silver haired. But both committed to their roles in other ways during a rehearsal Sunday for Friday\u2019s inauguration. \u00a0\u00a0Army Sgt. Maj.\u00a0Greg Lowery bought a red tie to get into the role of Trump.\u00a0Army Master Sgt. Neil Ewachiw, who was playing Pence, donned a blue tie. Army Spc. Sara Corry purchased a pair of heels so she would match Melania Trump\u2019s height.\u00a0Army Master Sgt. Leigh Ann Hinton, who portrayed Karen Pence, wore a pair of more sensible wedges. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to look the part as much as possible,\u201d Lowery said, \u201cstanding in the correct place at the correct time.\u201d That meant spending hours Sunday morning at the Capitol Building where they walked down the steps of the East Front to review the troops, stood on the West Front so the cameras could get the right angles for the swearing-in ceremony, and even marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to practice the parade. \u201cOur primary duty is to help the people who are responsible for the logistics and movement so they can prepare and practice,\u201d Hinton said. Hammers were ringing throughout the rehearsal as workmen continued to get the flag-bedecked Capitol\u00a0ready. The military music and the\u00a0master of ceremony's booming announcements of the arriving Trump and Pence families\u00a0could be heard blocks away, possibly prompting joggers and tourists wandering by Sunday morning to wonder what they were missing. After Lowery was \"sworn in\" as the 45th president, he waved to the near-empty National Mall which will be filled with people as far as the real Trump will be able to see Friday. But Lowery didn't wave as long as organizers expect the new president will, so organizers sent him back to the podium to wave some more. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Pence's oath will be administered by Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas on the steps of the U.S. Capitol immediately after Trump is sworn into office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to become the 45th president of the United States. According to the inaugural committee, Thomas will be the first African-American in history to administer the oath of office to either the vice president or president. Pence will be the first officeholder to use the Reagan family's Bible since Reagan himself used it in his own inaugurations as California governor and U.S. president, the inaugural committee said. The Bible will be open to II Chronicles 7:14, the same biblical passage used by Reagan in his inaugurations. \u201cPresident Ronald Reagan placed his faith in a loving God and the goodness of our country,\" Pence said in a statement. \"He set out to change a nation and in doing so, he changed the world. In the march of history, Ronald Reagan\u2019s time in office was limited, but his legacy inspired a generation and will continue beyond.\" It has not yet been announced what Bible that Trump will use. Previous presidents have chosen Bibles with historical significance. President Obama took his oath of office in 2013 with two Bibles, one that had belonged to Abraham Lincoln atop a traveling Bible that was Martin Luther King Jr .'s. Presidents George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Dwight Eisenhower each took the oath with a Bible used by George Washington in his own inauguration in 1789. ",

Richter, 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry, 173rd Airborne Brigade, lifts his battle weary eyes to the heavens. Sergeant Daniel E. Spencer stares down at their fallen comrade. (Photo: Courtesy of National Archives and Records Administration) PASADENA, Calif.\u00a0\u2014 No, this is not the most divided America has ever been. Not by a long shot. There was the Civil War, obviously. But more recently, there was the War in Vietnam\u00a0\u2014 a conflict that\u00a0sparked generational and racial conflict, split families, and led to battles in the streets, some of them fatal. As he did with The Civil War,\u00a0filmmaker Ken Burns will examine The Vietnam War for PBS. Made with his partner Lynn Novick,\u00a0this 10-episode, 18-hour documentary arrives in September and\u00a0will feature a score by Nine Inch Nails'\u00a0Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (Oscar-winners for The Social Network). What to expect from your favorite TV shows this season Burns, who has been working on the project for 10\u00a0years, says if nothing else, Vietnam will remind people that \"the past is like the present.\" Many of our divisions, he says, were born in the\u00a0military, political, cultural, social and familial conflicts that surrounded Vietnam, a war\u00a0that took the lives of 58,000 Americans. Yes, Burns says, it's possible that some people in our currently polarized nation will react negatively to the film, but Burns says he's more hopeful that the film will inspire people to come together and talk. That, he says, is how he sees PBS, as\u00a0\"a\u00a0place to come together and to begin to have courageous conversations.\" In the end, he says, the goal was to create a film everyone could\u00a0embrace.\u00a0\"It will be controversial, but only among those who don't watch it.\" The divisions caused by the war played out in every facet of\u00a0American life, including the music of the time \u2014 much of which will be heard on the soundtrack. That's one of the reasons Burns\u00a0says he's so excited to work with Reznor and Ross, who will write the original score and\u00a0bring a new sound to his films. And they say they're equally excited. \"I can't over-state how flattering this is,\" says Reznor. Reznor says he and Ross were contacted in the fall of 2012, and they began writing the music not long after that, \"the goal being to create a world that was unique to this project....We spent a long time trying to figure out the language, the musical instruments, that would best fit this film, and trying to figure out why they chose us for this project.\" Filmmaker Ken Burns, from left, composer Trent Reznor, composer Atticus Ross and filmmaker Lynn Novick of ''The Vietnam War,' coming to PBS. \u00a0(Photo: Frederick M. Brown, Getty Images) Why did Burns and Novick choose Reznor and Ross?\u00a0\"We knew we needed something different here,\" says Novick. She found it, she says,\u00a0in 2011 when she went to see a movie they scored,\u00a0The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\u00a0\"I lost track of the movie, and started paying attention just to the music....I thought, 'Whoever did this music, I need to get them for this film.'\" She didn't know at the time that\u00a0the composers were Reznor and Ross, and when she found out, she figured she'd never be able to get them to do it. \"But I\u00a0thought, 'We\u00a0might as well ask.'\" They said yes, and in the future, Reznor says, \"should the subject matter warrant, it's an unquestionable yes\" again.\u00a0But that doesn't mean Reznor is open to everything. \"I'm not going to be on The Voice next season. I don't think.\" Over its 18 hours,\u00a0Vietnam will try to cover almost every aspect of the conflict. Burns says inevitably it will include some information you've heard before, but most of what you hear will be both new and revelatory. One thing you won't here, however, is the conspiracy theory that President Kennedy was assassinated because he wanted to withdraw from Vietnam. \"That's just a fallacy,\" says Burns. \u00a0 8 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iA5QZv NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told NPR, \"The goal is to rally the American people against a disastrous Republican proposal.\" Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told NPR, \"The goal is to rally the American people against a disastrous Republican proposal.\" Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images This week, the House and Senate took the first substantial step toward repealing Obamacare. Today, Democrats are holding rallies across the country, in an attempt to get some public momentum behind their longshot goal of blocking that effort. Congressional Democrats are organizing what they call a \"Day of Action,\" with events scheduled from California to Illinois to Maine. And in a demonstration of just how much clout the runner-up candidate in last year's Democratic presidential primary now has within the party that he's still not a member of, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will host the most high-profile rally of the day, in Warren, MI. Sanders played a major role in organizing the Obamacare rallies, sending out information about the events to the massive email list he gathered over the course of the 2016 campaign. \"The goal is to rally the American people against a disastrous Republican proposal,\" Sanders told NPR. He's hoping the rallies are the first step toward an \"outside-the-beltway\" communication strategy that could help Democrats cut into President-elect Donald Trump's powerful ability to set the daily political agenda. Article continues after sponsorship Since Congress came back earlier this month, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders have been pushing back against Republican proposals by doing what they normally do: holding big press conferences, doing TV interviews, and making the most of their time on the Senate floor. Earlier this week, Senate Democrats talked late into the night about all the good they say Obamacare has done. And when the Senate voted to take the first step toward an Obamacare repeal early Thursday morning, many Democrats broke Senate rules by trying to explain their \"no\" votes as they cast them. This is the typical minority party playbook. But it's much harder to break through all the noise in an era where President-elect Trump can basically reprogram cable news with a single tweet. Schumer is trying to get Senate Democrats more engaged on social media. But no one else in Washington has been able to dominate it like Trump. This clearly frustrates Sanders. He wants Democrats to reimagine how they get their message out, beyond floor speeches and press conferences. \"How do you mobilize millions of people,\" he asked, \"and get them to understand that the Republicans are doing exactly the opposite of what the American people want?\" That's what this Michigan event and all of today's other rallies are all about. Sanders tapped the massive email list he put together during his primary campaign, blasting out messages about the Michigan rally, and similar events across the country. He and Schumer will be trying to make their case in a state where Democrats typically did well with working-class voters \u2014 but faltered badly in 2016. \"There are many parts of the country that I could have gone to,\" Sanders said. \"But Michigan is a great state. It's a state where I did well in the Democratic primary. And is a state where Trump won.\" Democrats are now out of power at pretty much every level of government. Party leaders are trying to figure out their strategy. But so are grassroots activists. One place many liberals are turning \u2014 an online guide called Indivisible. It's basically a manual \u2014- written by former Democratic Congressional staffers \u2014 that lays out ways that Democrats could use Tea Party tactics to fight Trump. Ezra Levin, who helped write the document, said the Tea Party did one thing very effectively. \"If they were in Texas, they didn't call members of Congress in California,\" Levin said. \"They knew that they were constituents of people who had a voice in Washington. And they focused on their two Senators, and their representative.\" That's what this guide recommends to Democrats trying to figure out how to organize. It offers practical tips like, how to effectively call a lawmakers' office, or how to best pressure a representative during a town hall. The guide's been read nearly 4 million times. Levin said he wants readers to understand that it's really easy for people to become politically active. \"This means getting a handful of your friends together, or joining an existing group. And just getting out there on a regular basis, at district offices or at member events. Or just making calls,\" he said. That kind of grassroots spirit is what lifted Sanders' surprising presidential campaign. It also got President Obama all the way to the White House. But when Obama tried to use his campaign apparatus and email lists to mobilize supporters in legislative fights, he had a mixed record. Now Sanders is trying to do the same thing. Today's rallies will be the first test of how much momentum he still has. ",

Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images A member of the Iraqi special forces' Counter-Terrorism Service stands guard next to a damaged building at Mosul university on Sunday, during an ongoing military operation against the Islamic State. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images Iraqi forces have made a crucial step in the bloody quest to retake Mosul from the Islamic State, according to a spokesman for the country's military. Iraqi Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool announced that the city's university has been fully retaken from ISIS militants. Special forces, known in Iraq as the Counter-Terrorism Service, or CTS, raised the Iraqi flag above the campus Friday, the Associated Press reports \u2014 but the troops were still days away from claiming complete control. The Battle For Mosul: 5 Key Things To Know \"Iraqi forces entered the university grounds Friday and managed to secure more than half of the campus the next day amid stiff resistance from IS militants, who mainly deployed sniper and mortar fire to slow down the advancing troops,\" the wire service adds Sunday. Iraqi military launched its campaign to retake the northern city \u2014 the last major Iraqi city still in ISIS hands \u2014 last October. The former Iraqi commercial center is the place ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi first declared the caliphate , or Islamic state, shortly after the group captured it in June 2014. And it has been one of the central pillars of the militant group's diminishing territorial claims. Earlier this month, Iraqi troops reached the Tigris River, which bisects the city, retaking much of Mosul's eastern half. Yet, as Jane Arraf reports for NPR , the toughest fight is likely still to come. ISIS still holds the west side of the city, where more than 700,000 civilians are believed to remain. Article continues after sponsorship Iraqi Troops Edge Deeper Into Mosul \u2014 With Caution Brig. Gen. Scott Efflandt, the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, tells Jane that part of the complexity of the fight ahead lies in the urban combat required: \"Picture any large metropolitan city on the U.S. East Coast \u2014 dense, older cities with smaller streets. And then picture having to eradicate all crime and any enemy force in there. \"It requires street by street, house by house, room by room operation. There's no quick way to do it. You have to walk, you have to climb stairs, you have to open doors and then repeat the process again and again and again and then when you're doing that you have to leave someone behind to guard the area you just went through. \" And they will continue to do so without the presence of American troops on the front lines. For now, CTS spokesman Sabah al-Numan tells Reuters the special forces are combing the university's campus Sunday for remaining militants. \"The university is completely liberated and forces are sweeping the complex for any hiding militants,\" Numan said. \"Most buildings are booby-trapped so we're being cautious.\" ",

The Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) says Florida received 1,892 reports of human trafficking. That\u2019s a 54 percent increase from the previous year.\u00a0 One of the world's largest classified ad websites is being accused of knowingly facilitating prostitution and child sex-trafficking. Backpage.com... The increase in reported allegations of human trafficking was due in large part to increased training and a new screening tool developed between DCF, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice and the attorney general.\u00a0 The Statewide Council on Human Trafficking also implemented specialized training for first responders and other child welfare professionals to help recognize the signs. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe increase in reports of human trafficking is evidence that the coordinated effort across state agencies to train professionals is increasing awareness and bringing more of these cases to light,\u201d DCF Secretary Mike Carroll said in a news release Friday . \u201cFlorida must continue to create and implement a continuum of services that addresses all aspects of a survivor\u2019s life including physical, social, emotional and spiritual health.\u201d The DCF tracks human trafficking by three primary categories: sexual exploitation by a non-caregiver, such as an adult entertainment club or escort service; sexual exploitation by a parent, guardian or caregiver; and labor trafficking.\u00a0 A U.N.\u00a0 report released last month found that nearly three-quarters of all\u00a0 human trafficking victims \u00a0worldwide are women and girls, and that trafficked men and boys are typically used as forced laborers, soldiers and slaves. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s report also found that children comprise nearly a third of trafficking victims globally. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

In a joint interview published Sunday in The Times of London and Germany's Bild , Trump said that he planned to make Britain's departure from the European Union \"a great thing\" and that he would meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May shortly after he is sworn in Friday. \"We're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly,\" he told the papers, adding: \"I love the UK.\" Related: Brexit, What Brexit? Londoners Upbeat Despite Uncertainty The comments come as Britain wrestles with an uncertain future under Brexit, the referendum under which it voted to leave the European Union. Since the vote June 23, the country has seen its currency plummet and its AAA credit rating wiped out. It also faces the prospect of tariffs and trade restrictions from the EU, The Times reported \u2014 a possibility that made Trump's comments that much more significant, because a possible trade deal with the United States could be a powerful negotiating tool. In the interview, Trump attributed Brexit to an influx of refugees, saying: \"If they [EU countries] hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it .. . entails, I think that you wouldn't have a Brexit,\" he said. \"I think people want ... their own identity, so if you ask me ... I believe others will leave.\" Play ",

But according to the contractor, he added, \u201cThe people who had bought it were like, \u2018We don\u2019t like this kitchen; we just want a new kitchen.\u2019\u201d Mr. Bond showed up with cash in hand, U-Haul in tow. \u201cI went in there for one fridge and ended up negotiating and getting two fridges and the dishwasher,\u201d he said. He paid $2,400 for the lot, down from about $3,000. To ensure that the appliances worked, he asked the sellers to have them up and running before he arrived. \u201cI\u2019d make sure I\u2019d call them and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to meet you at 2 p.m. on Wednesday. Can you please make sure it\u2019s plugged in and at temperature when I get there?\u2019\u201d Not everything went flawlessly. After being transported to the storage unit, the wine refrigerator wouldn\u2019t hold the proper temperature in one of its zones. \u201cSomething had become disconnected,\u201d said Mr. Bond, who paid a local repairman $200 to fix it. But with high-end refrigerators normally selling for as much as $8,000, he figured, \u201cIf I\u2019m buying it for $1,000 and I put another $1,500 into it \u2014 that\u2019s still an incredible savings.\u201d But there was still the matter of finding a new home to house all the fancy appliances. \u201cWe really wanted something that we could make our own,\u201d said Mr. Bond, who worked in carpentry in high school and as a general contractor during summers between college. \u201cWe were looking for something we could put some sweat equity into.\u201d That summer, they found their fixer-upper: a two-bedroom, one-bath prewar apartment in Scarsdale, N.Y. \u201cThe place was wall-to-wall white carpet, which was horrendous,\u201d Mr. Bond said. \u201cI think it had actually been a pink carpet that had just gotten bleached over the years, because when we moved the dining room table, there was a pink ring under it.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mirrored wall panels in the living room had been painted over, and the appliances hadn\u2019t been upgraded since the 1980s. \u201cWe just saw a lot of potential,\u201d Mr. Bond said. Underneath the old carpet, there were beautiful oak floors, and the walls that boxed off the kitchen, living and dining rooms could come down. Not to mention that the place cost about a quarter of what it would have in Brooklyn .

    "text": "What Michelle Obama Wore and Why It Mattered By VANESSA FRIEDMAN Credit It began with Jay Leno. It began, to be more specific, in October 2008, when Mr. Leno, the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d at the time, turned to his guest, Michelle Obama , the wife of the Democratic nominee for president, and said \u2014 with glee, with gotcha expectation, because it had just been revealed that the campaign clothes budget for Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, was $150,000 \u2014 \u201cI want to ask you about your wardrobe. I\u2019m guessing about 60 grand? Sixty, 70 thousand for that outfit?\u201d \u201c J. Crew ,\u201d Mrs. Obama said of her silk blouse, gold skirt and cardigan fastened with a big rhinestone brooch. \u201cLadies, we know J. Crew. You can get some good stuff online!\u201d And thus was an eight-year obsession born. Not to mention a new approach to the story of dress and power. When Mrs. Obama understood the impact of that early answer \u2014 when she saw the public response to her outfit (which had been chosen specifically as a riposte to the Palin news) \u2014 it set in motion a strategic rethink about the use of clothes that not only helped define her tenure as first lady, but also started a conversation that went far beyond the label or look that she wore and that is only now, maybe, reaching its end. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Though amid discussion of legacy and historical change fashion may seem the least of the matter, consider the number of words devoted to what both the first lady and President Obama wore since the original campaign began. Consider that for five and a half years there was a blog chronicling Mrs. Obama\u2019s wardrobe choices, arguably the first devoted to the clothes of a political figure, and that when Mr. Obama wore a tan suit to a news conference it practically broke the internet (ditto when he eschewed a tie ). Consider that Mrs. Obama\u2019s effect on fashion brands was the subject of a study by a New York University professor in the Harvard Business Review entitled \u201cHow This First Lady Moves Markets.\u201d Consider all that, and there is simply no ignoring the fact that during these two terms, clothing played a role unlike any it had ever played before in a presidential administration. Photo On Mrs. Obama\u2019s first visit to London, in April 2009, she wore a J. Crew cardigan. Here, with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, visiting the Maggie\u2019s Cancer Caring Centre. Credit Pool photo by Leon Neal A noncomprehensive litany of some of the designers whose clothes the first lady wore during her husband\u2019s two terms in office includes: Carolina Herrera, Narciso Rodriguez, Michael Kors, Maria Cornejo, Thom Browne, Isabel Toledo, Jason Wu, Prabal Gurung, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Marchesa, Tom Ford, Vera Wang, Tadashi Shoji, Cushnie et Ochs, Tory Burch, Naeem Khan, Brandon Maxwell, Rodarte, Bibhu Mohapatra, Zac Posen, Barbara Tfank, Alexander Wang, Rag & Bone, Joseph Altuzarra, Tracy Reese, Monique Lhuillier, Thakoon, Christian Siriano, Calvin Klein, Sophie Theallet, Reed Krakoff, Diane von Furstenberg, Derek Lam, Proenza Schouler and Alice & Olivia. Also Talbots. And Target. And Ann Taylor. Sheesh. Plus, of course: Gucci, Versace, Givenchy, Ala\u00efa, Junya Watanabe, Christopher Kane, Roksanda, Moschino, Lanvin (those controversial expensive sneakers), Dries Van Noten, Alexander McQueen, Duro Olowu, Lanvin and Kenzo. To name a few. Photo Wearing a Gucci gown to honor recipients of the 2016 Kennedy Center Honors on Dec. 4, 2016. Credit Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press It is, by any measure, an unprecedented list. The twin conditions of the historic nature of this presidency and the fact it occurred alongside the rise of social media, which turned every public second into a shareable, comment-worthy moment, combined to create a new reality where every appearance mattered. Not everyone listened to all of the speeches or read the analysis or considered the context. But everyone paused for a moment to assess the visual. And a couple who had spent their entire lives being scrutinized as pioneers understood what that meant, and instead of bridling at it, leveraged it. If you know everyone is going to see what you wear and judge it, then what you wear becomes fraught with meaning. Certainly Mrs. Obama\u2019s significance as a contemporary role model goes far beyond her image, but no one understood the role of fashion, and the potential uses of that, better than the first lady. \u201cShe realized very early on that everything she did had ramifications,\u201d said Thom Browne, who made the tailored coat and dress Mrs. Obama wore for the inaugural parade in 2013, as well as a dress she wore to the 2012 Democratic National Convention and also during the final debate that year. And she understood, he went on, \u201cthat people did not just want to know how she looked, but what she was about,\u201d and that she could plant subliminal cues to the latter with her clothes. Photo Mrs. Obama wearing a Thom Browne tailored coat and dress at the inaugural parade in 2013. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times Change was the promise, and change was the look \u2014 far beyond the amount of upper arm on display, or the riot of color and prints. Or the cardigans. Just because something appears trivial does not mean it is any less powerful as a means of persuasion and outreach. In some ways its very triviality \u2014 the fact that everyone could talk about it, dissect it, imitate it \u2014 makes fashion the most potentially viral item in the subliminal political toolbox. Talking heads complained early on in the second term about Mrs. Obama\u2019s allowing the clothes conversation to dominate the substance conversation, but in fact she made the two inextricable. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There have been a lot of words since the 2016 election devoted to how Mrs. Obama loved fashion and fashion loved her in return, and that is true; to listen to designers who have dressed her is to hear a chorus of \u201cit was the privilege of my career.\u201d That the first lady, a Princeton-and-Harvard-educated lawyer and hospital power player, was publicly able to enjoy clothes allowed a swath of smart women to stop being so neurotic about dress (as she said to Vogue in her third cover story, the most of any first lady, one of the factors in choosing a garment always has to be, \u201cIs it cute?\u201d). But her real contribution went far beyond giving women a license to like clothes and use them to celebrate their own strength and femininity. Just as, despite the attention paid to the study on how much the first lady was worth to a brand \u2014 \u201cI have been publishing for 25 years,\u201d said David Yermack, the author of the study and a professor of finance at the N.Y.U. Stern School of Business, \u201cand nothing has compared to the interest in this\u201d \u2014 it wasn\u2019t ultimately about revenue generation. Indeed, despite Mrs. Obama\u2019s patronage, a number of labels she wore have struggled financially, including J. Crew ; Maria Pinto , which closed; and Bibhu Mohapatra, which filed for bankruptcy last week. Rather, like first ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy to Nancy Reagan, Mrs. Obama understood that fashion was a means to create an identity for an administration. But unlike any other first lady, instead of seeing it as part of a uniform to which she had to conform, with the attendant rules and strictures that implies, she saw it as a way to frame her own independence and points of difference, add to her portfolio and amplify her husband\u2019s agenda. \u201cOur glorious diversity \u2014 our diversities of faiths and colors and creeds \u2014 that is not a threat to who we are; it makes us who we are,\u201d she said during her final speech, and the proof was, literally, on her back. While most first ladies turned to a small number of trusted designers to help them create their look (Oleg Cassini with Mrs. Kennedy; Adolfo and James Galanos with Mrs. Reagan; Oscar de la Renta with Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush) Mrs. Obama seemed to work with them all. That is not a situation that, as any woman would know, happens by accident. We all tend to gravitate toward certain designers in part because of sheer laziness: We know what suits us, what we like, and so we go there first. To have been so, well, evenhanded in her choices could have happened only with careful calculation. \u201cI am not sure people really realized the extent of what she was doing,\u201d said Tracy Reese, whose custom-made pink and gold silk dress, worn by Mrs. Obama for her speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, became her best-selling dress when remade for sale, and whose black dress with big red poppies, worn by the first lady for the 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on Washington, is now on display at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. \u201cIt was really about us all.\u201d Photo On Sept. 4, 2012, at the Democratic National Convention, the first lady wore a custom-made pink and gold silk dress by Tracey Reese. Credit Alex Wong/Getty Images Especially because Mrs. Obama not only wore their clothes, she also took their business seriously, framing fashion as a credible, covetable job choice during her education initiatives. She put fashion on a par with the movies by hosting a Fashion Education workshop at the White House, just as she had held a Careers in Film Symposium. She invited students to witness Jason Wu donating his first inaugural gown to the Smithsonian, and designers were occasionally included on the guest list for state dinners alongside officials, artists and executives \u2014 though no designer ever attended twice. \u201cShe came in at a time when the economy was particularly tough and really shone a light on fashion in the broadest sense,\u201d said Narciso Rodriguez, whose dress she wore on the night in 2008 that ushered in the Obama era, and recently at the National School Counselor of the Year event when she gave her last speech as first lady. If you think that was an accident, there\u2019s a bridge I can sell you \u2014 just as the fact she wore Jason Wu to her husband\u2019s farewell address in Chicago, a designer she also wore at both inaugural balls, was no coincidence. It was closure. Photo On Jan. 20, 2009, she wore a one-shouldered white gown by designer Jason Wu at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball in Washington. Credit Alex Brandon/Associated Press Mrs. Obama\u2019s dress choices were often labeled \u201c sartorial diplomacy \u201d and \u201cdemocratic,\u201d and they were that; she made something of an art out of pairing designers with countries during state dinners or trips, wearing, for example, Mr. Khan, an Indian-American designer, to the India state dinner, and Mr. Ford, an American designer then based in London, when she dined with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. Especially in her husband\u2019s second term, Mrs. Obama used her leverage and visibility not only to raise the profile of a host of local designers (the biggest struggle for a young designer, Mr. Wu said, is attention; she solved that), but also as argument against isolationism and in support of allies across the world. It was not happenstance that she wore a Gucci gown to the Kennedy Center Honors the same day Italy went to the polls to vote on a referendum widely viewed as a verdict on Matteo Renzi, the country\u2019s now former reformist prime minister.

Traffic moves past an icing warning sign at night on I-70 west Lawrence, Kan., on Jan. 14, 2017. (Orlin Wagner / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter A third wave of sleet and drizzle glazed swaths of the central U.S. on Sunday, extending icy weather that some meteorologists began acknowledging fell short of dire forecasts. Much of the region remained under an ice storm warning on the eve of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as stretches continued getting pelted by rain, often in areas where temperatures hovered around freezing. The freeze made roads harrowing. In Kansas near Kansas City, two troopers escaped injury when their vehicles were struck while working a crash along northbound Interstate 635. And in central Nebraska, authorities believe icy conditions contributed to a fiery crash involving two tractor-trailers shortly before 9 a.m. Sunday on Interstate 80, forcing the closure of 15 miles of Interstate 80. It was not immediately clear whether that wreck caused any injuries. Authorities say ice contributed to a southwestern Kansas wreck Saturday night that killed a 35-year-old Oklahoma man and injured several others. The Kansas Highway Patrol said Thay Torres-Ocacio of Guymon, Oklahoma, died after the sport utility vehicle in which he was riding went out of control on an overpass and eventually overturned several times. Some people lost power amid the storm. Nearly 10,000 electric customers were without power in Oklahoma, with most of those in northwestern part of the state. South of Kansas City, the latest round of storms dumped three-quarters of an inch of precipitation overnight, resulting in about one-quarter of an inch of ice. Jared Leighton, a National Weather Service meteorologist near Kansas City, Missouri, said Sunday that while the breadth of the ice accumulations fell short of expectations, \"that shouldn't distract from the impact of the storm.\" ",

Nelson, 18 years old and a Las Vegas native, was shot at least twice in what investigators told TV station KSNV was an argument that escalated on the street. Investigators told KSNV they did not believe the incident to be gang-related. The shooting occurred about 7:30 p.m. local time in the southeast Las Vegas Valley. The station\u2019s report said the suspect is a male in his late teens, who fired at least five shots and fled the scene. He is still at large. Nelson was transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he died. Missouri State Director of Athletics Kyle Moats was emotional when talking about Nelson and the tragedy in a telephone interview on Sunday. \"It's tough,\" he said. \"A kid doesn\u2019t get to fulfill his dreams in life. The football thing is a very small piece of it. Anytime a life is taken, we take for granted some of the things we have and the liberties we have.\" Moats said there already are plans in place to provide counseling for team members and coaches. \"I feel awful for our guys, because he\u2019s a friend,\" Moats said. \"It\u2019s tough. There\u2019s not a play chart for this one. You have to do the best you can, and we're going to do everything we can to support our guys. Everyone will react differently. \"I feel for the family. To lose a son is something I can\u2019t comprehend.\" A former teammate of Nelson\u2019s at Chaparral High School tweeted on Sunday that Nelson \u201cdied a hero. He was protecting his sister from 3 men jumping her. He is loved and has a huge heart.\u201d i want everyone to know that richard died a hero. he was protecting his sister from 3 men jumping her. he is loved and has a huge heart. \u2014 Drew (@DREWNERO) January 15, 2017 Bears coach Dave Steckel expressed his feelings in a release sent out by Missouri State. \"Our Missouri State football family is in shock and mourning at the loss of one of our family members,\" Steckel said in the statement. \"Richard is like a son and a brother. It is a tragedy that he lost his life defending what is right. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family in Las Vegas, and we know he is in a good place with God. We ask everyone to respect the privacy of our football family at this time as we begin the healing process.\u201d Nelson moved to Las Vegas from Raymore, outside of Kansas City, when he was in seventh grade, to live with his paternal grandmother. Nelson was a second-team all-state player at Chaparral High School, and also had standout careers in basketball and track. He won two state titles in track. As a senior at Chaparral, he was honored with the Courage Award by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He redshirted as a freshman at Missouri State. Dylan Cole, who graduated last month after a decorated career at Missouri State, and junior receiver Deion Holliman were among those who took to Twitter to express the pain they are feeling.

    "text": "By Abby Phillip and Mike DeBonis January 15 at 7:02 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @mikedebonis President-elect Donald Trump entered the week of his inauguration fending off questions about the legitimacy of his presidency even as he promised to unite the nation as its new leader. Taking its cue from Trump, his administration-in-waiting came out swinging this weekend against criticism from all corners. His aides went on the attack against the Democratic Party and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the civil rights icon who questioned the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s claim to the White House. And a top aide issued a pointed warning to the head of the Office of Government Ethics to \u201cbe careful\u201d after he publicly called for Trump to make a cleaner break with his business interests. Furthermore, Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, piqued the news media\u2019s interest by acknowledging that there had been discussion about moving press briefings out of the White House to accommodate larger crowds. [ News conferences can be moved from White House, Priebus says ] Trump\u2019s top aides pushed back hard on the notion that Trump\u2019s presidency was somehow not legitimate \u2014 a charge that stems from the allegation that Russia meddled in the elections \u2014 with Priebus describing Lewis\u2019s charges as \u201cinsanity\u201d and \u201cincredibly disappointing.\u201d \u201cI think President Obama should step up,\u201d Priebus told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think the administration can do a lot of good by telling folks that are on the Republican side of the aisle: Look, we may have lost the election on the Democratic side, but it\u2019s time to come together.\u201d (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Vice President-elect Mike Pence asserted Trump\u2019s right to \u201cdefend himself\u201d against the suggestion that he is not a legitimate president, even coming from an \u201cicon\u201d such as Lewis. And he criticized Lewis for refusing to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cTo hear John Lewis, a man that I served with, that I respect, question the legitimacy of the election and to say that Donald Trump will not be a legitimate president is deeply disappointing to me. And also to hear that he was not going to attend the inauguration this Friday \u2014 I hope he reconsiders both statements,\u201d Pence said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The combative stance comes five days before Trump will take the oath of office and address a bitterly divided nation. \u201cFor many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon. On Saturday, Trump was widely criticized for responding to Lewis with tweets that accused the congressman of being \u201call talk\u201d and \u201cno action, no results.\u201d Lawmakers in both parties pointed to the arrests and physical beatings that Lewis withstood as a leader in the civil rights movement as evidence to the contrary. The incident, which came at the start of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend, might serve to only deepen the distrust of Trump among African Americans. National exit polling from the election found that 91\u00a0percent of black voters viewed Trump unfavorably. [ Trump\u2019s latest feud echoes difficult relationship with African Americans ] Trump also poured salt on old wounds for Democrats who argue that his long history of doubting President Obama\u2019s citizenship was a racist effort to delegitimize the country\u2019s first black president. \u201cWhat [Democrats] are right about is to talk about the racist past of Donald Trump,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Transition officials deflected questions about Trump\u2019s years-long refusal to accept that Obama is a natural-born American citizen, calling it \u201cold news.\u201d Priebus said Sunday that questions about Obama\u2019s birth have \u201cbeen resolved for at least two years in Donald Trump\u2019s mind\u201d and distinguished between questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship and accepting the results of the election. Stephanopoulos corrected Priebus, noting that Trump continued to raise questions about Obama\u2019s eligibility well into his own presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. The point is not where Barack Obama was born,\u201d Priebus said. Priebus took a similarly bellicose stance against Walter Shaub Jr., the director of the Office of Government Ethics. [ Trump\u2019s business ties prompt showdown between tiny ethics office and GOP ] Shaub has publicly criticized Trump\u2019s transition team for rushing his nominees\u2019 ethics reviews, and he called on Trump to divest his business assets to avoid conflicts. The comments prompted Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, to call for Shaub to testify before Congress. \u201cThe head of the government ethics ought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political,\u201d Priebus said on ABC. \u201cApparently, [Shaub] may have . . . publicly supported Hillary Clinton . . . calling out the president with info on Twitter about our disentangling of the business over a month ago. So I\u2019m not sure what this person at government ethics, what sort of standing he has any more in giving these opinions.\u201d The comments and the prospect of a congressional investigation were taken as a thinly veiled threat to Shaub, a political appointee named by Obama in 2013 to a five-year term. \u201cWhy is Congressman Chaffetz investigating Walter Shaub for doing his job, George, for speaking so courageously?\u201d Norm Eisen, a former Obama ethics czar, said on ABC. Eisen on Twitter called Priebus\u2019s comments \u201cshocking, \u00admafia-style THUGGERY.\u201d Priebus also signaled that the news media may be seeing changes during the Trump administration. To allow for \u201cmore press coverage from around the country,\u201d the incoming chief of staff told ABC that the initial press briefings may be moved from inside the White House to the nearby Eisenhower Executive Office Building. He did not mention evicting media members from their workspace inside the White House and near the offices of the president and vice president, despite reports to the contrary. \u201cThis is all a distraction, and it\u2019s all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election,\u201d Pence said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe American people see right through it.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Bernie Sanders stands on stage during the \"Our First Stand: Save Health Care\" rally at Macomb Community College on January 15, 2017 in Warren, Michigan. (Rachel Woolf / Getty Images) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Democrats and labor organizers spent Sunday at dozens of rallies across the country, pledging to fight in Congress against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and any attempt to change Medicare or Medicaid. The party's leaders faced crowds ranging in size from dozens to thousands of people, urging them to call Republicans and protest the push for repeal. \"Nobody's gonna shut us up! Nobody's gonna turn us around!\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the Democrats' 2016 vice-presidential candidate, at a rally in Richmond that drew a crowd of at least 1,000. \"We're standing in the breach and battling for tens of millions of Americans!\" \"Our First Stand,\" the catchall theme for the protests, represents one of the the earliest protests by an opposition party against an incoming president. Brainstormed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Democratic leaders in Congress, each rally introduced crowds to men and women who had faced death or bankruptcy before the ACA went into effect, then challenged Republicans to listen to their stories. Rattled during the ACA's passage by tea party protests and raucous congressional town hall meetings, Democrats were flipping the script. \"The immediate goal of the rallies is to show Republicans that the majority of people are against repealing the Affordable Care Act,\" Sanders said in an interview this week. Healthcare rally in Michigan Corey R. Williams / AP People wait for the start of a health care rally in Warren, Mich., north of Detroit, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017. People wait for the start of a health care rally in Warren, Mich., north of Detroit, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017. (Corey R. Williams / AP) \"I think people are waking up to the fact that the Affordable Care Act has been helping tens of millions of Americans,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., after a rally in Bowie, Maryland, organized by Maryland Democrats that drew 1,500 people. \"Energizing the public around a common goal can have an important result.\" In Bowie, a number of rally attendees said they were also planning to join the Women's March to be held in Washington, D.C., the day after Trump's inauguration. Some lifted unofficial signs from Sanders' 2016 primary campaign; others said they had been galvanized by the election itself. Valencia Danner, 23, said that the Bowie rally was her first political event of any kind. Scott Gledhill, 73, said that he'd voted for Gary Johnson for president but was worried about Republicans' plans regarding the ACA and Medicare. \"Two months after aging into Medicare, I got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,\" he said. \"My bill would have been half a million dollars. I would have lost everything I had, after a whole lifetime of work and saving.\" The rallies also demonstrated how the party's restive left is shaping its response to Trump. Some activists rallied while chastising the Democrats who had voted against an amendment to the Republicans' repeal resolution that would have made it easier to import prescription drugs from Canada. In Bowie, some of the loudest cheers came when Rep.

Similar rallies took place around the country. (Patrick Whittle / AP) \"John Lewis and I are going to be doing our job on the floor,\" said Hoyer, evading the question. (He is not planning to skip the inauguration.) \"We had an election, and over 2 million more people voted to keep the Affordable Care Act than to repeal it.\" Sanders himself headlined a rally of more than 10,000 people in Michigan's Macomb County. The county, made up of suburbs of Detroit that voted for Barack Obama twice and flipped to Donald Trump, has become an emblem of the shifts that shocked Democrats and lost them the presidency. Before and after Sanders spoke, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and leaders of local unions defended the ACA itself -- but then added that reform might mean something more progressive. \"How about a public option? Single-payer?\" said Stabenow, referring to two progressive plans that would effectively expand Medicare to younger people. \"We've got things we can do.\" Sanders, who as a candidate called for on an ambitious, European-style reform of the health-care system, used his own speech to renew that call. \"Our job today is to defend the ACA,\" Sanders said. \"Our job tomorrow is to bring about a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system.\" Those plans were non-starters during the 2009-2010 congressional debate on health care. Since then, however, losses in conservative states and districts have moved the Democratic Party to the left, and the surprise defeat of Hillary Clinton has made Democrats question the political power of incremental, compromise-built policies. But for all Democrats, the immediate policy threat is to the existing Affordable Care Act. In Bowie, leaders distributed lists of Republicans to call and urged people to call their relatives in red states to get them to join the cause. Van Hollen suggested that repeal could be stopped entirely if three Senate Republicans could be turned against it. In Richmond, after the choir from Kaine's church sang \"We Shall Overcome,\" the senator had the same message. He described the late-night drama of last week's budget \"vote-a-rama,\" which saw Democrats lose vote after vote to defend the ACA. \"We wouldn't sit down! We wouldn't shut up! Because this isn't business as usual!\" Kaine said. \"Why don't we just jump off a cliff, then we'll figure out how to land while we're in mid-air? That's what they're saying.\" The Washington Post's Gregory Schneider contributed reporting from Richmond. ",

He stood strong as a Kingdom Builder, pioneering leader, and revolutionary mind changer. Long was a family man and spiritual leader who was well respected and loved for his passion to unapologetically and courageously preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d The bishop was well-regarded in Lithonia, just outside Atlanta in DeKalb County, home to one of the most affluent African-American communities in the U.S. Long has been the senior bishop of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church for nearly 30 years.\u00a0 WGCL reports he grew the congregation from 300 when he started to more than 25,000 today. Along the way he built an international televangelist empire that included athletes, entertainers and politicians. Long\u2019s wife, Vanessa Long, filed for divorce in 2011 after a string of sexual infidelity allegations involving young men. She stayed legally married to Long, however, and released a statement marking his passing.\u00a0 \u201cI am confidant through my belief in God that my husband is now resting in a better place. \u00a0Although, his transition leaves a void for those of us who loved him dearly, we can celebrate and be happy for him, knowing he\u2019s at peace,\u201d Vanessa Long said. Long, who has been an outspoken opponent of gay marriage, built his empire with charisma and a prosperity Gospel message that told followers God would reward the faithful with wealth. It was an idea he embodied, sporting jewels on stage, living in a mansion and driving a luxury car. \u00a0 In 2011, Long settled a case involving allegations of sex between him and four teenage boys . The four young men accused him of using his power to influence them into sexual relationships with him.\u00a0 Long\u2019s first wife, Dabara S. Houston, claimed the pastor physically abused her when she was seven-and-a-half months pregnant with their only child. ",

Wootson Jr. January 15 at 5:46 PM Follow @CleveWootson President-elect Donald Trump's team and senators of both parties on Jan. 15 reacted to Trump's feud with Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) In 2010, days after returning from Selma, Ala., Mike Pence went on a GOP website and gushed about \u201cmy friend\u201d John Lewis. Then a congressman from Indiana's 6th District, Pence said he was \u201chonored\u201d to walk beside a man personally recruited by Martin Luther King Jr. He talked about how an officer had bashed a younger Lewis in the head during the fight for voting rights. Lewis, he said, was \u201can integral part of the American story in our nation's unrelenting march toward a more perfect union.\u201d Now Vice President-elect Pence is one of many leaders picking sides between Lewis and President-elect Donald Trump. Lewis recently called Trump an illegitimate president and Trump responded that the civil rights icon\u00a0is \u201call talk.\u201d In the past year, Trump has gotten into public disputes with a beauty queen and the Muslim parents of a dead soldier . But on the eve of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Trump went back and forth with a man whom John McCain once called\u00a0\u201cone of the most respected men in America.\u201d It's a widely held opinion. For a lifetime of civil rights work, Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. Last year, the Navy announced it would name a ship after him, making Lewis one of just a few \"\u00a0to get that honor. The Lewis-Trump fracas started Saturday, when\u00a0 Lewis told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u00a0that he didn't see Trump as a legitimate president and wouldn't be attending the inauguration for the first time in 30 years. Trump struck back on Twitter, saying that Lewis needed to focus on his congressional district in Georgia, \u201cwhich is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.\u201d Trump said Lewis is \u201cAll talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results.\u201d Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 Lewis's statements made him the first prominent Democrat to claim that Russia's alleged hacking of the presidential election made Trump's presidency illegitimate. The feud dominated TV news shows just days before the inauguration. And it contributed to a growing number of lawmakers who have said they\u00a0will not be attending the inauguration . Lawmakers rushed to take sides, including many whom Lewis had invited on trips to Selma, the site of the 1965 \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d protests. Most notably, Republicans spoke out in defense of Lewis and his legacy\u00a0\u2014 even those who disagreed with his policies. Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) said he disagreed with calling the election illegitimate but said Lewis \u201cdeserves all of our respect. He's earned it.\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) riffed on Trump's tweets in defending Lewis: \u201cJohn Lewis and his 'talk' have changed the world.\u201d Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) replied to one of Trump's tweets about Lewis with: \u201cDude, just stop.\u201d A few, such as\u00a0Pence, tore into Lewis. In an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Pence said he respects \u201cthe sacrifice\u201d Lewis made, according to the Associated Press. But Pence said Lewis is making \u201cbaseless assertions\u201d about the election. The most recent statements from lawmakers were a stream of bipartisan respect for Lewis's role in American history. Ahead of #MLKday2017 , let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed. ",

    "text": "27 Photos Elephants stand on their trunks during a live performance of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus at Madison Square Garden on April 02, 2007, in New York City. Scott Wintrow/Getty Images SARASOTA, Fla. - Goodbye to death-defying feats - daring young men (and women) on the flying trapeze, whip-wielding lion tamers, human cannonballs. Goodbye to the scent of peanuts and popcorn, the thrill of three rings, the jaunty bum-bum-dadadada of circus music. Send out the clowns. The Big Top is coming down - for good. On Saturday, officials of the company that owns the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced that it will close in May, ending a 146-year run that dates back to a time before automobiles or airplanes or movies, when Ulysses S. Grant was president and minstrel shows were popular entertainment. Ringling Bros. Circus names first woman ringmaster What killed the circus? There are many suspects: increased railroad costs. Costly court battles with animal rights activists that led to an end to elephant acts - and the fact that some people didn\u2019t want to see a show without elephants. In a press release, animal rights group PETA celebrated the circus\u2019 demise. \u00a0 \u201cThirty-six years of PETA protests, of documenting animals left to die, beaten animals, and much more, has reduced attendance to the point of no return,\u201d PETA\u2019s statement read. \u201cAll other animal circuses, roadside zoos, and wild animal exhibitors, including marine amusement parks like SeaWorld and the Miami Seaquarium, must take note: society\u00a0 has changed, eyes have been opened, people know now who these animals are, and we know it is wrong to capture and exploit them.\u201d But mostly, in an era of Pokemon Go, online role playing games and YouTube celebrities, the \u201cGreatest Show on Earth\u201d doesn\u2019t seem so great. \u201cIt\u2019s been through world wars, and it\u2019s been through every kind of economic cycle and it\u2019s been through a lot of change,\u201d said Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, owner of the Ringling Bros. \u201cIn the past decade there\u2019s been more change in the world than in the 50 or 75 years prior to that. And I think it isn\u2019t relevant to people in the same way.\u201d Just this week, the circus made headlines when it announced that a woman would be ringmaster for the first time in the show\u2019s 146-year history. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing because all of these different experiences that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to have in my life have really blended together in an amazing way to prepare me to lead the greatest show on Earth,\u201d\u00a0 Kristen Michelle Wilson told CBS News .\u00a0 For a long time, the circus was more than relevant - it was the stuff that dreams were made of. The first circuses were created in Europe; the American twist would be canvas tents that allowed mobile troupes to go to the far-flung audiences of the 19th century. Phineas Taylor Barnum\u2019s traveling menagerie was wildly popular, while the five Ringling brothers performed juggling acts and skits in Wisconsin. Eventually, Barnum, the Ringlings and another performance-minded businessman named James Bailey pooled their resources and knowledge. Some of the early performances were merely zoos on wheels and a few human oddities, but over time, the acts became truly spectacular - attractions like Jumbo, touted as the world\u2019s largest elephant. Sprawling companies traveled around America by train, wowing audiences with the sheer scale of entertainment and exotic animals. Deborah Walk, assistant director of legacy and circus at The Ringling - circus impresario John Ringling\u2019s mansion, art and circus collection in Sarasota - said that the circus\u2019 impact on small town America is often overlooked. \u201cThat wonderful show that you can see in Madison Square Garden crisscrossed the country and ended up in San Francisco. And every place in between saw the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the 1880s, especially, here you had this huge colossal canvas city that tracked across the country. It brought the wonders of the world to your door. You didn\u2019t have to go to Africa or Asia to see the animals.\u201d The circus also heralded societal changes, she said. Women became performers around the turn of the 20th century (although there would be no African-American or female ringmasters until 2016). When the circus came to town, kids dreamed of running away to join it and its ever-changing roster of stars: the sad-faced clown, Emmitt Kelly; the daredevil trapeze act, the Flying Wallendas; Gunther Gabel-Williams, blond-maned and fearless in the ring with the big cats. The circus was so important to home-front morale that President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave Ringling Bros. special permission to use the rails during World War II. \u201cThe circus is the only ageless delight that you can buy for money,\u201d Ernest Hemingway wrote in a three-page essay for the Ringling Bros. program in 1953. \u201cIt is the only spectacle I know, that, while you watch it, gives the quality of a truly happy dream.\u201d But as the 20th century went on, kids became less enthralled. Movies, television, video games and the internet captured young minds. The circus didn\u2019t have savvy product merchandising tie-ins or Saturday morning cartoons to shore up its image. After 1956, the circus no longer performed under tents, moving to arenas. The public grew conflicted about animal acts. Circuses without animals - such as Cirque du Soleil - were smaller and growing in popularity. Animal rights activists put pressure on cities where the circus toured. Los Angeles and Oakland prohibited the use of bull-hooks by elephant trainers. Asheville, North Carolina, banned wild or exotic animals from performing in the city-owned stadium. 27 Photos End of an era for Ringling Brothers circus elephants In May of 2016, after a long and costly legal battle, the company\u00a0 removed the elephants \u00a0from the shows and sent the animals to live on a conservation farm in Central Florida. The animals had been the symbol of the circus since Barnum brought an Asian elephant named Jumbo to America in 1882. \u00a0\u00a0 In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from groups including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over allegations that circus employees mistreated elephants. The initial lawsuit was filed by a former Ringling barn helper who accepted at least $190,000 from animal-rights groups. The judge called him \u201cessentially a paid plaintiff\u201d who lacked credibility and standing to sue, and rejected the abuse claims. Kenneth Feld testified about the elephants\u2019 importance to the show at that 2009 trial. \u201cThe symbol of the \u2018Greatest Show on Earth\u2019 is the elephant, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years,\u201d he said. Asked whether the show would be the same without elephants, Feld replied, \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d And, it wasn\u2019t. Feld Entertainment removed the elephants in 2016, sending all 40 of them to their Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida. Ticket sales plummeted. The circus, already an afterthought for many, receded further in the public mind. Jeff and Carol Fouse of St. Louis, Missouri, toured the Ringling Circus Museum on a recent day. They saw the old-timey diorama of the circus encampments. They shuffled past the colorful, sequined ringmaster costumes and peered into the rail cars that were once filled with clowns and elephants and even a pygmy hippo. Then they squinted into the bright Florida sunshine. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if there is a circus anymore,\u201d said Jeff Fouse, a 63-year-old engineer, tilting his head. The Feld family, which bought the circus in 1967, has branched out and bought and created other large-scale touring shows, such as Disney on Ice, Marvel Live and Monster Jam. Each was specialized with characters and stories, but Feld made sure that each had a bit of the circus in them, as well. It was, after all, about the show. But the circus, itself, was dying. The Felds said they looked at scenarios and costs. They ran numbers and tried new things - an interactive phone app, ice skaters in the show, adding motorcycle stunts - but nothing worked. The show will go on at smaller and more specialized circuses. But come May, after almost a century and a half of spectacular revels, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will vanish, like a big, colorful, improbably long dream. Sixty-three years ago, in his circus program essay, Hemingway marveled at the way performers made stunts and tricks in the ring look so simple. \u201cIt is all wonderfully easy in your dreams,\u201d he wrote. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 On Friday, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, declared that he did not view Donald J. Trump as a \u201clegitimate president.\u201d Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts . \u201cAll talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results,\u201d he added. \u201cSad!\u201d While some questioned Mr. Lewis\u2019s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Definition of bad strategy: trump saying 50 year fighter for civil rights John Lewis is \"all talk\" over Martin Luther King holiday weekend. \u2014         Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) Jan. 14, 2017 Others ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of Mr. Lewis\u2019s district, which is majority African-American and encompasses three-quarters of Atlanta, as \u201chorrible,\u201d \u201cfalling apart\u201d and \u201ccrime infested.\u201d In fact, Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead; the world\u2019s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The 5th is hardly the hellhole of Trump's imagination. Have visited CDC there. Also has GA Tech and Emory. It is sad to run down Atlanta. https://t.co/lxnSzHQHHn \u2014         Michael Gerson (@MJGerson) Jan. 14, 2017 Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation , announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia. In addition, Mr. Trump\u2019s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition effort. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Pakistani-American parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, after Mr. Khan spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Those attacks were widely viewed to have backfired, and Mr. Trump later modulated his words about the Khans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump himself has experience questioning a president\u2019s legitimacy. He was instrumental in sowing doubts about President Obama\u2019s birthplace. Mr. Lewis, who is 76 and was first elected to Congress in 1987, is one of the few genuinely historic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by Democrats and Republicans alike. Allies of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, circulated pictures of him linking arms with Mr. Lewis at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march to fend off accusations that Mr. Sessions was a racist. Nevertheless, Mr. Lewis testified against Mr. Sessions , declaring, \u201cWe need someone as attorney general who\u2019s going to look out for all of us, and not just some of us.\u201d A few critics, including David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said they disagreed with Mr. Lewis\u2019s statement that Mr. Trump was not legitimate, which he made in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News and which will be broadcast on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Still, Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Lewis: \u201cI honor the man he is. Honesty; integrity; courage \u2014 these are qualities you can\u2019t buy.\u201d I disagree with what @repjohnlewis said, but I honor the man he is. Honesty; integrity; courage-these are qualities you just can't buy. https://t.co/ew6a5ln5Wh \u2014         David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) Jan. 14, 2017 In his interview with Mr. Todd, Mr. Lewis said he believed that the Russians had delivered the election to Mr. Trump. \u201cYou know, I believe in forgiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It\u2019s going to be very difficult. I don\u2019t see this president-elect as a legitimate president.\u201d Mr. Lewis is one of a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have announced that they will boycott the inauguration on Friday. Others include Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois. Noah Weiland contributed reporting.

Police converge outside the Westfield Culver City mall following a disturbance on Jan. 7 involving about 200 teenagers, many fighting with each other. (KTLA) Richard Winton Contact Reporter It seemed like a typical Saturday evening\u00a0at the Westfield shopping mall in Culver City, until chaos erupted. False reports began to spread about a gunman in the mall on Jan. 7, prompting shoppers to flee and bringing a huge response from local police. There was no shooter, but officers who arrived at the scene found about 200 teenagers outside the shopping center, many fighting with each other. It took hours for police to sort it all out, with some shoppers spending the entire time on lockdown inside stores. In the end, authorities concluded that the teens had gathered at the mall, intending to cause a scene, after coordinating via social media. Culver City is the latest flashpoint in what has become a consuming problem for malls across the country. For generations, shopping malls have served as second homes for teenagers, and merchants were happy to have them. But at some shopping centers, the teens have worn out their welcome. Following a\u00a0series of high-profile incidents in recent years, more than 100 shopping centers have instituted curfews or bans on unaccompanied minors, according to a trade group. The restrictions\u00a0often are on Friday and Saturday nights. In California, Sacramento\u2019s Arden Fair mall banned unaccompanied minors on the day after Christmas as 60,000 shoppers headed to its stores. The mall said it has not ruled out enacting such a ban again. That action could end up sparking a legal showdown\u00a0because civil liberties advocates say California law prohibits retailers from banning groups wholesale. \u201cMalls should not be banning anyone based on blanket generalizations or stereotypes of how teens will behave,\u201d said Michael T. Risher, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. Arden Fair is the only California mall to take such action. But elsewhere, the teen bans\u00a0are gaining a foothold. Several malls nationwide saw brawls break out during the holidays, and retail intelligence suggested some of the incidents were planned through social media.\u00a0Philadelphia authorities arrested at least three teenagers after a fight in the food court involving 30 to 40 kids. In Aurora, Ill., eight teens were charged after a large mall disturbance. Restrictions on teens in malls aren\u2019t new. The Mall of America in Minnesota\u00a0instituted such an approach in the 1990s. Minors cannot wander America\u2019s largest mall unaccompanied on Friday and Saturday nights. Versions of such an\u00a0approach have sprung up across the country, said Stephanie Cegielski, vice president of public relations for the International Council of Shopping Centers. The trade organization is aware of at least 105 of the\u00a01,222 shopping malls in the U.S. having\u00a0some policy limiting access by minors. \u201cOwners have to be mindful of the needs of their community, which means they have to consider whether or not curfews and/or parental accompaniment rules are necessary,\u201d\u00a0Cegielski said. \u201cThere is no denying that online shopping is growing and owners do not want to give their consumers a reason to turn to online versus in-store shopping.\u201d Risher said California\u2019s decades-old law, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, \u00a0prohibits businesses \u2014 including shopping centers \u2014 from engaging in arbitrary or wholesale discrimination against a specific group, and that includes children. In a letter to the Arden Fair mall, Risher warned that a business must treat people based on their conduct and not because they are part of a category \u2014\u00a0in this case, minors. \u201cThe fact that some minors may have in the past engaged in illegal conduct does not justify restricting the rights of all minors,\u201d he said. A Fresno mall tried to institute a similar ban on unaccompanied minors in 2007 but backed down after being rebuked by the ACLU and the Fresno city attorney. The\u00a0mall then reverted to enforcing the city\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew for minors. But Arden Fair owners insist\u00a0they have the right to restrict entry. They argue that teenagers are not a protected class and that they, as owners, have a right to create rules governing the use of their property. Arden Fair pointed out a series of incidents in which mall managers said teens caused problems. Four years ago, the mall had to be evacuated when teenagers who were fighting knocked down a sign and some shoppers thought it was a gunshot. Mall officials said they took the Dec. 26 action amid concerns that teens were planning more trouble. On that day, 30 mall security guards and 50 Sacramento police officers were at the shopping center enforcing the ban. Sgt. Bryce Heinlein, a Sacramento Police Department spokesman, said no teens were involved in any incidents that day,\u00a0but there were two fights involving adults. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg asked the city attorney to review the legality of the Arden Fair\u00a0ban. Steinberg\u2019s call came after residents told the City Council they  believed minorities\u00a0in particular\u00a0were being singled out. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to go to the mall and feel they will be racial profiled,\u201d Pearl Barton, an African American woman, said of her granddaughters. \u201cWhy do they need parental guidance?\u201d The Los Angeles region\u2019s largest mall operators don\u2019t have policies directed specifically\u00a0at teens. Westfield, which owns the Culver City mall and a dozen other shopping centers across California, requires civility of all its customers and reserves the right to remove anyone for unruly behavior. Westfield and other large mall operators have a significant security operation, including social media intelligence-gathering. In Los Angeles, the firm employs not only a platoon of mall officers, but it also uses off-duty police officers to bolster safety. \u201cSecurity matters are of primary importance, always.\u00a0While the company does not publicly discuss levels or methods, significant resources are devoted to security arrangements,\u201d said Catharine C. Dickey, Westfield\u2019s executive vice president. It remains unclear exactly why so many teens converged at the Culver City mall on Jan. 7. But it appears some were drawn by a social media call-out for people to meet there. \u201cIt was on Instagram that it was an event, an Instagram event,\u201d one teen at the mall told KABC-TV. \u201cEverybody just came, and people who saw their enemies fought each other.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

State security officials said fighting between rival gangs broke out Saturday at the adjacent Alcacuz and Rogerio Coutinho lockups near the city of Natal in the Rio Grande do Norte state. Officials waited until dawn Sunday before entering to try to re-impose control, said state security chief Caio Cesar Bezerra. \"This way we guaranteed a calm intervention, a pacific intervention without resistance from the inmates,\" Bezerra said. President Michel Temer expressed concern over the rebellion Sunday through his official Twitter page, saying he had been following the situation closely. Like many prisons across the country, Alcacuz is overcrowded, with more than 1,000 inmates crammed into a facility meant for 620. The recent outbreak of prison violence began on Jan. 1-2, when 56 inmates were killed in the northern state of Amazonas. Authorities said the Family of the North gang targeted members of Brazil's most powerful criminal gang, First Command, in a clash over control of drug-trafficking routes in northern states. Many of the dead were beheaded and dismembered. Four others died at a smaller prison. Then on Jan. 6, in the neighboring state of Roraima, 33 prisoners were killed, many with their hearts and intestines ripped out. Experts say First Command is exploiting overcrowding and squalid conditions in the penitentiaries to expand its reach across the national prison system. Meanwhile, the prison chief for the southern state of Parana, Luiz Alberto Cartaxo, told Brazil's Globonews network that 21 inmates escaped from the Piraquara prison there on Sunday after using explosives to break through the prison wall. He said two other inmates died in a confrontation with police while trying to flee. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) BIRMINGHAM, Ala.\u2014 The explosions of violence that have marked a broken trust between U.S. law enforcement and communities of color across the country\u00a0echo the painful clashes that marked the early struggles of the American civil rights movement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in an interview with USA TODAY Sunday. \u201cI really think the world is watching how we deal with these issues,\u2019\u2019 Lynch said in the wide-ranging interview here where she had traveled to commemorate Martin Luther King weekend events. Lynch is preparing to leave office following a tumultuous 20-month tenure, also punctuated by a string of deadly mass shootings, a disputed investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and ongoing concerns about the extent of Russia's interference in the U.S. elections. But her legacy will likely be\u00a0defined by the Justice Department\u2019s aggressive oversight of more than two dozen police agencies across the country. Lynch said technology, specifically the speed of digital media and video-enabled smart phones, accelerated the recent scrutiny of police operations in ways that many had not anticipated.\u00a0\"Policing became front and center, because technology put it front and center,\u2019\u2019 Lynch said. In much of the country where encounters between police and the public have not been in the forefront, \"it's been a real eye opener.\" \"We have broadened the debate and engaged on the issues in a more meaningful and real way.\" The \"incredibly violent and fatal (past) year for law enforcement, Lynch said, referring to the ambush killings of five Dallas officers and three others in Baton Rouge, also highlighted the current threat to law enforcement.\u00a0\"Everyone just wants to get home safe,\" she said. Of this weekend's feud between President-elect Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who said he would not attend the inauguration and questioned the legitimacy of the election, Lynch chose her words carefully.\u00a0Describing Lewis as \"a piece of living history,\" \u00a0Lynch said that the Georgia congressman is \"entitled to his views.\" \"He has earned the right to speak for himself,\" she said. On the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Attorney General Loretta Lynch speaks at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala. \u00a0(Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP) Later, she spoke from the sanctuary of the 16th Street Baptist Church, a \u00a0monument to the early civil rights movement where four young black girls were killed in a bombing carried by white supremacists in 1963. Lynch offered\u00a0a counterpoint to the divisive rhetoric of the recently-ended political campaigns that she said threaten the very gains made by King and the movements other foot soldiers. \u201cI know that we are in difficult days now,\u2019\u2019 Lynch told a packed congregation. \u201cMany worry that Dr. King\u2019s dream \u2014\u00a0and all that has flowed from it \u2014\u00a0is at risk like never before. I have seen the disconnect between the forces of our government and the communities we serve; I have seen the concerns that the voting booth will be moved out of reach, that our hearts will close along with our borders, that a prayer in a different tongue or posture will place one at risk. \u201cI have seen the fear that once again we will let a distinction without a difference govern our view of our fellow Americans, rather than what is in their hearts,\u2019\u2019 the attorney general said. \u201cAnd I have seen the fear that, with the turn of the electoral wheel, so many of us will be seen as children of a lesser God. \u00a0I have seen all that.\u2019\u2019 Without uttering a name, the attorney general\u2019s words tracked the most severe anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment to those expressed by incoming Republican administration.\u00a0Despite those fears, Lynch said she was boosted by the resolve of \u201cthe men and women of goodwill who love this country, who believe in its promise and who are working to fulfill its founding creed.\u2019\u2019 \u201cAnd if it comes to pass that we do enter a period of darkness, let us remember \u2014\u00a0that is when dreams are best made. \u00a0So let us see \u2014\u00a0what shall become of Dr. King\u2019s dream? \u00a0The Lord has already wrought a miracle by bringing us this far.\u2019\u2019 The venue for Lynch\u2019s final speech as attorney general was\u00a0steeped in symbolism.

(Chicago Police Department) \u00a0 Eugene Ciardullo, 51, a Chicago police officer, was charged with criminal sexual assault Jan. 14, 2017. (Chicago Police Department) \u00a0 Tony Briscoe Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A Chicago police officer has been charged with felony criminal sexual assault, according to police and Cook County state's attorney officials. Officer Eugene Ciardullo, 51, was arrested by fellow officers at his home Saturday afternoon, department spokesman Officer Jose Estrada said. Ciardullo was booked into Cook County Jail on Sunday, according to online records. Ciardullo is expected to appear in Cook County bond court Sunday afternoon. Ciardullo, of the Scottsdale neighborhood, is assigned to the department's Deering District on the South Side, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Police officials said the victim identified Ciardullo as the person who had a \"sexual relationship\" with her starting when she was 17 years old. The Tribune is not publishing additional details about the victim to avoid identifying her. The felony charge against Ciardullo, a 21-year veteran of the force, was approved Saturday. The internal affairs division is also investigating the case, Guglielmi said, and will present its findings to the Chicago Police Board to determine what discipline should be ordered. \"The Chicago Police Department is currently also investigating this incident internally and administratively,\" Guglielmi said in a statement. \"We remain committed to the highest levels of accountability for our officers and members and will not tolerate any activity or actions that undermine the integrity of the hard working men and women of our Department.\" Ciardullo has been a Chicago police officer since August 1995, according to city records. Throughout his career with the Police Department, Ciardullo has amassed about 40 complaints on allegations ranging from minor personnel violations to excessive force but has only been found to have committed wrongdoing on two occasions. He was given a 10-day suspension in 2001 stemming from an excessive force allegation and a two-day suspension in 2008 for a violation related to \"weapon/ammunition/uniform deviation,\" the records show. It's unclear in the records if Ciardullo served those suspensions or fought the penalties. Details of the actual allegations within those complaints were not available. Check back for more details.

    "text": "Email BELGRADE, Serbia - Fueling tensions in the Balkans, Serbia warned Kosovo on Sunday it will defend \u201cevery inch of its territory,\u201d including its former province where Serbs allegedly are under threat from Kosovo Albanians. Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic issued the warning after a Serbian train, bearing signs reading \u201cKosovo is Serbian,\u201d was halted Saturday before it entered Kosovo due to reports of a planned attack by ethnic Albanians. \u201cYesterday, we were on the verge of clashes,\u201d Nikolic said after a meeting of the country\u2019s top security body and the train\u2019s overnight return to Belgrade. He accused the Kosovo Albanians of \u201cwanting war.\u201d \u201cWe are a country which has to protect its people and its territory,\u201d Nikolic said. Kosovo leaders saw the train, painted in the colors of the Serbian flag and decorated on the inside with Serbian Orthodox images, as a provocation and a threat to the sovereignty of the former Serbian province. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 , but Serbia and its ally Russia do not recognize the split. Serbia has sought to maintain influence in Kosovo\u2019s north, where most of the country\u2019s Serb minority is located. NATO-led troops have controlled Kosovo\u2019s borders since a three-month air war in 1999 to stop a bloody Serbian crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists. Serbia officially is seeking European Union membership, but has been sliding toward the Kremlin and its policies to increase its influence in the Balkans. Kosovo Prime Minister Isa Mustafa said Saturday he had contacted the United States and the European Union to express his country\u2019s concerns. Nikolic, who is staunchly pro-Russian, said the EU and the West have never been on Serbia\u2019s side or come to its aid. \u201cWhy were the so-called international community and the Albanians so upset about one train?\u201d Nikolic asked. \u201cMaybe because it had \u2018Kosovo is Serbian\u201d written on it, and because it had pictures of our icons inside.\u201d Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo soared following the recent detention in France of Ramush Haradinaj, a former Kosovo prime minister, on an arrest warrant from Serbia. Kosovo has called the warrant illegitimate and urged France to ignore it, while Serbia is urging Haradinaj\u2019s quick extradition to face war crimes charges. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

John Kasich has gone from an \u201cadult in the room\u201d alternative in a fractious Republican presidential field, to a potential convention spoiler in Cleveland, to now facing a hostile new president who reached down personally to seize control of the state GOP. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The roller coaster ride has left many wondering whether Kasich\u2019s political star and personal influence have faded. To this, Kasich had a direct answer this week: \u201cYou know (how) they talk about lame duck? They never met me.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With his characteristic defiance, Kasich has re-emerged in recent weeks after a period of retreat that followed a painful decision to concede his presidential ambitions for a second time. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The 64-year-old Republican has vetoed what would have been one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws and Republican-backed legislation further delaying Ohio\u2019s alternative-energy mandates. He has resumed his public schedule in Ohio and scheduled appearances over the next week in Atlanta for Martin Luther King Jr. Day and in Washington to discuss health care with senators and attend President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Kasich is Republicans\u2019 singular 2016 presidential contender never to fall in line behind Trump. His actions cost Kasich control of the Ohio Republican Party on Jan. 6, when then-Chairman Matt Borges was pushed out by Trump\u2019s favored candidate after the president-elect made personal phone calls to some central committee members. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe governor faces some unusual political problems because of the fallout of the presidential election,\u201d said John Green, of the University of Akron\u2019s Bliss Institute. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 University of Dayton associate political science professor Nancy Martorano Miller said, \u201cI think the rest of the state GOP is trying to walk that line between the two of them, because we don\u2019t know how this is going to play out. The big question marks are how is President Trump going to react to places and things and people that didn\u2019t line up behind him?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That Kasich aides remain engaged on social media and that Kasich is writing op-eds and a book suggest the former congressman isn\u2019t done running for office, Miller said. In other words: This, too, is politics . \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThey may be banking on a strategy that things go horribly wrong for the Republican Party in the next two years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risky bet.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But Kasich has sustained voter support in his closely divided bellwether state. A Monmouth University Poll in October found that Kasich\u2019s anti-Trump stance hadn\u2019t hurt his overall favorability rating, though he has lost some support among fellow Republicans and gained some among Democrats. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 During public events this week, Kasich espoused a message that\u2019s equal parts John F. Kennedy and Mr. Rogers, urging people to ask not what politicians can do for them, but to \u201cstick your nose in somebody else\u2019s business\u201d to help solve society\u2019s tough problems. Bracing the state for a painful budget cycle, he says that every person is special and that the country needs people engaged in their communities to effect change. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nazek Habatfha, 35, of Dublin, is a graduate student and Islamic youth leader who petitioned for Kasich\u2019s eventual veto of the renewable energy bill. She said Kasich impressed her as he weathered the year\u2019s political blows without seeming to betray his values. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSometimes doing the right thing is not necessarily doing the popular thing. That\u2019s really the position that John Kasich is in, as I view it, and I hope that we will look back at John Kasich and say he was that minority voice that stood up for what is right,\u201d said Habatfha, a Hillary Clinton voter. \u201cRight now, popular opinion is not on his side.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Now, Mr. Pruitt, tapped to head Donald J. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency , will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in Washington. If confirmed by the Senate, he is expected to shelve the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency is charged with policing, many of which have helped him advance his political career. The impact would stretch from the nation\u2019s waterways to the planet\u2019s climate, since the E.P.A. carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming. \u201cHe has advocated and stood up for the profits of business, be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters, at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air,\u201d said Mark Derichsweiler, who led the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality division responsible for overseeing the poultry-related cleanup. Mr. Derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state, frustrated with Mr. Pruitt\u2019s approach. Photo Algae, caused by phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure, on a rock pulled from the Illinois River in Tahlequah, Okla. Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Times Mr. Pruitt declined a request to comment. But his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy that states understand their needs best and should be allowed to regulate their own environment. On Thursday, a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination, in advance of his confirmation hearing, set for Wednesday. \u201cSome claim Mr. Pruitt opposes clean air and water. This could not be further from the truth,\u201d wrote the groups , which include the political action committee Club for Growth; the American Energy Alliance, which has advised Mr. Trump on energy policy; and Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by the anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist. Mr. Pruitt, the endorsement said, \u201cunderstands that many of the nation\u2019s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pruitt, if confirmed, will take over the agency in an odd position: He has spent the last seven years suing it to block regulations that he would be expected to put into effect and enforce. Some legal scholars say he should recuse himself from major pending environmental matters, while groups like the Environmental Defense Fund are urging Congress to reject his confirmation. \u201cThe president\u2019s choices deserve a lot of deference from Congress and even environmental groups,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cBut at some point when the nominee has spent his entire career attempting to dismantle environmental protections, it becomes unacceptable. That\u2019s why Mr. Pruitt is the first E.P.A. nominee from either party that the Environmental Defense Fund has opposed in our 50-year history.\u201d Some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases, environmental protection is probably not one of them. Smog and toxic chemicals that foul the air and waterways of one state may originate from one or several others, necessitating federal oversight of pollution. \u201cPollution doesn\u2019t respect state boundaries,\u201d said Patrick A. Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. \u201cStates have limited ability to regulate pollution from outside the state, and almost every state is downstream or downwind from other pollution.\u201d Document: Pruitt v. EPA: 14 Challenges of EPA Rules by the Oklahoma Attorney General Case in point: the \u201cGreen Country\u201d chicken battle that Mr. Pruitt inherited in eastern Oklahoma. The phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure were causing algae blooms in the ponds, streams and lakes of the 1.1-million acre Illinois River watershed, which reaches from Arkansas into Oklahoma. In 2005, Attorney General Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, sued Tyson Food, Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution and to force them to change the way they disposed of 300,000 tons a year of animal waste. As Mr. Pruitt ran for election, at least $40,000 in contributions poured into his campaign from nearly 30 executives at poultry companies named in the lawsuit or attorneys at law firms representing them, including Mark Simmons, the founder of Simmons Foods; Donald J. Smith, then the chief executive of Tysons Foods; and Gary Weeks, a lawyer listed on the court papers as representing George\u2019s, another company targeted in the lawsuit, according to data assembled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and confirmed by The New York Times. That money represents about 4 percent of the total $1 million he raised in the 2010 campaign, records show . After Mr. Pruitt took over, instead of pushing the federal judge for a ruling that, seven years later, still hasn\u2019t been issued, he negotiated an agreement with Arkansas and the poultry companies to conduct a study of the appropriate level of phosphorus in the Illinois River.

It was a case we inherited.\u201d J. D. Strong, director of Oklahoma\u2019s Wildlife Department and the state\u2019s former Secretary of Environment, praised Mr. Pruitt for negotiating the settlement. Photo Drew Edmondson, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor as Oklahoma attorney general, arrived for closing arguments in the state\u2019s case against the Arkansas poultry industry in February 2010. Credit Cory Young/Tulsa World, via Associated Press \u201cYou can\u2019t force a judge to rule,\u201d Mr. Strong said. \u201cPruitt didn\u2019t sit back and wait or badger the judge for a ruling. He worked to get the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas around the table.\u201d A spokesman from Tyson Food noted that the contributions to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s campaign were made by the company\u2019s executives and employees \u2014 including two former chief executives and members of the Tyson family \u2014 rather than by the company itself. \u201cWe\u2019ll point out that our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels, and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit,\u201d Worth Sparkman, the spokesman for Tyson, said. But Mr. Pruitt quietly allowed the expiration of a 2003 agreement that Mr. Edmondson helped negotiate with Arkansas to reduce poultry waste pollution \u2014 and to monitor the progress \u2014 without seeking another formal extension of the deal. And Mr. Pruitt shut down the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies. That environmental unit had broad jurisdiction, forcing pork-producing farmers to spend millions of dollars on their own cleanups and collecting tens of millions of dollars to clean up toxic sites in the state, including poisonous waste left at an abandoned lead and zinc mine known as Tar Creek. Mr. Pruitt, in response to questions, provided a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure, but the list includes cases that were largely initiated under Mr. Pruitt\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Edmondson. What do you think senators should ask Mr. Pruitt during his confirmation hearing to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency? A spokesman for Mr. Pruitt said that while the environmental unit had been closed, environmental cases continued to be handled by the state solicitor general\u2019s unit. \u201cUnder the leadership of Attorney General Pruitt, this team has held bad actors accountable and protected stewardship of Oklahoma\u2019s natural resources.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Edmondson said that prosecution of such environmental crimes fell as a result of the shuttering of the unit. \u201cUnder his tenure as attorney general, I don\u2019t think environmental crimes have disappeared,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said of Mr. Pruitt, in an interview. \u201cIt is just the filing of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely disappeared.\u201d Residents who live in eastern Oklahoma, where local ponds and streams are still often clogged with algae, said they, too, were frustrated. Phosphorus levels have declined considerably \u2014 a total of about 70 percent between 1998 and 2015 \u2014 but the largest reductions took place before Mr. Pruitt became attorney general, as wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and more poultry farmers have shipped chicken waste for proper disposal. Still, the levels remain far above the state standard and the decline in pollution has been slower than some hoped. \u201cI want an attorney general \u2014 and a head of our E.P.A. \u2014 who is not averse to protecting Oklahoma\u2019s most outstanding waterways,\u201d said Ed Brocksmith, who is a co-founder of a group called Save the Illinois River . At the same time that he was retreating from his predecessor\u2019s more aggressive approach, Mr. Pruitt sent a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists and then put on his state government stationary, open records obtained by The New York Times in 2014 showed. The letters pressed the federal government to back down on proposals to tighten controls over energy production, such as oil and gas wells that can release planet-warming methane. Photo Ed Brocksmith near the Illinois River, which he crosses several time a day. He said he wanted a state attorney general and head of the Environmental Protection Agency who was \u201cnot averse to protecting Oklahoma\u2019s most outstanding waterways.\u201d Credit Nick Oxford for The New York Times Mr. Pruitt separately filed a series of lawsuits against the federal government, challenging regulations intended to reduce the discharge of poisonous mercury from coal-burning power plants, carbon dioxide blamed for climate change and other emissions that federal authorities argued were causing unsightly haze in Oklahoma\u2019s air. In total, Mr. Pruitt filed 14 lawsuits challenging federal environmental regulations. In 13 of those cases, the co-parties included companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to Pruitt-affiliated political campaign committees. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Pruitt separately has served as a leader of the Republican Attorneys General Association , which since 2013 has collected $4.2 million from fossil-fuel related companies , including Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries, Murray Energy and Southern Company, which in many cases have also supported the lawsuits he has filed. Given the scale of his regulatory challenges, Mr. Pruitt turned to major corporate law firms, which typically defend energy companies fighting these laws, for help. In some cases, that assistance was offered free. BakerHostetler, the Cleveland-based law firm whose clients have included dozens of energy industry players, assigned five of its lawyers to help Oklahoma overturn President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, intended to combat climate change. The law firm did not charge Oklahoma anything for the work, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office confirmed. David B. Rivkin Jr., the lead attorney from BakerHostetler who handled the matter , said that the work was considered charitable, similar to when major law firms give free legal advice to inmates at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay military prison. Environmentalists scoffed. \u201cThe industries and companies, through their corporate lawyers, are renting the state\u2019s seal in order to make it look like their self-interested arguments are being made by Scott Pruitt on behalf of a state,\u201d said David Doniger, director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Counsel. \u201cIt is a disgrace.\u201d Even federal judges are skeptical. Mr. Pruitt joined with Missouri and several other mostly rural states in one federal suit to beat back California\u2019s regulations requiring egg farms, including those in Oklahoma, that wanted to sell in the state to seek more humane treatment of hens. In rejecting the suit, the federal judge admonished the plaintiffs. \u201cThe court concludes plaintiffs have not brought this action on behalf of their interest in the physical or economic well-being of their residents in general,\u201d Judge Kimberly J. Mueller of the United States District Court wrote in her 2014 opinion , \u201cbut rather on behalf of a discrete group of egg farmers whose businesses will allegedly be impacted.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Choice for E.P.A. a Frequent Ally of the Regulated.

Glasgow Herald Email Satirists and late-night comics have not spared President-elect Donald Trump -- and neither has a Scottish newspaper\u2019s TV critic. Sunday Herald reviewer Damien Love\u2019s writeup for this Friday\u2019s broadcast of the inauguration of the reality TV star as the 45th President of the United States characterized the proceedings as the return of \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d The satirical TV review has since gone viral: President Trump: The Inauguration 4pm, BBC One/STV After a long absence, The Twilight Zone returns with one of the ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history. Sci-fi writers have dabbled often with alternative history stories \u2013 among the most common is the \u201cWhat if The Nazis Had Won The Second World War\u201d setting \u2013 but this huge interactive virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years, sets out to build an ongoing alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is, but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today\u2019s feature-length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony, while pundits speculate gravely on what lies ahead. It\u2019s a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d Twitter users praised the description as \u201cbrilliant,\u201d and \u201cgenius,\u201d and noted the paper\u2019s \u201cterrifying sense of humor.\u201d\u00a0 \"A nightmarish version of 2017\".

LEE, JENNIFER DANIEL and KEVIN QUEALY MARCH 24, 2016 An ancient technique called the memory palace helped one of our contributors improve his memory. Can it work for you? How to play We\u2019d like you to try to memorize a 10-item shopping list using a variation of the \u201cmemory palace\u201d technique. It works like this: Imagine waking up and getting ready for the day. We\u2019ll show you an item you need to buy, and we\u2019ll pair it with a common location in a home. Try to visualize the pairs together in your home. Let's play! Here we go! In a few seconds, we\u2019ll ask you to recall your list. Focus on your memory palace, associating your items with places in your home. Test begins in Let's go shopping. What are the items you need to buy today? Proceed to checkout Choose an item to begin. You remembered out of 10 items correctly. Here\u2019s how other Times readers have fared. Correct answers Thanks for playing! You correctly remembered out of 10 items, better than about of all Times readers. Here\u2019s what you missed, along with what you were supposed to associate it with in your memory palace: . One note: This game is not a perfect adaptation of the memory palace technique. The most effective approach involves places you know by heart, which is why visualizing the items in your home or along a familiar route might help you recall them more effectively. A second imperfection here is that we are asking you to choose among hundreds of items rather than having you type them in directly. As our colleague Austin Frakt notes , our brains are excellent at recalling things we\u2019ve seen before \u2013 even one image among thousands. (That\u2019s one reason the memory palace technique works so well.) But that also means it might have been easier for some readers to select words in this quiz rather than typing them in from scratch \u2013 you might have recognized the words. Still, the \u201cmemory palace\u201d is a proven way to improve your memory. One study found that the method doubled the proportion of people who could remember at least 11 of 12 grocery list items. Also, feel free to try this game again ! The puzzle is different every time you try it. More on the memory palace ",

Bernie Sanders, while acknowledging that some Americans \"don't like\" the health care law and continuing to call for universal coverage, pledged before a crowd of thousands to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \"There are differences of opinion about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 some like it, some don't like it. But very few Americans believe that we should repeal the ACA without a replacement program to make it better,\" Sanders, I-Vermont, said at a rally Sunday, one of several dozen gatherings across the country aimed at ginning up public support for the health care law. \"Know we are saying to our Republican colleagues: We will not allow you to throw up to 30 million Americans off of health insurance,\" he said. Sanders appeared alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, both of Michigan's Democratic senators and a handful of the state's House members, as well as a number of progressive activists. According to Sanders, Democrats organized 70 rallies Sunday from Maine to California as part of their campaign to defend the law against Republican efforts to dismantle it.

Related: Six Things You Might Not Know Could Go With Obamacare Repeal The House voted Friday along party lines to instruct committees to finish drafting legislation to repeal the ACA by Jan. 27, following a Senate vote in favor of the same measure Thursday. It's the first step in what many experts expect to be a long road to repealing and replacing the law. Republicans are grappling over whether to repeal and replace the law at the same time \u2014 a process that could take months as Republicans work to draft an alternative \u2014 or to fulfill their campaign promises by repealing it as soon as possible, even if they don't have a viable replacement plan.

Police investigate the scene where two people were shot near the intersection of West 47th Street & South Marshfield Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, Jan. 15, 2017. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staff Contact Reporter A man was killed in Ukrainian Village and seven\u00a0other people were wounded in Chicago shootings from Sunday afternoon to\u00a0early Monday, police said. The fatal shooting was at 1:10 a.m. Monday, when a 36-year-old man was shot in the 2200 block of West Chicago Avenue. A shooter\u00a0in a black SUV chased him to the corner of Chicago and Oakley avenues and shot him in the abdomen, face and left leg. The man collapsed outside Fatso's Last Stand, a popular neighborhood hot dog joint whose door was shattered in the shooting. He was taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition and later pronounced dead. Other shootings: At 1:45 a.m. Monday, a 28-year-old man was shot in the West Chatham neighborhood. He was in the passenger seat of a parked car when two people walked up and fired shots. He was shot in the hip and got himself to Saint Bernard Hospital. His condition was stabilized. About 12:25 a.m., a 28-year-old man was shot in Englewood. He was walking on the sidewalk in the 6900 block of South Normal Avenue when someone fired shots from a silver sedan and he was shot in the hip. He went to Advocate Christ Medical Center and his condition was stabilized. About 8:10 p.m. Sunday, a 33-year-old man was shot in the South Austin neighborhood. He got himself to West Suburban Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the lower left leg after being shot during a robbery in the 600 block of North Leclaire Avenue, police said. He was listed in good condition. Ten minutes before that, a 36-year-old woman was shot in the Brainerd neighborhood. She was shot in the leg in the 600 block of West 95th Street and then went to Advocate Christ Medical Center. Her condition was stabilized.

Moscow Optimistic of Improving Relations Under Trump 1:40 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170116012136if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/855520835646\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> NEW YORK \u2014 The outgoing CIA director charged on Sunday that Donald Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies. John Brennan's pointed message on national television came just five days before Trump becomes the nation's 45th president amid lingering questions about Russia's role in the 2016 election even as the focus shifts to the challenges of governing. \"Now that he's going to have an opportunity to do something for our national security as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. and national security interests are protected,\" Brennan said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" warning that the president-elect's impulsivity could be dangerous. \"Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests,\" Brennan declared. CIA Director John Brennan testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee in Washington, D.C., in June. Yuri Gripas / Reuters Trump, who has unleashed a series of aggressive tweets against the U.S. intelligence community and his political rivals in recent weeks, did not respond to Brennan's criticism. The president-elect remained behind closed doors in his Manhattan high rise Sunday as his team worked to answer questions about his plans at home and abroad once he's sworn into office on Friday. Among Trump's immediate challenges: the United States' complicated relationship with Russia, crafting an affordable health care alternative that doesn't strip coverage from millions of Americans, and growing questions about the legitimacy of his presidency. Related: Trump Open to Lifting Russia Sanctions, Not Committed to 'One China' Policy: Report Civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., is among several Democrats in Congress who vowed to skip Trump's inauguration, charging that Russian interference in the 2016 election delegitimizes his presidency. \"There will be many more members who join us in this decision,\" Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., wrote Saturday on his Facebook page. Trump's lieutenants pushed back hard Sunday in a round of television interviews.

Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he hopes Lewis will change his mind and attend. Priebus later acknowledged that conservatives \u2014 led by Trump himself \u2014 spent years questioning Obama's eligibility to serve as president, suggesting he was not born in the United States. Trump has done little to encourage unity in recent days, instead inflaming tensions with his critics through a series of tweets. The incoming president tweeted Saturday that Lewis should pay more attention to his \"crime ridden\" Atlanta-area district, adding that the civil rights leader was \"all talk.\" Lewis suffered a fractured skull when he led a march in Selma, Alabama, more than a half century ago and has devoted his life to civil rights. The current White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said \"Lewis has literally fought, bled and gone to jail\" during what he called his \"remarkable life.\" He encouraged the incoming president to move past Lewis' criticism. \"That would be the kind of thing that would not only send a message to the American people that we're prepared to work together, but would also send a message to the Russians that we are united,\" McDonough said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Questions about Trump's relationship with Russia have dominated the days leading up to his inauguration. Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn, who is set to become Trump's national security adviser, has been in frequent contact with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for the alleged election hacking, a senior U.S. official said. After initially denying the contact took place, Trump's team publicly acknowledged the conversations on Sunday. \"The conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats,\" said Vice President-elect Mike Pence, also in an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions would raise questions about whether Trump's team discussed \u2014 or even helped shape \u2014 Russia's response. Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the sanctions or the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, a decision Trump quickly praised. Trump has repeatedly called for a better relationship between the U.S. and Putin's government. He suggested in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday that he'd consider easing the latest sanctions on Russia. \"I think he has to be mindful that he does not have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road,\" Brennan said. The CIA chief roundly denounced Trump's approach to Russia and other national security threats, suggesting the president-elect has much to understand before he can make informed decisions on such matters. \"The world is watching now what Trump says and listening very carefully. If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies as well as our adversaries?\" Brennan said. \"It's more than just about Mr. Trump,\" he said.

    "text": "advertisement A plan by Donald Trump to toss out dozens of ambassadors on the day he takes office risks months of uncertainty in some of the most sensitive parts of the world, according to several experts. The president-elect's stance that all politically appointed ambassadors must, with no exceptions, be gone from Day One risks cutting off nations' direct line to the president while Congress wades through the lengthy process of approving their successors, analysts said. \u201cAmbassadors can calm down any anxiety\u201d This could be especially pertinent because of Trump's penchant for making candid foreign policy statements from his Twitter account; a good ambassador might be able to provide their host government with reassurances and explanation perhaps absent from the president-elect's forthright 140-character messages. \"You do not want to have a situation where countries are left without a direct link to the president for that long,\" said Julianne Smith, director of the Strategy and Statecraft Program at the Center for a New American Security , a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. It's standard procedure for all ambassadors appointed by an administration to leave their posts at the end of the president's final term. But this process is usually staggered, with some diplomats taking a so-called \"grace period\" and leaving their offices weeks or even months after the inauguration. This can be because of family reasons, if the diplomat has school-aged kids, for example, or because there's a crisis in the host country that the ambassador's familiar hand can help steer. In a move to make a mark on Day One, Trump has signaled he will not allow any politically appointed ambassador to take this grace period, a senior State Department official told NBC News. The New York Times also spoke with several American diplomats who saw a cable saying much the same. All of them, without question, will have to be out by the afternoon of Jan. 20. This will mean U.S. embassies in countries such as China, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia, and across Western Europe will be looking for a new ambassador come the end of this month. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Lin Hui / Imaginechina via AP In total, ambassadorships for some 80 countries, international agencies, and issues (the ambassador at large for global women's issues, for example) will be vacant all at once. Any new appointments will have to be approved by Congress, a lengthy process in the easiest of times, but a potentially months-long slog when there are dozens of envoys to get through. The embassies would not be rudderless during this time. When there is no ambassador the deputy mission chief takes over as what's known as a \"charg\u00e9 d'affaires.\" These people are almost always senior career diplomats themselves, and perhaps even more versed in foreign policy than their politically appointed bosses. But this is no substitute for the symbolic importance of an ambassador, according to Smith. \"If you're a country where you have got some friction with the U.S. ... you are going to find yourself without an interlocutor,\" she said. \"Number twos are often very capable senior diplomats, but in times of crisis these countries want someone with a direct line to the president.\" Politically-appointed diplomats are usually either major fundraisers for the president or his political allies. They make up around 35 percent of the ambassadors currently in service, according to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity , a nonprofit journalism organization based in Washington. The other 65 percent are career ambassadors, people who have risen through the diplomatic service and are mostly based in Africa, South America and some of Asia. Even in the internet age, where the State Department can spread its message from Washington using mass-media, the subtle, personal touch of a good ambassador is as vital as ever, according to Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute , a London-based think tank. \"Messages that you broadcast to the world are not the same as the ones you want to deliver in person,\" he said. Donald Trump Drew Angerer / Getty Images Furthermore, at a time when the loudest messages coming out of Washington may well be emanating from the next president's social media accounts, an ambassador who has a good relationship with his or her host country could be crucial in providing context. \"Mixed signals are also dangerous. Ambassadors can calm down any anxiety,\" said Smith, at the Center for a New American Security. \"Without that, countries reading Twitter and press releases could be left guessing.\" Professor Scott Lucas, a U.S. foreign policy expert at England's University of Birmingham, agreed that forcing all ambassadors out from day one was \"an absolutely risky move.\" He said the policy was unsurprising given what he said were the the president-elect's other bombastic pronouncements before taking office. \"It's very much, 'My way or the highway,'\" Lucas said. \"He is saying, 'We are in charge and we set the rules.' But it's done in not a very thought-out way.\" Like Trump's statements questioning America's intelligence community over alleged Russian hacking , his ripping-up-trees approach to diplomatic officials is bad for morale, the professor added. \"You have a president-elect who has shown no respect for serving personnel,\" he said. Not everyone agrees the move will be so detrimental. Among them is James Edward Hoare, an associate fellow at London's Chatham House think tank. \"Diplomacy will carry on, with the professional staff stepping in until Mr. Trump has made his new political appointments,\" he said. \"While [Trump's decision] indicates a lack of generosity and a wish to show who is in charge, as well as a certain amount of personal inconvenience to those concerned, [the ambassadors] must have all known that they would be out of office pretty soon after mid-January.\" How countries will react to long periods without an ambassador is hard to judge. Japan and South Korea, both nervously eyeing their noisy neighbor North Korea, will both be without ambassadors, as will China. Trump spent much of his candidacy attacking Beijing, but his pick for ambassador , Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, has described Chinese President Xi Jinping as an \"old friend.\" This position will be a priority appointment for Trump. But given its high-profile nature, particularly in Trump's administration, the ambassadorship's approval is going to be met with \"a lot of scrutiny\" in congress, according to Smith. Saudi Arabia, a member of the anti-ISIS coalition, will also be looking for a new top diplomat, as will India, Australia, and a Western Europe beset by a migration crisis, terror threats and a resurgent Russia. \"Countries [without ambassadors] will left in the dark, and they could choose to take advantage of that and make a risky move,\" Smith said. \"If they are not getting a signal right away they may think that's a chance to test the new administration.\" Alexander Smith ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook Incoming Trump White House officials downplayed reports Sunday that the nascent Trump administration is planning to move reporters out of the White House, saying the issue is where to hold news conferences and briefings at the start of the new presidency. \"The only thing that's been discussed is whether or not the initial press conferences are going to be in that small press (room),\" incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told ABC's This Week . \"The press room that people see on TV is very, very tiny,\" including only 49 seats for reporters. Priebus responded to an Esquire story saying that \"a\u00a0plan to evict the press corps from the White House is under serious consideration by the incoming Trump Administration.\" Proposals include moving the press to the Old Executive Office Building, next to White House, or to the White House Conference Center, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the executive mansion. Some of the talk reflects long-standing friction between Team Trump and the media,\u00a0\"I want 'em out of the building,\" one unnamed Trump official told Esquire about the White House press corps. \"We are taking back the press room.\" Reporters have had work stations in the White House for more than a century.\u00a0The current White House press room, including the briefing room as well as work desks,\u00a0sits atop an old indoor swimming pool, and has been around since the Nixon administration. The room where news briefings and press conference are held features 49 theater-style seats, though there is standing room for reporters who want to attend events of special interest. Trump officials who hit the talk show circuit this weekend said the location of briefings and news conference is the issue, noting that hundreds and hundreds of journalists applied for credentials to Trump news conference last week. \"The one thing that we discussed was whether or not we want to move the initial press conferences in the Executive Office Building, which, by the way, is the White House (complex),\" Priebus said. \"So no one is moving out of the White House.\" Vice President-elect Mike Pence told CBS' Face The Nation: \"I think no decisions have been made on that yet.\" Jeff Mason, current president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said he will meet with incoming Press Secretary Sean Spicer to seek clarify on their plans. The association \"will fight to keep the briefing room and West Wing access to senior administration officials open,\" said Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters. \"We object strenuously to any move that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny of an on-site White House press corps.\" Stay with USA TODAY for full coverage of the 2017\u00a0 inauguration .

    "text": "Photos by Matt McClain Published on January 12, 2017 NEW YORK \u2014 A peculiar droning sound emanates from the stage of the Broadhurst Theatre on West 44th Street minutes before the start of that evening\u2019s performance of \u201cThe Front Page.\u201d Standing backstage, just behind the realistic set of a Chicago courthouse pressroom of the 1920s, you begin to make out the jumble of consonants and vowels that the actors are repeating in unison: \u201cBenedict Cumberbatch,\u201d \u201cBenedict Cumberbatch,\u201d \u201cBenedict Cumberbatch,\u201d \u201cBenedict Cumberbatch . . . \u201d Meet the cast It might be amusing for the faraway Cumberbatch to learn that his name is invoked by the likes of Nathan Lane, John Slattery, John Goodman and a herd of other accomplished actors before the curtain rises on the sold-out Broadway revival of \u201cThe Front Page.\u201d Not in benediction, but as an exercise in diction. The play\u2019s rat-a-tat dialogue must be delivered over the course of three acts so crisply by the newsmen, politicians, cops, socialites and other assorted schleps, mobsters, street walkers and convicts who populate Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur\u2019s 1928 script that regular maintenance of enunciation and projection is needed. Therefore, limbering the tongue with a chorus of Cumberbatches is one of a number of preparation rituals these stage veterans, ages 29 to 85, execute as an audience 1,100 strong settles in each night for nearly three hours of bracing comedy and drama. Wandering the warren of alcoves on two floors that defines the play\u2019s backstage world, you\u2019re likely to witness any number of these rituals: Goodman, who plays Sheriff Hartman, an oafish Chicago lawman, lying on the floor by the prop shelves and going through his warm-up calisthenics; Slattery, climbing the steps from the basement, muttering some of his lines as star reporter Hildy Johnson; Jefferson Mays, a Tony winner for \u201cI Am My Own Wife,\u201d racing back and forth across the length of the backstage like a harried commuter, before slipping on gloves and entering as pompous reporter Bensinger of the Tribune. Video #1 subheadline Then there\u2019s Robert Morse, whose career stretches from the original Broadway production of \u201cHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\u201d to TV\u2019s \u201cMad Men.\u201d Waiting to go on midway through the play as Mr. Pincus, a bewildered government clerk, Morse is available in the meantime to kibitz in the basement greenroom, imparting wisdom on such topics as why the first raising of the curtain is such a bellwether moment for the show: \u201cWe all listen to the applause for the set,\u201d Morse says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get that applause, it\u2019s going to be a lousy evening.\u201d Robert Morse prepares backstage for his role as Mr. Pincus, a bewildered government clerk. \u201cI\u2019m 85 and playing 25,\u201d Morse said. \u201cAnd getting away with it!\u201d The point is to have as few of those as possible. Washington Post videographer McKenna Ewen, photographer Matt McClain and I spent the production\u2019s 86th through 88th performances backstage last month to answer this question: How does a cast of 25 actors, plus a dozen stage managers, stagehands, electricians, dressers, props handlers and makeup artists get into the proper groove to envelop a Broadway audience in the antics of an 88-year-old play? Musicals these days are often as large or even larger. But rising costs and a shrinking pool of interested theatergoers have made straight plays of this magnitude an extreme rarity on Broadway. It\u2019s a complex organism, a Broadway production of this caliber, with a backstage so teeming with experience, talent and ego it could be the subject of an anthropology class. Or as Lane puts it as he sits in his prime-location dressing room, the one with the shortest walk to the stage: \u201cWorking on this play and seeing how the machinery works, it\u2019s like mathematics.\u201d Christopher McDonald, seated, who plays Murphy of the Journal, and Lewis J. Stadlen, who plays Endicott, are seen in their dressing room. As Nathan Lane delivers his lines onstage, McDonald mouths them along with him backstage, and gives a victory gesture with each laugh from the audience. ACT 1 Much of the play\u2019s formula is entrusted to the mind and annotated script of production stage manager Tripp Phillips. At this point in December of the play\u2019s run \u2014 it had its official, and mostly well-received, opening in late October \u2014 the show\u2019s machinery is well oiled. It now ends about 10 minutes earlier than six weeks ago, thanks largely to the cast\u2019s improved mastery of the play\u2019s rhythms. In the absence of director Jack O\u2019Brien, whose guidance for the most part ended on opening night, Phillips is the production\u2019s field marshal. At his console just offstage right, he \u201ccalls\u201d the show through a headset and panels of switches that let the head electrician in the lighting booth, and the sound man and a carpenter at other stations, know when to activate each of the 200 lighting cues, as well as separate cues for such sound and special effects as ricocheting bullets, ringing phones, shattering windows and whining sirens. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can be late with those,\u201d says Phillips, who trained to be a director but switched 22 years ago to stage management; his longest stint was a four-year association with a revival of the musical \u201c42nd Street.\u201d He or stage manager Jason Hindelang will call each performance, watching on multiple TV monitors, and occasionally from out front, for imperfections creeping in, in the way lines are delivered or how the focus of a scene might be shifting. \u201cYou want to make sure that the values stay correct,\u201d Phillips says. \u201c . . . I\u2019m a little OCD, I\u2019m a little hyper-organized, so those things are actually benefits in this job.\u201d Much of the play\u2019s formula is entrusted to the mind and annotated script of production stage manager Tripp Phillips. At his console just offstage right, Phillips \u201ccalls\u201d the show through a headset and panels of switches. \u201cThe Front Page\u201d is a drama with two intermissions and a dual nature: It\u2019s both a valentine and a poison-pen letter to the gritty, profane worlds of Chicago journalism and politics. \u201cIt was like the Wild West, Chicago in the 1920s,\u201d says Lane, who plays the evening\u2019s most galvanizing comic character, the hard-boiled schemer Walter Burns, a volcano of bluster whom Hecht and MacArthur based on a feared Chicago newspaper editor. A much-loved 1940 movie comedy, \u201cHis Girl Friday,\u201d starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, was adapted from the more acerbic \u201cFront Page.\u201d \u201cThe play is more cynical, darker, melodramatic,\u201d Lane notes. \u201cAnd then it starts twisting and turning till it turns into almost a farce by the third act. I can\u2019t think of anything else quite like it.\u201d It was Lane\u2019s idea to mount the play, its first Broadway revival since 1986, a notion hatched over a meal with his friend producer Scott Rudin. Many cast members say they owe their participation to having worked with Lane before, and they speak of him with an affection that borders on reverence. \u201cUsually by the time Nathan comes on, it\u2019s gangbusters,\u201d says Goodman, who was in a New York production of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d with Lane and another cast member, Dann Florek, 40 years ago. \u201cI listen to him every night. And I don\u2019t know how he does it.\u201d The audience response is different at each show we witness that December week, as if ticket holders are the actors\u2019 frenemies: supportive or withholding at any given moment. The actors are keenly attuned to the divergent reactions, and they\u2019ve heard plenty about what strikes some people as the interminable Act 1. While, for instance, the set is greeted with varying amounts of applause at the curtain rise at the Wednesday matinee and evening performances, the audience is silent Tuesday night. On that occasion, Morse\u2019s reaction is a desultory shrug. Over the next two days, the actors and technical crew members, falling into patterns that make a long run look like an endless looping of the movie \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d will stop to relate the rigors of their particular track. \u201cEvery one of us in this play is running a different sort of race,\u201d Mays says. Those races include unique pitfalls. Sherie Rene Scott, preparing in an upstairs dressing room for her role as prostitute Mollie Malloy, reveals the nasty bruise she acquired courtesy of one of the piece\u2019s most dangerous stunts: In despair,Mollie jumps out of a window in the pressroom, which means that, eight times a week, Scott must leap nine feet into a specially built, foam-padded chamber in the basement that\u2019s not always as easy a landing as you might think. Sherie Rene Scott is attended to by hair and makeup supervisor Jenna B. DeJesus. Scott\u2019s character, Mollie Malloy, jumps out of a window in the pressroom, which means that, eight times a week, she must leap nine feet into a specially built, foam-padded chamber in the basement. John Magaro, sitting at the table of hair and makeup supervisor Jenna B. DeJesus, reveals the knee and elbow pads he wears under his jailhouse garb as nebbishy escaped convict Earl Williams. Nightly, he bursts through another window made of breakaway glass, imported from California. In her dressing room, meanwhile, Holland Taylor talks about overcoming her reticence to play the part of Hildy\u2019s mother-in-law, Mrs. Grant, which she initially saw as too minor to bother O\u2019Brien about during rehearsals. \u201cI\u2019ve never had the experience,\u201d she explains, \u201cof being a cog in such a magnificent vehicle.\u201d Act 1 introduces us to the gaggle of reporters \u2014 played by Mays, Dylan Baker, David Pittu, Lewis J. Stadlen, Clarke Thorell, Christopher McDonald and Joey Slotnick \u2014 who are staying late in the pressroom to report on a sensational event: the dawn execution of Earl, whom Mollie insists is innocent of the murder of which he\u2019s been convicted. The reporters mercilessly taunt Mollie, and on her exit from one scene, the sobbing Scott can be spied at a backstage mirror, wiping tears off her smeared face. \u201cOnce the waterworks get going, it\u2019s not easy to turn them off,\u201d she explains later. It\u2019s all a long setup for the antics and complications to come, including the efforts of Lane\u2019s Walter to stop Slattery\u2019s Hildy from leaving his paper to move to New York and marry pretty, young Peggy Grant (Halley Feiffer). The production\u2019s physical detail is remarkable, down to the coating of dust applied to the window sills, the 1920s Chicago Cubs pennant on the wall, even the working vintage water cooler in the corner. (\u201cWe did have an issue when the spigot accidentally got left on,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cActors were skating around the stage.\u201d) Props head Laura Koch cooks vegetable patties on a grill for a scene in which the reporters bamboozle a dim policeman to fetch them burgers. The accuracy extends to a nightly culinary routine. About 10 minutes into the show, props head Laura Koch pulls five patties out of a refrigerator backstage to cook on a George Foreman grill. The reporters bamboozle a dim policeman (Micah Stock) to fetch them \u201chamburger sandwiches.\u201d And so, burgers are made, vegetable patties on slider buns, \u201cbecause big buns are too much to talk and eat,\u201d Koch says. Everything that goes into the brown bag Stock fetches is routinized: the ketchup bottle (diluted with eight ounces of water for easy pouring); the arrangement of five burgers in the bag (one with lettuce, for Mays\u2019s Bensinger); even the bag itself. Koch sprays a bit of Pam on the same edge of the bag every night to simulate leaking burger grease. The script doesn\u2019t specify this level of precision. But as Koch recounts, it instills a sense of reality that extends to the offstage banter. \u201cOne of the guys always says: \u2018That was the best burger ever!\u2019 \u201d Video #2 subheadline ACT 2 \u201cPlaces, please,\u201d Phillips announces into the backstage P.A. system. \u201cHave a great second act.\u201d Out of Lane\u2019s dressing room, behind Phillips\u2019s console, pop three actors: Feiffer, Slattery and Taylor. It\u2019s another ritual, running lines during intermission with Lane. Although Walter is heard all through Acts 1 and 2 \u2014 via hyperbolic phone calls, barking orders at Hildy \u2014 he doesn\u2019t physically enter until just before the end of Act 2. Most of Lane\u2019s phone-call lines are prerecorded; at two points, though, they\u2019re delivered live from a soundproof booth behind the set. The running of lines in his dressing room, which Lane confesses is often just an excuse for shooting the breeze, helps to loosen him up. \u201cIt\u2019s more taxing than I thought it would be,\u201d Lane says of the play. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, what a blast, I don\u2019t even have to come on till the end of the second act.\u2019 Well, it\u2019s nerve-racking to wait till the end of the second act. You really have to sort of pace yourself, because you don\u2019t want to get ready too soon. Then you\u2019re just sitting around in a three-piece suit like at a doctor\u2019s office, and you have to get ready to jump on the speeding train.\u201d Dylan Baker, Lewis J. Stadlen and Nathan Lane talk backstage. Baker, who plays McCue of the City News Bureau, said, \u201cLearning the rhythm, you don\u2019t want to let anybody down, you don\u2019t want to drop a stitch, because the whole thing can undo so easily.\u201d The actor-reporters are the play\u2019s workhorses, especially Slattery. Most everyone else has ample down time, but Hildy is the linchpin figure. The character is torn between his opportunity to settle down with Peggy and a job in the \u201cadvertising\u201d business \u2014 given Slattery\u2019s \u201cMad Men\u201d history, that mention always gets a big laugh \u2014 and his desire to report out Williams\u2019s escape. He and the others playing reporters have developed a special esprit de corps. Says Baker, who plays McCue of the City News Bureau: \u201cLearning the rhythm, you don\u2019t want to let anybody down, you don\u2019t want to drop a stitch, because the whole thing can undo so easily.\u201d As other actors stretch out on couches in the greenroom or wait for their stage reentries in their dressing rooms, Slattery can be seen dashing this way and that, trailed by his omnipresent dresser, and stopping at DeJesus\u2019s table for some quick toupee management. Feiffer and Stock occupy spots on the sofas, she with a laptop, he sharing the quiche he\u2019s brought from home and reading a screenplay of a movie for which he\u2019s auditioning. Feiffer, a playwright like her father, Jules, is tapping away at a new piece and gabbing with Stock. They\u2019ve become friends, and she\u2019s asked him to participate in a reading of her new work. As a closed-circuit broadcast of the production runs on a screen above them, they\u2019re joined by Patricia Conolly, who plays the minor part of the cleaning lady, Jennie. \u201cBefore this, I hadn\u2019t worked in a year,\u201d Stock confides. It\u2019s a stunning admission from the 29-year-old actor, and another indication of how tough this business is, given the enthusiastic notices \u2014 and the Tony nomination \u2014 Stock received when he appeared with Lane on Broadway in 2014-2015 in the Terrence McNally comedy \u201cIt\u2019s Only a Play.\u201d By this point in the \u201cFront Page\u201d run, which ends Jan. 29, the actors have memorized one another\u2019s habits and are only too happy to share the details \u2014 who sneaks out for a smoke, who\u2019s about to get married. They all rib one another and share stories, with Morse as raconteur-in-chief. Nightly, John Magaro, who plays convict Earl Williams, bursts through a window made of breakaway glass. Act 2 is when most of the crucial stunts occur. Magaro dons a plastic eye shield and climbs onto the outside edge of the upstage window to prepare for crashing into the pressroom; carpenter Brian Munroe cleans up glass fragments that fall into the pit that will soon cushion Scott\u2019s leap. Off the stage sweep Goodman and Florek, he of \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d fame, who plays the self-serving Mayor. (He later reports that he watched the presidential candidates to find his character\u2019s public buffoonishness and private malice.) Taylor exits a scene shortly thereafter, when Mrs. Grant is kidnapped at Walter\u2019s behest, by a hoodlum played by Danny Mastrogiorgio. Even if things can seem a bit sedate offstage, Taylor offers a thought about the galloping pace onstage as she races breathlessly back to her dressing room. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re on the roof of a train in a heist movie,\u201d she says, \u201cjumping from car to car.\u201d Manhattan\u2019s Broadhurst Theatre on West 44th Street, where the sold-out Broadway revival of \u201cThe Front Page\u201d is playing. ACT 3 This is when Lane\u2019s performance reliably goes into overdrive. Hildy has hidden Earl in a roll-top desk; its false back allows the curled-up Magaro to stretch out backstage. Lane\u2019s Walter has arrived, and seeking to preserve the paper\u2019s scoop about William\u2019s recapture, tries to move the immovable desk out of the room by himself. He can\u2019t, but refuses to stop trying. As Lane sinks to the floor, \u201cThe Front Page\u201d gets its biggest laugh of the night. The gag came to him during previews. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m going to try and lift it,\u2019 and my feet started to slide and . . . I could hear them laughing,\u201d Lane says. \u201cAnd the longer I let it go \u2014 it\u2019s just one of those things you discover in performance.\u201d As Lane delivers his zingers, McDonald, known for his roles in such movies as \u201cThelma and Louise\u201d and \u201cQuiz Show,\u201d and who here plays Murphy of the Journal, mouths them along with him, backstage. He hears the audience\u2019s guffaws and gives with each laugh a victory gesture. The Wednesday night audience is the warmest yet. They applaud vigorously at the curtain rise. \u201cThey\u2019re glad to be here,\u201d Phillips says. The warmth never wears off this night, and even actors like Morse, who\u2019ve been here and done this countless times, are tickled. \u201cI\u2019m 85 and playing 25,\u201d he declares. \u201cAnd getting away with it!\u201d The bows that occur two hours and 40 minutes or so after the curtain is first pulled receive an even more exuberant reception. That\u2019s partly because the audience gets a reminder of what they\u2019ve experienced, through a curtain-call tableau of the entire company, the actors all posed as if for a group portrait. Video #3 subheadline The curtain comes down, and Phillips announces into his mic that it has been another fine performance. But the evening isn\u2019t quite over. The cast remains onstage to recognize Magaro, the actor getting married that weekend. He\u2019s presented with a gift and a card signed by everyone. He\u2019ll miss the Friday, Saturday and Sunday shows for his nuptials. Magaro could also take Thursday off, but just enjoys coming to work too much \u2014 another measure how all those complicated backstage mathematics add up to an enterprise that remains distinctly human. The actor-reporters are the play\u2019s workhorses, especially John Slattery, shown here backstage. Most everyone else has ample down time, but Slattery\u2019s Hildy Johnson is the linchpin figure.

Prosecutors allege she was beaten. Snuka maintained she died from a fall. The decision to dismiss his case came a month after Snuka\u2019s lawyer told the court that his client had dementia, was in hospice care in Florida and had six months to live. Earlier, he had given confused testimony to the court , and his lawyers blamed his condition on the many head injuries he sustained during his career. Last summer, Snuka was one of the higher profile names on a lawsuit against the WWE over traumatic head injuries . The case involves 53 \u201cretired professional wrestlers and performers who sustained long term neurological injuries during their tenure with WWE,\u201d including Joseph \u201cThe Road Warrior Animal\u201d Laurinaitis and Chris Pallies, known as \u201cKing Kong Bundy.\u201d Snuka was represented by a guardian after a judge\u00a0 declared him mentally unfit \u00a0to stand trial for the 1983 beating death of his girlfriend.\u00a0 The lawsuit states that the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE \u201croutinely failed to care for the Named Plaintiffs\u2019\u00a0 repetitive head injuries \u00a0during their career in any medically competent or meaningful manner that complied with any known published contact sports return to play guidelines at the time the injuries occurred.\u201d The lawsuit also claims that the injuries sustained by wrestlers \u201cinvolve a neurological disease and ongoing disease process called\u00a0 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) \u00a0as well as the effects of\u00a0 Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) \u00a0that occur as a consequence of repetitive head trauma sustained by the Plaintiffs as professional wrestlers in matches sponsored, controlled and created by WWE.\u201d WWE denies the allegations.

Steve Kroft: What else does he make besides tuna fish? Malia Obama: Chili, and that\u2019s it. His wife was a working mom, a hospital executive and major breadwinner in the family. She wasn\u2019t crazy about her husband being in politics. Steve Kroft: Has it put strains on the marriage from time to time? Michelle Obama: Oh, no. Sen. Obama: Absolutely, it has. Steve Kroft: But you\u2019d let him go ahead and do this? Michelle Obama: I think if I weren\u2019t married to him, I\u2019d want him to be in there. So I don\u2019t want to stand in the way of that because we have to work out a few things. We\u2019ve had those arguments and\u2026 Sen. Obama: And I\u2019ve lost them all. 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft and President Barack Obama CBS News It all seems like a long time ago. Steve Kroft: So what\u2019s the difference between this guy and the guy you are now? How much smarter are you than this guy standing on the street corner? President Barack Obama: Well, let\u2019s see. Obviously I\u2019m grayer, a few more wrinkles. You know I\u2019ll be honest with you, Steve. One of the things I\u2019m proud about is that I think my basic character and outlook actually have not changed much. And people who are closest to me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who\u2019s leaving. And the reason I take pride for that is one of the things you worry about when you\u2019re in the bubble, and there\u2019s all this pomp and circumstance and hail to the chief is, do you lose touch with what you thought was important and what brought you here? And I\u2019m proud that I don\u2019t think I have lost touch. Steve Kroft: If you had to write a brief description of this job beginning with wanted-- how would you describe the position? And what are the tasks? And what skills do you think you need? President Barack Obama: Thick skin helps. Steve Kroft: Thick skin, stamina. \u201cPeople who are closest to  me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who\u2019s  leaving.\u201d President Obama President Barack Obama: Stamina. There is a greater physical element to this job than you would think, just being able to grind it out. And I think your ability to not just mentally and emotionally, but physically be able to say, \u201cWe got this. We\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d Steve Kroft: Did you learn the executive stuff on the job? Because when we first talked, I must have asked you 100 times. Your only executive experience was running the Harvard Law Review and running your own campaign. Did you have to learn a lot of this on the job? President Barack Obama and 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News President Barack Obama: The campaign was a more significant training ground than I think people give it credit for. By the time I got here, I think I had a pretty good sense of what was required. But the circumstances in which I came in were different than most executives, right? The enterprise was in the midst of a major crisis. And so, those first six months were a fire drill. Beside the two wars he inherited in Iraq and Afghanistan, and promised to end, a financial crisis at home had pushed the United States to the brink of another Great Depression. When we spoke with the new president in March of 2009 , the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month, the government was throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at failing banks, and the auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Politically pummeled from all sides, Obama did his best to keep a sense of humor. President Obama: I just want to say that the only thing less popular than putting money into banks is putting money into the auto industry. So-- Steve Kroft: But 18 percent are in favor, 76 percent against. President Obama: It\u2019s not a high number. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re sitting here and you\u2019re-- you are laughing about some of these problems. Are people going to look at this and say, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s sitting there just making jokes about money--\u201d How do you deal with that? President Obama: No, no, no. Steve Kroft: I mean, wha-- explain the-- the-- the-- President Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: The mood in your laughter. President Obama: Yeah, I mean, there\u2019s gotta be-- Steve Kroft: Are you punch-drunk? President Obama: No, no, there\u2019s gotta be a little gallows humor to get you through the day. President Barack Obama participates in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft in the State Dining Room of the White House, Jan. 9, 2017. Chuck Kennedy, The White House A political candidacy built around hope and change and compromise would eventually become a presidency of crisis and confrontation. Steve Kroft: Is there anything that surprised you about this job? President Barack Obama: I was surprised and continue to be surprised by the severity of partisanship in this town. And I think that I\u2019d been warned about it. You\u2019ll remember, in the campaign back in 2007, 2008, people would say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s being na\u00efve. He thinks that there\u2019s no red states and blue states. And wait \u2018til he gets here.\u201d And I will confess that, I didn\u2019t fully appreciate the ways in which individual senators or members of Congress now are pushed to the extremes by their voter bases. I did not expect, particularly in the midst of crisis, just how severe that partisanship would be. Steve Kroft: You came into this office trying to unify the country. You said that many times during the campaign. You wanted to bring people together. You wanted to change Washington. You talked about transformative change. And you became the focal point for some of the division. \u201cI\u2019m the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever.\u201d President Obama President Barack Obama: I became a lightning rod for some partisan battles. I could not be prouder of the track record we\u2019ve put together. By almost every measure, the country is significantly better off than when I came in. If you can look back and say, \u201cThe economy\u2019s better. Our security\u2019s better. The environment\u2019s better. Our kids\u2019 education is better,\u201d if you can say that you\u2019ve made things better, then considering all the challenges out there, you should feel good. But I\u2019m the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever. Steve Kroft: You didn\u2019t change Washington. President Barack Obama: You know, I changed those things that were in direct-- my direct control. I mean, I-- look, I\u2019m proud of the fact that, with two weeks to go, we\u2019re probably the first administration in modern history that hasn\u2019t had a major scandal in the White House. In that sense, we changed some things. I would\u2019ve liked to have gotten that one last Supreme Court justice in there. I\u2019d like the Supreme Court to take a look at-- Steve Kroft: You couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. President Barack Obama participates in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft in the Oval Office of the White House, Jan. 9, 2017. Pete Souza, The White House President Barack Obama: But we couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. Trying to get the other side of the aisle to work with us on issues, in some cases, that they professed, originally, an interest in, and saying to them, \u201cHold on a second. You guys used to think this was a good idea. Now, just because I\u2019m supporting it, you can\u2019t change your mind.\u201d But they did. And what that did, I think, made me appreciate. And I\u2019ve said this before. But it\u2019s worth repeating. Because this is on me. Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns. But there were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren\u2019t able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us. And there were times during my presidency where I lost the PR battle. And losing the PR battles, particularly about healthcare, translated into losing his Democratic majorities in Congress, beginning with a Republican landslide in the midterm election of 2010 . Steve Kroft: There is this feeling in-- particularly among people who are among your hardened supporters\u2014 President Obama: Right. Steve Kroft: --who feel a little disappointed that they think that you\u2019ve lost your mojo. That you\u2019ve lost your ability, that touch you had during the campaign to inspire\u2014 President Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: -- and lead that-- you know, everybody in Washington writes about the sort of aloofness that you have and I`m sure that drives you crazy. That you\u2019ve let other people define you, that you haven`t sold your successes well enough? President Obama: I think it`s a fair argument, you know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know leadership isn\u2019t just legislation, that it\u2019s a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence, and bringing them together and setting a tone. For the next six years, there would be legislative gridlock, and by 2016, the people who had looked to Obama for change were looking somewhere else. Steve Kroft: Donald Trump, if you take away the particulars, was elected to the office , basically, on the same program that you were, of change. He wants to change Washington. President Barack Obama: Well, I mean that\u2019s a lot of particulars you\u2019re taking away. Fair enough. Steve Kroft: But do you think-- President Barack Obama: He was a change candidate. Steve Kroft: Do you think anybody can change Washington? President Barack Obama: I think the American people can change Washington. But I think that it is not going to change, because somebody from on high directs that change. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, are motivated by all kinds of issues. They\u2019re sincerely interested in the economy, in terrorism, in social issues. But the one overriding thing they\u2019re interested in is getting reelected. And if they think that it\u2019s harder for them to get reelected by cooperating with each other, then they won\u2019t cooperate. Steve Kroft: A lot of people think the system is broken, that the system, the political system is broken. That seemed to be the message that you heard throughout this campaign. President Barack Obama: Well -- Steve Kroft: And you seem to be saying, in some ways, maybe it is broken. President Barack Obama and 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News President Barack Obama: In the first two years, when I had a strong majority in the House and the Senate, we were as productive as any administration has been since the \u201860s. I mean, we got a lot done. And so you can get a lot of stuff done through this system. But to sustain a governing majority, that requires an ability for Republicans and Democrats to find some common ground. And right now, the structure of the system is such where it makes it really hard for people to work together. And we mentioned, an example earlier, the Supreme Court nominations. I mean, the fact that Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans, was able to just stop a nomination almost a year before the next election and really not pay a political price for it, that\u2019s a sign that the incentives for politicians in this town to be so sharply partisan have gotten so outta hand that we\u2019re weakening ourselves. Steve Kroft: How serious do you think this is? I mean, how stable do you think that the political system, the democratic system, is? President Barack Obama: Look, I think it\u2019s stable, because the framers, in their wisdom, designed the system so that power\u2019s pretty disbursed. You know, we have states. And we have cities. And we have counties. And we have the private sector. And-- and so the country still works even when Washington\u2019s dysfunctional. But the problem is that, over time, big pieces of business that have to get done without leadership from Washington, don\u2019t get done. Steve Kroft: I want to go back just briefly on this. But I think, look, this last election, you had a political system. Well, first of all the people elected somebody who went around saying that the system was rigged. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: You had two of the most unpopular presidential candidates selected by the two parties in history. Doesn\u2019t that say something\u2019s wrong, something serious is wrong? President Barack Obama: It indicates that there is a lot of cynicism out there. It indicates that the corrosive nature of everything from talk radio to fake news to negative advertising has made people lack confidence in a lot of our existing institutions. I think it indicates, at least on the Democratic side, that we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen our grassroots networks. In some ways, the Democratic Party hadn\u2019t constructed itself to get that message out to the places it needed to get to. The Tea Party I have huge disagreements with, obviously. But I give them credit for having activated themselves. And they made a difference in terms of moving the Republican Party, in terms of moving the country in a particular direction. It\u2019s a direction I disagreed with. But it showed that, in fact, you get involved, if your voice is heard it has an impact. Steve Kroft: Do you feel the same way about Donald Trump? President Barack Obama: Well I think that he clearly was able to tap into a lot of grievances. And he has a talent for making a connection with his supporters that overrode some of the traditional benchmarks of how you\u2019d run a campaign or conduct yourself as a presidential candidate. What will be interesting to see is how that plays out during the course of his presidency. We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and sound bites and some headline that comes over their phone. And I think that there\u2019s a power in that. There\u2019s also a danger, what generates a headline or stirs up a controversy and gets attention isn\u2019t the same as the process required to actually solve the problem. Steve Kroft: You said you don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to do when he governs, but we\u2019re in this transition period and one of the first things that he has done in this transition period is to pick a fight with the intelligence agencies. Do you think that that\u2019s a smart move? President Barack Obama CBS News President Barack Obama: You\u2019re not going to be able to make good decisions without building some relationship of trust between yourself and that community. Steve Kroft: Do you see that happening? President Barack Obama: Not yet, but, you know, again, he hasn\u2019t gotten sworn into office yet. When we come back, President Obama talks about one of the strangest transitions in White House history -- and he acknowledges some mistakes. At the White House on Monday, crates and boxes lined the hallways and cluttered the East Room. Some carpets had been rolled up. Outside, there are bleachers on Pennsylvania Avenue and moving vans in the driveway \u2013 visual evidence that there\u2019s a transition underway. This ritual of democracy, this peaceful transfer of power can be awkward under the best of circumstances. And these are not the best of circumstances for either the outgoing or incoming president. Steve Kroft: You have to admit that this is one of the strangest transitions in history. President Barack Obama: It\u2019s unusual. I\u2019ll agree with that. Well, I-- Steve Kroft: I mean, he-- President Barack Obama: --and I suspect-- I suspect the president-elect would agree with that. Look-- Steve Kroft: No, I-- President Barack Obama: --he is an unconventional candidate. Steve Kroft: Right. President Barack Obama: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s run a campaign like his successfully in modern history, not that I can think of. And, as a consequence because he didn\u2019t have the supports of many of the establishment in his own party, because he ran sort of an improvisational campaign-- Steve Kroft: Can you run an improvisational presidency? President Barack Obama: I don\u2019t think so. And so now he\u2019s in the process of building up an organization. And well, we\u2019ll have to see how that works. And it\u2019ll be a test, I think, for him and the people that he\u2019s designated to be able to execute on his vision. \u201cFirst of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don\u2019t underestimate the guy, because he\u2019s going to be 45th president of the United States.\u201d President Obama\u00a0 Steve Kroft: Look, I think that the country deeply appreciates the fact that you have not spoken clearly, I think, probably what\u2019s on your mind in relation to the president-elect. But as you said earlier it\u2019s unusual. He seems to have spent a good deal of his time sending out tweets that, you know, that the United States must strengthen and expand its nuclear ability. That Meryl Streep is an overrated Hillary flunky. You\u2019re watching this like everybody else. I mean what\u2019s going on? President Barack Obama: You know, you\u2019re going to have to talk to him. But here\u2019s what I-- here\u2019s what I think. First of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don\u2019t underestimate the guy, because he\u2019s going to be 45th president of the United States. The one thing I\u2019ve said to him directly, and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country, is just make sure that, as we go forward certain norms, certain institutional traditions don\u2019t get eroded, because there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re in place. One thing both men have in common is a love of golf and a shared knowledge of the word \u201cmulligan,\u201d which means a do-over to replace a lousy shot. Steve Kroft: I mean you play golf. President Barack Obama: I do. Steve Kroft: Do you ever wish you had a mulligan? I mean in the eight years that you\u2019ve had, if-- if you had-- if you had three or four mulligans would you use \u2018em? President Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, there\u2019s no doubt that probably at least once a week, maybe once a day, I said, \u201cAh, I should have done that better.\u201d I bet at the end of this interview I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s-- that would have been a really good answer for that or this.\u201d I think we\u2019ve done the big stuff right. I think that there are some big, obvious fumbles-- Steve Kroft: Like? President Barack Obama: --or shanks if you are using the-- Steve Kroft: Right. President Barack Obama: --golf analogy. Well, Healthcare.gov is a good example. Steve Kroft: \u00a0Right. President Barack Obama: You know, if you know you got a controversial program, and you\u2019re setting up a really big, complicated website, website better work on the first day or first week or first month. The fact that it didn\u2019t obviously lost a little momentum. That was clearly a management failure. Critics of the administration would cite what they see as larger failures in the area of foreign policy particularly in the Middle East, which we grilled him about in an interview 15 months ago. Steve Kroft: There is a perception in the Middle East that the United States is in retreat, that we\u2019ve pulled our troops out of Iraq and ISIS has moved in and taken over much of that territory. The situation in Afghanistan is very precarious and the Taliban is on the march again. President Obama: I think it\u2019s fair to say, Steve, that if-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0It\u2019s -- Let me just finish the thought. President Obama: OK. Steve Kroft: \u00a0They say you\u2019re projecting weakness, not strength-- President Obama: You\u2019re-- you\u2019re-- you\u2019re-- you\u2019re saying \u201cthey\u201d-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0I\u2019m talking about-- President Obama: You\u2019re-- you\u2019re not-- you\u2019re not citing too many folks, but-- but-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0No, I\u2019ll cite folks if you want me to. President Obama: But here\u2019s-- Steve Kroft: I\u2019d say the Saudis, I\u2019d say the Israelis, I\u2019d say a lot of our friends in the Middle East. President Obama: I-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0I\u2019d say everybody-- President Obama: Steve-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0Everybody in your-- everybody in the Republican Party. You want me to keep going? President Obama: Yeah, if you are\u2014if you\u2019re citing the Republican Party, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is nothing I\u2019ve done right over the last seven and half years. But even former members of his administration criticized the president for talking tough and not following through. In 2012, Obama told the Syrian government that the use of chemical weapons would cross a red line\u2026 Obama: That, that\u2019s a red line for us. That could provoke us military involvement. When they were used, the president responded not with force, but diplomacy, raising questions about his credibility. Steve Kroft: \u00a0I want to go back to, like, 2012. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: I want to-- to two words. Red line. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: You didn\u2019t have to say that. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: And there have been reports that it wasn\u2019t in your speech. President Barack Obama: No, it wasn\u2019t. Steve Kroft: That you just sort of ad-libbed it. If you could pull \u2013 and it created \u2013 it created problems for you with the military people. Would you take those words back? You didn\u2019t have to say them. President Barack Obama: Yeah, look, if you\u2019re putting all the weight on that particular phrase, then in terms of how it was interpreted in Washington, I think you make a legitimate point. I\u2019ve got to tell you, though, I don\u2019t regret at all saying that if I saw Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons on his people that that would change my assessments in terms of what we were or were not willing to do in Syria. Steve Kroft: \u00a0But you didn\u2019t say that. President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0You said you drew the red line. President Barack Obama: I-- look, I-- Steve Kroft: I don\u2019t want to make too big a deal out of it, but-- President Barack Obama: I understand-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--I think that-- but I-- President Barack Obama: I-- but that-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--you think that that was-- President Barack Obama: --well-- Steve Kroft: Would you take it back? If you had-- President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--the opportunity to take it back? President Barack Obama: The reason I\u2019m hesitating is not to be defensive. It-- it\u2019s simply, Steve, that I would have I think made a bigger mistake if I had said, \u201cEh, chemical weapons. That doesn\u2019t really change my calculus.\u201d I think it was important for me as president of the United States to send a message that in fact there is something different about chemical weapons. And, regardless of how it ended up playing, I think-- in the Beltway, what is true is Assad got rid of his chemical weapons. And the reason he got rid of \u2018em is-- Steve Kroft: For a while. President Barack Obama: --because-- well, look-- if 90 percent or 95 percent of those-- chemical stockpiles were eliminated, that\u2019s a lot of chemical weapons that are not right now in the hands of ISIL or Nusra or, for that matter, the regime. Steve Kroft: Israel. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: \u00a0A few weeks ago you allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank. It caused a major fallout between the United States and Israel. Was it your decision to abstain? President Barack Obama: Yes, ultimately. Steve Kroft: \u00a0Why did you feel like you had to do that? President Barack Obama: Well, first of all, Steve, I don\u2019t think it caused a major rupture in relations between the United States and Israel. If you\u2019re saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu \u00a0got fired up, he\u2019s been fired up repeatedly during the course of my presidency, around the Iran deal and around our consistent objection to settlements. So that part of it wasn\u2019t new. And despite all the noise and hullabaloo-- military cooperation, intelligence cooperation, all of that has continued. We have defended them consistently in every imaginable way. But I also believe that both for our national interests and Israel\u2019s national interests that allowing an ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that could get worse and worse over time is a problem. And that settlements contribute. They\u2019re not the sole reason for it, but they\u2019re a contributing factor to the inability to solve that problem. And-- Steve Kroft: And you wanted to make that point? President Barack Obama: Not only did I want to make that point. We are reaching a tipping where the pace of settlements, during the course of my presidency has gotten so substantial that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to imagine an effective, contiguous Palestinian state. And I think it would have long-term consequences for peace and security in the region, and the United States, because of our investment in the region, and because we care so deeply about Israel, I think has a legitimate interest in saying to a friend, \u201cThis is a problem.\u201d And we\u2019ve said it-- look, it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t been saying it from Day One. We\u2019ve been saying it for eight years now. It\u2019s just that nothing seemed to get a lot of attention. When we return: the president discusses eight years in the Oval Office and life with his family in the White House. After our interview in the State Dining Room, President Obama invited us to the Oval Office where he had some things he wanted to show us, and some thoughts about his family\u2019s eight years in the Executive Mansion.\u00a0 Steve Kroft: What are you going to miss most about this place? 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft and President Barack Obama CBS News President Barack Obama: This walk is one of them. On the way, he told us that his family life had thrived living and working under the White House roof, but that his wife and daughters didn\u2019t feel the same way about life in what Harry Truman called \u201cthe finest prison in the world.\u201d Steve Kroft: How do they feel? President Barack Obama: Ah, they\u2019re ready to go. I mean, the girls, obviously, you know, they are now of an age in which the constraints of Secret Service and bubbles and all that stuff has gotten pretty old. Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny. I mean, she\u2019s thrived as a first lady, but it\u2019s not her preference. And so-- Steve Kroft: She was the hardest sell. President Barack Obama: She was the hardest sell. And she never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic, given how good she is. Having said that she would acknowledge, and I certainly feel that we-- we just have a lot of memories here. You know, our kids grew up here. Some of our best friends have been made here in this place. There have been moments that were highlights for us-- that-- you know, are going to be hard to duplicate. So-- Steve Kroft: She\u2019s glad you did it though? President Barack Obama: She is now. Ahhh, I think I\u2019ve said this story before. You know, she used to say to our friends, \u201cBarack\u2019s exactly the kind of guy I want to be president. I just wish he didn\u2019t want to do it when I was married to him.\u201d So-- so now that we\u2019re-- Steve Kroft: But you\u2019re still all right? I mean, everything\u2019s OK? President Barack Obama: So far, as far as I know. I better check later. Yeah. Steve Kroft: You have said you\u2019re going to take a big vacation. You\u2019re going to write your book. You\u2019re going to work on your library. You\u2019re going to set up a foundation. I mean, that sounds very professorial compared to what you\u2019ve been doing, like the ivory tower equivalent of puttering around the garden. Are you going to be happy doing this? President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: Are you-- President Barack Obama: --look, I\u2019m going to try to get some sleep. And do a little puttering. Because I haven\u2019t had a lot of chance to reflect and absorb all this. I do not expect to be behind a desk a lot. I look forward to teaching the occasional class, \u2018cause I was a professor. And I had fun doing it. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re not going to go to Wall Street, make a lot of money? President Barack Obama: I\u2019m not going to Wall Street. The amount of time that I\u2019ll be investing in issues is going to be high. But it\u2019ll be necessarily in a different capacity. \u00a0 Steve Kroft: Roosevelt\u2019s remembered for Social Security. Eisenhower is remembered for a speech about the military industrial complex. Ten years from now, what are they going to say about you? What are they going to remember you for? President Barack Obama: You know, I don\u2019t think you know now. I think you\u2019re not going to know until 10 years from now. I do think that, you know, saving the economy was a pretty big deal. We did a lot of stuff early that ended up having an impact. I believe that the work we\u2019ve done in moving our energy future in a cleaner direction is going to stick even if some of the individual steps that we took are reversed by future administrations. I think that it\u2019s embedded itself in the economy. And we\u2019ve been able to organize the international community around it in ways that aren\u2019t going to go back. I think we\u2019ve set the bar with respect to the notion that it is possible to provide health care for people. Now I know that the incoming Congress and administration talks about repealing it. But we\u2019ve set a bar that shows that this can be done. And that core principle is one that the majority of Americans, including supporters of Donald Trump believe in. Steve Kroft: What are your memories of this office? What\u2019s going to stick in your mind? What are you going to remember from here? President Barack Obama: Well I think the number of decisions that you make just with your advisers sitting here-- we\u2019ve had some big powwows around, is the banking system about to collapse and what do we do about it? To questions of war and peace. So you remember the decisions that were made in this room. The objects in this room-- only a few of \u2018em I really attach to. I think that I\u2019ll always remember the bust of Dr. King. I thought having an American here who represented rhat civic spirit that got me into this office was useful. Over there I\u2019ve got the original program for the March on Washington that was framed and given to me by a friend. You know, I\u2019ll remember the view out this window, because this is where we had our-- the playground that we put in when Malia and Sasha came in. \u00a0Being able every once in awhile to look out the window and see your daughters during the summer, swinging on that swing set, that made the presidency a little bit sweeter. When Sasha and Malia Obama arrived at the White House in 2009, they were age 7 and 10.\u00a0 Their parents -- for the most part \u2013 were successful in keeping them out of the limelight, except in the rarest circumstances. In the fall, Malia begins at Harvard after a gap year. Sasha is a sophomore at her private school in Washington. This month, the swing set was dismantled and given away. Steve Kroft: You feel older? President Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s interesting. Physically, I feel probably as good as I\u2019ve ever felt. And I\u2019ve got as much energy as I ever did. But what you feel after eight years -- and I think you\u2019d feel this no matter what, but anytime you have a big transition, it gets magnified \u2013 is time passes. Your kids grow up. I think they more than anything are making me feel as if, you know, you want to squeeze everything you got every single day out of this thing. Because it passes quick. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re having trouble letting go? President Barack Obama: No. I am looking forward to getting out of the bubble. I am glad that I\u2019m leaving this place at a relatively young age, at 55. So I have the opportunity for a second maybe even a third act in a way that I think would be tougher if I were, you know, the age of some presidents when they left. There\u2019s some bittersweet feelings about leaving the people here. \u2018Cause even though all the team you assemble, you know, you\u2019re going to stay in touch with \u2018em, it\u2019s not the same, you know? The band kind of breaks up. And, I think I\u2019m the best president I\u2019ve ever been right now. And I think the team that is operating right now functions as well as any team that I\u2019ve had. And so, you know, there is a part of you that thinks, \u201cMan, we\u2019re pretty good at this stuff right now.\u201d And you hate to see that talent disperse. Steve Kroft: You going to have reunions? President Barack Obama: Well, not I don\u2019t think we\u2019re go have, like, T-shirts and, you know, all that stuff. That sounds kind of sad. And so my-- so many of my staff is young enough that they\u2019re going to do amazing things. And I\u2019m going to be helping them try to do them. So overall though, I have a deep appreciation for the wisdom of this guy right there, George Washington. It\u2019s good to get fresh legs in here. I think that it refreshes our democracy. It-- I think sustaining the pace over more than eight years is pretty tough. Steve Kroft: What are you going to do on the 21st when you wake up? I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to be when you wake up, but you\u2019re going to wake up someplace where you\u2019re not president. President Barack Obama: Well, here\u2019s one thing is I\u2019m not setting my alarm. That, I\u2019m certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I\u2019m going to spend time with Michelle. And, you know, we got some catching up to do. We\u2019ve both been busy. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re going to be spending your own money, right? President Barack Obama: Abs-- well, you know, the truth though is that we\u2019ve been-- Steve Kroft: Have you been spending your own-- when was the last time you-- President Barack Obama: I-- Steve Kroft: --spent your own money? President Barack Obama: Well, I will say this. You know, I mentioned how I\u2019ve got a pretty thick skin in this job. You\u2019ve got to have it. One thing that did kind of get under my craw sometimes was people talking as if when we went on vacation or-- Steve Kroft: Right, right, right, right. President Barack Obama: --you know, that people\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, spending taxpayer money.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, I actually I\u2019m paying for all of this. The only thing I don\u2019t pay for is Secret Service and an airplane.\u201d Steve Kroft: And communications. President Barack Obama: And communications, \u2018cause I don\u2019t have any choice. But, you know, we buy our own toilet paper even here in the White House. Steve Kroft: Really? President Barack Obama: You know, we-- it\u2019s not free. I\u2019m-- I\u2019ve got a grocery bill at the end of every month. You know, our toothpaste, our, you know, our orange juice, that all gets paid. But I-- it is true that I don\u2019t carry my wallet that often. So I\u2019m going to have some catching up to do in terms of how day-to-day things operate.\u00a0 \u00a0 Steve Kroft: It\u2019s not unusual for a president to issue an observation, \u201cBeware of this. Be wary of that.\u201d What is the thing that concerns you most right now, leaving office, about the country? President Barack Obama: Making sure that our democracy stays healthy. And making sure that we maintain that sense of solidarity. Um, the thing that has disturbed me most about the Russian hacking episode is-- and the thing that surprised me most has not been the fact of Russian hacking, because Chinese, Russians, Iranians-- a lot of-- Steve Kroft: The United States-- President Barack Obama: The United-- well, the cyber world is full of information gathering, you know, propaganda, et cetera. I have been concerned about the degree to which, in some circles, you\u2019ve seen people suggest that Vladimir Putin has more credibility than the U.S. government. I think that\u2019s something new. And I think it\u2019s a measure of how the partisan divide has gotten so severe that people forget we\u2019re on the same team. President Barack Obama: We go into the hallway here\u2026 The president led us through a side door from the Oval Office into a short hallway and into his small private dining room. Here, the mementos were personal, far less formal. Steve Kroft: All this stuff is coming with you? President Barack Obama: Absolutely. Well, not all of it. It-- I think-- Steve Kroft: Hard packing up? President Barack Obama: I think, this famous-- Steve Kroft: This is going to stay there, right? President Barack Obama: --painting of The Peacemakers, that goes with the territory. Steve Kroft: How much stuff are you going to take with you? President Barack Obama: Not that much. I mean, you know, we got-- I got books, I got clothes, I got mementos like-- these that, you know, I cherish. We got some furniture that we purchased that, you know, we\u2019ll try to use in the new place. Steve Kroft: Do you like it, the new house? President Barack Obama: It\u2019s a nice-- it\u2019s a nice home. I mean-- Steve Kroft: You\u2019ve been there--? President Barack Obama: Yeah. It\u2019ll-- it\u2019s temporary. And-- Steve Kroft: Two years? President Barack Obama: Yeah. But it feels like a home. You know, it\u2019s not crazy big but there\u2019s enough room for, you know, a treadmill and some workout equipment in the basement. \u201cMy fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won\u2019t stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days.\u201d President Obama The next day President Obama was back in Chicago where it all began to deliver his farewell address. Obama in farewell address: My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won\u2019t stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. Thank you. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. President Obama, in all the times we were with him, seemed to savor the challenge of an interview. For him, it was an intellectual workout, something on par with a pickup basketball game, complete with a little trash talk. There were never any restrictions on questions. No taboo topics. A year and half ago, there was a particularly contentious line of questioning about America\u2019s role in Syria. After it, we took a short break for a few sips of water.\u00a0 And when the cameras rolled again, the president was ready for more. President Obama: What else you got? Tonight, at last, we have no more questions. I\u2019m Steve Kroft. Next Sunday, here on CBS, the AFC Championship game. And we\u2019ll be back in two weeks with a brand new edition of 60 Minutes. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Janell Ross and Vanessa Williams January 15 at 7:30 PM Follow @janellross Follow @wapovanessa The eruption of hostilities between President-elect Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, may be recorded as just one more example of what has become standard Twitter retaliation for Trump. But coming on the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend, it also reignited the passions around Trump\u2019s difficult history with African Americans, the group of voters from whom he might be most alienated as he prepares to move into the White House this week. In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d on Friday, Lewis said he did not consider Trump to be \u201ca legitimate president\u201d because of allegations that \u00adhigh-level Russian operatives interfered in the election on Trump\u2019s behalf. Trump lobbed back with a tweet in the early hours Saturday that disparaged both the congressman and his district, which includes some of Atlanta\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. \u201cCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201c(Not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results. Sad!\u201d Trump continued his taunts in another tweet Saturday evening, saying that Lewis should \u201cfinally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\u201d (Claritza Jimenez,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s attack on Lewis drew\u00a0widespread condemnation\u00a0across party lines, particularly given Lewis\u2019s role in the fight for voting rights for African Americans. \u201cJohn Lewis is beyond a doubt the conscience of the country, and that\u2019s why his people [constituents] send him to Congress,\u201d said Kwame Lillard, an activist who helped to organize the civil-rights-era Freedom Rides and has known Lewis for more than 60 years. Lewis also was one of the leaders of the legendary Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march in 1965, in which Alabama state troopers attacked marchers, leaving many of them, including Lewis, badly injured. The march entered the American lexicon as \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d and the stark images of the police beatings helped build support for the civil rights movement. Shamed Dogan, a Republican member of Missouri\u2019s House of Representatives, said that the state\u2019s new governor, Eric Greitens (R), attended the Missouri Legislative Black Caucus\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. celebration two days after taking office. \u201cI would like to see Donald Trump take the same approach to the Congressional Black Caucus and find common ground with them instead of feuding with heroes like Congressman Lewis,\u201d Dogan said. Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric about Hispanics, Muslims and women was one of the hallmarks of his campaign, and while he emerged from the election with a solid majority of electoral college votes, he trailed Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million popular votes. In national exit polling , 91 percent of black voters had an unfavorable view of Trump, while 83 percent regarded Clinton favorably. In their vote preference, the exit polling found that black voters favored Clinton over Trump by a margin of 89 percent to 8 percent. Since Election Day, Trump has said that, in an effort to bring the country together, he would reach out to voters who did not support him. During the transition, Trump has been frequently photographed at his New York headquarters with black celebrities, including the rapper Kanye West, retired football great Ray Lewis and boxing promoter Don King. On Friday, he was visited by Steve Harvey, a comedian, game-show host and dating-advice guru. Harvey supported Clinton and had been critical of Trump during the campaign, but after their meeting he said the president-elect was \u201ccongenial and sincere.\u201d The attack on John Lewis, however, underscores Trump\u2019s tense relationship with black voters and seemed to echo some of his past confrontations with African Americans. Trump started his presidential campaign with huge disadvantages among African Americans, in part because of his years-long questioning of whether President Obama was born in the United States. Trump also drew criticism for taking out a full-page ad in New York newspapers in 1989 urging the death penalty for five black and Hispanic teenagers accused of raping a woman in Central Park. Even after the young men were exonerated, Trump criticized the city for awarding them damages for the years they had spent in prison and continued to argue that they were \u201cguilty of something.\u201d In the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump began appealing to black voters to give him a chance. Speaking at rallies, to overwhelmingly white audiences, Trump described black people as living \u201cin hell,\u201d stuck in crumbling, crime-ridden neighborhoods and failing schools. \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he asked. For some people, Trump\u2019s attack on Lewis \u2014 as well as his inaccurate description of Atlanta, a longtime haven for middle- and upper-middle-class African Americans \u2014 brought it all back. Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, said that if Trump was serious about reaching out to the black community, he would have to take responsibility for a campaign whose tone was \u201cdivisive at best, seriously offensive at worst\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d with reports of an increase in racist behavior and actions directed at minorities by some whites. She said he will have to meet with and apologize to the civil rights community and young activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThe burden of proof is on you. It\u2019s not on everybody else to warm up to you because you\u2019re the president,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cBecause the rhetoric came out of his mouth, the burden of proof is on him to show that he\u2019s changed, he\u2019s sensitive and he cares about those issues.\u201d D.L. Hughley, a comedian and political commentator, put it more bluntly in a Facebook video in which he blasted Trump for \u201chaving a comedian and a rapper and a football player out to talk about the concerns of the community.\u201d \u201cIf Donald Trump cared about black people, he wouldn\u2019t have denigrated the president with those claims of birtherism ,\u201d he said. Hughley, who in the late 1990s toured with Harvey as part of the popular \u201cKings of Comedy,\u201d said Trump was more comfortable with black entertainers. \u201cYou\u2019d rather see us run the football than run the country.\u201d So far Trump has nominated only one African American for a Cabinet position: retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson, as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Harvey told reporters that Trump asked him to work with Carson on inner-city issues. Some political observers say Carson\u2019s appointment is an indication that Trump is not serious about improving the lives of people in struggling communities. Michael Eric Dyson, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said that in touting Carson and Harvey as his urban policy team, Trump is practicing \u201caffirmative action in the worst sense of that term.\u201d \u201cSteve Harvey is a talented comedian but he is not a politician, a policy maker. He nor Carson have any expertise in the issues they will oversee,\u201d Dyson said. \u201cThis is really nothing more than an attempted end run around serious engagement and an example of the kind of visionary bankruptcy of President-elect Trump.\u201d Scott Clement contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Twitter YouTube Just months after a launch pad explosion thwarted its last attempt, SpaceX has successfully launched an unmanned rocket into orbit. The launch, which unfolded Saturday at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base, marked a crucial \u2014 and expensive \u2014 test for the private space company in the aftermath of its recent, very visible misfire . SpaceX Rocket And Its Cargo Explode On Launch Pad In Florida [VIDEO] Shortly after the launch, the two-stage rocket detached its first stage, which subsequently landed safely on a platform in the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX live-streamed the entire process along the way. You can watch it here or play the video embedded at the top of this post. The Falcon 9 rocket is bearing 10 commercial satellites for Iridium Communications, which currently operates a network of dozens of mobile communications satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is under contract with Iridium to launch at least 70 satellites into orbit in a series of seven launches for the company \u2014 beginning with Saturday's batch. The new satellites will replace the current network, in \"what will be one of the largest 'tech upgrades' in history,\" according to a press release from SpaceX . Still, a cloud of uncertainty hung over the launch, after an explosion left a wreckage of last September's test in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said at the time that the blast came while workers were still loading propellant into the rocket, though no one was physically harmed in the accident. In addition to destroying the rocket itself \u2014 a Falcon 9, like the rocket being launched Saturday \u2014 last year's blast also obliterated a $200 million communications satellite. The Israeli satellite \"had been leased by Facebook as part of a project to bring high-speed internet to parts of Africa,\" NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports for our Newscast unit. Article continues after sponsorship A months-long investigation by SpaceX dug into what went wrong \u2014 \"the toughest puzzle to solve that we've ever had to solve,\" Musk said. That probe wrapped up earlier this month, concluding the accident \"was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank,\" according to CBS News . The Federal Aviation Administration then signed off on that investigation, approving the new licence for Saturday's launch. Prior to last year's accident, SpaceX had managed a string of high-profile successes, including landing a Falcon 9 on a floating barge. ",

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump's Incoming Administration's Ties to Russia Continue to Face Scrutiny 0 Shares Email In a strong message to Donald Trump , the head of the CIA cautioned the president-elect to be \"very disciplined\" with what he says publicly and recognize his words have an impact on U.S. national security once he takes office. \"I think Mr. Trump has to be very disciplined in terms of what it is that he says publicly. He is going to be, in a few days' time, the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government and I think he has to recognize that his words do have impact,\" CIA Director John Brennan said today on \"Fox News Sunday.\" According to Brennan, \u201cthere are many dangers\" when a president-elect and the intelligence community are at odds. In recent days, Trump has accused the intelligence community of leaking the unverified 35-page dossier on alleged Trump-Russia relations, even going as far as to compare US intelligence to Nazi Germany. Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 \"If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries?\" Brennan asked. Trump\u2019s CIA Rebukes Create \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Feud with Intelligence Agencies Brennan, who reaches the end of his term Friday, also fired back at Trump's comparison of the U.S. intelligence community to Nazi Germany as \"outrageous.\" \"What I do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany,\" Brennan said. \"I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly.\" When asked if Trump understands the threat from Russia, Brennan told Fox News, \"I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world.\" Brennan added, \"Mr. Trump needs to understand that absolving Russia of the various actions it has taken in the past number of years is a road that he, I think, needs to be very, very careful about moving down.\" The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on Brennan's remarks today. Twice during the interview, the CIA director stressed that he feels Trump needs to understand that it's \"more than being about him and it's about the United States and the national security.\" \"He has to make sure that now he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security - as opposed to talking and tweeting - he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. national security interests are protected and are advanced,\" Brennan said. Brennan warned, \"Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests. And so, therefore, when he speaks, when he reacts, just to make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound.\" During the interview, he would neither confirm nor deny whether the CIA has information on whether the Trump transition team has had contact with Russia -- something the Trump team has denied. 0 Shares ",

Got it President-elect Donald Trump stands with his children, Eric Trump, far left, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr., far right, at a Jan. 11 press conference at Trump Tower in New York. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Rosalind S. Helderman , Drew Harwell and Tom Hamburger January 15 at 5:33 PM Follow @PostRoz Follow @drewharwell Follow @thamburger Airplanes belonging to Donald Trump\u2019s businesses will be inspected over the next four years by employees of the Federal Aviation Administration that he will lead. Disputes over Trump\u2019s trademark registrations could be reviewed by judges appointed by his hand-picked commerce secretary. His Department of Housing and Urban Development could reverse its past opposition to a potentially lucrative sale of a large subsidized housing complex in New York partly owned by the president-elect. And Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency will have the power to roll back clean-water rules he and other golf course owners have said are harmful to their industry. When Trump takes office on Friday, he will assume control of a federal bureaucracy with enormous power to bolster nearly every corner of his real estate, licensing and merchandising empire \u2014 and enhance his personal fortune. Trump announced steps last week that he and his lawyers said would provide adequate safeguards to separate his business from government. He said he will shift assets into a trust that will be managed by his sons. Providing few specifics, he promised no new foreign deals and said the company would adopt new internal systems to scrutinize potentially problematic domestic transactions. A display of Trump-branded wine, champagne, water and steaks on March 8 at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) But Trump and his lawyers did not address how his administration will approach the range of regulatory actions and other decisions that could directly touch the business, which in addition to Trump-branded properties around the world includes several dozen golf courses, office and condominium buildings, a winery, and his beachfront Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump\u2019s properties also include his newly opened luxury hotel in Washington\u2019s Old Post Office pavilion, which is leased from the federal government. At a minimum, according to ethics experts, government officials tasked with making decisions affecting Trump businesses could feel pressure to keep the boss happy. At worse, experts say, Trump or his allies could abuse their power to sway decision-makers. \u201cWe are going into an inauguration in a completely unprecedented situation,\u201d said Trevor Potter, who advised several GOP presidential campaigns and served as chair of the Federal Election Commission. \u201cWe face now . . . a president with a huge number of active business interests who has not taken steps to prevent government decisions concerning those interests from landing on his desk. This is a big step backwards.\u201d Potter and other ethics experts say it\u2019s not too late for Trump to take additional steps to insulate himself from such conflicts. Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics counsel to former president George W. Bush, called on Trump to enact an executive order prohibiting his appointees from participating in matters involving his businesses and enacting special civil service protections for other government employees who must do so. Without such action, Painter said, \u201cpublic trust is completely gutted. It becomes: \u2018I\u2019m the president. I\u2019m special.\u2019\u201d Spokesmen for Trump\u2019s transition and business did not comment in response to a list of detailed questions about how the president-elect\u2019s administration and company will handle likely interactions between his businesses and specific agencies. In announcing his plan last week to separate from the management of the Trump Organization, Trump said his sons Eric and Donald Jr. would run the company \u201cin a very professional manner.\u201d (The Washington Post) \u201cThey\u2019re not going to discuss it with me,\u201d he said, promising a shield between the Oval Office and Trump Tower. Sherri Dillon, a lawyer who helped design Trump\u2019s move, said Trump will limit the information he receives about his business to profit and loss statements and that the Trump Organization would appoint an ethics adviser to monitor its activities. \u201cHe instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit,\u201d she said. Most government employees are civil servants who are expected to apply the rules equally as they carry out their regulatory duties. Spokesmen for several government agencies said their workers could be trusted to regulate Trump\u2019s businesses fairly. And one legal expert said government workers responsible for enforcing laws and regulations are prohibited from bending the rules. \u201cIf they say, \u2018Tell me how to rule, and I\u2019ll rule that way,\u2019 that\u2019s clearly not legal,\u201d said John F. Duffy, a University of Virginia law school professor who specializes in intellectual property law, referring to government trademark officials. But employees have typically not been asked to apply the rules to businesses owned by their ultimate boss, the president himself \u2014 and no law prohibits the president from profiting from his elected position. Tensions have already been apparent within the government over Trump\u2019s handling of ethics issues. After the Office of Government Ethics director last week criticized Trump\u2019s decision not to divest from his business, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) summoned him for questioning. Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the OGE director \u201cought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political.\u201d Nearly every department of government could come into contact with aspects of Trump\u2019s businesses \u2014 and, because Trump is not divesting, his bottom line will be at stake. Take Trump\u2019s share in Starrett City, a complex of 46 low-income apartment towers spread over 140 acres in Brooklyn closely regulated by HUD. Trump, who once called the property \u201cone of the best investments I ever made,\u201d reported last year that his 4\u00ad\u00a0percent share in the complex was worth up to $25 million and brought in up to $5 million each year. The Trump administration will face a decision in 2020 that could directly affect how much he makes from the investment in the future. That will happen when HUD, likely to be headed by Trump rival-turned-supporter Ben Carson, will negotiate renewal of a loan subsidy program that reduces investors\u2019 mortgage interest payments. Spokesmen for HUD and the property owners did not respond to requests for information about the value of this subsidy. Advocates for low-income housing have argued that government subsidies have made ownership of low-income housing highly profitable. Another potential boost for Trump\u2019s revenue could come if HUD reverses a 2007 decision in which the agency blocked owners from selling the property as Brooklyn\u2019s real estate market boomed. Trump clashed at the time with Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other opponents of the sale, who accused owners of seeking to make money at the expense of poor tenants. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop free enterprise,\u201d Trump told the New York Daily News. \u201cThis is not Communist China.\u201d In addition to HUD approval, a sale would likely require the blessing of New York officials who forged an agreement with investors and Schumer after the 2007 fight to keep Starrett City as a housing site for middle- and low-income families for years into the future. Under questioning from Democratic senators last week during his confirmation hearing, Carson committed to inform the Senate Banking Committee of all future decisions related to Trump properties. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), a member of the committee, told The Washington Post that Carson\u2019s response was not enough and that the Trump family should sell its stakes in Starrett City and any other HUD-assisted property it owns. \u201cAn administration with personal financial interests that compete against American interests is ripe for corruption,\u201d Brown said. Some decisions with implications for Trump\u2019s business could come in more obscure areas of the executive branch. Applications for trademarks \u2014 a significant asset for Trump\u2019s businesses that rely heavily on his brand \u2014 are approved by government examiners at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Government records show Trump\u2019s campaign and business hold more than 100 trademark registrations, some of which will need to be approved for renewal by government workers in coming years. Trump\u2019s business has pending applications for eight more, and daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s business filed three applications in December. Disputes over trademark registration are heard by a government body called the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, whose judges are appointed by the commerce secretary. While judges have not been removed in the past when a new president takes over, experts said it was not clear anything would prohibit an administration from removing trademark judges and replacing them with favored candidates. Regardless, Trump\u2019s agency chief will fill vacancies. One dispute in front of the board, which began when Trump\u2019s attorneys jousted with a musician who created an iPhone trumpet game called \u201ciTrump,\u201d is ongoing. The Trump team filed its latest legal argument last week. Ken Kunkle, a Minnesota attorney specializing in trademark law, said the trademark judges could feel pressure in a Trump-related case. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where you\u2019re hearing a case involving the president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom that standpoint, I imagine it could involve some discomfort.\u201d There could also be pressure on government aviation inspectors. Trump\u2019s companies own a Boeing 757 jet dubbed \u201cTrump Force One,\u201d a smaller Cessna Citation X plane and three Sikorsky helicopters, all of which were built at least 20 years ago, Federal Aviation Administration registrations show. Those aircraft are inspected and regulated by the FAA, which will be led by a Trump appointee. All aircraft, including Trump\u2019s, are subject to random \u201cramp inspections\u201d by FAA inspectors, including reviews of logbooks and maintenance records. Those inspectors would be expected to oversee the Trump-company aircraft for safety, maintenance and other regulations, and potentially fine or otherwise penalize the company in case of violation. One former FAA manager said the issue is already being discussed among the agency\u2019s employees, who worry a vindictive Trump looking for budget cuts could target the agency if displeased with its inspectors\u2019 actions. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear right now among employees at the FAA,\u201d said the former manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid offending the new president. This person predicted that FAA inspectors would be reluctant to find anything wrong with Trump\u2019s aircraft, wary that doing so could be \u201ca career-buster.\u201d Issues related to Trump\u2019s aircraft have come up before: The FAA grounded Trump\u2019s Cessna jet during his presidential campaign because its necessary registration had expired. Trump resolved the issue by registering the plane under a new owner \u2014 another one of his companies, FAA records show. Potential conflicts could also arise involving Trump\u2019s condo projects and hotels, which have encountered government regulators in the past. Contractors at his construction sites have been ticketed and fined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to Labor Department records. The department\u2019s wage and hour division has tracked complaints of overtime and pay violations. Trump appealed to the independent agency that handles labor disputes, the National Labor Relations Board, last year after employees of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas sought to join the Culinary Workers Union. The president-elect settled that case after the election, negotiating a new contract with more than 500 housekeepers, servers and other hotel staff. As president, though, Trump will have the power to remake the NLRB. He will be able to name new members over time and top staff, including the general counsel, who helps decide which cases the court takes up. Once he takes office, Trump\u2019s businesses will likely be asking Trump\u2019s government for permission to hire foreign workers. Trump businesses have requested visas for more than 500 foreign cooks, housekeepers and other workers since 2013, according to government data. While Trump has pledged in recent weeks that his administration will \u201cfollow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American,\u201d his companies are likely to continue seeking to import labor for jobs such as picking grapes at the Trump Winery in Virginia or waiting tables at the Trump National Golf Club Jupiter in South Florida. Future Trump-company requests will be reviewed by the Labor Department and visas will be administered by the Department of Homeland Security, both of which will be led by Trump appointees. In other areas, Trump\u2019s government will be in a position to enact policies that his businesses have previously pushed for. Trump\u2019s golf courses, for instance, are members of professional associations that fought a 2015 move by the EPA to better define what bodies of water receive federal oversight. The rule has been put on hold by court action and Trump, like many Republicans, has said he wants to overturn it. \u201cWe see the clean water rule as something that could very much put our courses out of business,\u201d said Bob Helland, the director of congressional and federal affairs for the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, whose membership includes employees at 12 Trump courses. \u201cWe\u2019re very comforted by the fact that he comes to the White House with a background in the industry. We\u2019re happy to see someone who knows what it takes to maintain a course.\u201d Dalal Aboulhosn, a deputy legislative director for the Sierra Club, said she fears Trump has a \u201cvested interest\u201d in rolling back the rule. \u201cWe would like to see a clear and functioning clean water act that makes sure our waters are protected for all Americans,\u201d she said. Drama could unfold behind the scenes at the Internal Revenue Service, where employees face the potentially uncomfortable task of reviewing the complex personal finances of the president. Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, breaking with modern tradition in which presidential candidates disclose their records to show the public what conflicts, if any, might exist. Trump reiterated during his news conference last week that he would not release his returns because of ongoing audits and his belief that Americans don\u2019t care about the returns. Polls have shown that the public feels otherwise, with a Pew Research Center survey this month finding that 60 percent of Americans believe Trump has a responsibility to release his returns. As president, Trump will be automatically audited each year, a practice described in the IRS manual that has been in place for presidents and vice presidents since the 1970s. As with other traditions not enshrined in law, Trump could change the practice by ordering the IRS or his treasury secretary to forgo the annual audit, legal experts said. Every elected president, dating back to Richard Nixon, has voluntarily released his tax returns each year, allowing the public to serve as the ultimate check-and-balance on whether potential tax errors by the president appeared to have been ignored by a friendly auditor. Trump has not said if he would follow the practice of the annual audit or if he would abide by the tradition of voluntarily releasing his returns. \u201cFor decades, that crowd-sourcing has been the solution \u2014 the idea that sunlight and disclosure would guard against impropriety,\u201d said Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit tax policy center. If required by auditors to pay back taxes, Trump could also challenge the ruling before the U.S. Tax Court, whose judges are presidential appointees. \u201cPart of our culture as tax practitioners is the understanding that the IRS is not entangled in politics,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a longtime tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cWhat does it mean for a president to flout that history? Where does it take us?\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

A cross-border drug smugglers' tunnel that had been shut down but left unfilled on the Mexican side was found to be back in operation in December, officials said. (Mexico Attorney General's Office / Associated Press) Mexican drug cartels have burrowed dozens of tunnels in the last decade, outfitted them with rail and cart systems to whisk drugs under the U.S. border and, after being discovered by authorities, abandoned them. But some of the illicit passageways live on. At least six previously discovered border tunnels have been reactivated by Mexican trafficking groups in recent years, exposing a recurring large-scale smuggling threat, according to U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials. The breaches of border defenses, most recently in December, occur because Mexican authorities, unlike those on the American side, do not fill the tunnels with concrete once they have been discovered. Mexican authorities say they lack the funds. Instead, only the tunnel openings are sealed. That allows traffickers to simply dig a new entry point to access the largely intact subterranean passageways leading to the U.S. border. The security lapse is a boon for traffickers, experts say, saving them time and money and reducing their risk of being caught as they haul away dirt. \u201cThe biggest threat is that it\u2019s a huge open invitation for drug traffickers, and it\u2019s definitely going to be taken advantage of,\u201d said Michael Unzueta, a former special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego. On the U.S. side, drug tunnels have been filled since 2007, after The Times reported that they were being left unfilled because of budget constraints at U.S. Customs and Border Protection . Prompted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who called the tunnels a \u201cnational security risk,\u201d the agency has filled every large tunnel up to the border ever since, according to Department of Homeland Security officials. U.S. authorities at the time anticipated that traffickers would reactivate the tunnels, and some recommended that the U.S. consider paying Mexico\u2019s costs of filling the tunnels on its side.\u00a0But funding sources were never found. Since 2007, it has cost Customs and Border Protection $8.7 million to fill drug tunnels, according to a 2016 report by the Department of Homeland Security. Now an estimated 20 large tunnels, constructed before and after 2007, remain largely intact on the Mexican side, according to U.S. and Mexican officials. The tunnel issue could take on more urgency under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump , who has made border security a central feature of his campaign. Border patrol agents who are part of Trump\u2019s transition team said they plan to bring it up with the new administration. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave infrastructure in place in the form of half-completed tunnels for [cartels] to use,\u201d said Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union of agents whose leaders have advised Trump on border security issues. \u201cThe cartels are by no means stupid. They\u2019re taking the idea to work smarter, not harder, when it comes to these tunnels.\u201d When border fencing went up, traffickers moved underground. Since 2006 there have been 148 tunnels built, according to the DHS, most of them in Arizona and California. \u00a0 The biggest underground threats now come from what border officials refer to as \u201csuper tunnels,\u201d which cost millions of dollars to dig and feature sophisticated touches like lighting and ventilation systems that extend for hundreds of yards down wood-beamed passageways. Most have been constructed in San Diego\u2019s Otay Mesa region, 20 miles south of downtown. The truck-clogged landscape of nondescript warehouses has long served as ideal cover for underground incursions emanating from a light industrial area directly across the border in Tijuana. It was here in November 2010 that U.S. and Mexican authorities made one of the biggest drug busts ever, seizing 30 tons of marijuana from warehouses linked by a 600-yard passageway. At a news conference in front the warehouse in San Diego, authorities dubbed it the \u201celection day tunnel,\u201d allowed reporters into the depths and declared a victory against traffickers. \u201cFrustrated by our defenses, they\u2019re literally going underground, but we\u2019re thwarting them there as well,\u201d said John Morton, then director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Afterward, mixing trucks on the San Diego side poured enough concrete to fill the tunnel all the way to the border two blocks away. On the Mexican side, workers poured concrete into the tunnel opening and declared it closed. Four years later, in April 2014, U.S. and Mexican authorities were back in the same area. Traffickers had dug 700 yards from a window repair shop in Tijuana to another warehouse in San Diego. When U.S. agents toured the tunnel they noticed that one segment was lined with older-looking electrical wiring and wooden support beams. It also had two sets of ventilation and cart tracks. The election day tunnel, they determined, had been reactivated \u2014 about 1,025 feet of it. According to coordinates provided by Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of ICE, traffickers appeared to have started digging the tunnel at the window repair shop, then burrowed across Jose Maria Velasco and Jose Lopez Portillo streets, where they tapped into the existing passageway. From there, they had a free run to the border, and were able to reuse the electrical wiring and support beams. \u201cIt saves them time and money because they don\u2019t have to dig as far. It\u2019s already there,\u201d said Joe Dimeglio, a supervisory special agent with ICE Homeland Security Investigations. In recent years, traffickers have reactivated or tried to reactivate at least four other tunnels in the Otay Mesa area, most recently last month near Tijuana\u2019s international airport. Two more tunnels have seen resumed activity under the Mexicali-Calexico border, 100 miles east of San Diego, according to Homeland Security Investigations. The election day tunnel remains largely intact in Mexico, concealed inside a high-walled compound where a security guard spends his time watching television on a torn-up sofa. The guard, Victor Mendiola, 55, is there because the property remains under the control of Mexican federal authorities. Mendiola said his responsibility includes preventing people from accessing the concrete-sealed opening, which now has added layers of garbage and dirt. But his presence, he admits, isn\u2019t much of a deterrent.\u00a0Clustered around the building on all sides are car repair shops, warehouses and homes, any one of which can serve as a staging ground for diggers wanting to tap into the tunnel beneath his feet. \u201cI\u2019m here every day, but they could do it again,\u201d Mendiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

The AP learned declining attendance combined with high operating costs are among the reasons for closing. (Jan. 14) AP This file photo taken on March 19, 2015 shows a performer riding an elephant holding a US national flag during a Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performance in Washington, DC. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced Saturday, January 14, 2016 it will host its final show in May, ending \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" after 146 years. Company executives cited high operating costs and declining ticket sales after the American circus retired its elephants -- a main draw -- as some of the factors that triggered its downfall. (Photo: ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS, AFP/Getty Images) Animal rights activists claimed a major victory Sunday after Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus said it would halt its show in May after 146 years . The move came as circuses and animal-performance shows across the country have struggled with declining attendance and shifting social pressure brought to bear by activists who argued the animals were sometimes poorly treated.\u00a0Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus removed elephants from its performances last May, and the company said ticket sales then dropped drastically. The company had long battled animal rights activists in costly court skirmishes\u00a0\u2014 winning a $15.75 million judgment against them in 2015 \u2014\u00a0but apparently lost the larger fight over public opinion. \u201cIT\u2019S OVER,\u201d actress and animal rights advocate Pamela Anderson posted to her 1.07 million Twitter followers. PETA, which has crusaded against animal treatment, lauded the decision and said the trend should accelerate. \u201cAll other animal circuses, roadside zoos, and wild animal exhibitors, including marine amusement parks like SeaWorld and the Miami Seaquarium, must take note: Society has changed, eyes have been opened, people know now who these animals are, and we know it is wrong to capture and exploit them.\u201d More coverage: Elephants' final act Circuses have long been a part of the American social fabric, bringing exotic animals to small towns across the country, giving awestruck children a taste of the wilder world beyond. But the past three decades, in particular, have seen a growing concern for the health and welfare of wild animals who spend their lives in captivity. Most people didn\u2019t realize what went on behind the scenes, said Jan Creamer, the president of Animal Defenders International, which has conducted undercover investigations into circuses for 20 years. Even if only some circuses treated the animals poorly, people began to believe that simply keeping them in captivity and forcing them to perform was its own kind of cruelty, she said. \u201cPeople were shocked at the day-to-day casual violence,\u201d Creamer said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any better. Now, we do. As Ringling has found out, people are better educated and \u2026 recognize suffering and cruelty in other species. They don\u2019t want to see animals suffer for 15 minutes of entertainment.\u201d Feld Entertainment, which owned the circus, said ticket sales dropped after the elephants were retired to the company\u2019s breeding and research facility. The company didn\u2019t specify what will happen to the remaining animals, which include tigers, lions, horses, dogs and camels, but scheduled a Monday press conference to discuss the decision. Company officials declined to be interviewed on Sunday. \"The circus and its people have continually been a source of inspiration and joy to my family and me, which is why this was such a tough business decision to make, company CEO Kenneth Feld said in a statement. \"The decision was even more difficult because of the amazing fans that have become part of our extended circus family over the years, and we are extremely grateful to the millions of families who have made\u00a0Ringling Bros.\u00a0part of their lives for generations.\" Ringling Bros. circus closing after 146 years The company's two circus shows,\u00a0Out of This World\u00a0and\u00a0Circus Xtreme, have 30 shows left, including appearances in Atlanta, Brooklyn and Boston. The final shows are May 7 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, R.I., and May 21 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. The company said it would help its circus performers transition to new roles\u00a0but didn\u2019t offer specifics about how many employees might lose the jobs. Feld Entertainment said in a statement that the spirit of the circus would live on through the company's\u00a0other shows. As with most things, Internet chatter immediately turned the circus conversation to politics. Actor and author George Takei said the title of the \u201cGreatest Show on Earth\u201d would now be taken up by the Trump administration (he used language we can\u2019t print), and multiple USA TODAY readers jokingly suggested that the circus clowns would find work in politics. After 146 yrs, Ringling Bros will close \"Greatest Show on Earth.\" That title now goes to the daily shitshow coming from the President-elect. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) January 15, 2017 Those kinds of jokes previously hit a nerve with Feld Entertainment, which last fall launched a \u201c#TakeBackTheCircus\u201d campaign after growing tired of hearing politicians referred to as clowns. @TrevorHughes @USATODAY @RinglingBros used to watch the train with all the animals roll into town as a kid. Was a highlight of the year. \u2014 Jason Gerdon (@JGfromOC) January 15, 2017 @TrevorHughes @USATODAY @RinglingBros Loved going to the circus and taking our grown sons and watching their faces as the elephants parade! \u2014 Terry Kennedy (@TerryKennedy7) January 15, 2017 @TrevorHughes @RinglingBros @USATODAY Even as a child I realized the human depravity & sadism involved in animal circuses. \u2014 James Madison (@JamesMa50910080) January 15, 2017 @TrevorHughes @USATODAY @RinglingBros Honestly, the first time I saw a whip come out to be used on the animals, it felt wrong to me. 5666 CONNECT TWEET 17 LINKEDIN 58 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iA0L3g NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump has always been hooked on recognition. He is obsessed with his television ratings . His office is festooned with decades-old magazine covers featuring himself. Even negative attention can be a win; he\u2019s thrilled to be named Time\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d even if the cover might evoke images of both Hitler and Satan. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But today magazine covers and TV hits lack the cultural dominance they once held. (As Mr. Trump tweeted in 2013 , Time \u201clooks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot!\u201d) Now he\u2019s found a medium where recognition arrives every fraction of a second, and his reach is quantified in real time \u2014 ratings, but for every sentence you ever write. Scroll through the list of accounts Mr. Trump follows and you\u2019ll find a tightly curated crew of Trump relatives (like Ivanka ), Trump-branded properties ( Trump Waikiki ), Trump-adjacent celebrities ( Roma Downey , wife to \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d producer Mark Burnett) and reliably Trump-friendly outlets (\u201c Fox & Friends ,\u201d naturally). It\u2019s a remarkable picture of social media restraint for Twitter\u2019s most uninhibited star, and it gives a glimpse at the image Mr. Trump intends to project: devoted family man, tremendous business magnate, friend to Gary Player. But Mr. Trump\u2019s dominant posture is reactive, and his real focus is on who follows him. He almost exclusively retweets praise from fans. He tweets about all the credit he deserves (\u201cThank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night\u201d), then waits for more virtual credit to roll in. He brags to journalists about the rate at which likes and retweets hit. He gets high on his own supply. Part of the peculiarity of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets is that he tweets like a celebrity, not a politician or a businessman. Even his handle, @realdonaldtrump , suggests his full immersion in the most basic of our celebrity culture. Though he\u2019s preparing to assume the presidency, he tweets like a Hollywood social climber \u2014 he fans celebrity feuds with Graydon Carter (\u201cno talent\u201d) and Meryl Streep (\u201cover-rated\u201d) and posts product endorsements (\u201cBuy L. L. Bean.\u201d). The highest office in the land has afforded Mr. Trump his most prominent celebrity perch. His account has risen from a few million followers to nearly 20 million in the past year. There was a time when some assumed that Mr. Trump\u2019s public persona would evolve as he rose in the political ranks. But there\u2019s just one Trump, and that\u2019s been key to his success. As Kim Kardashian once said , the secret to social media dominance is authenticity and consistency. Mr. Trump\u2019s projection of realness relies on him being reliably self-aggrandizing and wildly inappropriate. That may seem like a liability for the leader of the free world, but it\u2019s an asset in the low-culture celebrity roles that have led him to this moment: reality TV boss, Howard Stern guest, pro-wrestling heel. Eight years ago, Barack Obama was the social media wonder headed to the White House, and his tech savvy was heralded as a bright light for democracy. The tweets he posts to @POTUS never seem impulsive; they seem made for posterity. Even his jokes are calculated to be minimally offensive and maximally educational. When the NASA rover Curiosity carried Mr. Obama\u2019s signature to the surface of Mars, Mr. Obama responded in the form of a dad joke: \u201cThat is out of this world.\u201d If Mr. Obama came to power in a time of great optimism for Twitter, Mr. Trump lords over a waning platform. What was once a hopeful place for global connection and resistance has become a site for coordinating harassment campaigns, connecting with white supremacists and accelerating unverified and sometimes dangerous rumors. Its growth has slumped and its stock price has stagnated. But the place suits Mr. Trump\u2019s purposes fine. For the guy who\u2019s all about appearances, Twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming press secretary, has suggested that Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions, where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fans instead of the scrutiny of the press. The social media platforms that were once heralded as democratic tools could also be used to undermine democratic norms. Advertisement Continue reading the main story All of this works because one group is as intoxicated by Twitter as Mr. Trump is: journalists. It\u2019s hard to explain to a normal person \u2014 one of the 79 percent of American adults who don\u2019t use Twitter \u2014 why the platform mesmerizes the news media. Its all-powerful search function means you can conjure material on any kind of news topic \u2014 or just spend your time searching for your own name. Reporters still crave the ego rush of a published byline, but that pales in comparison to the animated feedback loop that Twitter offers. The more time you spend, and the more tweets you send, the bigger your following becomes. But Twitter provides little actual reach \u2014 compared with Facebook or Google, it hardly drives any traffic to articles. It\u2019s like a video game for professional validation. Mr. Trump expertly exploits journalists\u2019 unwavering attention to their Twitter feeds, their competitive spirit and their ingrained journalistic conventions \u2014 chiefly, that what the president says is inherently newsworthy. As a developer and reality show star, he lobbied the news media for coverage. Now journalists feel obligated to pay attention to him. Mr. Trump overwhelms the media with boatloads of what was once a rare commodity: access. He creates impressions faster than journalists can check them. By the time they turn up the facts, the news cycle has moved on to his next missive, leaving less time (and reader attention) for the stories Mr. Trump does not highlight on his feed. Mr. Trump may not follow a deliberate distraction strategy, but he doesn\u2019t need one. He distracts instinctively. All he needs is a phone, the press and whatever thought just entered his mind.

Strickland, 24, was arrested in El Paso and booked into the jail. He has been charged in Milwaukee with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide and with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Jail records do not list an attorney to comment on his behalf. Authorities said Strickland was among a group of men arguing in front of a Milwaukee home July 17. Witnesses saw him go inside the house, emerge with a gun and fire into the small crowd. Authorities said Strickland fatally shot Maurice Brown Jr., 38, who was on the ground, then turned to Michael Allen Reed, 39, and shot him in the head. \"It was vicious,\" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said when Strickland was added to the FBI's most-wanted list last month. \"It was unnecessary. Neither individual posed the slightest threat to Mr. Strickland, but they paid with their lives for occupying the same space.\" Authorities have said Strickland fled from the shooting in a black SUV, abandoning his 18-month-old daughter inside the house, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The FBI said agents were led to Strickland after receiving a tip that he may be temporarily living in El Paso. The FBI in El Paso and the El Paso Police Department arrested Strickland early Sunday morning during a traffic stop. He was taken into custody without incident. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump slams outgoing CIA director Brennan after criticism over Russia threat Published               January 15, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump blasted outgoing CIA Director John Brennan on social media Sunday after Brennan said Trump does not have a \u201cfull understanding\u201d of Russia\u2019s power and threat to the world. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has a full understanding of Russian capabilities and the actions they are taking on the world,\u201d Brennan told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He also suggested that Trump lacks a \u201cfull appreciation\u201d of Russia\u2019s aggression or about why President Obama imposed sanctions on the Kremlin for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cMr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia is a road that he needs to be very, very careful about moving down,\u201d Brennan said. Trump responded with a two-tweet message that criticized the CIA's record under Brennan and questioned whether the director had leaked a dossier of unverified allegations that Russia spies had obtained compromising personal and financial information about Trump. . @FoxNews \"Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat. Does not fully understand.\" Oh really, couldn't do... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017 much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017 The day after the dossier's contents were published by BuzzFeed, Trump posted on Twitter that intelligence agencies \"should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak'\" before asking \"Are we living in Nazi Germany?\"\u00a0 Trump has repeatedly hoped for better U.S. ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he has been particularly suspicious of the entire U.S. intelligence community since it concluded Russia and Putin tried to influence the elections, in an apparent effort to help Trump defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Brennan said Trump likening the U.S. intelligence community to Nazi Germany for presumably leaking the content of an opposition-research dossier on him is \u201coutrageous.\u201d \"There is no interest in undermining the president elect,\u201d he said. \u201cOur responsibility is to understand dangers on the world stage so (Trump and his Republican administration) have the intel we have so they can make the best decision.\u201d However, he said Trump \u201cneeds to be disciplined\u201d and that he\u2019ll face numerous challenges\u201d in his presidency that begins Friday -- with terrorism, cybersecurity, North Korea and Middle East instability among those at the top. \u201cSo many issues on Day One,\u201d said Brennan, who President Obama appointed to lead the CIA in 2013.

Under President Obama, the unemployment rate... Show me how I did. \u2026 reached its lowest level since 2007. The current rate is a stunning decline from the 9.3 percent in 2009, the year Mr. Obama took office. Under Mr. Obama, the number of immigrants convicted of crimes who were deported... Show me how I did. \u2026 was double the number who were deported during the Bush administration. In fiscal year 2016, 58 percent of the 240,255 immigrants deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement were convicted criminals. Under Mr. Obama, national spending on health care, as a percent of the gross domestic product,... Show me how I did. \u2026 continued to rise, as more people signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under Mr. Obama, the national debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product... Show me how I did. \u2026 nearly doubled. In fiscal year 2016, the Congressional Budget Office projected the debt to be nearly 77 percent of the gross domestic product. Under Mr. Obama, the number of Mexicans living in the United States illegally... Show me how I did. ... declined, and it is now a million below its peak during the Bush administration. Under Mr. Obama, the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people... Show me how I did. \u2026 continued to decline, contrary to President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s statement that decades of progress are now being reversed . A number of cities saw recent upticks, but over all, crime is still lower than in the 1990s. Under Mr. Obama, the number of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq... Show me how I did. \u2026 declined steadily. In July, he announced that the United States would keep more troops in Afghanistan than initially planned.

Gerald Herbert / AP Share advertisement In March 2014, more than two years after President Barack Obama sailed to reelection in a historic sweep of the Latino vote, a powerful ally was about to call him out. The president had been flying high on the success of his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, a legacy-defining executive action that opened up broad horizons for thousands of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as young children. But there was a major wrinkle in his record that the president could not outrun. At a gala that March, Janet Murgu\u00eda, president of the National Council on La Raza (NCLR), stood before a room full of immigrant advocates and said what many had long been thinking in the back of their minds: Though congressional Republicans were on the hook for blockading comprehensive immigration reform, Obama was not blameless in their community's visceral disappointment. \"For us, this president has been the deporter-in-chief,\" Murgu\u00eda said. Members of a coalition of Latino groups rally outside the Federal Building in Los Angeles on March. 26, 2014. The rally was part of the \"Obama Legacy Project,\" a campaign looking to hold President Obama accountable for record deportations. Damian Dovarganes / AP file It was a shocking condemnation coming from one of the largest Latino advocacy groups in the country. NCLR had served as a pipeline of influential leaders who were elevated as advisers in the Obama White House. Yet Murgu\u00eda's keynote address highlighted the vise squeezing around Obama: From one side, growing public outrage was bubbling in blaming the president for not doing enough to combat illegal immigration; on the other, a burgeoning Latino voting bloc with newly realized political clout was fast becoming disillusioned by the rising toll of deportations. Related: Immigrant Harboring Law: Activists Face Off With State of Texas in Federal Court When Obama's eight years in office come to a close, he will be leaving behind a mixed legacy on immigration that is tinged by political impasse and half-fulfilled promises. Congress did not pass comprehensive immigration during Obama's administration; a bipartisan Senate plan stalled in the House. But Obama broke new ground in creating DACA, which gave more than 800,000 young undocumented immigrants known as DREAMers a lifeline, with temporary work permits and protection from deportation. Undocumented DREAMer Astrid Silva hugs President Barack Obama after introducing him before the president's remarks on his use of executive authority to relax U.S. immigration policy during a speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas on Nov. 21, 2014. Mike Blake / Reuters file Yet at the same time, more immigrants were forcibly removed from the United States under Obama than any other president. More than 2.8 million undocumented immigrants have been deported over the last eight years , marking a visceral point of conflict for DREAMers who say they have much to owe to the president. \"Even though we had millions of deportations, I recognize that my life has been radically different under an Obama administration, more than I had ever imagined,\" said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for pro-immigrant group United We Dream. Related: SCOTUS Immigration Case Could Undermine Trump Deportation Plan Now, a chief concern is that Obama's successor, Donald Trump, will take the most aggressive pieces of the current administration's enforcement apparatus and use them to an extreme. \"There is a vast network of a deportation structure that will now facilitate Trump's move to deport millions of people more,\" Martinez added. Advocates say that adding to Obama's tainted record is the resurgence of a highly contested practice of detaining immigrant women and children, even asylum seekers. Play ",

Journalists gather outside the London headquarters of Orbis Business Intelligence, the company run by British former intelligence officer Christopher Steele. (Leon Neal / Getty Images) Kurtis Lee Contact Reporter He\u2019s a former British spy, a man used to operating in the shadows. Now, however, he is dramatically, and uncomfortably, in the spotlight. Christopher Steele, whom some confidants describe as a real-life Agent\u00a0007, has been identified in news reports as the author of a controversial dossier suggesting\u00a0that Russian officials had gathered compromising information about President-elect Donald Trump that could be used to blackmail him. The dossier\u2019s existence was widely known among journalists and politicians in Washington since the fall, but the allegations about the incoming president\u2019s activities in Russia and his personal life were unverified\u00a0and remained unknown to the general public. But this month the 35-page file, salacious allegations and all, was published by BuzzFeed News. Trump has castigated the dossier as \u201cfake news,\u201d and blamed U.S. intelligence agencies for leaking it \u2014\u00a0an accusation that heightened the already-testy relationship between the president-elect and intelligence community. Later, the Wall Street Journal identified the dossier\u2019s author as Steele. Without naming Steele, Trump alluded to him on social media as a \u201cfailed spy afraid of being sued.\u201d But that\u2019s not accurate \u2014 at least to some. \u201cI know him as a very competent, professional operator who left the secret service and is now operating his own private company,\u201d Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia, told the BBC last week. \u201cI do not think he would make things up. I don't think he would, necessarily, always draw correct judgment, but that's not the same thing.\u201d Toward the end of the Cold War, Steele, 52, served in the MI6, Britain\u2019s version of the CIA, an agency created in the early\u00a01900s so secretive that the British government didn\u2019t officially acknowledge its existence until the 1990s. Steele began working for MI6 that same decade,\u00a0with postings in in Moscow and then Paris. According to British news reports, he was a Russia specialist and worked on the investigation into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy who was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210, which was slipped into his green tea during a meeting in London with two Russian agents.\u00a0 Litvinenko, who sought asylum in Britain in 2000, was a harsh critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin , and last year a British inquiry found that Putin \u201cprobably approved\u201d the scheme to poison him.\u00a0 Steele left the intelligence agency in 2009 and founded Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. The London-based firm, housed in a handsome headquarters with elaborate stonework on the\u00a0balconies,\u00a0specializes in investigations and intelligence-gathering, noting on its website \u201creal-time source reporting on business and politics at all levels.\u201d Some of Steele\u2019s work included gathering information for the U.S. Department of Justice into a 2015 corruption inquiry of FIFA, the international governing body of soccer, according to Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper. Several members of FIFA\u2019s ruling executive committee were indicted on bribery charges as part of a widening corruption investigation headed by the FBI and Department of Justice. John Sipher, a former CIA official who spent 28 years at the agency \u2014 including stints in Russia \u2014 did not work specifically with Steele, but said that within the intelligence community, Steele was a \u201ccredible guy.\u201d \u201cHe knows his stuff,\u201d said Sipher, who retired from the CIA in 2014 and now works at a Washington-based technology firm. \u201cThat was widely known.\u201d Sipher credited much of the uproar over Steele\u2019s dossier to the fact that \u201cno one truly knows his sources.\u201d Others, like Nigel West, an intelligence historian who worked with Steele, described his work glowingly as if he were out of the movies. \u201cHe\u2019s James Bond,\u201d West told NBC News, alluding to the fictional British spy. \u201cI actually introduced him to my wife as James Bond.\u201d\u00a0 The veracity of the memo has come under intense scrutiny, and journalists, as well as government officials, have called the allegations unverified.\u00a0Moreover, misspellings are dotted throughout. For example, it refers to Alfa Group, a privately owned Russian-based financial investment firm, as \u201cAlpha Group.\u201d Such errors seem at odds with comments from intelligence professionals who have described Steele as meticulous. Russian officials have dismissed the memo as false. \u201cThis is an absolute canard, an absolute fabrication, and it\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d said\u00a0Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin.\u00a0 He added, \u201cThe Kremlin does not engage in collecting kompromat ,\u201d\u00a0using the Russian term for compromising material.\u00a0 State-run Russian media chimed in too. \u201cIts content was like a parody of poorly constructed kompromat,\u201d said the television station Russia 24. Sean Spicer, who is set serve as Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, offered a forceful condemnation of the report at a news conference last week.\u00a0 \u201cThe report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple,\u201d Spicer said, adding that it\u2019s \u201cflat-out false.\u201d Steele has not commented publicly about the dossier, and reporters who\u2019ve staked out his company\u2019s headquarters haven\u2019t been rewarded much for their efforts. The company website does not include a biography on him, or anyone else, but it does note that it still welcomes resumes from job applicants who \u201cpossess excellent research, analytical and writing skills, and thrive on unraveling complex issues in a diverse range of industries and regions.\u201d In recent days, details have emerged about Steele\u2019s personal life. His wife, Laura, died in 2009, as a result of cirrhosis of the liver, according to the Telegraph. They lived in Surrey, a suburb of London, where Steele still resides. While Steele has reportedly gone into hiding \u2014 at least for now \u2014 West is hoping for the best for his former colleague. \"If it is validated, Chris will be confirmed as one of the great intelligence officers of the decade,\u201d West told the British TV station ITV News in an interview about the dossier. \u201cIf not, I fear the worst.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

Cardona, Naples (Fla.) Daily News Published 4:48 p.m. ET Jan. 15, 2017 | Updated 1 minute ago x Share The suspect in the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting is a 26-year-old Army veteran named Esteban Santiago. Officials say he reached out to the FBI in November and told them that the Islamic State had taken control of his mind. USA TODAY NETWORK An undated handout photo made available by the Broward County Sheriff's Department shows Esteban Santiago in custody following a shooting which left at least five people dead and several injured at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale. (Photo: BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF / HANDOUT, EPA) Esteban Santiago, the man accused of killing five people and injuring six others at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport shooting on Jan. 6, is set to appear in court again Tuesday for a pre-trial detention hearing. Federal detention hearings are held in cases that involve violent crimes, offenses with a maximum sentence of\u00a0life imprisonment or death, and serious risk of flight. The prosecution will have to prove that no conditions of release will ensure the public\u2019s safety. It will likely be determined during the hearing where Santiago, 26,\u00a0will be held and the terms of his detention. Airport shooting survivor shielded stranger from gunfire In his first appearance last week, Santiago answered U.S. Magistrate Judge\u00a0Alicia Valle\u2019s questions about his finances and whether he understood the charges against him. Valle determined Santiago was indigent and\u00a0appointed him a public defender. A criminal complaint filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleges that Santiago committed murder, airport violence and firearm violations. Santiago fired 10 to 15 rounds of ammunition from his 9 mm handgun and shot at people in a \u201cmethodical manner,\u201d aiming for victims\u2019 heads, according to the criminal complaint affidavit. When his ammunition was spent, Santiago dropped to the floor. ",

USA TODAY NETWORK Despite a weekend dust-up, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Sunday he hopes that Georgia congressman John Lewis re-considers his decision to attend this week's inauguration of Donald Trump. While expressing admiration for Lewis and his role in the civil rights movement, Pence told Fox News Sunday that \"I was\u00a0deeply disappointed to see someone of his stature question the legitimacy of Donald Trump's election as president and say he's not attending the inauguration ...\u00a0I hope he reconsiders both positions.\" Pence also said Trump was defending himself when with tweets that attacked both Lewis and his Atlanta-based congressional district.\u00a0\"Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to.mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\" Trump said in a pair of tweets. \"All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\" In a later tweet, Trump said: \"Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!\" Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 Lewis does not appear to be prepared to back down from his boycott decision, or his claim that Trump is an illegitimate president because of evidence of Russia interference; at least more than dozen Democratic lawmakers have joined his call for a boycott, accusing Trump of a racially-tinged attack on Lewis and residents of his district. In an interview broadcast Sunday, Lewis told NBC's Meet The Press that \"I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" and \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and\u00a0they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\" Trump's response to those comments drew criticism from members of both parties. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who called for Lewis to reconsider his boycott, also tweeted to Trump: \"John Lewis and his 'talk'\u00a0have changed the world.\" To Lewis, Sasse tweeted: \"Please come to the Inauguration. It isn't about a man. It is a celebration of peaceful transfer of power.\" Stay with USA TODAY for full coverage of the 2017\u00a0 inauguration .

Employees prepare the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Narenda Shrestha / EPA) Sarah D. Wire Contact Reporter There\u2019s a lot Rep. Jared Huffman would rather do than go to Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday. So\u00a0he\u2019s going to stay home. \"I\u2019ll spend that day, and actually several days, in my district doing service events and community events to try to send a positive message with my time rather than sitting passively and applauding while something that I think is very dark and dangerous for our country begins,\u201d said Huffman (D-San Rafael). Among other things, Huffman plans to spend the weekend helping with a river cleanup,\u00a0participating\u00a0in a naturalization ceremony for new citizens\u00a0and joining a local women\u2019s march against the Republican president-elect.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to be far busier in my district and in my community doing positive things than I ever would have been coming to Washington for that ceremony,\u201d Huffman said. As of Thursday night, 39 of California\u2019s 55-member delegation said they planned\u00a0to attend the inauguration, where members of Congress have some of the best seats to view the peaceful transfer of power. That includes all 14 of the delegation\u2019s Republicans. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove) said:\u00a0\u201cI attended both of Obama\u2019s. You better believe I\u2019ll be attending Trump\u2019s!\" But at least 12 California House Democrats are skipping the inauguration.\u00a0An additional five say they are still trying to decide. Among the undecideds is Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who recently had a pacemaker installed.\u00a0Her staffers said they weren\u2019t\u00a0sure of her plans. Some told The Times last week they are they\u00a0being motivated\u00a0to stay home by outcry from constituents in a state that overwhelmingly picked Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, others by Trump\u2019s comments and the moves he\u2019s made since building his Cabinet. Most of the members\u00a0who aren\u2019t\u00a0going made up their minds not to attend even before Trump criticized civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who announced on Friday he wouldn\u2019t be going and said he believed Trump wouldn\u2019t be a legitimate president.\u00a0 Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) said last week\u00a0her conscience won\u2019t permit her to attend. \u201cAn inauguration for me is a celebratory event and while I appreciate and honor the peaceful transition of power, for me to celebrate someone who wants to build a wall, who wants to establish a Muslim registry, who wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and who has appointed a person as attorney general such as Jeff Sessions ... I can\u2019t celebrate that,\u201d Lee said. \"I acknowledge the fact that he is the incoming president, but I\u2019m not in the mood to celebrate that fact,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose). Rep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside) said he  struggled with the decision\u00a0and sought advice from colleagues and constituents before ultimately deciding not to go. \u201cHe\u2019s shown such disrespect for some of the people I represent and it\u2019s a hard thing for me to get over and he\u2019s not really dialed it back or tried to show that he\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Takano said. \u201cI want to be respectful of the office, but at the same time I also want to represent my constituents.\u201d Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) is using his week free of House votes to do his Air Force Reserve duty on Tuesday and Wednesday. He\u2019ll be done before Friday\u2019s ceremony, but said he doesn\u2019t see the point of coming back for it. Lieu and Trump will find topics to agree on, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I need to be at his inauguration,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it on television, but do I want to ... spend taxpayer money to fly me here to watch it?\u201d Multiple members are still wrestling with the decision. Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D-Los Angeles) said he\u2019s struggling to give Trump the deference he would normally extend a president\u00a0regardless of party, and hasn\u2019t made up his mind. \u201cI think about all the people that he has offended, over and over, past and present, and it\u2019s painful to think that I would bring myself to actually go out there and sit there and subject myself to him just 50 feet away,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas said. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) is leaning toward not going,\u00a0too, though she\u2019d like to say goodbye to President Obama. Her constituents voted overwhelmingly for Clinton, and she said they\u2019re telling her not to go. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that I want to be there,\u201d Bass said. \u201cFor us to fly all the way back here, I just don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d Rep. Juan Vargas, a former Jesuit missionary, said that if he doesn\u2019t go, he\u2019ll spend the time praying for the country\u00a0and for Trump. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for the office of the president, but after the things that the president-elect has said \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be a hypocrite and pretend like I have respect for him,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cI studied to be a priest for a long time and we all make mistakes, but the things that he has said, the mocking of disabled people in particular, the things he\u2019s said about Mexicans, it would be very hard for me to be in a place like that celebrating.\u201d Several Democrats who have decided to go said their\u00a0decision was made easier because they\u2019ll also\u00a0attend the Women\u2019s March on Washington, a protest expected to draw many thousands to the National Mall the day after the inauguration. Many members who are not attending the inauguration said they will participate in associated women\u2019s marches in California. Freshman\u00a0Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Santa Barbara) said he struggled with whether to go before deciding that it was more important to make a statement by attending than to make a statement by staying home. \u201cI was trying to reconcile everything that happened during the election. Clearly, with President-elect Trump it\u2019s not just a difference on policy. His behavior, the hateful things he said about many people, including myself \u2014 somebody who is Mexican \u2014 veterans, the disabled, really touched me in a very profound way,\u201d he said. Carbajal was born in Mexico and immigrated to the U.S.\u00a0as a child. He says\u00a0joining some constituents for the women\u2019s march afterward is \u201ca way to be present, to symbolize that I will be at least one member of Congress among many that he will have to deal with as he implements his agenda.\u201d Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) said attending the march after going to the inauguration is a chance to exercise his rights as a citizen. \u201cTo respect the office of the presidency and yet be able to turn around the next day and to say that not everything that he\u2019s said represents the values of San Bernardino County or this country \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s America,\u201d he said.

    "text": "Laura Ricketts' pleas to President Obama led to Monday's White House visit Photos from the 2017 Cubs Convention at the Sheraton Grand Chicago. Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune It was a bipartisan effort by the Ricketts siblings that led to Monday's White House celebration of the Cubs , who just managed to beat the clock before President Barack Obama 's moving day. So while Pennsylvania Avenue is fenced off in preparation for President-elect Donald Trump 's inauguration ceremony Friday, the World Series champions will be ushered inside Monday afternoon for the final sports celebration of the Obama era, joining the Blackhawks as the only Chicago teams to be feted by Obama during his eight years in the White House. Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts, a prominent fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in her failed presidential bid, was the key to getting the deal done after Obama called Cubs manager Joe Maddon and invited the team after they beat the Indians in Game 7 of the World Series. \"It's no surprise that I support President Obama,\" Ricketts said. \"But he invited us right away and I think everyone wanted to make it work. It was just a matter of getting the guys together after a very long season, and finding a time when we can get all the guys together, and a time when the president was available. He's very busy trying to wrap up his term and get out of office. \"I just sent a couple of emails saying, 'Please make this work. We'd love to do it. We really appreciate the invite. Really, can we make it work?' \" It didn't look possible when the players scattered around the world after the Cubs' victory parade. But Cubs traveling secretary Vijay Tekchandani kept them apprised of the possible plans during the offseason, and things finally fell into place in December, when Monday's date was agreed upon as the best chance. \"We suggested the 16th would work, or around the convention, since all the players are here,\" Ricketts said. \"There were a lot of moving parts. They wanted to relax, and it was a long, stressful, exhausting haul for them. They deserved time to relax, and to pull them all back together after they had just dispersed, that would be kind of tough. \"So it really kind of had to work around (the Cubs Convention) because they were all coming here anyway.\" Photos of Chicago sports teams visiting the White House through the years. The champions flew to Washington on Sunday night, and Maddon, the players and other personnel will either fly back to Chicago afterward on a team charter or fly directly to their homes from D.C. \"It's going to be awesome,\" pitcher Kyle Hendricks said. \"The first African-American president, just to be able to visit him and get a picture. \u2026 Just to see the White House in general is a really special honor. I've talked to some people that have been able to visit, and they told me it's just unbelievable. Just to be able to see the scene, see what it's all about, it's a really special opportunity for us.\" President Theo Epstein will be making his second trip to the White House after missing the visit by the 2007 champion Red Sox . Epstein said it was misinterpreted by some in Boston as a protest, though family issues prevented him from going. Jake Arrieta said he will miss Monday's festivities for family reasons as well, but most everyone else will be on hand. \"Tom (Ricketts) summed it best with that one quick liner \u2014 'No matter your politics, you get invited to the White House, you go,'\" Cubs vice president Jason McLeod said. \"I'm giddy to be able to get invited. \u2026 All the players are super excited. It will be a lot of fun and meaningful. I think we're going to Walter Reed (Hospital) after. That will be so moving.\" Epstein said some 2016 players no longer with the Cubs, including Dexter Fowler and Aroldis Chapman, have confirmed they'll be joining the team for one last hurrah. Obama, of course, is a well-known White Sox fan, and made news when he joined Twitter in 2013 and began following the accounts of the Sox, Bears, Hawks and Bulls. The exclusion of the Cubs was glaring. But Obama later began following the Cubs account, and when I sent an email to the White House about his allegiances before the 2015 playoffs, he responded: \"With the Sox out, I'll be rooting for the Cubs to win the Series. They're due. They've got great young players, and I'm a Maddon fan. That's an official statement.\" Chairman Tom Ricketts on Cubs' White House visit Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts on\u00a0the team's White House visit. (Mark Gonzales/Chicago Tribune) Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts on\u00a0the team's White House visit. (Mark Gonzales/Chicago Tribune) Obama has also feted the 1985 Bears at the White House, along with the Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks. Regardless of Obama's preference, Ricketts said this is a perfect way for him to go out. \"It'll be his last (team celebration),\" she said. \"He's from Chicago, even though I know he's a Sox fan. But his wife, Michelle, I know is a huge Cubs fan. I just felt like it'll be appropriate.\" Some Cubs players heard rumors the team could go back again in June when they play the Nationals and be feted by Trump. But one management source said that's unlikely, and one visit per year is enough. \"I don't know,\" Ricketts said of the possibility. \"It's up to the president-elect. I don't know if he's a big baseball fan, or a Cubs fan. Maybe they'll be invited back, but who knows if he'll even be in town when we're in town. \"You never know what's going to happen. But this is the official visit.\" ",

USA TODAY Sports Osweiler threw three interceptions in the loss to the Patriots on Saturday. (Photo: Winslow Townson, USA TODAY Sports) FOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2013 Early in the fourth quarter, the Houston Texans found themselves within striking distance of the heavily-favored New England Patriots, trailing by eight points. But those eight points might as well have been a Texas-sized chasm. On\u00a0first down from their own 11,\u00a0Brock Osweiler attempted a 20-yard pass over the middle to wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. In heavy traffic, Hopkins tipped the ball\u00a0and New England's Logan Ryan grabbed the interception, returning it\u00a0to the 6-yard-line. The play was a virtual dagger into the heart of the Texans\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and\u00a0their season. Two plays later, New England scored, a 1-yard run by Deon Lewis on their way to a 34-16 win the AFC divisional game. \u201cTurnovers, that\u2019s what did it,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn it over. We simply can\u2019t make those mistakes. It was more than one paly. There were a couple plays. It\u2019s tough. They played well.\u201d Osweiler was 23-of-40 for 198 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions. Before that fourth-quarter interception, the Texans trailed by 8 points. After the pick, the Patriots added 10 unanswered points. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d Osweiler said. \u201cYou need to capitalize on great opportunities against a football team like this and even though we hadn\u2019t done that throughout the game, at the end of the day, we were still just down eight points at the start of the fourth quarter. I made a clear read. I thought I was going to have a big explosive game completion and I think the ball just got away from me a little bit. It sailed a tick high and next thing you know, it\u2019s intercepted, so that\u2019s my fault. \"I\u2019ll clean that up. I can promise you I\u2019m going to throw about 1,000 of those routes in this offseason and get that fixed.\u201d MORE NFL PLAYOFFS: Falcons' offense just might be unstoppable, even in the postseason The game was a microcosm of Osweiler\u2019s first season in Houston \u2013\u00a0heavy on frustration, short on performance. \u201cAnytime you don\u2019t end your season with a Super Bowl\u00a0championship you\u2019re going to disappointed and I\u2019m certainly disappointed,\u201d said Osweiler, who is in the first year of a four-year, $72 million deal. \u201cThe one thing I will say is that I think it\u2019s easy to point out the negative especially on offense of what has taken place this year, but I think there was also a lot of great things that took place that we can certainly build upon in the future. But, no question about it, we have a lot to clean up moving forward into next season.\u201d Trailing by 11 after the first quarter, the Texans cut the deficit to four at halftime. But that was as close as they would get. Osweiler\u2019s lone touchdown came on a 10-yard pass to tight end C.J. Fiedorowicz in the second quarter. Head coach Bill O\u2019Brien deflected much of the blame from Osweiler. \u201cInterceptions, they are never one guy\u2019s fault,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cObviously, as an offense, we need to score more than 16 points. You know, you are not going to beat the Patriots scoring 16 points. So, I\u2019m not going to get into all the different plays and all that. I just know that I need to do a better job. \"Like I said, it starts with me. And, also like I said, give the Patriots credit. They did a great job.\u201d PHOTOS: Best of the NFL divisional round Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

After attacking CNN and BuzzFeed over Russian intel reports, President-elect Donald Trump gets into a heated exhange with a CNN reporter at his n... \u201cWe object strenuously to any move that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny of an on-site White House press corps,\u201d Jeff Mason, chair of the WHCA, wrote in an email on behalf of the group\u2019s members.\u00a0 \u201cThe briefing room is open now to all reporters who request access. We support that and always will,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThe WHCA will fight to keep the briefing room and West Wing access to senior administration officials open.\u201d\u00a0 Mason added that he would be meeting with incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer in order to \u201ctry to get more clarity on exactly what they are suggesting.\u201d\u00a0 The statement came shortly after a report in Esquire magazine that the Trump administration could be looking to evict the press corps from its spot in the White House Briefing Room, where journalists assigned to cover the president have been for decades.\u00a0 \u201cThere has been no decision,\u201d Sean Spicer told Esquire in a report published Saturday. He added that \u201cthere has been some discussion about how to do it.\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence weighed in on the potential press eviction Sunday on\u00a0 CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d offering up the explanation that the press may be better served in a briefing area that wasn\u2019t just \u201ca pretty small room.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI think the interest of the team is to make sure that we accommodate the broadest number of people who are interested in media from around the country and around the world,\u201d Pence said. He confirmed Spicer\u2019s claim, however, that \u201cno decision\u201d had yet been made.\u00a0 The reports come after recent flare-ups of Mr. Trump\u2019s own antagonistic relationship with the press. During his first news conference with journalists since his election victory, the president-elect repeatedly slammed members of established news outlets as \u201cfake news.\u201d\u00a0 And in his most recent tweet Sunday, Mr. Trump charged that the \u201cmedia should apologize\u201d for their recent coverage of an unverified dossier alleging compromising ties to Russia.\u00a0 Thank you to Bob Woodward who said, \"That is a garbage document...it never should have been presented...Trump's right to be upset (angry)... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017 about that...Those Intelligence chiefs made a mistake here, & when people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE.\" Media should also apologize \u2014 Donald J.

Brazil\u2019s frequently overcrowded prisons\u00a0 occasionally see bloody riots featuring dismemberment . \u00a0 State security officials said fighting between rival gangs broke out Saturday at the adjacent Alcacuz and Rogerio Coutinho lockups near the city of Natal in the Rio Grande do Norte state. Officials waited until dawn Sunday before entering to try to re-impose control, said state security chief Caio Cesar Bezerra. \u201cThis way we guaranteed a calm intervention, a pacific intervention without resistance from the inmates,\u201d Bezerra said. President Michel Temer expressed concern over the rebellion Sunday through his official Twitter page, saying he had been following the situation closely. Like many prisons across the country, Alcacuz is overcrowded, with more than 1,000 inmates crammed into a facility meant for 620. A man digs a grave for an inmate killed in a prison riot at the Parque Taruma cemetery in Manaus, Brazil, Jan. 4, 2017. Close AP The recent outbreak of prison violence began on Jan. 1-2, when 56 inmates were killed in the northern state of Amazonas. Authorities said the Family of the North gang targeted members of Brazil\u2019s most powerful criminal gang, First Command, in a clash over control of drug-trafficking routes in northern states. Many of the dead were beheaded and dismembered. Four others died at a smaller prison. Then on Jan. 6, in the neighboring state of Roraima, 33 prisoners were killed, many with their hearts and intestines ripped out . Experts say First Command is exploiting overcrowding and squalid conditions in the penitentiaries to expand its reach across the national prison system. Meanwhile, the prison chief for the southern state of Parana, Luiz Alberto Cartaxo, told Brazil\u2019s Globonews network that 21 inmates escaped from the Piraquara prison there on Sunday after using explosives to break through the prison wall. He said two other inmates died in a confrontation with police while trying to flee. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

But relief was already on the way. \"Over the next 24 hours, whatever precipitation type you can think of, it will likely happen across the Panhandles\" of Texas and Oklahoma, the National Weather Service said Sunday. Even the all-powerful National Football League had to change its plans, delaying Sunday afternoon's American Football Conference playoff game in Kansas City, Missouri, between the Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers by six hours. The temperature in Kansas City finally rose above freezing by midday, and kickoff was still expected about 8:30 p.m. ET. Light icing continues N of I-70, otherwise most of the area is done with the ice. More rain on the way tonight, but worry not, all liquid. pic.twitter.com/w0I4tuXEGU \u2014 NWS Kansas City (@NWSKansasCity) January 15, 2017 Almost 15,000 customers remained without power across north Texas and Oklahoma on Sunday afternoon, utility companies reported. Road crews were busily laying down salt and sand across the region with a quarter to a half an inch of ice expected on roads, trees and power lines by Sunday night. \"It's always nice to get that extra income from a snow event or ice event,\" Drake Allen of Allen Lawn Care and Landscaping in Vandalia, Iowa, told NBC station WHO of Des Moines. The frigid storm system was blamed for at least six deaths Friday and Saturday: three in Missouri, two in Kansas and one in Oklahoma. Two semi-trucks slammed into each other and exploded into flames Sunday on Interstate 80 near Kearney, Nebraska. No one was hurt. Ashland, Nebraska, Fire Department Two semi-trucks slammed into each other and exploded into flames Sunday morning on ice-slicked Interstate 80 near Kearney, Nebraska, the Ashland Fire Department said. Fortunately, no one was injured in the inferno, the Nebraska State Patrol said , but I-80 was closed for several hours. Almost 200 National Guard members were activated in Kansas, where Gov. Sam Brownback declared a state of emergency. \"I think the big concern that we've been looking at is you've got a good likelihood of some power lines going down,\" Brownback said Sunday . Two state troopers were struck by a vehicle Sunday morning on Interstate 635 in Kansas City, Kansas, Trooper Candice Breshears told NBC station KSNT of Topeka, Kansas. The state Transportation Department said no one was injured. Two #KHP Troopers have been struck this morning on I-635! #MOVEOVER & #SLOWDOWN \u2014 Trooper Candice (@TroopCandiceKHP) January 15, 2017 But it could have been worse, forecasters said. The storm system was beginning to dissipate sooner than had been expected Sunday afternoon as slowly rising temperatures moved the freezing line farther north, the National Weather service said. As a result, winter weather and ice warnings were being changed to watches and advisories across the region. Once the storm finishes moving through early Monday on its way east, \"we are going to experience a warmup,\" said Nick Walker, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel . Temperatures as much as 30 degrees above normal are expected in the eastern part of the country as far north as Boston \u2014 \"even places like Pittsburgh will see above-average temperatures by 20 to 25 degrees, with a 55-degree high on Tuesday,\" Walker said.

Rosenthal of the Federal District Court in Houston, ruled on Jan. 6 that the city\u2019s change to the election system violated the Voting Rights Act and intentionally discriminated against Latino voters. Judge Rosenthal put the city under federal oversight, requiring Pasadena officials to seek advance approval from the Justice Department before changing the City Council election map and procedures, a practice known as preclearance. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis is a message to those jurisdictions that the fact that they no longer have to preclear their changes doesn\u2019t mean that they can discriminate against minority voters,\u201d said Nina Perales, the vice president for litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , which represented eight Hispanic voters who sued the city. An appeal by Pasadena officials is likely, and a court could stay the ruling, blocking it from taking effect while an appeal moves forward. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring it, and there\u2019s a reasonable chance that we\u2019ll appeal,\u201d said C. Robert Heath, the city\u2019s lead lawyer in the case. \u201cWhile we have great respect for the court, we disagree with its conclusion that the city acted with an intent to dilute the vote of its Hispanic citizens.\u201d Two smaller places, Charles Mix County in South Dakota and Evergreen, Ala., agreed to submit to federal oversight and are the only other jurisdictions required to get Justice Department approval before changing their election rules. Officials in Charles Mix County agreed in 2007, and those in Evergreen did so in 2014. The outcome of the case in Pasadena is a major test of whether the Voting Rights Act in its diminished form remains a vital tool for minority voters, particularly as the Justice Department inevitably swings to the right in the Trump administration. In this city that was once home to the Texas headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan, the judge\u2019s ruling was hailed by Latino residents, election law experts and civil rights groups as a major victory and a reminder that the preclearance mechanism did not entirely vanish after the Supreme Court\u2019s weakening of the Voting Rights Act. But some advocates said that however welcome, the piecemeal, costly and after-the-fact litigation in the Pasadena case and similar ones that were pending are a far cry from the blanket protections for minority voters alleging discrimination under the Voting Rights Act. \u201cIt just completely changes the calculus,\u201d said Deuel Ross, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund . \u201cThese discriminatory changes can go into effect and stay in effect for years, while someone has to spend millions of dollars and hire an attorney in order to even potentially win it.\u201d Photo Hispanics account for 62 percent of Pasadena\u2019s population. Credit Michael Stravato for The New York Times In fact, Judge Rosenthal\u2019s ruling came more than three years after the change to Pasadena\u2019s election system was first proposed. One election in 2015 was held under the new system. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The changes at the center of the case redrew the Pasadena City Council map from eight neighborhood-based single-member districts to a mixed system with six single-member districts and two citywide at-large seats. The move to what became known as the 6-2 map eliminated one Hispanic-majority district and prevented Latino-backed candidates from winning a City Council majority. At-large election systems in a number of cities and school districts have been found to have diluted minority voting strength. In communities where whites make up the majority of voters and where people generally vote in racial blocs, white voters can defeat minority-preferred candidates and elect white-preferred candidates for at-large districts that encompass the entire electorate. Smaller single-member districts can help minority voters elect candidates of their choice, because they can be drawn so that minority voters make up a majority in some of the districts. Judge Rosenthal\u2019s 113-page ruling describes a racially charged atmosphere in Pasadena politics to support its finding of intentional discrimination. Councilman Ornaldo Ybarra testified that when he was campaigning in 2009, white residents told him that they \u201cweren\u2019t going to vote for a wetback.\u201d Richard Scott, the city\u2019s director of community relations and an ally of the mayor, directed a vendor to \u201cpull out Hispanic names\u201d from the mailing list of voters who would receive campaign materials in favor of the 6-2 map. \u201cAt trial, Mr. Scott testified that when he wrote \u2018pull out Hispanic names,\u2019 he meant to direct the vendor to pull out the names of Democratic voters,\u201d Judge Rosenthal wrote, one of several instances in which Pasadena officials \u201cunderstood race and party as interchangeable proxies. By clearly and explicitly intending to diminish Latinos\u2019 voting power for partisan ends, Pasadena officials intentionally discriminated on the basis of race.\u201d Pasadena is a majority-minority city of 150,000, where Hispanics account for 62 percent of the population but have long complained about a lack of city services and attention in their neighborhoods, which have aging roads and infrastructure. The city\u2019s white population and its Latino population remain largely physically divided , as the judge noted. North Pasadena is older, poorer and predominately Hispanic, while on the other side of the Spencer Highway, South Pasadena is newer, wealthier and predominately white. \u201cThey don\u2019t listen to us,\u201d said Patricia Gonzales, 49, a community activist who lives on the north side and who was one of the plaintiffs. \u201cIt\u2019s like what we say doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Three of the eight council members are Hispanic, but one of them, Councilman Cody Ray Wheeler, is a Latino with an Anglo surname, and the judge wrote that politicians in Pasadena thought Mr. Wheeler\u2019s election \u201cwas the result of his Anglo-sounding name and the Anglo votes that attracted.\u201d In 2013, the council was split 4 to 4, with the mayor holding the tiebreaking vote: Four were aligned with the mayor and four were aligned with the Hispanic community. Many were convinced that in the next election cycle, the Latino-backed candidates would win four seats again, plus a fifth, meaning they would have a majority on the council for the first time in Pasadena\u2019s history and weaken Mr. Isbell\u2019s influence. \u201cLatino success in Pasadena elections has been slow, slight and disproportionately lower than Pasadena\u2019s Latino population,\u201d Judge Rosenthal wrote. \u201cBut Latino success has increased in recent years. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of this case, which the court finds credible and amply supported by reliable record evidence, is that Pasadena changed to the 6-2 map and plan precisely because Latinos were becoming more successful at winning City Council seats.\u201d After the 2015 elections, the council remained divided 4 to 4 under the 6-to-2 map. Three seats were held by Hispanics and one of the new at-large seats was won by a white candidate who had the support of Hispanic voters, Councilwoman Pat Van Houte. The split was emphasized by the city\u2019s lawyers in defending the new system. Mr. Heath said city officials did not think the 6-to-2 map discriminated \u201csince Hispanics make up about 50 percent of the city\u2019s citizen voting-age population and the 6-to-2 system resulted in the election of Hispanic-preferred candidates to half the seats on the City Council.\u201d An aide to the mayor referred questions about the case to Mr. Heath, the city\u2019s lawyer. Mr. Isbell appeared to accidentally drop the gun that he brought to the March 2014 hearing. At a trial held in 2016 on the voting-rights allegations, he testified that it was a broken pellet gun, a claim the judge discounted, saying in her ruling that the \u201ccredible evidence\u201d was that it was a 9-millimeter Beretta. Judge Rosenthal, the city and the plaintiffs are still sorting out a lingering question: how long the city should be under federal oversight. The judge asked both sides to suggest a time period, writing that five years \u201cmight be appropriate.\u201d Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert and law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the relevant section of the Voting Rights Act gave the judge wide discretion. \u201cYou can guess that the plaintiffs will argue for a longer period and the city for shorter,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a very close look at the facts, I\u2019m not in a position to say what I think is the ideal number here. But I don\u2019t think choosing 10 years would be too long.\u201d ",

    "text": "Widow of Slain Oregon Standoff Leader Carries on His Mission By andrew selsky, associated press SALEM, Ore. \u0097 Jan 15, 2017, 3:30 PM ET 0 Shares Star Rick Bowmer/AP Photo Jeanette Finicum speaks with reporters during a rally at the Utah State Capitol, in Salt Lake City, March 5, 2016. Finicum, the widow of an Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, killed by FBI agents in a Jan. 26, 2016, traffic stop in central Oregon, is planning to hold a meeting in John Day, Oregon, Jan. 28, 2017, with their children, in an effort to continue with his mission. 0 Shares Email Leaders of an armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in rural Oregon were driving to a public meeting a year ago when police shot and killed one of them at a roadblock. Now, LaVoy Finicum's widow and their children are planning to hold that meeting later this month in the same town, John Day. Speakers are slated to talk about the Constitution, property rights and other issues. \"It is the anniversary of my husband's death. We want to continue with his mission,\" Jeanette Finicum told The Associated Press. \"The people within counties and states should decide how to use those properties, not the federal government.\" LaVoy Finicum was the spokesman for several dozen occupiers during the 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and has become a martyr for the movement to transfer ownership of federal lands to local entities. The U.S. government owns nearly half of all land in the West, compared with 4 percent in other states, according to the Congressional Overview of Federal Land Ownership. Finicum's cattle brand, an L connected to a V with a floating bar, adorns bumper stickers, black flags and T-shirts seen at conservative gatherings. Jeanette Finicum has become something of a cause celebre in the year since her husband's death. She spoke at a rally on the steps of Utah's capitol. The Tri-State Livestock News, based in South Dakota, recently ran a story describing her dispute with the Bureau of Land Management over grazing fees. The agency administers 245 million acres of public lands and manages livestock grazing on 155 million acres of those lands. \"It's been a horrific year,\" Jeanette Finicum said in a phone interview from her Cane Beds, Arizona, home. \"There's been so much going on that most people don't have to deal with when they lose a loved one, like we did.\" She met LaVoy at a barn dance. He told her he was a bad dancer. \"He was right. He had no rhythm,\" Jeanette Finicum said with a laugh. They got married 14 days later. \"There isn't anyone like him that I met in my lifetime, and I don't expect there will be anyone else who will measure up,\" she said, choking up with emotion. She was a stay-at-home mom all 23 years they were married. \"With him gone, all of the responsibilities have fallen to me,\" she said. \"I spent the year rounding up, branding and calving.\" Oregon State Police shot LaVoy Finicum three times on Jan. 26, 2016, after he exited a vehicle at a police roadblock in the snowy Malheur National Forest, held up his hands and then reached toward his jacket. Authorities concluded the officers were justified because they thought Finicum was going for his pistol. But at least one FBI Hostage Rescue Team operator fired two shots at Finicum's vehicle \u2014 shots that were not disclosed during the investigation. In March, the inspector general of the U.S. Justice Department began investigating possible FBI misconduct and whether there was a cover-up. The inspector general's office declined to discuss the investigation last week. The U.S. attorney's office in Portland said it was ongoing. Jeanette Finicum insists her husband was not a threat and that he was murdered. Her lawyer has said the family plans a wrongful-death lawsuit, and Finicum said she will release more details during the Jan. 28 meeting. It's being held at the fairgrounds in Grant County, which neighbors the county containing the refuge. Public lands make up 66 percent of Grant County's 4,529 square miles. Jeanette Finicum bristled when asked if those attending the meeting might be inspired to take over federal sites. \"That's a ridiculous question,\" she said. \"We will peacefully demonstrate, peacefully teach and stand for liberty.\" Fairgrounds manager Mindy Winegar said local logger Tad Haupt rented a pavilion for the meeting that seats up to 500 people. Haupt, a vocal opponent of U.S. Forest Service management practices, is the one who invited the occupation leaders to speak in John Day, a town of about 1,700, on Jan. 26, 2016. The FBI expressed no concern about the upcoming meeting. \"Everyone has a constitutional right to assemble, and to free speech,\" spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele said. Grant County Judge Scott Myers granted permission for the fairgrounds, a county facility, to be used for the event, saying rejecting the request could have had more repercussions than allowing it to happen. Myers said he doubts it will pose a threat but then added, \"I have steadfastly tried to convince myself that over the past few months.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky . 0 Shares ",

In a decision filed Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017, a Pennsylvania judge dismissed the murder case against Snuka in the 1983 death of his girlfriend Nancy Argentino, saying Snuka is not competent to stand trial on counts including third-degree murder. \u00a0(Michael Kubel/The Morning Call via AP, File) Former pro wrestler Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka died Sunday, 12 days after a Pennsylvania judge dismissed a murder case against him in the 1983 death of his girlfriend. He was 73. Our family @TaminaSnuka asked me to share the sad news that her dad Jimmy Snuka has just passed away. Alofa atu i le aiga atoa. #RIPSuperfly \u2014 Dwayne Johnson (@TheRock) January 15, 2017 Snuka's death was announced on Twitter by fellow wrestling legend Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. WWE broadcaster Jim Ross tweeted that Snuka had been battling stomach cancer. Our condolences to the family and friends of Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka who died earlier today after losing his fight with stomach cancer. RIP\uf64f \u2014 Jim Ross (@JRsBBQ) January 15, 2017 Snuka's daughter, Tamina \u2014 also a wrestler \u2014 posted a photo on Instagram Sunday of her hand grasping her father's with the caption \"I LOVE YOU DAD.\" Attorney Robert Kirwan II told the Associated Press that Snuka was taken Sunday to his son-in-law's home near Pompano Beach, Fla. so that he could spend his last moments there. The family informed him shortly after 1 p.m. Sunday that Snuka had died, Kirwan said. Lehigh County Judge Kelly Banach on Jan. 3 dismissed the murder case against the retired WWE star after the defense said he had dementia, was in hospice care in Florida and had six months to live. Snuka was charged in 2015 with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Nancy Argentino, whose body was found more than three decades earlier in their Whitehall Township, Pa. hotel room. Prosecutors allege she was beaten, while Snuka maintained she died from a fall. Authorities reopened the investigation after The Morning Call newspaper raised questions about the case in 2013. Banach had first ruled last summer that Snuka was not competent to stand trial after his attorney argued the ex-athlete suffers from dementia, partly due to the head trauma sustained over a long career in the ring. Prosecutors countered that Snuka's brain shows normal signs of aging and suggested he might be feigning symptoms. At a hearing last month to re-evaluate Snuka's mental fitness, Snuka's wife told the judge that the family struggles to keep him from leaving home during bouts of psychosis in which he thinks he's late for a wrestling match. Banach then took time to review Snuka's medical records before ruling. Kirwan said Snuka died \"due to complications from his ongoing medical problems\" but did not state what they were specifically. \"The family is simply heartbroken. It's been a long journey,\" he said. \"They are grateful to the judge for dismissing the charges against him.\" Kirwan added that he believes his client's name will eventually be cleared. Snuka, a native of Fiji who previously lived in Camden County, N.J., was known on the wrestling circuit for diving from the ropes. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996.

Time_Sports Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka has died at the age of 73 after a battle with stomach cancer. (Photo: Jeff Daly, AP) Legendary professional wrestler and WWE Hall of Famer Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, who thrilled fans for decades with his splash from the top rope as one of the original high flyers, died Sunday from stomach cancer. He was 73. \u00a0 His daughter, who wrestles\u00a0under the name Tamina Snuka, posted on Instagram with the hashtag #BestDad to announce Snuka\u2019s death. A photo posted by SaronaSnuka (@saronasnukawwe) on Jan 15, 2017 at 11:19am PST Snuka, who was from the Fiji Islands, had three stints with World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment and was inducted into the\u00a0Hall of Fame in 1996. Snuka most famously feuded with Magnificent Muraco. Snuka\u2019s leap off the top of the steel cage onto Muraco in October 1983 at Madison Square Garden\u00a0is among the most iconic images in pro wrestling history. Snuka also is noted for his 1984 feud with Rowdy Roddy Piper, which included Piper making fun of Snuka\u2019s South Pacific heritage by hitting him over the head with a coconut. Snuka would be in the corner of Hulk Hogan and Mister T for their tag team match against Piper and Paul Orndorff at the original 1985 Wrestlemania. His WrestleMania history also includes being the first opponent of The Undertaker, who would go on to win 21 consecutive matches at the company's biggest show of the year. His last WrestleMania match was in a legends match with Ricky Steamboat and Piper against Chris Jericho at Wrestlemania 25. Snuka also wrestled in ECW, AWA, TNA, WCW, and other independent organizations and was in the ring as recently as 2014.\u00a0 His death comes two weeks after murder charges were dropped because of his health in the death of his girlfriend in 1983. Charges were filed in September 2015 after prosecutors reopened the case following a plea from Nancy Argentino\u2019s family. Snuka was moved to hospice care in Florida months ago and given six months to live, his lawyer told the court in December in a hearing to re-evaluate whether Snuka was competent to stand trial. At the time, his wife told the judge that the family was struggling to keep him from leaving home during episodes of psychosis because he thinks he is late for a match.\u00a0 The judge ruled in June that Snuka was not competent to stand trial because of dementia and other health issues, but the charges remained in place until they were dismissed this month.\u00a0 Snuka was charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Argentino\u2019s body was found in a hotel room in Whitehall Township, Pa., and the coroner determined she had a skull fracture. Snuka had said she died in a fall, although his version\u00a0has changed over the years in various retellings. After the charges were initially filed, WWE suspended Snuka\u2019s legends contract and removed his page from the Hall of Fame portion of its website. The company, along with others in the pro wrestling community, reacted to his death on Twitter.

Alex Mathew Dean Taylor, 23, was found dead at his job at Fort Hood in Texas. \u00a0(U.S. Army) The Army and local police are investigating the deaths of 11 Fort Hood soldiers who have died on and off the large Texas base in the past three months under mysterious circumstances, according to reports. The most recent death involved Sgt. Alex Taylor, 23, of Texas City, Texas, who was found Wednesday unresponsive at his job at Fort Hood. The Army\u2019s Criminal Investigations Command is probing Taylor\u2019s death, Stars and Stripes reported Friday. \u201cAt this point in the investigative process we do not suspect foul play, but have not completely ruled it out while we conduct a complete and thorough death investigation,\u201d Criminal Investigations spokesman Christopher Grey told the paper. Fort Hood said Taylor\u2019s awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Aviation Badge and Air Assault Badge, among others. He was part of the 15th Military Intelligence Battalition and enlisted as an aviation operations.\u00a0 Taylor is at least the 11th Fort Hood soldier to have died in the U.S. since Oct. 12. Three other soldiers were found unresponsive in October, November and December. Their deaths are under investigation by the Army and police in two Texas towns. Three other soldiers died from gunshot wounds. One of them, Pvt. Kevin Paulino, 24, died from a gunshot while he was in Indiana, Stars and Stripes reported. The Army said the soldiers' deaths were under investigation. Another two died of illnesses and two others died in auto crashes. Investigators found the body of Pvt. Dakota Stump, 19, of Avon, Indiana, in the woods next to his flipped over vehicle Nov. 3, three weeks after he had been reported missing and declared AWOL, the paper reported. Investigators believe Stump crashed into the woods after his vehicle left the roadway and rolled over multiple times. Fort Hood said Army Criminal Investigation is investigating Stump\u2019s death. Three soldiers from Fort Hood died November 12 in a suicide bomb attack at Bagram air base in Afghanistan: Staff Sgt. John Perry, 30; Private First Class Tyler Iubelt, 20; and Sgt. 1st Class Allan Brown, 46. Brown died of injuries suffered in the attack at Walter Reade National Medical Center in Bethesda Dec. 6, the Houston Chronicle reported Friday. The Army said Sgt. Douglas Riney, who was assigned to Fort Hood, died in Afghanistan Oct. 20 in a firefight with the enemy. Advertisement ",

(Chris Whetzel / For The Times) Tom Petruno When Donald Trump takes the oath of office later this week, he will inherit the second-longest stock bull run in history, and a market valued at a record $26\u00a0trillion. From Wall Street\u2019s point of view, it doesn\u2019t often get much better than this. And that\u2019s a big challenge for the new president. The longevity of the current bull, and stocks\u2019\u00a0high prices relative to company sales\u00a0and earnings, have raised the stakes for what\u2019s next. The Dow Jones industrial average, at 19,885, is up 8.9% just since election day \u2014\u00a0a sign of investors\u2019\u00a0lofty expectations for the economy under Trump. If he disappoints, or his tax, trade and spending policies trigger unexpected or dangerous consequences, stocks could react violently. A new bear market \u2014\u00a0meaning a drop of 20% or more in the Dow and other indexes \u2014\u00a0could in turn quickly undermine the business confidence and spending crucial for Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u00a0agenda. It also would erode the retirement savings of the roughly half of U.S. households that own stocks\u00a0and stoke distressing memories of the 2008-2009 market crash. But even though another big market downturn is inevitable, it doesn\u2019t have to occur in 2017, or even in the next few years. Continued investor excitement over Trump could drive stocks to new highs this year in a rally that could feed on itself. There\u2019s another possibility\u00a0too: Rather than a bull or a bear, the market could temporarily morph into something much gentler \u2014\u00a0a patient, lamb-like market that isn\u2019t exciting but also does no great harm. Even in hot bull markets, stocks can go quiet\u00a0for extended periods. Here\u2019s a look at four potential scenarios for stocks in 2017:\u00a0 A market \u2018melt-up.\u2019\u00a0 Some market pros see the possibility of 2017 replaying 1987: a surge in share prices stoked by optimism about the economy. Coming out of the early-1980s recession, U.S. economic growth exploded higher in 1983 and 1984. The pace then decelerated in 1985 and 1986. By the start of 1987, however, a plunge in oil prices set the stage for a new growth wave. Even though stocks had been rallying strongly since August 1982, they rocketed in 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 44% from the start of the year to a then-record 2,722 in August 1987. A weakening dollar helped boost expectations for U.S. export growth. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, sees the jump in consumer and business confidence since Trump\u2019s election as a potentially powerful driver of share prices in the near-term \u2014\u00a0if that mood can be sustained. In December, a U.S. small-business confidence index leaped to its highest level since 2004. Although the economy has grown since 2009, the slow expansion has left many consumers and investors doubtful that better times can last, Paulsen said. \u201cFor eight years, we just haven\u2019t had confidence,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cWe've had fear.\u201d\u00a0A reversal could be huge for spending and investing. A 2017 market \u201cmelt-up\u201d is the official forecast of Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He sees a 10% jump in U.S. stocks in the first half, in what he terms the \u201cIcarus Trade\u201d \u2014\u00a0for the Greek mythical character who flew too close to the sun on wings of wax and feathers. As Hartnett alludes, the problem with market melt-ups is that they often are followed by meltdowns. That\u2019s what happened in 1987: The infamous Oct. 19, 1987, crash slashed 22.6% off the Dow in a sell-off driven partly by computerized trading gone awry. Despite that collapse, the Dow still posted a net gain of 2.3% for the year \u2014\u00a0and resumed climbing in 1988. The 1987 bear market was one of the shortest in history, lasting just 3.3 months. Another market crash like 2008-09. An obvious danger Wall Street faces is wild-eyed optimism about what Trump can do to quickly bolster the economy.\u00a0 \u201cThe market is looking forward to a combination of corporate tax cuts, a reduction in individual tax rates,\u00a0fiscal stimulus and deregulation,\u201d said\u00a0Russ Koesterich, co-manager of investment giant BlackRock Inc.'s $41-billion Global Allocation Fund. \u201cBut this is a lot, probably more than any administration can realistically achieve in one year.\u201d Still, the expectation of a longer timetable for reforms probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause a sudden dramatic exodus from stocks. The greater risk may be that Trump ignites a global economic crisis with trade policies aimed at punishing major exporters including Mexico and China. Last September, a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that Trump\u2019s anti-import trade proposals \u2014\u00a0including a 35% tariff on Mexican goods \u2014\u00a0would likely trigger immediate retaliation by exporting nations against American goods and services. The result could be \u201ca trade war that would plunge the U.S.\u00a0economy into recession and cost more than 4 million private-sector American jobs,\u201d\u00a0 the study said . Absent a sudden economic or geopolitical calamity, however, the market lacks many of the necessary ingredients for another crash, some analysts say. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist\u00a0at brokerage Charles Schwab , said that although\u00a0many investors live in fear of a 2008 replay, \u201cthe\u00a0conditions that existed then don't exist now.\u201d Financial crises and crashes often follow periods of extreme market excesses, such as intense\u00a0speculative behavior. In 2008, the U.S. housing bubble was the most obviously inflated market. But 2007-2008 also marked the peak in zooming prices for crude oil and other commodities, for stocks in emerging markets such as China and Brazil, and for European stocks and the euro currency, among other assets. Today, there\u2019s little argument that U.S. stocks are at risky levels relative to earnings. But commodities, emerging markets, many European shares and most currencies remain well below their all-time highs. What\u2019s more, the U.S. banking system is vastly healthier than it was in 2008. Weak banks were allowed to fail and the survivors were forced to substantially boost their capital cushions against loan losses. A new financial crisis is highly unlikely to be centered in U.S. banks. That doesn\u2019t do much to mollify bearish analysts who note, correctly, that overall global debt levels have mushroomed since 2008. Much of it was piled on by governments and central banks in their efforts to support their economies during and after the recession. But some types of consumer debt also have ballooned, notably car loans and education loans in the U.S. Albert Edwards, global strategist at French bank Societe Generale and a notorious market bear, believes that record high corporate debt will be the \u201cvortex\u201d of trouble leading to the next recession. Still, debt poses the greatest risk when economies are slowing \u2014\u00a0not when they're accelerating.\u00a0 The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week said its latest data point to a pickup in growth this year not just in the U.S. but also in most of the rest of the world. A \u2018typical\u2019\u00a0bear market. Forecasting a bear market drop of 20% or more in 2017 might seem the logical call to anyone who has bet on red or black in roulette. The blue-chip Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has recorded positive total returns (including dividends) every year since 2009. If you think of that as landing on black eight straight times in roulette, the odds of red in 2017 would seem high. Besides that, the current bull run now is 94 months old. Only the 1990s\u2019 advance was longer , at 113 months. But history has demonstrated that bull markets don\u2019t simply die of old age. Something has to kill them. And often the killer is the onset of a recession that slashes consumer and business spending.\u00a0 This time, though, few of the classic early-warning signs of recession are present. Just the opposite. \u201cFor the first time in nine years it can be said that the economy is hitting on all cylinders ,\u201d\u00a0said James Stack, a market historian who heads InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Mont. An index of so-called leading economic indicators tracked by the Conference Board research group continued to edge higher in 2016. By contrast, that index was plummeting well before the starts of the last two recessions, in 2001 and 2008-2009. Another argument against a bear market taking hold: U.S. corporate earnings began to rebound in the third quarter of 2016 after five straight weak quarters. Analyst estimates now forecast a 12% jump in S&P 500 profit in 2017, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at research firm CFRA in New York. Analysts often are overly optimistic, Stovall concedes. \u201cYet the new Trump administration is promising tax cuts and economic stimulus from an increase in infrastructure spending, which may justify leaving the 2017 estimate at 12%, or push it even higher,\u201d\u00a0he said. Given how high stock prices are compared with earnings, a profit surge may be essential for keeping the bull market alive. The average blue chip stock is priced at about 23 times per-share earnings over the last 12 months, according to market data firm Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. InvesTech\u2019s Stack calculates that price-to-earnings ratios have been in this nosebleed\u00a0range\u00a0less than 11% of the time since 1928.\u00a0He also notes that bear markets can occur in the absence of recessions. That was the case in 1987.\u00a0 With or without recessions, high stock valuations are \u201calmost inevitably resolved by a new bear market,\u201d\u00a0Stack said. He thinks the odds increasingly favor a market peak this year, and a bear market to follow. How bad? Every bear is unique, but they typically take back about half of the previous bull market\u2019s gains, Stack said. If that holds true this time, the market could drop about 40% before bottoming. That would be much less than the financial-crisis plunge of 57%, though\u00a0still quite painful. But for long-term investors, bear markets should be viewed as opportunities\u00a0\u2014 the chance to buy low. Neither bull nor bear\u00a0 A final possibility is that stocks\u00a0could simply stall out for a lengthy period, as many investors wait to see what happens with the economy under Trump. There could be intermittent rallies and sell-offs, but nothing dramatic for the market overall. A \u201clamb market\u201d\u00a0is one animal analogy. Wells Capital\u2019s Paulsen offers another: \u201cA \u2018bunny market.\u2019\u00a0Because it\u2019s hoppy but it doesn\u2019t go very far.\u201d Admittedly, the idea of a sustained benign market at current record share prices will sound to some like famed economist Irving Fisher\u2019s declaration, just before the 1929 market crash, that stocks had reached \u201ca permanently high plateau .\u201d Yet there have been\u00a0plenty of times when the market has temporarily run\u00a0out of gas. In the current bull, it happened in 2011 and again in 2015. The stars would\u00a0have to align perfectly this time, analysts concede. The U.S. and global economies must avoid massive shocks. Corporate earnings must continue to rise, even as worker wages pick up . And the Federal Reserve\u2019s program of raising interest rates must remain on a slow track. Some market pros say the most important underpinning for stocks worldwide today is the belief that the risk of a global deflationary depression has passed. The long-term bullish case is that governments, particularly the U.S., are embracing growth policies again.\u00a0 The jargony term is \u201creflation\u201d : growth with a mild pickup in inflation, but not a rabid inflation. \u201cInflation is toxic to stocks. Reflation is not,\u201d\u00a0said Schwab\u2019s Sonders. Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis, said his firm\u2019s research supports the idea that the bull market that began in 2009 is a \u201csecular\u201d\u00a0one \u2014\u00a0meaning the long-term trend points up, even though bear markets will periodically interrupt it. The last two secular bulls ran from 1982 to 2000 and from 1942 to 1966, both periods of healthy economic growth. If investors believe in the secular trend, Clissold said, then \u201cthe buy-the-dip mentality still makes sense.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

Earlier this month, a Lehigh County judge dismissed homicide charges against the retired professional wrestler. Snuka's daughter, Tamina Snuka, also a WWE wrestler, tweeted Sunday afternoon: \"I LOVE YOU DAD #FOREVERMYDAD #RestWell #FamiliesAreForever #BestDad #SnukaLegacy.\" She also posted a photo on Instagram of her holding his hand.

Homicide charges against Snuka in the\u00a01983 death of his girlfriend\u00a0Nancy Argentino, 23, in a Whitehall Township motel, have been dismissed after Snuka was ruled incompetent to stand trial.\u00a0 (The Morning Call staff) Freedom High School grad Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who was also a WWE wrestler, tweeted: \"Our family @TaminaSnuka asked me to share the sad news that her dad Jimmy Snuka has just passed away. Alofa atu i le aiga atoa. #RIPSuperfly.\" Argentino was just 23 when she died in 1983, allegedly after being rushed to a hospital from Snuka's Whitehall Township hotel room with a serious head injury. Argentino was Snuka's mistress, and traveled with him on the pro wrestling circuit, which included Allentown's Ag Hall. Snuka was charged in September 2015 with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. A county grand jury determined Snuka repeatedly assaulted Argentino at the former George Washington Motor Lodge in Whitehall Township and then left her in bed to die on May 10, 1983. The charges came to light after a 2013 Morning Call investigation on the 30th anniversary of Argentino's death, which uncovered a previously unseen autopsy report that concluded the case should have been investigated as a homicide. After a four-day hearing in June, Banach found Snuka incompetent to stand trial. During the hearing, a defense expert described Snuka as a \"shell of a man\" who did not recognize family members and believed the police officers who arrested him were fans seeking an autograph. When contacted by phone Sunday afternoon, Argentino's two sisters, Lorraine Salome and Louise Argentino, said they do not feel any closure from Snuka's death. Laurie Mason Schroeder Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka is in a Florida hospice and has six months to live, his lawyer said Friday.

While a Lehigh County judge mulls whether Snuka, 73, can ever regain competency to stand trial for homicide, his family struggles to keep him from leaving his home during bouts of psychosis in which... (Laurie Mason Schroeder) Salome said had Snuka been charged just after their sister's death they would have found justice. \"There were so many blockades,\" Salome said. Louise Argentino said the fact that Snuka had to go to court in the last years of his life gives her some measure of satisfaction. \"We made his life miserable his last few years,\" Louise Argentio said. \"His life was affected by going to court.\" The Morning Call reported in December that Snuka was in a Florida hospice, suffering from cancer, and had six months to live. In June, a judge declared Jimmy Snuka incompetent to stand trial in the 1983 death of his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino. Snuka, whose legal name is James Reiher, was born in the Fiji Islands and grew up in Hawaii. He began wrestling in the early 1970s and was a veteran of the ring by the time his straight-out-of-the-jungle character hit the WWF in 1982. For his signature move, the \"Superfly Splash,\" Snuka would climb to the top rope and pause to extend his arms in the air with his index finger, pinkie and thumb up pointed out. With his opponent lying back-to-the-mat in the center of the ring, Snuka would fly through the air and land chest to chest. ",

    "text": "Paul previews ObamaCare replacement plan focusing on lower cost policies Published               January 15, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on Sunday previewed his ObamaCare replacement plan -- in an apparent effort to take the lead in the growing GOP effort to simultaneously repeal and replace the 2010 health care law. Paul, who was a 2016 presidential candidate, said the bill that he and other congressional Republicans have crafted attempts to \u201cinsure the most amount of people, give access to the most amount of people, at the least amount of cost.\" Paul, a physician, has emerged in recent weeks as a leader in the repeal-replace effort, amid Republican concerns that fulfilling campaign vows to dismantle ObamaCare at the start of the 115th Congress could leave tens of millions of Americans uninsured. Incoming Republican President Donald Trump has expressed similar concerns, despite campaigning on a winning repeal-replace agenda. Paul tweeted on Jan. 6: \"I just spoke to (Trump) and he fully supports my plan to replace ObamaCare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now.\" The Republican-led Congress has already taken votes toward repealing ObamaCare under a process known as budget reconciliation, which effectively keeps Democrats from blocking the effort and requires only a simple majority for passage. Among the other Senate Republicans trying slow the repeal process, to synch with a replacement plan, are Susan Collins, Maine; Bob Corker, Tennessee; Rob Portman, Ohio; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Paul suggested Sunday that the replacement plan will include more low-cost insurance plans \"One of the key reforms that we will do is, we're going to legalize the sale of inexpensive insurance,\" he told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\" \u201cThat means getting rid of the ObamaCare mandates on what you can buy.\u201d Paul last week announced some of the early details of the plan on Fox News' \"Special Report\" with Bret Baier. Paul said his plan borrows from previous GOP replacement plans and appears to have consensus among congressional Republicans. \"The ideas that we've taken for the replacement bill come from other Republicans' bills,\" he told Fox.\u00a0 Paul said Sunday the plan also will include health saving accounts and tax credits to help customers save money. He also suggested the plan will allow people and small businesses to create their own markets. \"There's no reason why (a business owner) with four employees shouldn't be able to join with hundreds and hundreds of other businesses that are small to become a large entity to get leverage to bring your prices down,\" Paul said. However, he acknowledged rolling back Medicaid expansion as part of the ObamaCare repeal remains a \u201cbig question.\u201d Many Americans got coverage under Medicare expansion in states. On the issue of Rex Tillerson\u2019s effort to become the next secretary of state, Paul said he\u2019ll support the former ExxonMobil CEO\u2019s bid. \"Yes, I will vote for Rex Tillerson,\" said Paul, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holding the confirmation hearings. \u201cI was very impressed.\" Advertisement ",

    "text": "Jolted by Deaths, Obama Found His Voice on Race Tensions across the country prompted the president to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and YAMICHE ALCINDOR JAN. 14, 2017 WASHINGTON \u2014 Only weeks after 70 million Americans chose a black man for president, shattering a racial barrier that had stood for the entirety of the nation\u2019s 232-year history, no one in the White House, especially the man in the Oval Office, wanted to talk about race. President Obama had made a pragmatic calculation in January 2009, as the financial crisis drove communities across the United States toward economic collapse. Whatever he did for African-Americans, whose neighborhoods were suffering more than others, he would not describe as efforts to specifically help Black America. Mr. Obama made the decision knowing how powerfully his election had raised the hopes of African-Americans \u2014 and knowing that no matter what he did, it would not be seen as enough. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018They are going to hate us one day,\u2019\u201d said Melody Barnes, who is black and served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first domestic policy adviser, recalling her sadness when she stood in an auditorium in those early months as a crowd cheered for the success of the new president. \u201cI knew that we couldn\u2019t do everything that people wanted to meet those expectations.\u201d Continue reading the main story The fear inside the West Wing was that promoting a \u201cblack agenda\u201d and aiming programs directly at African-Americans at a time of widespread economic anxiety would provoke a white backlash \u2014 the kind that, years later, White House officials would view as helping to elect Donald J. Trump. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cAt a minimum, that would have been tone deaf,\u201d said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as the nation\u2019s first African-American attorney general during much of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, \u201cand at worst, would have created a reaction in the larger community that would have prevented the things you wanted to do.\u201d Mr. Obama, who had grown up straddling two worlds as the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas, wanted to be the president of all America. Framing his efforts in racial terms could exacerbate something that was already simmering, he thought. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to lift the economy over all,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters in the summer of 2009 when he was asked about doing more to help African-Americans recover economically. Video Obama\u2019s Evolving Approach to Race President Obama\u2019s comments on racial issues in America changed from an initial reticence to a final bluntness. Michael D. Shear looks back on how his tone shifted during his presidency. Publish Date January 14, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed But over the next seven and a half years, racial tensions across the country forced Mr. Obama to abandon his early reticence on race again and again. Ultimately he led a national conversation on race ignited by spasms of violence \u2014 police shootings and protests in Florida, South Carolina, Missouri and elsewhere. Inside the White House, aides recall them as among his most painful moments as president. \u201cAfter my election there was talk of a post-racial America,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his farewell speech on Tuesday in Chicago, reflecting on the threat that racial strife poses for the country\u2019s democratic ideals. \u201cSuch a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d After he leaves office, Mr. Obama will continue that conversation in work for My Brother\u2019s Keeper and other programs to help black youths. There is plenty to do. As much as his once-unthinkable presidency has inspired and empowered African-Americans, black unemployment is still about double that for whites. Nearly a quarter of blacks are living in poverty, almost the same as in 1976. \u201cHe made it seem like everything was all good, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Thelonious Stokes, 21, a black artist whose experiences of being racially profiled in Chicago left him jaded about the state of race relations. \u201cWe almost needed Trump to show the true state of America.\u201d The \u2018Beer Summit\u2019 Backlash Continue reading the main story Photo From left, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Sgt. James Crowley of the Cambridge, Mass., police and Mr. Obama gathered at the White House in 2009 for a meeting that became known as the beer summit. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Mr. Obama\u2019s earliest public reflection about race as president backfired. Asked about a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a friend of Mr. Obama\u2019s who was arrested in July 2009 trying to enter his own house by a white officer, Mr. Obama immediately took sides. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt is fair to say,\u201d the president said six days after the arrest at a prime-time news conference, \u201cthat the Cambridge police acted stupidly.\u201d Those words \u2014 and the frenzied reaction to them \u2014 helped deepen the caution about racial issues inside the White House. For days, the president\u2019s critique of the arresting officer dominated the news and the morning staff meetings in the West Wing. Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, was especially agitated, his colleagues recalled, and argued that the White House had to do something to change the subject. Mr. Gibbs succeeded in pushing for what the news media quickly labeled a \u201cbeer summit\u201d on the edge of the Rose Garden in the White House, where Mr. Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, joined Mr. Obama over beer for a discussion . \u201cIt had to be cauterized in a way that it would stop leading the news,\u201d Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s closest adviser, conceded. Professor Gates, for one, was pleased. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody but Barack Obama would have thought about bringing us together,\u201d he said at the time. As a candidate for president in 2008, Mr. Obama had drawn praise for confronting racial divisions during a powerful speech he delivered about his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who had characterized the United States as fundamentally racist and the government as corrupt. \u201cThe profound mistake of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It\u2019s that he spoke as if our society was static; as if no progress had been made,\u201d Mr. Obama said that March day in Philadelphia, urging people to move beyond old racial wounds. \u201cLet us be our brother\u2019s keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister\u2019s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.\u201d The Obama Era Articles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought to the nation, and how the presidency has changed him.

But the beer summit was deeply disturbing to many of the president\u2019s African-American advisers, who thought he should not have backed down. The officer had acted stupidly, they thought, and the nation\u2019s first black president ought to be able to say so. The meeting \u201cwas demeaning and diminished his leadership and his voice at that moment,\u201d one of them recalled, asking for anonymity to bluntly discuss the topic. \u201cPeople thought we were being punked. I got so many emails, so many phone calls from people I respected: \u2018He was right. Why are you backpedaling?\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inside the West Wing, the impact was clear. Mr. Obama would have to be more cautious when it came to racial issues, particularly ahead of the 2012 re-election campaign. The issue of race was too divisive at a time when Mr. Obama needed to emphasize inclusion. \u201cWhat it did teach us is that you just have to be careful about the words that you choose,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you shy away from issues that arise that deal with race, just as he didn\u2019t shy away from Reverend Wright. But you have to be sensitive to a long history of people reacting strongly to the topic.\u201d Outside the White House, people noticed, too: \u201cHe plainly arrested him because he was black,\u201d said Edward G. Robinson Sr., who is black and works at a box factory in Cleveland. Mr. Obama \u201cbacktracked because he wanted to be everybody\u2019s president.\u201d Like others, Mr. Robinson said the president was met with racially motivated disrespect in Washington, and pointed to the moment when a white Republican lawmaker yelled, \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the president during a congressional address. The White House would go on to publish reports about its efforts to help African-Americans, including details about the impact that the Affordable Care Act was having to help poor blacks. But Mr. Obama rarely talked about race publicly during the next few years. A Personal Connection Continue reading the main story Photo Protesters in New York\u2019s Union Square in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The president\u2019s voice was shaking with emotion. \u201cIf I had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin,\u201d Mr. Obama told Ms. Jarrett and David Plouffe, his senior adviser and former campaign manager, as the three talked in the Oval Office about what the president should say publicly about the death of the 17-year-old African-American at the hands of a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. \u201cI am going to say that.\u201d It was March 2012, nearly three years after the beer summit. The specter of that meeting still hovered and Mr. Obama was, in a sense, taking sides again. But in personalizing the shooting, his aides recalled, Mr. Obama\u2019s hope was that people might view African-African boys differently if they saw Trayvon through the president\u2019s own eyes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama headed out to the Rose Garden, announced his nomination of a new World Bank president, then took the question from a reporter that everyone knew was coming: \u201cCan you comment on the Trayvon Martin case, sir?\u201d Mr. Obama called it a tragedy , said he was glad the Justice Department was looking into it, reflected on how the nation was doing necessary soul searching and then concluded: \u201cBut my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. If I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u2019\u2019 Moments after Mr. Obama returned to the Oval Office, Gene Sperling, one of his top economic advisers, stopped by with tears in his eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what that will mean to my son,\u201d Mr. Sperling, who is white and is married to an African-American woman, told the president, according to a colleague who was there at the time. One of President Obama\u2019s lasting legacies may be the symbolic impact on the generation for whom \u201cpresident of the United States\u201d has always referred to a black man. This time, the president\u2019s comments were embraced by many outside the White House, too. Media reports focused on the emotion Mr. Obama had displayed \u2014 rare for a politician whose usual demeanor was cool and professorial. \u201cFor him to say things like that in front of the entire country and the world, I think sends a strong message to people,\u201d Ryan Shultz, 33, an art teacher in Chicago who is white, said in a recent interview. But others viewed the president\u2019s comments that day as a continuing affront to police officers and a saw in them a willingness to take sides in the racial debate. For at least one person, it went further. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine parishioners in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, later said he was inspired to kill because of media coverage of Trayvon\u2019s shooting. \u201cCrime is still bad and police are still shooting black people left and right,\u201d Mr. Shultz said. \u201cI live in Chicago \u2014 a murder capital of the United States \u2014 and it\u2019s crazy and it hasn\u2019t gotten that much better, I don\u2019t think.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Photo The police and demonstrators clashed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 after a white officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in Ferguson, Mo., shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014. Only minutes before, Mr. Obama had arrived on Martha\u2019s Vineyard for his summer vacation, which would soon be dominated by how to respond to the racial violence that Mr. Brown\u2019s death unleashed. The president and his aides, including Mr. Holder and Ms. Jarrett, who were also vacationing on the island, made urgent calls to Missouri\u2019s governor, state police officials and civil rights leaders. They debated whether Mr. Obama should go to Ferguson, and decided against it, knowing that a presidential visit would be disruptive. Mr. Holder would go instead .

Privacy Policy But the more urgent question for the three of them was how to weigh in. The president was wary of putting his thumb on the scale in a case destined to be investigated by the federal authorities. But it was just as clear that tensions between the police and African-Americans were increasing \u2014 not only in Ferguson, but also around the country. If Mr. Obama wasn\u2019t the right person to step into that issue, who was? \u201cYou want to try to calm the situation,\u201d Mr. Holder said, recalling the discussions he had with the president and Ms. Jarrett about what to say. \u201cYou want to reassure the community that an investigation will be done and done fully. But you want to make sure that the people in law enforcement know it is done fairly.\u201d \u201cThere was that trust gap,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was something that had to be dealt with.\u201d As the violence worsened, Mr. Holder, Mr. Obama and Ms. Jarrett concluded that the president needed to denounce the violence \u2014 and at the same time criticize the police for their conduct during the protests. \u201cThere is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,\u201d the president said in a televised statement on Aug. 14 from Edgartown, Mass. But he added, \u201cThere\u2019s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.\u201d Photo A demonstrator asking Mr. Obama to visit Missouri during the unrest there. The president instead sent his attorney general to represent the administration. Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times For the rest of his presidency, Mr. Obama would strive for the balance he struck in his remarks that day: empathy and understanding for African-Americans and support for the police and the rule of law. But however he weighed in, the events in Ferguson made clear that he could no longer hang back and instead had to lead a national debate about race, violence and unity. \u201cOnce it was so in America\u2019s face, police brutality, it blew the circuit,\u201d said Bill Burton, an African-American who served as deputy White House press secretary during the first term. \u201cIt made it possible to have that conversation that our country had actively not been having.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Inevitably, Mr. Obama\u2019s striving for balance often left him vilified by both sides. Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, rebuked Mr. Obama for not being \u201chelpful\u201d in discussing police tactics from his vacation. Years later, Mr. Pasco told NPR that the president often struck the wrong tone when he talked about race and policing. \u201cThe president has never been a police officer. He\u2019s never walked in a police officer\u2019s shoes,\u201d Mr. Pasco said last July. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a breakdown in communication more than there is a breakdown in insincerity or intent.\u201d Ja\u2019Mal Green, a 21-year-old Black Lives Matter activist based in Chicago, said he thought Mr. Obama \u201cignored\u201d the calls of organizers for federal policy and funding aimed at stopping police brutality. Mr. Green said he also grew tired of hearing Mr. Obama couple his grief for families in racially charged shooting episodes with statements supporting white police officers. \u201cHe is trying to walk a neutral line and he wants to please both sides,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cHe wants to please black people and then he wants to please police supporters and police officers and police unions. But sometimes you have to pick a side in situations. You need to pick your time when you fight for home or you\u2019ll just have everybody hating you.\u2019\u201d Mr. Stokes, the 21-year-old artist from Chicago, felt similarly disappointed. \u201cChicago is the exact same,\u201d Mr. Stokes said. \u201cHe simply opened up, maybe, a lane for young men like me to just maybe be accepted a little bit more to people that don\u2019t accept educated black people. But that\u2019s it, literally. White America is still running everything, and that means that nothing is changing.\u201d A Time for Grace Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Obama embraced Eliana Pinckney at a memorial service for her father, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Less than a year after Mr. Brown\u2019s death in Ferguson, on June 17, 2015, nine African-American parishioners, including a pastor, were gunned down by a 21-year-old white supremacist during a church meeting in Charleston. Two days later, the victims\u2019 families addressed Mr. Roof , the gunman, at a court hearing, where one by one they forgave him. \u201cYou took something very precious away from me,\u201d Nadine Collier, the daughter of 70-year-old Ethel Lance, told Mr. Roof, as her voice rose in anguish. \u201cI will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\u201d It was an extraordinary scene, broadcast live on television, which moved many who saw it to tears. Mr. Obama was traveling and did not see it in real time, but when Eric Schultz, the deputy press secretary, read Ms. Collier\u2019s words out loud to Mr. Obama on Marine One , the presidential helicopter, the president was awed by what he heard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s what we need to recognize here, the ability of people to forgive on the worst day of their lives.\u2019 It really struck him,\u201d Ms Jarrett recalled. \u201cWe sat there and talked about it on the helicopter. About that quality, the amazing grace.\u201d Later, in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama struggled with his chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, to come up with the right words for a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor of the Charleston church and a friend of the president\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say,\u201d Mr. Keenan told Mr. Obama, according to Ms. Jarrett. \u201cYou\u2019ve said everything that one could possibly say on the subject.\u201d Eventually, the president decided that instead of talking about guns he would talk about what black churches stood for and the meaning of grace. \u201cIt would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again,\u201d the president told a hushed audience at the memorial service. \u201cOnce the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual \u2014 that\u2019s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society. To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change \u2014 that\u2019s how we lose our way again.\u201d The week before, during a podcast interview with Marc Maron , the comedian, Mr. Obama had caused a minor stir by using the word \u201cnigger\u201d in answering a question about race relations. He knew it would cause a ripple, an aide with him recalled, but he shrugged. At the beginning of his term, the podcast could have caused a fury and Mr. Obama might have pulled back again. But events in the country \u2014 especially the deaths of young black men \u2014 had given him more opportunities to engage the topic. Mr. Pinckney\u2019s funeral was one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to just whistle in the wind,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a chance to talk to people when they are ready to hear him. He doesn\u2019t ignore moments.\u201d Advertisement ",

Foreign ministers and representatives from about 70 countries are seeking to revive the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry attends the peace conference in Paris on Sunday. Foreign ministers and representatives from about 70 countries are seeking to revive the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 3:32 p.m. ET Foreign ministers and other diplomats from some 70 different countries descended on Paris on Sunday, with the intent to renew peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The summit, which was held without leaders from either side of the conflict, pushed for the establishment of a Palestinian state. \"We are here to reiterate strongly that the two-state solution is the only one possible,\" said French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, in his opening remarks to top envoys at the conference. A joint statement issued after the one-day conference also warned against any parties taking unilateral action on the conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused to attend, decrying the conference as biased against Israel from the outset. \"It's a rigged conference, rigged by the Palestinians with French auspices to adopt additional anti-Israel stances,\" he said Thursday, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also did not attend, though he praised France for organizing the summit. Despite the absence of the two parties, French President Francois Hollande asserted the importance of holding the meeting anyway. As NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, Hollande said the two-state solution is in danger \u2014 and that without a solution, the conflict between Israel and Palestinians threatens to have detrimental effects on the rest of the region. Article continues after sponsorship Eleanor adds: \"Hollande said with the international community mobilized against ISIS, some may think peace in the middle east can wait. But we will never stabilize the region if this oldest conflict is not solved. \"Hollande said the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict serves as a pretext for criminals and terrorists across the Arab world. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry participated in Sunday's talks in order to \"try to ensure America's continued interest in a two-state solution is preserved,\" Eleanor says. The State Department has said he is attending to make sure that \"whatever happens in this conference is constructive and balanced,\" the BBC reports. It also may be meant as a message to Kerry's successors, the diplomatic team of President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to be inaugurated Friday. Trump has given indications that he is supportive of settlements Israelis have established in land the country captured in 1967, which have been central point of contention in peace negotiations. ",

John Lewis ' criticism of Trump was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and called on President Obama to \u201cstep up\u201d by telling Democrats to accept the election loss and stop questioning \"the legitimacy of the next United States president.\" In an interview on \u201cThis Week,\u201d ABC News' George Stephanopoulos asked Priebus if the president-elect was right to pick a fight this weekend over remarks by Congressman and civil rights icon Lewis. \u201cJohn Lewis stood up in an interview and said that Donald Trump was not a 'legitimate president,'\" Priebus said, referring to an NBC interview on Friday. \"That\u2019s insanity, and it\u2019s wrong.\u201d \"We need folks like John Lewis and others who I think have been champions of voter rights to actually recognize the fact that Donald Trump was duly elected. He's going to put his hand on the Bible in five days,\" Priebus said. \"I think it\u2019s incredibly disappointing \u2013- and I think it\u2019s irresponsible -- for people like [Lewis] to question the legitimacy of the next United States president,\u201d he added. \u201cI think putting the United States down across the world is not something a responsible person does.\" The incoming White House chief of staff added that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said \u201cmany, many times\u201d there\u2019s no evidence that Russia's interference in the presidential election affected the outcome. Clapper has said that the intelligence community can't gauge how voters' choices in the election might have been affected by the disclosure of private information stolen by hackers. \"President Obama should step up,\u201d Priebus said. \"We've had a great relationship with the White House, George ... I think the administration can do a lot of good by telling folks that are on the Republican side of the aisle, 'Look, we may have lost the election on the Democratic side, but it's time to come together.'\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "AP January 15, 2017, 1:12 PM Beijing again dismisses Trump\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d policy change suggestion Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang takes a question from the media during a press conference in Beijing on July 13, 2016. NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP/Getty Images BEIJING - China\u2019s foreign ministry on Sunday again rejected President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that he might use American policy on Taiwan as a bargaining chip between the two sides. Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that the \u201cone China\u201d policy is \u201cnon-negotiable.\u201d Since recognizing Beijing in 1979, Washington has maintained only unofficial ties with Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing considers its territory - a status quo that Trump has repeatedly threatened to upend since winning the November election. \u201cThe government of the People\u2019s Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing China,\u201d Lu said in a statement. \u201cThat is the fact acknowledged by the international community and no one can change.\u201d In this \"Face the Nation\" Web Extra former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger cautions the president- elect to soften his rhetoric against China Trump told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Friday that \u201ceverything is under negotiation, including \u2018one China.\u2019\u201d The interview is the latest indication that Trump could shake up the U.S.-China relationship, particularly on Taiwan, which China considers a core national interest. China was already angered by Trump\u2019s Dec. 2 phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen , the first time an American president or president-elect has publicly spoken to Taiwan\u2019s leader in nearly four decades. Beijing considers any reference to a separate Taiwanese head of state to be a grave insult. Trump then said in a television interview that he didn\u2019t feel \u201cbound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\u201d On Sunday, Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff, said that \u201cthere are no plans to change the one-China policy.\u201d \u201cBut certainly that policy is on the table if China doesn\u2019t also come to the table and work with us on trade, work with us on the South China Sea and what\u2019s happening there,\u201d Priebus said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d After attacking China repeatedly during his campaign, Trump has continued to disparage China on his Twitter account over its military build-up in disputed areas of the South China Sea, allegedly manipulating its currency to put American companies at a disadvantage, and not doing enough to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. He has also announced that a new White House trade council will be led by economist Peter Navarro, a sharp critic of Chinese economic policy who wrote a book titled \u201cDeath By China.\u201d Trump told the Journal that he would not label China a currency manipulator as soon as he takes office, though he repeated his contention that China is manipulating the yuan. So far, Beijing has reiterated its refusal to negotiate on Taiwan and to push for positive cooperation between the two sides, though state-run media have run several strongly worded editorials attacking Trump. Chinese political observers said Sunday that they expect Beijing\u2019s response to change once Trump is inaugurated next week. \u201cTrump has not taken office yet, so he is an ordinary person now,\u201d said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University. \u201cTherefore, there\u2019s no need for China to take his remarks seriously or further respond to what he said.\u201d Tang Yonghong, a professor at Xiamen University, said that China needs to convince Trump that \u201cif he wants to make money from the Chinese mainland, he must be a friend of China instead of being an enemy.\u201d \u201cI think Trump is handling international relations, including Sino-U.S. relations, with a businessman\u2019s logic,\u201d Tang said. \u201cHe wants to see how China will respond to such provocation.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "By Paul Schwartzman January 15 at 6:43 PM Follow @paulschwartzman (The Washington Post) In the coming days, Sally Berk will be able to say that she lives in the same Northwest Washington neighborhood as Barack and Michelle, Jared and Ivanka, and a billionaire named Jeff. Ho-hum. What\u2019s another president in the \u2019hood when five others have already resided in Kalorama, Washington\u2019s very own version of Beverly Hills? Can you blame the soon-to-be first daughter for wanting to live a 13-minute, chauffeur-driven glide path to her father at the White House? And where else can a tech magnate find a 27,000-square-foot crash pad just 1.8\u00a0miles from his new media company? \u201cWe\u2019re just so used to it,\u201d said Berk, who 36 years after moving to Kalorama is accustomed to the motorcades, Secret Service retinues and hovering helicopters that come with sharing sidewalks with Washington royalty. Yet, despite the neighborhood\u2019s history as a turret-happy crib for the country\u2019s elite, it is not every day that three of the world\u2019s most powerful names decide, at virtually the same moment, that Kalorama is the place for them. The former Textile Museum property was recently purchased by Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and owner of The Washington Post, became the latest A-lister known to plant a flag in the neighborhood, paying $23\u00a0million in cash for a 10-bedroom mansion on S Street NW. This home on Tracy Place NW was purchased by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) A bit more than four blocks away, on Tracy Place NW, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and their three children are moving into a six-bedroom, five-fireplace manse that was listed last year for a relatively reasonable $5.5\u00a0million. Around the corner, behind a newly constructed Secret Service guard booth on Belmont Street, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are set to relocate to their post-White House rental \u2014 a nine-bedroom, 8.5-bathroom house owned by Joe Lockhart, who served as press secretary to President Bill Clinton. The Obama family will live in this house on Belmont Street in the Kalorama neighborhood. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \u201cFamous people have always lived here,\u201d said Penn Lupovich, 81, a retired doctor, as he stood outside his house on Tracy Place, defiantly nonchalant about living across the street from Ivanka Trump\u2019s new address. No, Lupovich said, Kalorama\u2019s residents are not holding meetings to prepare for the arrival of their new neighbors. No one, he insisted, is sweating the prospect of security checkpoints and hordes of gawkers. \u201cIt\u2019s Washington \u2014 if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t live here,\u201d Lupovich said of his neighborhood of 42 years. \u201cI came here to change the world, and that\u2019s the way it has always been. That\u2019s what we do here. Change the world!\u201d A majestic mix of mansions, townhouses, apartment buildings and embassies northwest of Dupont Circle, Kalorama is like any other neighborhood, residents insist \u2014 albeit one that requires a minimum of several million dollars to buy into. Or if you have $20,000 a month available for rent, that\u2019ll work, too. The neighborhood includes next to no places to buy a cup of coffee, not to mention eggs or a quart of milk, though the bare essentials can be acquired at the 7-Eleven on Wyoming Avenue NW, a bit less than a mile from the Obamas\u2019 place. Sure, the neighborhood\u2019s residents may be a bit more prominent \u2014 a former congressman over here, Bloomberg Media\u2019s chief executive over there \u2014 but they want trash picked up and streets swept just like anyone else. \u201cWe have potluck dinners \u2014 someone says, \u2018You bring the dessert, I got the dead cow on the grill,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mario Castillo, a lobbyist who has lived on Belmont for 20 years. \u201cTo me, they\u2019re all just neighbors, and then they happen to be the Jeff Bezoses, the Ivankas and the Obamas. \u201cAre they going to be friendly?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre they going to be approachable? Can you have a conversation with them? Not as Jeff or Ivanka or Obama. But just as folks. That\u2019s what appeals to me. Not the titles.\u201d \u201cTed and Vicki were neighbors of mine\u201d Jim Bell, a Sotheby\u2019s International real estate agent who describes himself as \u201cthe king of Kalorama,\u201d predicts that the neighborhood will regain its quiet rhythms after an inevitable spasm of excitement greets the arrival of the famous new residents. \u201cTed and Vicki were neighbors of mine,\u201d Bell said, referring (of course) to the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his wife. \u201cDonald Rumsfeld lived here. It\u2019s a whole bunch of mostly quiet rock stars, and then once in awhile you\u2019ve got someone who gets more press. And then it dies down. Everyone says, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 At the end of the day, they\u2019re just people. They have dogs and kids and they go to sleep at night.\u201d A sloping landscape of rolling knolls, the neighborhood in the late 1700s was defined by a single estate, known as Belair, which was built by a local commissioner before it was taken over by a diplomat who renamed it Kalorama, the Greek word for \u201cfine view,\u201daccording to the D.C. Office of Historic Preservation. Thomas Jefferson was a regular visitor. The intersection of Tracy Place and Belmont Street in the Kalorama neighborhood of Northwest. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) After the Civil War, as Washington\u2019s population grew, developers began dividing Kalorama\u2019s land and constructing massive homes that evoked a variety of architectural styles, from Victorian-style villas to Beaux-Arts apartment houses and Colonial and Federal mansions. Before Obama, Woodrow Wilson was the only president to move to Kalorama immediately after leaving the White House. At varying points, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover also resided in the neighborhood. Wilson\u2019s house, now a museum, is on S Street, next door to the mansion purchased by Bezos, a sale that was cheered by residents who feared that the property \u2014 the former Textile Museum \u2014 would be turned into condos. \u201cBravo!\u201d someone shouted at a neighborhood meeting last week after Bezos\u2019s architect announced that the property was bought by a family who intended to restore it as a home, according to the Current newspaper. But the architect, Anthony \u201cAnkie\u201d Barnes, declined to identify the buyer, said David Bender, chair of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, who is not unaccustomed to such secrecy. No one from the president\u2019s orbit, for example, notified the ANC that several guard booths would be built outside the house on Belmont \u2014 the kind of exterior construction that the commission typically approves. \u201cWe heard nothing,\u201d Bender said. Nor has he received many complaints, though parking is a concern, as is a recent uptick in the presence of reporters and photographers in the neighborhood (\u201cAbsolutely not! We don\u2019t talk about our neighbors!\u201d a woman walking her dog near the Kushner-Trump house said when asked about their impending arrival). Councilman Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), whose district includes Kalorama, said the Secret Service is planning to install gates on both ends of the portion of Belmont that encompasses the Obama residence. \u201cIt will certainly be safe over there,\u201d he said. Castillo said a representative from the White House and Secret Service recently visited him to explain where the roadblocks would be set up and how residents would receive visitors. \u201cI have gardeners, and what about the paperboy? How do we make arrangements to get him in and out?\u201d he said. \u201cThey were very professional. It\u2019s not going to be as draconian as you might think.\u201d A couple takes a walk down S Street in the Kalorama neighborhood.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) When he arrived in Kalorama in 1996, Castillo recalled, his neighbor sent over a housekeeper with a note on a silver tray that read, \u201cWelcome to the neighborhood.\u201d Castillo plans no such greeting for the Obamas, preferring to allow them a respite after \u201ceight years of a hectic life. I have the sense that they are a little exhausted.\u201d Lupovich said Kalorama is more transient than it was when he first moved in, and that he doesn\u2019t know too many of his neighbors anymore. He\u2019s not expecting to interact with Kushner or Ivanka Trump, though he has already benefited by their presence, wandering across the street to hire their house painter to put a new coat on his living room (Ivanka ordered the rooms in her house to be painted \u201csimply white,\u201d the painter said). As for Obama, the retired doctor said he plans to extend an invitation to both the outgoing president and the new president to join him in his living room for what he hopes would be consequential policy discussion. \u201cI want the president and Don Trump to come over and talk health care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we did it in the old Washington.\u201d local ",

He was 63. Long died Sunday after battling cancer, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia, said in a statement to multiple media outlets. His death came \"after a gallant private fight with an aggressive form of cancer,\" the statement said. Senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist since 1987, Long oversaw the church's explosive growth with membership swelling from a modest 300 to 25,000. The Long has been senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist since 1987. The church said it grew from 300 members to more than 25,000 under Long's leadership and became one of the nation's largest congregations. The church operated television and international ministries, and built satellite churches in several cities, including Miami, Denver, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Long was a Christian author, a gospel singer and was also known for preaching and practicing a \"prosperity gospel\" in which the faithful would be rewarded with wealth. Long was also known for his flamboyant lifestyle, as he flew around the world on a private jet, drove around metro Atlanta in a $350,000 Bentley and lived in a $1.4 million house with six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. In 2006, the church hosted then-President George W. Bush and former presidents Bill Clinton , Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush during the funeral of Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \"As I reflect on his life, I am especially remembering Bishop Long's support during some of the most difficult times in my life. the passing of my mother in 2006, and the sudden and unexpected loss of my sister in 2007,\" King's daughter, Bernice King , said in a statement Sunday. \"During these devastating moments in my life, he was there for me and my family in many ways and I will forever be grateful.\" Scandal erupted in 2010, when four young men filed lawsuits accusing him of sexual misconduct, bringing notoriety to his church that reached far beyond its 10,000-seat cathedral at its home base in Lithonia, Georgia, just east of Atlanta. Long's lavish lifestyle was a focal point in the lawsuits, which accused him of seducing the young men into sexual relationships in exchange for trips, clothes and cars. Two of the men had accused Long of grooming them for sexual relationships through the church's LongFellows Youth Academy. The other two men, one of whom attended a satellite church in Charlotte, made similar allegations in the legal cases. Eight months later, Long settled the cases out of court for an undisclosed amount and has never admitted any wrongdoing. After that, some congregation members changed their opinion of him, but many others continued to rally around the charismatic leader. He's survived by his wife, Vanessa Long, four children and three grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced. 0 Shares ",
