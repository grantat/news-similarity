Commuters could expect a messy drive to work Monday in several areas, with rainfall expected to ease slightly but not taper off until Tuesday. Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect for swaths of greater Los Angeles and across Southern California, where multiple roads were closed Sunday or blocked by fallen trees. The National Weather Service cautioned that the system could end up being the strongest storm in at least seven years. California has been swamped during a wet winter that has brought plenty of rain and snow after years of drought. By early evening, the rainfall had set records. Long Beach Airport received 3.87 inches of rain by 5 p.m., breaking the all-time daily mark for rainfall. Los Angeles Airport got 2.78 inches of rain Sunday, another all-time daily record. Los Angeles firefighters said they\u2019d rescued a dozen people and two pets as of Sunday night and responded to more than 170 weather-related incidents in all. Firefighters in San Bernardino County staged a dramatic swift-water rescue of a couple whose pickup truck was trapped in surging water west of the Cajon Pass. Television footage showed rescue crews sending a raft, which was anchored to a fire truck, into rushing brown water so the trapped couple could climb aboard, one by one, from the car\u2019s passenger window. Authorities said the Long Beach\u2019s Swift Water Rescue team helped save two teenagers Sunday \u00a0after they decided to go rafting in the L.A. River in the middle of the powerful rainstorm, CBS Los Angeles reports . Long Beach Fire Department spokesman Jake Heflin told the station, \u201cWe dispatched resources \u2026 to search for two individuals after their rafts were spotted empty in the river.\u201d About 15 minutes later, firefighters pulled one of the teens from the fast-moving current. Then, firefighters found the second teen, who managed to pull himself out of the water. In Murrieta, firefighters rescued a family of four from a pickup truck that got caught in fast-moving water Sunday evening, CBS Los Angeles says . A father, mother and their two children \u2013 ages 6 and 2 \u2014 were brought to dry land within about 20 minutes. Firefighters threw the family members life jackets and then rescued them one-by-one. There were no injuries. Here is flooding on 710/Willow in Long Beach. @CHPsouthern pic.twitter.com/12XT7WEymr \u2014 Caltrans District 7 (@CaltransDist7) January 23, 2017 The couple told KCAL9 their truck got swept into a ravine on their way home from a birthday party. Fast-moving floodwaters swept through California mountain communities and residents fled homes below hillsides scarred by wildfires. Forecasts said mountain locations could see up to 6 inches of rain. Rain fell at a rate of nearly three-quarters of an inch per hour. Residents in rural Santa Cruz County watched helplessly Sunday as the San Lorenzo River spilled over its banks for the second time this month, sending muddy water and debris into yards and homes. No injuries were reported. \u201cThis is the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen this river move. It\u2019s already flowing under my house. I have maybe 2 feet of clearance before it\u2019s in my living room,\u201d Paradise Park resident Tammy Grove told the Sentinel newspaper. #LARain #CAStorm SR27/Topanga Cyn Blvd @ Old Topanga closed due to slide. Be vigilant when out and about. Or stay in! @CHPsouthern pic.twitter.com/8YRHX2kOzG \u2014 Caltrans District 7 (@CaltransDist7) January 23, 2017 Battalion Chief Aldo Gonzales with the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the river is the highest he has ever seen it. Traffic was diverted off Interstate 110 south of downtown Los Angeles because of water flowing across lanes. The 710 Freeway was also closed because of flooding. Authorities ordered evacuations near wildfire burn areas in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange counties. Potential debris flows could restrict access for emergency responders, officials said. Some residents refused to leave, but Ralph Olivas loaded up his family and their dog and left his home in Duarte, nestled in scenic foothills east of Los Angeles that were left bare by wildfires last June. Recent rain sent rocks down steep streets where homeowners built protective barriers out of lumber and sandbags. \u201cWe\u2019re packing and leaving because the muds are coming, the mudslides,\u201d he told CBS Los Angeles, adding that the risk \u201ccomes with the territory living up here.\u201d Farther north, officials warned of a \u201chigh avalanche danger\u201d at all elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains because of heavy snowfall that has closed several ski resorts. The Sierra Avalanche Center advised Sunday against travel in the area, warning of intense snowfall rates and gale force winds. The San Francisco Bay Area was under a high surf advisory along the coast until early Tuesday with waves of up to 19 feet expected, National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said. \u201cSurf will be coming up and down, but coming so fast there\u2019s no break,\u201d he said. The San Francisco Coast Guard warned of hazardous conditions at beaches after two people went missing in the water near Pebble Beach on Saturday. Along the coast, big surf rolled ashore, with record 34-foot swells recorded Saturday in Monterey Bay. . A historic WWI-era ship called the S.S. Palo Alto and docked near Santa Cruz was torn apart by massive waves Saturday. The Bay Area was also under a flash flood watch that continues through Monday and a wind advisory was in effect until late Sunday. Wine country communities that already experienced destructive flooding this month faced new flood warnings after strong thunderstorms Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing mudslides Bay Area wide,\u201d said Anderson, adding that heavy rain over the past few weeks has saturated the ground. Wind gusts topping 50 mph brought down trees across Northern California. In Mendocino County, a massive oak toppled onto an apartment in the city of Ukiah early Saturday, crushing the building and killing a woman as she lay in her bed, fire officials told the Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa. The woman\u2019s boyfriend and a 3-year-old boy escaped. Capt. Pete Bushby of the Ukiah Valley Fire Authority said heavy rain apparently had destabilized the 125-foot tree. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Trump Properties Face Global Terror Risk With Presidency By jon gambrell, associated press DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u0097 Jan 23, 2017, 6:26 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Initial Conflicts for President Trump 0 Shares Email Businesses around the world bearing U.S. President Donald Trump's name face an increased risk now that he is in the White House , security experts warn, especially as several are in areas previously targeted by violence. As Trump remains a brand overseas, criminal gangs or militants could target buildings bearing his name in gold, abduct workers associated with his enterprises for ransom or worse, they say. \"They may kidnap a Trump worker and not even want to negotiate,\" aiming for publicity instead, said Colin P. Clarke, a political scientist with the RAND Corporation who studies terrorism and international criminal networks. Predicting an attack keeps police, intelligence agencies and security experts awake at night around the world \u2014 and, by its very nature, it remains speculative. U.S. brands have been targeted in overseas violence before, but they never belonged to a president. That's the difference. Trump becoming America's 45th president presents a unique challenge given the range of his international business interests. Asked about security issues, the Trump Organization said in a statement it has \"extensive protocols in place at our Trump-owned and -managed properties\" in the United States and abroad. \"Our team continues to work very closely with local law enforcement,\" the statement said. \"We are also working in tandem with the local developers at Trump-branded properties worldwide to ensure that all residents, guests and associates remain safe and secure.\" The organization did not elaborate. While Trump has said he will put his business assets in a trust and hand over management control of his company to his two adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization executive, it's still his name on the projects. That hasn't worried Kim Ok Kyu, who lives in a Trump-branded apartment tower in Seoul, South Korea . She said security at her building is quite good, with many guards and strict restrictions on outsiders entering the building \"Terror? I don't think about it. I just hope my home prices go up,\" Kim said. But other properties are in areas that have seen violence, like Trump Towers Istanbul, the Turkish city hit hard by a string of bomb and gun attacks carried out by the Islamic State group. Flags and banners around the site bear the president's name, while private security guards man X-ray machines and metal detectors at its entrances, a standard practice in the city. In Bali, where bombs planted by the Islamic extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah targeting bar-goers killed 202 people in 2002, Trump's organization has licensed the president's name to a planned luxury resort. Bali police spokesman Hengky Widjaja said no one had requested extra security for the property and authorities had no plans to increase their presence there. A Trump-named residential tower is under construction in the Indian city of Mumbai, which was hit by a 2008 terror attack blamed on the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba that killed 166 people. Mumbai police spokesman Ashok Dudhe said he had no knowledge of any additional security around the tower. Another tower is being built in Manila in the Philippines, a nation where Abu Sayyaf militants conduct frequent kidnappings for ransom and where President Rodrigo Duterte wages a brutal crackdown on drug dealers that has killed thousands. Philippine police say they haven't monitored any specific threat toward Trump properties, though a tower rising in Manila sits in an area under an intensified security watch after Duterte declared a \"state of lawlessness\" following a September bombing. Even Trump's soon-to-open golf course in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates could be a target, despite the fact the Gulf Arab nation has largely escaped the violence gripping its Mideast neighbors. In the UAE's capital of Abu Dhabi, an American school teacher was stabbed to death in a mall bathroom by an extremist in December 2014. Authorities also have imprisoned others over disrupted terror plots in the country, which hosts some 5,000 members of the U.S. military. Dubai police have declined to discuss safety on the golf course while the developer says it plans no additional security there. The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to questions about the golf course, which Trump's children are expected to soon visit. All of the Trump properties should be looked at by outside security consultants, said Christopher A. Hagon, a managing partner of The Incident Management Group and a former London police officer with experience in diplomatic security. However, he acknowledged such commercial properties can't be surrounded by concrete blast walls and controlled like a U.S. Embassy. \"There is no complete answer to these things unless you've got a military encampment and you can do anything you like,\" Hagon said. \"You've got to make compromises, but hope those compromises won't weaken the overall approach.\" Away from the properties themselves, employees could be threatened, robbed or held captive, experts warn. Under U.S. law, the Secret Service is authorized to protect the president, the vice president and their immediate families. That would include his sons Eric and Donald Jr., who will run the Trump Organization under the plan announced by the president at a news conference last week. Already, the Secret Service and the New York police have provided security in and around Trump Tower in Manhattan as the president lives and works there. When asked about the Trump Organization, Secret Service spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan said the agency does \"not comment on our protective operations.\" However, that Secret Service protection extends anywhere the president and his immediate family travels. The U.S. intelligence community already has a duty to warn American citizens and others if it uncovers information about impending threats, which would include Trump's businesses. In 2015, National Intelligence Director James Clapper set formal guidelines for how the intelligence community does that if it learns of impending threats of killing, serious bodily harm or kidnapping. \"This includes threats where the target is an institution, place of business, structure or location,\" according to Clapper's directive. Those threats become more serious if Trump's work intersects with his duties in the Oval Office and a militant group decides to \"mock, torment or tease\" him with a kidnapped employee, Clarke said. He added: \"If an executive from Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan or Exxon Mobil gets kidnapped, it's news, but it's not the president's company.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann in Washington, Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul, Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, and Muneeza Naqvi in New Delhi contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

President Donald Trump \u2019s senior advisers defended White House attacks on the news media and incorrect claims about the size of the crowd at his inauguration, accusing news organizations Sunday of trying to undermine Trump\u2019s legitimacy.The pushback came a day after White House press Secretary Sean... (Tribune news services) On Monday, Spicer took dozens of questions from reporters during a briefing that lasted more than 90 minutes. He opened the briefing -- his first official one -- by vaguely joking about his controversial statement and saying that his Twitter feed proves that he is not the most popular press secretary. But soon, a reporter pressed Spicer on what happened and asked if he plans to always be truthful and never knowingly say something that is not factual. \"Our intention is never to lie to you,\" Spicer said. \"You're in the same boat: I mean, there are times when you guys tweet something out or write a story and you publish a correction. That doesn't mean that you were intentionally trying to deceive readers and the American people, does it? And I think that we should be afforded the same opportunity. \"There are times when we believe something to be true or we get something from an agency or we act in haste because the information available wasn't complete but our desire to communicate with the American people and make sure that you have the most complete story at the time, and so we do it. But, again, I think that when you look net-net, we're going to do our best every time we can. I'm going to come out here and tell you the facts as I know them, and if we make a mistake, I'll do our best to correct it.\" Who is Sean Spicer? Spicer is the White House press secretary and communications director for President Donald Trump. Here is some more information on Spicer. (Jan. 23, 2017) Spicer is the White House press secretary and communications director for President Donald Trump. Here is some more information on Spicer. (Jan. 23, 2017) See more videos Spicer continued to push reporters to hold themselves to the same levels of accountability that they hold the White House. He again pointed to an inaccurate report Friday night by a reporter who mistakenly thought the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. When it was revealed that the bust was still there, the reporter quickly issued a correction and an apology to his colleagues. Spicer responded on Twitter on Friday: \"Apology accepted.\" \"We had a tweet go out about Martin Luther King -- think about how racially charged that is,\" Spicer said Monday. \"And someone rushes out and says to the entire press corps that the president of the United States has removed the bust from his office.\" Spicer said that while the reporter apologized to his colleagues, \"Where was the apology to the President of the United States? Where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive that was. Where was that apology?\" ",

Somorie Moses, 40, was taken into custody Saturday, four days after a torso and leg belonging to an unidentified female were discovered in the trash heaps at the Metropolitan Transfer Station in the Bronx. CBS New York reports, citing sources in the New York Police Department, that the arrest came soon after a human head, two hands and two feet were found inside a freezer in his Brooklyn apartment. Moses, a registered sex offender, has been charged with concealment of a human corpse. Police reportedly used surveillance cameras and phone records to track him down. Next-door neighbor Frank Vassel told the station he was stunned to learn of the allegations. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s real gross,\u201d he said. \u201cA monster, got to be a monster.\u201d \u00a0 Other neighbors told the station there are children who live in the same apartment complex. Moses has an extensive rap sheet with over eight arrests. He served three years in prison for raping and forcing a girl under the age of 16 into prostitution in 2006, the station reports. The remains have yet to be identified and a cause of death isn\u2019t yet known. Moses was expected to be arraigned in Bronx criminal court. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

(Photo: Julienne Schaer) NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump could eat anywhere. But the new\u00a0president prefers simple fare. Trump Tower\u00a0has been dubbed the \u201cWhite House of the North\u201d because his wife and first lady Melania Trump and son will continue to reside there rather than living in the White House. All of Melania and Ivanka's Inauguration outfits New York has been nicknamed many things, but this turn in the political spotlight is a new one. Fifth Avenue has become a police barricade, but businesses are still open and calling for visitors to show up. And many have the new coveted selfie \u2014 a picture in front of Trump Tower. Tourists who can talk their way into Trump Tower can take photos inside, and buy \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and other campaign souvenirs from the building\u2019s gift store. \u201c\ufffd?White House North\u2019 is a new twist to New York City\u2019s continued evolution and appeal,\u201d says Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city\u2019s official destination marketing organization. \u201cVisitors flock to the city for so many reasons, this being just one new and unique facet for the destination. Fifth Avenue and its world-class shopping are already iconic draws, but now the entire Midtown area will only be further magnified.\u201d Will he go for the gold? Donald Trump's redecorating plans for the White House The Trump International Hotel, across from the acclaimed Time-Warner Center, is another place crowds are congregating. A destination itself, the Time Warner Center is home to shops like Michael Kors and Swarovski and larger-than-life sculptures by Colombian artist Fernando Botero. According to Cindy Adams, the prominent New York Post gossip columnist and a friend of Trump\u2019s for many years, he is a hard worker who takes many of his meals at his residence with his wife, or at one of his numerous properties in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s not a regular restaurant-goer,\u201d says Adams. \u201cHe has restaurants in Trump Tower.\u201d But in late November, when he was considering former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for secretary of state, Trump dined with him and his incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus at Jean Georges, the three-Michelin star restaurant located inside Trump International Hotel, near Central Park. For appetizers, the trio ordered a garlic soup with thyme, saut\u00e9ed frog legs, caper-raisin emulsion and scallops with caramelized cauliflower, according to a briefing given to reporters. President-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney dine at Jean Georges restaurant in New York City on Nov. 29, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) Relive the most memorable moments from Trump's inauguration Adams says Trump likes to go to events around the city, such as movie openings, boxing matches, and the first New York Yankees game of the year at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. \u201cI see him always at the opening day of the Yankees,\u201d Adams says, where he sits in an exclusive box. According to Adams, he also goes to the venerable 21 Club, an upscale restaurant that serves classic America fare, where Trump\u2019s go-to dish is the \u201c21 Burger\u201d \u2014 well done and with French fries. Trump also frequents the lesser-known Nino\u2019s, an Italian eatery on the Upper East Side. Ben Widdicombe, a society writer in New York City, says that Trump also likes the Waverly Inn in Greenwich Village, which is owned by Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair, a publication the president has criticized. \u201cEven though he\u2019s engaged in a war with Graydon Carter, he goes there,\u201d Widdicombe says. But Trump prefers to take his VIP companions to Jean Georges, among them Romney and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Even at a fancy restaurant, he tends to order steak and vegetables, Widdicombe says. And he likes burgers at the Jackson Hole, \u201chome of the 7 oz. burger,\u201d according to its website. Jackson Hole has locations in Queens, the outer borough of New York City where he grew up, but he now prefers locations closer to his home at Trump Tower. \u201cDonald Trump is a meat and potatoes kind of guy,\u201d Widdicombe says. Trump likes casual food, Adams agrees. A burger pleases him, though he does enjoy his hotel restaurants and an occasional stop at the Ralph Lauren Polo Bar. The restaurant is so exclusive that the doorman checks guests in via iPad and the public relations personnel refuse to provide photos. Trump\u2019s relationship with food has been in the spotlight\u00a0as long as he has been. New Yorkers\u00a0frowned upon him\u00a0when he ate pizza with a fork and knife with Sarah Palin\u00a0at Famiglia Pizzeria in Times Square in 2011, as the former Alaska governor considered a presidential bid. Once he was elected president, Trump lashed out at Vanity Fair for a\u00a0scathing review of the Trump Grill, a steakhouse in the lobby of Trump Tower.

(Jan. 21) AP President Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters on Jan. 21, 2017, in Langley, Va. (Photo: Olivier Douliery, Pool, Getty Images) President Trump engaged in revisionist history when he accused the \u201cdishonest\u201d media of making \u201cit sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.\u201d In fact, Trump made numerous disparaging remarks about the U.S. intelligence community. On his first full day as president, Trump visited the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. In his remarks, Trump promised to support the intelligence community. But then he went too far in blaming the media for distorting his past statements about U.S. intelligence. Trump, Jan. 21:\u00a0\"And the reason you\u2019re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. (Laughter and applause.) And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you\u2019re the number-one stop is exactly the opposite \u2014 exactly.\" At his press briefing on Jan. 23, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump went to the CIA \u201cto dispel the myth that there was a quote unquote rift.\u201d But the fact is that Trump belittled the intelligence community\u2019s work and questioned its motives in a series of statements and tweets before and after the election. His disagreement with the intelligence community stemmed from the IC\u2019s investigation of Russian cyber attacks on Democratic committees and officials. On Oct. 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out a statement saying the Russian government \u201cdirected\u201d the hacking \u201cto interfere with the US election process.\u201d On Jan. 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence went further and released a declassified report that said Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cdeveloped a clear preference for President-elect Trump\u201d and that he had waged a broad \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d to \u201cundermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process\u201d and to help elect Trump. For months, Trump refused to accept the intelligence community\u2019s findings of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election. During an Oct. 9, 2016, debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump said \u201cmaybe there is no hacking.\u201d That was two days after the intelligence community said the Russian government \u201cdirected\u201d the hacking. Trump, Oct. 9, 2016:\u00a0\"But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 [Clinton] doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.\" In an interview on Fox News Sunday two months later, Trump said the intelligence community did not know who was behind the hacking. Trump, Dec. 11, 2016:\u00a0\"They have no idea if it\u2019s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place. I mean, they have no idea.\" In a statement around that time, Trump also questioned the intelligence community\u2019s track record \u2014 citing its intelligence work prior to the Iraq War in 2003. Trump, Dec. 9, 2016:\u00a0\"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\" A month after that, Trump escalated his criticism of the intelligence community by questioning its motives. In a Jan. 3, 2017, tweet, Trump claimed that intelligence officials had delayed a briefing with him on the Russia report. In that tweet, Trump dismissively used air quotes around the word \u201cintelligence\u201d to describe the briefing, and questioned whether the delay was needed \u201cto build a case\u201d against Russia. The \"Intelligence\" briefing on so-called \"Russian hacking\" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 A day later, Trump quoted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to cast doubt on the intelligence community\u2019s findings about Russia\u2019s involvement in the election. According to the U.S. intelligence report, Russian military intelligence used WikiLeaks to publicly release hacked emails that were damaging to Clinton \u2014 a claim Assange denied. Julian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 On Jan. 11, 2017, Trump accused U.S. intelligence agencies of leaking an unsubstantiated report that Russia had damaging information on Trump. He claimed the leak was done to take \u201cone last shot at me,\u201d and compared it to \u201cliving in Nazi Germany.\u201d Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Director of National Intelligence James Clapper denied that \u201cthe leaks came from within the IC.\u201d We have no reason to doubt Trump\u2019s words when he says that, as president, he will have the CIA\u2019s back and will be its biggest supporter. But Trump can\u2019t take back words that he said about intelligence and falsely claim that the media misreported them.

Trump said \u201cwe want to start making our products here again,\u201d and that companies that invest in the USA rather than lay off workers and build factories abroad would reap \u201cadvantages\u201d from his administration. However, U.S. companies that move factories abroad will be hit with a border tax when they import the goods back to the U.S., Trump warned. ",

(Jan. 20, 2017) Donald Trump delivered a list of promises he said he would get done in his first day of office. (Jan. 20, 2017) Jenna Johnson, David NakamuraThe Washington Post President Trump delivered on more campaign promises Monday by implementing a hiring freeze for most federal agencies, withdrawing from a major trade agreement and urging corporate executives to keep jobs in the country. But his aides also signaled the new administration will not move as quickly as Trump had promised earlier on other top priorities, including renegotiating the long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and undoing President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration, including a policy that allows some undocumented immigrants who came here as children to stay lawfully. Trump's clearest shot at what he has derided as Washington's broken system of governing came in the form of the hiring freeze. The president and his aides have portrayed federal agencies as bloated and wasting money. But even the hiring freeze may promise more than it can deliver. It provided exemptions for those working in the military, which could include civilian employees, potentially leaving a large part of the federal workforce untouched by the order. Trump kicked off his first full workweek with a whirlwind of activity - a breakfast with corporate leaders followed by a call with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi and meetings with union workers and congressional leaders. Throughout the day, Trump maintained a heavy focus on trade, which was at the heart of his presidential campaign and one of the few areas where he did not shift among positions. And he often seemed comfortably at home in the White House as he entertained, signed orders, posed for photos and promised to disrupt Washington, just as he had electoral politics. Donald Trump Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump holds up an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership after signing it in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2017. President Donald Trump holds up an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership after signing it in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2017. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Monday opened with a \"listening session\" with leaders of some of the country's largest corporations - who stayed longer than planned to continue talking with Trump in the Oval Office. The president promised the group he would cut taxes, fast-track their plans to open factories and wipe out at least 75 percent of government regulations. \"We're going to be cutting regulation massively,\" Trump said during a brief portion of the meeting that was open to the press. \"Now, we're going to have regulation, and it'll be just as strong and just as good and just as protective of the people as the regulation we have right now.\" In exchange, Trump said companies must stay in the country and continue employing Americans. He again threatened to impose a \"substantial border tax\" on companies that move production out of the country. International-trade analysts said Trump may not have the authority to punish individual companies, while broad-based tariffs would violate existing treaties. Trump defended his idea as \"fair.\" President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday giving federal agencies broad powers to unwind regulations created under the Affordable Care Act , which might include enforcement of the penalty for people who fail to carry the health insurance that the law requires of most Americans. ... President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday giving federal agencies broad powers to unwind regulations created under the Affordable Care Act , which might include enforcement of the penalty for people who fail to carry the health insurance that the law requires of most Americans. ... (Ashley Parker, Amy Goldstein) \"Don't leave,\" Trump said. \"Don't fire your people in the United States. We have the greatest people.\" After the meeting, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical told reporters that Trump and the chief executives discussed the border-tax proposal and the industries it would help or hurt. But Liveris added that Trump \"is not going to do anything to harm competitiveness. He's going to actually make us all more competitive, recognizing there's a transition here. You can't get things done overnight.\" Later in the morning, reporters witnessed Trump signing three pieces of paper that were briefly described aloud by White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as he handed them to the president. These documents, labeled executive orders by aides, were not released to the media or the public until late in the day, leaving many to wonder for hours what exactly the president was implementing. First Trump signed a memorandum ordering the formal end of the United States' participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a long-standing campaign promise, although the move at this point is considered largely symbolic because the trade deal had little chance of being approved by Congress. \"We've been talking about it for a long time,\" Trump said as he held up the order. \"Great thing for the American worker.\" Trump had also promised to take steps on his first formal day in office to begin renegotiating NAFTA, but that deal went unmentioned Monday. Trump earlier said he will meet soon with the Canadian prime minister and the Mexican president to discuss renegotiating the agreement. Then came an executive order that would implement a hiring freeze for many jobs in the federal government, another promise Trump made on the campaign trail. \"Except for the military,\" the president said as he signed the order. \"Except for the military.\" Finally, Trump signed an order resurrecting an abortion-related rule known as the Mexico City policy. The policy forbids foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive federal funding from performing or promoting abortion services through their work in other countries. The policy takes its name from the location of a conference at which President Ronald Reagan instituted the restriction in 1984. Since that time, the rule has been in place under Republican presidents while being repealed by Democratic residents of the Oval Office. This signing seemed more like a party tradition than a new push by Trump, who had never mentioned the rule on the campaign trail. But he promised evangelical voters he would remain opposed to abortion. As reporters left the Oval Office, one asked the president about the lawsuit filed by a liberal watchdog group that alleges Trump is in violation of a little-known constitutional provision that bars him from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments. \"Without merit,\" Trump said. \"Totally without merit.\" Soon attention shifted to Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, who endured rounds of criticism and mockery for delivering a blistering statement Saturday in the White House briefing room that accused the media of underestimating Trump's inauguration crowd size and relied on a number of statistics that quickly proved to be inaccurate. Spicer held his first formal briefing Monday afternoon to a standing-room-only crowd, opening with a joke about being less popular than his predecessor, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest. The joke fell flat. Spicer proceeded to answer questions for nearly 80 minutes, calling on more than three dozen reporters from a wide range of news outlets. Even as he patiently worked the room, Spicer did not back down from his contention that the press was out to \"undermine\" the president, and he continued to insist that Trump's inauguration was the most watched in history, after television and Internet viewers were accounted for, without offering full evidence to back his claim. \"There's this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and the movement that he represents,\" Spicer said. \"And it's frustrating for not just him but I think so many of us that are trying to work to get this message out.\" Spicer was asked why Trump was not following through on more of the campaign promises he pledged to fulfill on his first day in office. \"Part of it is to make sure that we don't spend our entire day signing executive orders,\" he said. \"There's a way that we can do this to make sure that we're getting all of those things that he promised the American people done in short haste and doing it in a way that doesn't just jam them out in a fire hose.\" Meanwhile, Trump was meeting with a small group of union leaders and workers to promote his executive order canceling participating in the TPP. \"This is a group I know well,\" the president said, noting that he had hired \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of them over the years. At the end of the day, Trump met with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders and declared it was the beginning of a \"beautiful, beautiful relationship.\" As reporters were ushered out, Trump turned to business. \"We're about to make a big deal,\" he said, eliciting laughs around the table. But Trump wasn't ready to quite move past discussing the election. He spent about 10 minutes of the meeting providing a blow-by-blow of election night, according to a source familiar with the discussion, and continued to insist that there were between 3 million to 5 million illegal votes, without which he would have won the popular vote. The Washington Post's Amy Goldstein, Abby Phillip and Ylan Q. Mui contributed to this report. ",

    "text": "CBS/AP January 23, 2017, 12:34 PM Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi devastated by series of deadly storms, tornadoes ALBANY, Ga. - Chuck Stafford was watching the Atlanta Falcons rout the Green Bay Packers for the NFC title when bad weather suddenly began to pound his mobile home in southern Georgia. Stafford, 74, had just gotten up to head to the bathroom during Sunday\u2019s football game when the wind started whipping the mobile home park in Albany where he has lived for 31 years. His home started shaking violently. CBS News' Mark Strassmann reports from Albany, Georgia, on the powerful storms and deadly tornadoes that have torn across several southeastern st... The gusts blew the windows out of Stafford\u2019s trailer, spraying shattered glass everywhere. But he was lucky. \u201cI grabbed hold of my washer and dryer, got my legs spread apart and hunched over,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI guess I picked a good time to go to the bathroom.\u201d Stafford is among the residents in Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina now trying to pick up the pieces left behind by a powerful storm system that tore across the Deep South over the weekend, killing 19 people, including 15 in south Georgia. Rescuers were going through stricken areas Monday, searching for possible survivors. Dougherty County Coroner Michael Fowler said that a total of four people died Sunday in the county that includes Albany.\u00a0 Albany resident James Black told CBS News the apparent tornado \u201csounded just like everybody says it sounds like, it sounded like a train. Just about the time the warning flashed across, a couple minutes later the lights flickered and then the power went out. I went to look outside, I did and then the trees were all leaning. You could start to hear the rumble like a train. I told everybody to get down in the house and a couple seconds later I felt the house shake. Then I looked around and I saw a bunch of insulation around me so I realized it reached the house.\u201d \u00a0 Some 60 miles away, Coroner Tim Purvis in south Georgia\u2019s Cook County confirmed seven people died at the Sunshine Acres mobile home park in the rural community of Adel, where about half of the 40 homes were leveled. Amanda Williams, who lives at at Sunshine Acres,\u00a0 told CBS Jacksonville affiliate WJAX : \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, I don\u2019t even have words to explain it.\u201d\u00a0 Williams was inside her home when the deadly tornado hit. \u00a0 \u201cThen, before I knew it, you could hear it and feel it at the same time and that was it,\u201d Williams said. New damage picture from a mobile home park in Adel, Georgia (about 2 hours from Jacksonville). pic.twitter.com/z0mbOFYfep \u2014 Erica Bennett (@EricaANjax) January 22, 2017 The toll of 15 killed in south Georgia also included two deaths each in the counties of Berrien and Brooks. In South Carolina, the National Weather Service has confirmed that two tornadoes struck over the weekend, injuring one woman who was trapped in a mobile home that was damaged near Blackville. The weather service says a tornado touched down about 3:45 p.m. Saturday in Barnwell County and moved into Bamberg County. The other occurred in Orangeburg County a few minutes later. Weather experts say tornadoes can hit any time of year in the South, including in the dead of winter. Even north Florida was under the weekend weather threat. While the central U.S. has a fairly well-defined tornado season \u2014 the spring \u2014 the risk of tornadoes \u201cnever really goes to zero\u201d for most of the year in the Southeast, explained Patrick Marsh of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. He said 39 possible tornadoes were reported across the Southeast from early Saturday into Sunday evening \u2014\u00a0none immediately confirmed. Of that, 30 were reported in Georgia, four in Mississippi, and one each in Louisiana and South Carolina. January tornado outbreaks are rare but not unprecedented, particularly in the South. Data from the Storm Prediction Center shows that, over the past decade, the nation has seen an average of 38 tornadoes in January, ranging from a high of 84 in 2008 to just four in 2014. Jenny Bullard carries a pair of boots from her home that was damaged by a tornado, Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Ga.\u00a0 AP Photo/Branden Camp Jenny Bullard, 19, said she and her parents, Jeff and Carla, are glad to have escaped without major injury after an apparent tornado battered their home in Cook County, causing walls to collapse. They are a farming family dating back generations, living not far from where the mobile homes were destroyed. The middle section of their brick house was ripped off the slab. A piano was blown out of the house. She recalled waking up to the sound of hail and then heard her father, calling her name. \u201cThere was a bunch of stuff on top of him and I just started throwing everything I could until I got to him,\u201d she said. Then she and her parents fled. The young woman went back through the debris for family photos and other belongings. Bricks lay scattered about, alongside their possessions and furniture. Across the street, where the Bullards kept farm equipment in sheds, one shed was blown apart. Two grain silos were blown over. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible tragedy. But all this stuff can be replaced,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t replace each other. We\u2019re extremely lucky. My dad is lucky to be alive.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "CBS/AP January 23, 2017, 3:30 PM A win for Snapchat in crash lawsuit tied to speed filter Christal McGee\u2019s Mercedes after the crash in September 2015. Carl Court, Getty Images Email GRIFFIN, Ga. \u2014 A judge has dismissed claims against Snapchat that blamed the social media company\u2019s \u201cspeed filter\u201d for a highway crash. The judge said the Communications Decency Act provides the social media company with immunity. Snapchat attorney Mark Trigg told The Associated Press Monday in an emailed statement that the \u201cthe judge\u2019s ruling in this case is precedent setting for the entire mobile app and product industry.\u201d A Snapchat video appears to show the moments before a deadly car crash last Wednesday in Florida that killed five people, including a mother and ... \u201cA loss for Snapchat would have been dangerous, opening a floodgate of lawsuits for everyone from cell phone manufacturers to billboard advertisers to makeup brands \u2014 virtually anyone that can potentially cause a distraction from driving. Snapchat\u2019s win instead diverts blame from these companies and requires responsible use of these technologies by the driver,\u201d Trigg wrote. Wentworth and Karen Maynard sued Snapchat and the driver , Christal McGee, in April, saying McGee was trying to reach 100 mph on a highway south of Atlanta when her car hit theirs, sending it across the left lane and into an embankment. The collision in September 2015 left Wentworth Maynard with brain damage. The dismissal by Spalding County State Court Judge Josh Thacker on Friday leaves pending the claims against McGee, who allegedly hit them while using a Snapchat filter that puts the rate at which a vehicle is traveling over an image. The snap Christal McGee posted from an ambulance after the\u00a0 September 2015 crash. Maynard's lawyers via Snapchat According to court documents, McGee Snapchatted \u201cLucky to be alive\u201d from a stretcher after the accident.\u00a0 \u201cWe disagree with the Judge\u2019s ruling that the Communications Decency Act provides Snapchat with complete immunity for its negligent actions,\u201d Naveen Ramachandrappa, a lawyer for the Maynards, wrote in an email. He added that they are considering an appeal. The judge found that the claims against Snapchat were barred by the immunity clause of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which says, \u201cNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d Transportation safety advocates have kept a watchful eye on Snapchat\u2019s speed filter. \u201cWhat has really made this app stand out from the rest is that visual in-the-moment, right-now, what-am-I-doing,\u201d Katie Bassett, who\u2019s written about Snapchat for the consumer safety blog Safer America,\u00a0told CBS News in November.\u00a0 She called on\u00a0 Snapchat to delete the filter, which, she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t really serve a direct purpose other than to have a user climb in excessive speed and capture it on video.\u201d\u00a0 Now, the key question is whether Snapchat had a legal duty because Wentworth\u2019s injury was predictable, given that other users are alleged to have had wrecks while using the speed filter, and therefore should have removed or restricted access to the filter once it found out about those crashes, the judge wrote. That duty would stem from Snapchat\u2019s status as a publisher, and the law grants immunity on those grounds, the judge wrote. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Jan 23 2017, 5:47 pm ET GOP Obamacare Replacement Would Give Power to States by Maggie Fox advertisement Republican senators introduced a partial replacement to the Affordable Care Act on Monday that would let states keep some aspects of the Obamacare law, but that would end the mandate requiring citizens to carry health insurance. The measure, by Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, is being billed as an \"Obamacare replacement plan\" that would empower states and get health insurance to more people. Collins said the plan is clearer than an executive order President Donald Trump signed hours after his inauguration on Friday directing the Health and Human Services Department to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay\" any ACA requirement that would impose a fiscal burden. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, co-sponsored an Obamacare replacement plan Evan Vucci / AP It orders agencies to give greater flexibility to states in implementing the health care law. It says the policy of the Trump administration is to \"prepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market.\" Experts on both sides of the political divide said Trump's executive order did little to change the law. \"I think the executive order is in a large part symbolic,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum. \"It's important symbolism. There was a commitment to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,\" Holtz-Eakin told NBC News. \"It basically resets the policy direction of the administration, from expanding coverage, the Obama administration's goal, to reducing regulation and taxes, transferring responsibility to the states, and moving toward more market competition,\" said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. \u201cI think the executive order is in a large part symbolic.\u201d \"But it doesn't change anything yet on the ground. That will mostly need to be done by rulemaking by the relevant departments.\" Related: Five Obamacare Provisions Trump Could Change Right Away Collins called the executive order \"very confusing\". Her plan would allow states to automatically enroll people in bare-bones health insurance while allowing them to opt out. It would give states money to either keep or replace the ACA's Medicaid expansion; 19 states still have not expanded that program to cover more people. \"We need legislation,\" Collins told reporters. \"There are some improvements that can be made through the executive order, and through the regulatory process, but that by no means takes away the need for comprehensive legislation.\" Play ",

    "text": "Tillerson passes preliminary Senate vote to become secretary of state Published               January 23, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A Senate committee on Monday voted to approve former ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson as President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, paving the way to a final vote by all 100 senators. Tillerson was essentially assured of getting enough votes in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a committee member, decided earlier in the day to pledge his support for Tillerson becoming the country\u2019s top diplomat. The 11-10 vote along party lines in the GOP-controlled Congress would have been close without Rubio. Meanwhile, senators were debating on the chamber\u2019s floor\u00a0 whether to vote in favor of making Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo the next CIA director. The debate and final vote were expected to continue into the evening. Pompeo's nomination is expected to be approved since the Republicans have 52 senators in the chamber and 51 of them, a simple majority, are needed to vote \u201cyes.\" Rubio voted for Tillerson despite his concerns, and those of others on the committee, about Tillerson's past business ties with Russia. \u201cHe has a proven record of running a large, complex company,\u201d Rubio said before voting yes. \u201cFor me, this wasn\u2019t simply a concern about Russia.\u201d Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the committee, voted against Tillerson\u2019s nomination. \u201cI believe Mr. Tillerson\u2019s demonstrated business orientation and his responses to questions during the confirmation hearing could compromise his ability as secretary of state to forcefully promote the values and ideals that have defined our country and our leading role in the world for more than 200 years,\u201d he said before the vote. GOP Sens. John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, had expressed concerns about Tillerson similar to those raised by Rubio. However, the senators said Sunday that they would support Tillerson in the final floor vote. \"Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,\" they said in a joint statement. Top Senate Democrats on Friday postponed Pompeo\u2019s vote saying they wouldn\u2019t rush through the confirmation process for Trump. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that several of Trump\u2019s remaining nominees will be subject to \u201ca thorough debate.\u201d The New York Democrat said he was \u201cdubious\u201d about eight or nine of Trump's picks -- citing potential conflicts of interests and policy stands. The Senate has so far confirmed just two Trump nominees -- Gens. James Mattis, as defense secretary, and John Kelly, as Homeland Security secretary. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed confidence Sunday about having enough votes to get all of Trump\u2019s nominees confirmed. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll be able to confirm the president\u2019s entire Cabinet,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m optimistic.\u201d As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson spoke out against U.S. sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The penalties cost the energy giant hundreds of millions of dollars. The episode became even more of a concern after the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House race.

The president's business interest in a government-owned property has drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics advisers. John Minchillo/AP hide caption toggle caption John Minchillo/AP Police stand guard outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington the day before the inauguration. The president's business interest in a government-owned property has drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics advisers. John Minchillo/AP President Trump is now filing the documents needed to remove his name as top executive at his companies, finally making good on a promise to leave management by Inauguration Day. He may be a couple of days late, but public documents show Trump is making changes at the helm of his businesses. For example, a filing from Florida's Department of State , entered Monday, shows son Eric Trump as president of Trump International Hotels Management LLC. In March 2016, Donald J. Trump had been registered as president of the company. That sort of management shift was confirmed in numerous documents that began appearing online throughout Monday afternoon. The filings don't show a change in ownership, just a replacement of Donald Trump as the top executive. The Trump Organization may have gotten a nudge from a weekend report by ProPublica , an independent nonprofit news service. It had contacted officials in Florida, Delaware and New York and found no indication that Trump had begun transferring management to his sons. White House spokesman Sean Spicer was questioned Monday about whether Trump would release documents verifying the president had resigned from his businesses. Spicer said Trump has \"resigned from the company as he said he would before he took office,\" adding \"he's taken extraordinary steps to ensure that that's happened.\" Article continues after sponsorship It's believed Trump has more than 500 business entities, so re-registering them all could take some time. He did manage to sever ties with his businesses in the United Kingdom in time for his inauguration Friday. Meanwhile, one of Trump's newest ventures \u2014 the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. \u2014 had a rough first couple of months. The luxury hotel just blocks from the White House may have been sold out for inauguration festivities last week, but it lost more than $1.1 million in its first two months of operation. The hotel lost $334,000 in September and $825,000 in October. The Trump Organization had estimated a $84,000 loss in September and $481,000 profit in October. Those figures come from the federal General Services Administration, which owns the historic building that houses the hotel. GSA information was obtained by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Reps. Elijah Cummings, Gerald Connolly, Peter DeFazio and Andre Carson asked the GSA for any correspondence it has had with the Trump Organization. They want to see how the federal agency is addressing an \"apparent breach\" of the hotel's lease agreement. When the Democrats got the GSA information, they released it to the public on Monday. The lease explicitly says \"no elected official of the government of the United States\" may hold that lease. The letter said the documents did not give any reason why the hotel's income levels for its first two months were so far below the company's own projections, although September was a soft launch for the five-star hotel. There were no figures from November, when Trump won the presidential election, until now. One of the concerns ethics analysts have is that the hotel could create a conflict between Trump's business and his presidency. For example, foreign governments, lobbyists and special interest groups may stay at the hotel, just blocks from the White House, as a way of currying favor with the president. Trump's lawyers say he will hand over any of the hotel's profits to the U.S. Treasury Department. NPR intern Lucia Maffei contributed to this report. ",

Trucks travel to and from the World Trade Bridge in Laredo, Texas, on the U.S.-Mexico border. (Eric Gay / Associated Press) Don Lee Contact Reporter It was quick and easy for President Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership . With a stroke of his new presidential pen, he buried the massive Pacific free-trade agreement that the Obama administration had painstakingly negotiated, even though the 12-nation accord\u00a0had been moribund for the last year after\u00a0losing political support. It had little chance of being ratified by Congress. The real questions are: What will Trump replace it with? And when and how will he remake America\u2019s economic relations with the rest of the world? Nobody really knows for sure what Trump will do on trade because he has spoken only in generalities, threatening high tariffs and other tough measures against countries and American companies that move operations abroad. Trump\u2019s goal is to reverse the trade deficit and bring back jobs to U.S. shores. To many, he has sounded alarmingly protectionist, although it isn\u2019t clear how much of that is merely rhetoric to bring trading partners to the negotiating table. Trump\u2019s trade policies\u00a0will probably become clearer with his approach to reshaping\u00a0the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which has been in force since 1993 and accounts for about $1 trillion of U.S. merchandise trade. The president said Monday that he would begin renegotiating NAFTA at \u201cthe appropriate time,\u201d but White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump had already spoken to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his desire to reopen NAFTA negotiations. \u201cAnd I think as he meets with both of these individuals over the next 30 days or so, that's gonna be a topic,\u201d Spicer said. On his first full workday in the White House , President Trump took action highlighting the range of his campaign priorities: trade, abortion and tackling government bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s directives\u00a0follow another he issued just hours after taking the oath of office Friday that marked a first step ... On his first full workday in the White House , President Trump took action highlighting the range of his campaign priorities: trade, abortion and tackling government bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s directives\u00a0follow another he issued just hours after taking the oath of office Friday that marked a first step ... (Michael A. Memoli and Noam N. Levey) Trump\u2019s appointments suggest that the administration is serious about taking a sharply different, more aggressive tack on trade than recent past administrations, particularly involving China, the United States\u2019 top trading partner. Yet Trump\u2019s\u00a0Cabinet officials also include international business people and investors who have generally backed free trade. Trump\u2019s secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson, said\u00a0that he did not oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cThat is one X factor,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cIs he going to be able to simply implement what he\u2019s stated or will he be getting a pushback from his Cabinet as well as the congressional leadership?\u201d One strategy that Trump confirmed Monday was that he would be pursuing bilateral trade talks instead of multiparty deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cWe're going to have trade, but we're going to have one on one, and if somebody misbehaves, we're going to send them a letter of termination, 30 days, and they'll either straighten it out or we're gone,\u201d Trump told reporters after meeting with union leaders in the White House. An advantage of bilateral trade negotiations is that the U.S. can focus on a single country and not have to make concessions to satisfy a third party, although multilateral deals can offer commercial and geopolitical benefits that apply to many countries in a single swoop. Trump's pick for Commerce secretary assures lawmakers he is not anti-trade \u00bb The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which stood to be\u00a0the world\u2019s largest regional trade accord, accounting for 40% of global economic output, was the linchpin of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy to bind the region around an American-designed system of trade and commerce, essentially providing a counterweight to China\u2019s increasing\u00a0influence in the region. Although the Pacific deal was concluded more than a year ago, it never took effect, and Trump\u2019s action Monday made clear it would not be revived, as some congressional Republicans had sought. The U.S. already has a free-trade deal with six of the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries, but the pact would have added Japan, Vietnam and Malaysia. It would have\u00a0uniformly lowered or\u00a0eliminated\u00a0tariffs on many goods, and\u00a0created\u00a0common standards and rules of practice on a wide range of trade and investment activities. \u00a0\u00a0 The Pacific agreement was widely rejected by congressional Democrats, unions and consumer groups as favoring corporations and not taking a strong position against currency manipulation or\u00a0providing better protections for\u00a0patients, workers and the environment. \u201cWe appreciate that Donald Trump laid it in its grave,\u201d said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff at the AFL-CIO, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cBut that\u2019s only a first and small step.\u201d While there are signs of more aggressive trade actions on the part of Trump, Lee said it wasn\u2019t clear how Trump\u2019s approach \u2014 one of his popular refrains is \u201cbuy American\u201d\u00a0\u2014 would manifest itself in actual trade policies. \u201cThe incoming administration has a narrower vision of America first,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be negotiated and be worse for working people.\u201d Alan Deardorff, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, worried that Trump\u2019s \u201cintent to renegotiate NAFTA could be very harmful if it restores the tariffs and other barriers to trade between the U.S. and Mexico that existed prior to NAFTA. That would destroy, but not replace, the complicated North American supply chains that have grown under NAFTA and sustain much of U.S. manufacturing.\u201d Canada and Mexico are the United States\u2019 top two export destinations. American shipment of goods to Mexico totaled $212 billion last year, up from just $4.5 billion in 1993 when NAFTA was signed. Yet imports from Mexico have surged even more, particularly cars and car parts and electronics,\u00a0to a total of\u00a0about $271 billion\u00a0in the first\u00a011 months\u00a0last year from almost $40 billion in 1993. The result was a U.S. trade deficit of $58.8 billion through November last year, contrasted to a small surplus of $1.7 billion in 1993. Trade with Canada is more balanced, with the U.S. running a shortfall of about $9 billion last\u00a0January to November. Trade experts agree that NAFTA is\u00a0ripe for revisions, given its age and the need to update and incorporate\u00a0rules and standards for areas like ecommerce and other aspects reflecting a more high-tech, service-based economy. America\u2019s biggest trade deficit in goods\u00a0is with China, about $319 billion through November last year. Trump and his nominees to oversee trade have had the harshest words for China, pledging to upend the way Washington deals with China\u2019s trade and commercial relations. The U.S. has 20 free-trade agreements in force, but none\u00a0with China. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, reckons it won\u2019t be difficult for Trump to launch renegotiations on NAFTA. \u201cBoth governments said, \u2018We\u2019re ready, bring it on,\u2019\u201d he said of Mexico and Canada. The negotiations are almost\u00a0certain to\u00a0take many months and will most likely\u00a0be led by Trump\u2019s nominee to be the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer, and Wilbur Ross , named to serve as the new Commerce secretary. Both are expected to be confirmed by the Senate. Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine professor who was named by Trump to lead a new White House-based trade office, is also expected to play a role. At his confirmation hearing last\u00a0week, Ross, a billionaire financier who has invested in\u00a0distressed\u00a0steel, textile and other manufacturing companies, spoke critically of the\u00a0low wages of Mexican workers. He suggested that he might push\u00a0to renegotiate NAFTA's \"rules of origin\" \u2014 a provision that\u00a0allows a certain percentage of content made outside of NAFTA\u00a0countries to be shipped duty-free when they are included in the final product traded among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Trump has vowed to slash regulations. Where he might start and the hurdles he faces \u00bb Ross also expressed support for strengthening\u00a0the federal government's procurement practice of\u00a0favoring domestic suppliers.\u00a0 Many in Canada appear to be bracing for increased\u00a0tariffs and reduced exports to the U.S., some experts there said. \u201cEverybody has come to terms with the idea that they need to pay a higher price to access the U.S. market,\u201d said Domenico Lombardi, a global economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Canada. James\u00a0Bacchus, a former Democratic House member from Florida and onetime chairman of the World Trade Organization 's appellate body, said it was much too early to tell how the U.S. would approach the negotiations, much less what the shape of a revised NAFTA might look like. \u201cThe Trump administration has not yet laid out its\u00a0negotiating agenda, nor explained what its bottom line will be,\u201d he said. If Trump doesn\u2019t get a sufficient amount of what he wants, he has warned that he would withdraw\u00a0from NAFTA outright. But\u00a0Bacchus said that was an unlikely scenario.\u00a0\u201cWhat would that be,\u201d he asked, \u201cor is that simply a negotiating tactic?\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump's first weekend in office \u00a0echoes his campaign.

    "text": "WATCH Initial Conflicts for President Trump 0 Shares Email To fight what it called a \"grave threat\" to the country, a watchdog group on Monday filed a lawsuit alleging that President Donald Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his business to accept payments from foreign governments. The lawsuit claims that a constitutional clause prohibits Trump from receiving money from diplomats for stays at his hotels or foreign governments for leases of office space in his buildings. The language in the clause is disputed by legal experts, and some think the lawsuit will fail. But it signals the start of a legal assault on what Trump critics see as unprecedented conflicts between his business and the presidency. Trump called the lawsuit \"without merit, totally without merit\" after he signed some of his first executive actions Monday in the Oval Office. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York. The group is being represented in part by two former White House chief ethics lawyers: Norman Eisen, who advised Barack Obama, and Richard Painter, who worked under George W. Bush. The two have expressed frustration that Trump has refused to take their recommendation and divest from his business, and feel they had no choice but to take legal action. \"As the Framers were aware, private financial interests can subtly sway even the most virtuous leaders,\" the lawsuit argues, \"and entanglements between American officials and foreign powers could pose a creeping, insidious threat to the Republic.\" At a news conference earlier this month, Trump Organization lawyer Sheri Dillon the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution isn't meant to ban fair-value exchanges. They didn't think \"paying your hotel bill was an emolument,\" she said. Trump drew fresh attacks from critics almost the moment he took the oath of office on Friday. The group behind Monday's lawsuit also filed a complaint Friday addressed to the General Services Administration, an agency that oversees the lease of the government-owned building that houses Trump's new Washington hotel. The complaint argued the agency must cancel the lease because it expressly forbids any elected official from benefiting from it. GSA officials had said they needed to wait until Trump took office before weighing in on the issue. They have yet to issue an opinion, though, and have not responded to repeated requests for comment. Democrats in the House and Senate on Monday sent letters to Acting Administrator Timothy Horne seeking information about what the agency plans to do. In the new lawsuit, the group faces several legal hurdles, including making the case that it even has standing to bring the suit. \"There are a lot of issues that have to be litigated for the first time,\" said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of CREW. He added, though, that \"we have never had a president who has in a significant way accepted foreign payments.\" Bookbinder said his group will argue it has standing because the president has forced his organization to divert all it is resources to this fight rather than other issues, and therefore is harming it. That line drew criticism from some legal experts. Its argument for standing \"barely passes the laugh test,\" said Robert Kelner, chairman of the election and political law group of the firm Covington & Burling and an experienced Republican attorney. Edwin Williamson, a former State Department legal adviser, said that the group will struggle to prove its case. He agreed with Dillon's assessment that the emoluments clause does not apply the payment of a \"market price\" for a stay at a hotel. Trump said at his news conference earlier this month that he would not sell his ownership in his company, but would hand over management control to his two adult sons. He pledged that his company would strike no more deals abroad and would donate any profits from foreign governments using his hotels to the U.S. Treasury. Trump's companies began publicly filing paperwork on Monday to show that they're now being run by others. For example, Trump International Hotels Management LLC, registered in Florida, updated its paperwork with the secretary of state to list Eric Trump as president. Although Dillon says Trump has taken \"extraordinary\" measures, many government ethics lawyers have panned them as insufficient. They note that no modern president has taken office with as much wealth and as sprawling and opaque a business. His company, the Trump Organization, has stakes in golf resorts, office buildings, residential towers and hotel licensing deals in about 20 countries. Those include ones with which the U.S. has sensitive relations, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey. With so many business ties, particularly abroad, government ethics experts worry U.S. interests could take a back seat to his personal financial concerns. And even if they don't, they argue, people will try to curry favor with the new president by buying apartments in his towers or memberships in his golf resorts, raising doubts \u2014 fair or not \u2014 that U.S. policy is for sale. The lawsuit on Monday says that Trump's company is receiving payments from foreign government-owned tenants at Trump Tower in New York, including The Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. It also argues Trump's \"The Apprentice\" could get him in trouble. It says government-owned stations in in the United Kingdom and Vietnam are paying for broadcast rights of versions of the reality TV hit. Eisen and Painter have urged Trump to sell his holdings and put the cash in a blind trust, following the example of recent presidents. Trump is bucking another presidential tradition by refusing to disclose his tax returns. He has said he would be happy to release them, but only after the completion of an Internal Revenue Service audit. A public petition to the White House on Friday demanding he go public with his tax returns gathered more than 250,000 signatures \u2014 well over the 100,000 needed to trigger an official response. \"The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns,\" senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on ABC's This Week. \"We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Bykowicz reported from Washington.

    "text": "Photo James McMullan in his Upper West Side studio. Credit \u00c1ngel Franco/The New York Times No other living artist is more closely identified with an American theater company than James McMullan . For 30 years, his painterly posters for Lincoln Center Theater have been turned into collectibles that are more than advertising: They\u2019re synonymous with the shows themselves. It\u2019s hard to think of \u201cCarousel\u201d without recalling his artwork for the 1994 revival that depicts a brooding Billy Bigelow, vividly illuminated from below, atop wooden horses that rear beneath an angry sky. To commemorate Mr. McMullan\u2019s artistic tenure with Lincoln Center, a permanent exhibition of some of his best-known works was recently installed in the lobby of the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. For playwrights, having Mr. McMullan, 82, spend so much time considering and visualizing their created world is like having Picasso paint their child\u2019s portrait. \u201cOften contemporary theater posters seem to be made by someone in the marketing department and resemble clip art from the 1980s,\u201d said the playwright Sarah Ruhl , who has had several Lincoln Center plays promoted with posters by Mr. McMullan, including her latest, \u201cHow to Transcend a Happy Marriage,\u201d which starts performances on Feb. 23. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to point any fingers at any particular theater when I say this. But they often are not really held together by artistry. There is no one else like Jim.\u201d When it\u2019s time for Lincoln Center Theater to approve a poster, Mr. McMullan doesn\u2019t turn in crude line drawings. Working mainly in watercolor, not with computers, he turns in a finished painting. If it\u2019s rejected, he creates another one. The New York Times recently asked Mr. McMullan to open the many drawers of his studio on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to unearth some never-before-seen work for recent shows at Lincoln Center that demonstrate how he paints, from first impression to final poster.

By THE NEW YORK TIMES JAN. 23, 2017 Critics said the order would hinder the ability of women in poor countries to obtain reproductive health services, including family planning, by severing American funding to health clinics that offer a variety of services, including abortion counseling. The International Planned Parenthood Federation said its partners in Nepal, Kenya and Ethiopia had lost American funding the last time the policy was in effect, during the Bush administration. Because nongovernmental groups in those countries refused to accept the conditions of the policy, they were compelled to close clinics and offer fewer contraceptives, said Kelly Castagnaro, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. Advertisement A study of 20 sub-Saharan African countries by Stanford University researchers found that in countries that relied heavily on funding from the United States for reproductive health services, abortion rates rose when the Reagan-era policy was in place.

The next step is getting approval from the full Senate. USA TODAY NETWORK Secretary of State-nominee Rex Tillerson testifies on Jan. 11, 2017, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) 2559 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 Former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson won approval Monday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to become President Trump's secretary of State, paving the way for confirmation by the full Senate. The committee voted 11-10, along party lines, for Tillerson, whose nomination for the post has been controversial because of his close dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson prevailed after Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced he would reluctantly support former oil company executive despite reservations about his ties to Russia. Rubio told the committee his concern was that Tillerson will \"pursue a foreign policy of deal-making at the expense of human rights and democracy.\u201d During a sometimes tense confirmation hearing Jan. 11, Rubio called Tillerson's answers \"troubling\" and \"discouraging\" when he refused to agree that Russia\u00a0and Syria's aggressive actions were war crimes or that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's extradjudicial killings were human rights violations. 4 take-aways from Rex Tillerson hearing to be secretary of State Republicans hold a one-seat advantage on the panel, so a \"no\" vote would have blemished \u2014 though not torpedoed \u2014 Trump's choice to run the State Department. Rubio's decision to endorse Tillerson was probably made easier by the announcement Sunday of two other Tillerson skeptics \u2014 Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 to favor Tillerson.\u00a0In a joint statement, both said Tillerson \"can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests.\" Marco Rubio votes for Tillerson for secretary of state despite reservations Rubio wrote a lengthy Facebook post explaining that he would vote for Tillerson: \"Given the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy.\" Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, said he opposed Tillerson\u2019s nomination because \u201cthe fundamental role of a secretary of State is to promote American values.\u201d He said\u00a0Tillerson would not answer questions about whether he supported sanctions or whether development assistance should be contingent on human rights. \u201cSo many times he qualified (his responses) that he sounded like a business person and not like a secretary of State,\u201d Cardin said. Cardin said Tillerson lacked the passion for human rights shown by other Trump nominees, such as South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, picked to be ambassador to the United Nations, and James Mattis, who was confirmed Friday as secretary of Defense. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said he respects Tillerson\u2019s experience, but his world views don't support a tradition of promoting U.S. values such as protecting human rights and\u00a0enforcing rule of law. \u201cIt is not the type of moral clarity I would like a secretary of State to espouse,\u201d Menendez said. Menendez also said he did not think\u00a0Tillerson was forthcoming in his answers about ExxonMobil's lobbying against sanctions. Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., noted that Tillerson was\u00a0an engineer by training and was cautious in some of his answers because he \"probably doesn\u2019t know the person he\u2019s about to work for very well.\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, voted in favor of Tillerson, saying he was impressed by his commitment to support NATO allies\u00a0and to protect them if they come under attack. Those comments from Tillerson were at odds with Trump, who as a candidate said he would consider allies\u2019 contributions to their own defense before ordering U.S. troops to defend them. Democrats earlier criticized Rubio for what they see as caving to Trump. \u201cBy ignoring his serious reservations about Tillerson\u2019s connections to Vladimir Putin, Marco Rubio is not only rolling over for Donald Trump, he\u2019s earning the nickname Trump gave him: Little Marco,\" said\u00a0Zac Petkanas, a senior adviser to the\u00a0Democratic National Committee. Rubio had been pressed by a number of influential Republicans in recent weeks to back Tillerson, including former vice president Dick Cheney. If he voted against Tillerson, Rubio would be\u00a0tagged as the chief antagonist against his own party\u2019s president. It would also have meant running afoul of Senate Republican leaders who just awarded him a coveted seat on the Appropriations Committee. Only a handful of Cabinet nominees have been rejected, the most recent being former Texas senator John Tower in 1989, whom President George H.W. Bush had named to run the Pentagon. 2559 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jS6qTC NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Got it Donald Trump, accompanied by, from left, Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump, Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump, prepares to cut a ribbon during the grand-opening ceremony of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 26. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By David A. Fahrenthold and Jonathan O'Connell By David A. Fahrenthold and Jonathan O'Connell January 23 at 2:54 PM Follow @Fahrenthold Follow @OConnellPostBiz On Monday morning, a liberal watchdog group filed a lawsuit against President Trump, alleging he\u2019d violated a previously obscure provision in the Constitution, the \u201cEmoluments Clause.\u201d The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that the clause prohibits Trump-owned businesses from accepting payments from foreign governments. They asked a court to stop Trump\u2019s businesses from taking them now. \u201cThis cannot be allowed,\u201d the group wrote in its legal complaint. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Trump called the case \u201ctotally without merit\u201d during an event at the White House on Monday. Even if this case runs aground in court, there could be others. In fact, one of the parties best positioned to sue Trump might be the D.C. government \u2014 if D.C. officials decided it was worth the risk to sue the president. Below are four questions about the Emoluments Clause and what it might mean for President Trump. 1. What, exactly, is the Emoluments Clause? It is 49 words in Article I of the Constitution. \u201cNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d In this instance, the words that matter most are the ones we have placed in italics. According to legal scholars, these words were added out of a concern from the 1700s that American ambassadors, on the far side of the ocean, might be corrupted by gifts from rich European powers. Benjamin Franklin, for instance, had accepted a snuffbox festooned with 408 diamonds from the King of France. John Jay accepted a horse from the King of Spain. After that, the Emoluments Clause rarely came up again. It\u2019s never been the subject of a major court case and never been taken up by the Supreme Court, leaving great uncertainty about what it means \u2014 and to whom, exactly, it applies \u2014 in the 21st century. 2. Is President Trump violating the Emoluments Clause? That\u2019s uncertain. The group that filed Monday\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 whose attorneys include prominent ethics lawyers from the Barack Obama and George W. Bush White Houses \u2014 says Trump is in violation. Their logic is that the clause prohibits Trump from taking any money at all from a foreign state. To them, the clause prohibits not just straight-up gifts but also payments for services rendered. So it would prohibit a Trump-owned hotel from renting a ballroom to a foreign embassy and prohibit Trump Tower from renting out office space \u2014 as it already does \u2014 to a state-controlled Chinese bank . In their complaint, they ask a federal judge to stop Trump\u2019s businesses from taking those payments. \u201cA federal officeholder who receives something of value from a foreign power can be imperceptibly induced to compromise what the Constitution insists be his or her exclusive loyalty: the best interest of the United States of America,\u201d the group wrote in its legal filing. Trump and his attorneys have rejected that idea. Although Trump has promised to relinquish management of his companies to his two oldest sons and top executives, he will continue to own the businesses. His attorney said Trump will avoid running afoul of the Constitution because his businesses will not be accepting gifts from foreign countries, rather they\u2019ll be accepting payments, for services rendered. \u201cPaying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present,\u201d attorney Sheri Dillon said at a news conference before his inauguration . Dillon also sought to address a secondary concern \u2014 that foreign governments might turn those payments into gifts, by wildly overpaying Trump for a ballroom or a round of golf. Dillon said that Trump would turn over \u201cprofits\u201d from foreign governments at his hotels to the U.S. treasury. It is unclear, however, exactly how Trump\u2019s businesses would calculate that, because the Trump Organization hasn\u2019t provided any details on how such payments would be tracked, collected and dispersed. Is that enough? [ For foreign diplomats, Trump hotel is place to be ] \u201cToo many people are asserting more than they could possible know,\u201d said Seth Barrett Tillman, a lecturer on American law at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the Emoluments Clause. \u201cUntil the courts speak \u2014 particularly the Supreme Court \u2014 we don\u2019t know.\u201d 3.) Will the lawsuit work? That depends on what you mean by \u201cwork.\u201d Several legal experts have said they doubt a federal judge would give the watchdog group a full victory. One big question: Does the watchdog group even have \u201cstanding\u201d to sue Trump in the first place? \u201cJust complaining about bad government does not give rise to standing \u2014 or you or I would have standing to challenge just about anything that goes on.\u201d said Erik Jensen, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland . \u201cAnd the system just couldn\u2019t work.\u201d To have standing to sue, the watchdog group must show evidence it was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. The group says it can. The logic: Its workload has increased because Trump has given them new concerns to investigate. \u201cThe injury to the organization is that it\u2019s much more difficult to accomplish the organization\u2019s mission,\u201d said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor and former chief White House ethics lawyer for President Bush. He is one of the attorneys on the case and vice chairman of the watchdog group\u2019s board. \u201cBasically the administration has opened up a whole new avenue of corruption.\u201d Other legal scholars are skeptical about this. They say that nobody \u2014 especially not Trump \u2014 forced the watchdogs to work on this issue. \u201cThis injury is self-inflicted,\u201d Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, wrote on his blog Monday. Therefore, he said, the argument \u201cdoes not find support in the [Supreme Court\u2019s] caselaw.\u201d It\u2019s possible, however, that the lawsuit still could be a success for the watchdog group, even if a judge eventually rules against it. If the case progresses far enough, for instance, Trump\u2019s businesses might be forced to turn over documents that detail their dealings with foreign governments. Trump might be forced to turn over his tax returns, which he has refused to do. The watchdog group could then use those to unearth more details about Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest \u2014 learning more about who he does business with and whom he owes money to. [ Trump won\u2019t release his tax returns, adviser says, because people don\u2019t care ] 4.) Would somebody else have a stronger case? Among those best positioned to raise the issue legally, according to experts, are business competitors who can demonstrate that they\u2019ve lost clients or profits to Trump firms, particularly in cases where Trump\u2019s presidency benefits his company. Top on the list are hotels competing for that same foreign business, a group that includes investors from China, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as Washington-area developers and the D.C. government. The owners of competing luxury hotels in the District include a range of large institutional investors, many of them from abroad. The Four Seasons in Georgetown, which lost thousands of dollars in business when the Kuwaiti Embassy decided to hold its National Day celebration next month at Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, is majority-owned by Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese insurance giant affiliated with the Chinese government. The Four Seasons hosted the Kuwaiti event in previous years and initially planned to hold the 2017 event there as well. Although event organizers said they were under no political pressure to hold the celebration at Trump\u2019s hotel, that could place Anbang or another investor in the property, Chicago-based Strategic Hotels & Resorts, in position to take legal action. Four Seasons Georgetown spokeswoman Liliana Baldassari is among those who has familiarized herself with the Emoluments Clause in recent weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taking a look at it,\u201d she said. She declined to comment however on whether the hotel\u2019s owners would utilize it. Other hotel owners may have similar standing to raise the issue. The W Hotel nearby, also popular with the embassy crowd, is majority-owned by the UAE government, through a subsidiary of the Investment Corporation Of Dubai, a sovereign wealth fund. The St.\u00a0Regis Washington is owned by a subsidiary of a Qatari investment firm, Al Faisal Holding, that was founded and is controlled by the country\u2019s richest man, Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani. Suing the president, particularly one who freely uses Twitter to attack businesses and executives, would be a daunting effort for any business owner. For that reason, some experts expect attacks on Trump\u2019s business to originate with Democratic leaders or officials rather than competitors. In that case, there may be no Democrats better positioned to take aim at Trump over the Constitution than the District of Columbia\u2019s mayor, Muriel E. Bowser (D), or its attorney general, Karl A. Racine. Bowser and Racine may be loath to incite the new president, given the outsize influence the federal government has on the District\u2019s laws and budget rules. Bowser met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York after the election, and she said the president-elect told her that \u201che is a supporter of the District of Columbia, he\u2019s familiar with the District of Columbia, and he wants to be supportive.\u201d [ Trump is a D.C. \u2018supporter,\u2019 mayor says after meeting with president-elect ] But Bowser and Racine have a particular entree should they choose to pursue it: The D.C. government owns the land beneath the Marriott Marquis hotel and lent $383\u00a0million in taxpayer funds to the project. The District also owns the land under the Conrad Hotel, a luxury 360-room property that is under construction downtown and will compete directly with the Trump hotel when it opens in the first quarter of 2019. \u201cIf D.C. can allege that it has lost economically because of the benefits derived from the Trump violation of that Emoluments Clause, then D.C. could sue,\u201d argued Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Irvine School of Law and an American Constitution Society board member . \u201cAnd the way to do that would be to show that foreign governments are sending business to the Trump hotel that would otherwise go to D.C.\u2019s hotels.\u201d Bowser\u2019s chief of staff, John Falcicchio, declined to comment, citing legal advice. Racine is already engaged in litigation with Trump because the president has sued the District over his hotel\u2019s tax bill. Racine\u2019s spokesman, Robert Marus, issued a statement saying that \u201cgenerally speaking, we at the Office of the Attorney General will consider any viable legal claim that would advance the public interest of the District of Columbia. However, it would be inappropriate at this point to speculate on any litigation strategy or potential cause of action in a specific case, including any Emoluments Clause claim.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

By Greg Miller By Greg Miller January 23 at 7:15 PM Follow @gregpmiller Mike Pompeo was confirmed as CIA director by the Senate on Monday, putting the conservative Kansas congressman in charge of an agency that is bracing for its most contentious relationship with the White House in decades. As CIA director, Pompeo will be responsible for managing a global spying network at a time of escalating security problems, including renewed aggression from Russia, the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and the splintering terror threat posed by the Islamic State. But, at least initially, Pompeo\u2019s most vexing task may involve finding a way to establish a functional relationship between the CIA and President Trump. The new commander in chief traveled to CIA headquarters Saturday, in a trip that was an effort to create a fresh start with an agency he has frequently treated with contempt. Instead, what Trump delivered Saturday was largely a stream-of-consciousness airing of grievances, attacking Democrats and journalists. Trump skipped most of the daily intelligence briefings offered him after his surprise election victory. He has dismissed the agency\u2019s conclusions on critical issues, particularly its determination that Russia interfered in last year\u2019s election to help him win. Most recently, Trump accused intelligence officials of orchestrating a Nazi-like campaign to smear him. [ Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win ] Trump has expressed confidence in Pompeo, a businessman who served as a tank commander in the Army and graduated at the top of his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. \u201cIntelligence agencies are vital and very, very important,\u201d Trump said at his news conference this month. He singled out Pompeo, saying that his administration was \u201cputting in some outstanding people.\u201d His comments signaled that his hostility toward the agency might subside when his designated director is in charge. But CIA veterans say that Pompeo may face more fundamental challenges, including whether he will be listened to at the White House and able to insert hard information into debates presided over by a president who has suggested he sees information on WikiLeaks as more reliable than the contents of intelligence briefs. Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA and a supporter of Hillary Clinton during the campaign, said that he has \u201ccome to admire\u201d Pompeo after the two engaged in a series of conversations since Pompeo was tapped for the job. Morell said he expects Pompeo to arrive at the CIA without any preconceived notions, putting off any decisions until he has had a chance to survey its work. \u201cPompeo has two key challenges: winning over a workforce a bit skeptical of him . . . and making the CIA\u2019s voice heard at the Trump White House,\u201d Morell said. \u201cI know Pompeo, and he will succeed at the first challenge. The second will be the defining issue of his tenure as director.\u201d During his confirmation hearing, Pompeo vowed that he would defy Trump if ordered to direct the agency to resume brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects. He described the consensus view of U.S. spy agencies that Russia hacked the election in part to help Trump as a \u201csound\u201d judgment. He also said that he would \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d once installed in the CIA director\u2019s office on the agency\u2019s 7th floor. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Pompeo, 53, was a prominent member of the tea party in Congress, known for strident political views. He was a fierce critic of Clinton, a determined opponent of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran, and said at one point that he regarded the U.S. government\u2019s conduct in the attacks on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya, a political scandal that was \u201cworse in some ways\u201d than Watergate. But Pompeo has spent the post-election period seeking to reassure CIA officials and members of Congress that he is prepared to put aside that partisan persona and be an honest broker as director of the CIA. \u201cMy job,\u201d Pompeo said during his confirmation hearing, \u201cif confirmed, will be to change roles.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "advertisement With the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump reinstated a controversial rule that blocks foreign aid for family planning services. Known as the \"Mexico City policy\" or the \"Global Gag Rule,\" the policy bars foreign aid or federal funding for international programs that provide abortions \u2014 or even information about the procedure. Under the rule, USAID would be unable to provide funds to non-governmental organizations that provide referrals or counseling for abortion services, or advocate for the same. NGOs that provide abortions \u2014 except in the case of rape, incest or life endangerment \u2014 would also be ineligible for aid. Related: What Will Trump Presidency Mean for Women's Health Abroad? Much of the agency's family planning aid is aimed at reducing maternal and infant mortality, both through preventing unintended pregnancies and allowing families to better space childbirths. Established in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, the global gag rule has since become a political football that has been repeatedly rescinded and revived depending on which party controls the White House. Democratic President Bill Clinton nixed it. Republican President George W. Bush brought it back. Democratic President Barack Obama threw it out almost immediately after his inauguration. And now, Trump has reinstated it as part of what critics fear will be a broad effort to undermine reproductive rights at home and abroad. \u201cWe do expect it to cost women their lives.\u201d Pro-choice groups see the law's return as a step backwards after years of progress. Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equality, said that in addition to reducing women's access to contraceptives and safe abortions, the measure could hamper HIV prevention efforts abroad and force health clinics in developing countries to close their doors. Pro-choice advocates and anti-abortion advocates rally outside of the Supreme Court, March 2, 2016 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer / Getty Images, file \"This isn't just a reinstatement of an existing policy,\" Sippel said. \"I think how we're looking at it is: This is President Trump taking us back to 1984, and the world has changed very much since then. This is Trump's global gag rule, and we do expect it to cost women their lives.\" Pro-life groups, on the other hand, applauded the rule's return. Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, cited polls that showed a majority of Americans did not support the use of tax dollars for abortion services. Related: Pregnant Refugees Face Uncertain Future Among others, a July 2016 poll conducted by Marist College and commissioned by the Catholic Group Knights of Columbus found that 62% of Americans opposed or strongly opposed using tax dollars to fund abortions. Of the poll's respondents, 51% said they were pro-choice. \"For 40 years, the Hyde amendment has prevented the use of tax dollars from paying for abortion in the United States,\" Tobias said in a statement to NBC News. \"It is inconsistent with the Hyde Amendment to fund, with taxpayer dollars, organizations that perform abortions and promote the killing of unborn children in other countries.\" \u201cIt is inconsistent with the Hyde Amendment to fund, with taxpayer dollars, organizations that perform abortions\u2026\u201d The majority of U.S. family planning aid is disbursed by the United States Agency for International Development, which for 2017, has allocated $544 million of its $2.9 billion Global Health Programs budget to family planning and reproductive health services. USAID estimates there are 222 million women in the developing world without the ability to plan their families. According to the agency, the gap results in 53 million unwanted pregnancies each year. The majority of aid provided by USAID through the Global Health Programs is directed to countries in Africa and Asia, though a smaller number of European and South American nations receive aid as well. The law's renewal comes on the eve of the 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion under federal law. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would appoint conservative justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. In an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Trump said that should abortion be outlawed, he would support punishment for women who undergo the procedure. He later walked back the remark.

    "text": "'Net Neutrality' Foe Ajit Pai Is New FCC Head By tali arbel, ap technology writer NEW YORK \u0097 Jan 23, 2017, 5:51 PM ET 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump has picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era \"net neutrality\" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. In a statement Monday, Ajit Pai said he was grateful to the president for choosing him as the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Several reports last week had said he was the pick. Pai had been one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. There are currently just three members on the panel. The Republicans' new majority at the FCC, along with their control of Congress and the White House , is expected to help them roll back policies applauded by consumer advocates that upset many phone and cable industry groups, including net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from favoring some websites and apps over others. Pai, an active Twitter user, posted Monday that \"there is so much we can do together to bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans and to promote innovation and investment.\" AN INDUSTRY-FRIENDLY FCC Pai has long maintained that the FCC under former Chairman Thomas Wheeler had overstepped its bounds, suggesting that he would steer the agency in a direction more favorable to big phone and cable companies. In a December speech, he expressed confidence that the 2015 net neutrality rules would be undone and said the FCC needed to take a \"weed whacker\" to what he considered unnecessary regulations that hold back investment and innovation. Consumer advocates have been concerned that a deregulation-minded FCC could potentially allow more huge mergers, overturn new protections for internet users and lead to higher costs for media and technology companies that rely on the internet to reach consumers. Pai opposed online privacy regulations that force broadband providers to ask consumers for permission before using their data, saying they are more onerous than the requirements for internet companies like Google and Facebook. He voted against approving Charter Communication's $67 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller company, Bright House \u2014 not because he opposed the merger, but because he thought some of the conditions required by the FCC, like barring data caps on home internet service, amounted to government meddling in business. The cable industry's trade group, the NCTA, supported Pai in a statement Monday that said he has a \"common-sense philosophy that consumers are best served by a robust marketplace that encourages investment, innovation and competition.\" Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group, said Pai had a \"history of attacking consumer protections\" and urged him to keep the FCC's recent initiatives intact. The Internet Association, a trade group that represents tech and video companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix, had said last week that while Pai doesn't always side with the internet industry, \"he is both thoughtful and willing to listen.\" TO COME: PAI VS. THE ZERO RATING, MORE MERGERS? Pai also criticized an FCC report on \"zero rating\" earlier this month, characterizing it as a meaningless document that won't influence the FCC under Trump. The report, issued in the last days of the Obama administration, took issue with the way companies like AT&T; and Verizon exempted their own video services from wireless data caps, effectively making them cheaper to stream on phones and tablets than rival services such as Netflix. Future big media and telecom mergers may get a friendlier review under a Pai-led FCC. Pai voted to approve AT&T;'s 2015 acquisition of DirecTV. And while he told The Wall Street Journal in December 2013 that the Obama administration was likely to oppose Comcast's failed effort to acquire Time Warner Cable \u2014 he was right \u2014 he added that a Republican administration would be more likely to approve it. The FCC currently has a 2-1 Republican majority and two empty seats, which will be filled by one Republican and one Democrat. Pai, an Indian-American from Kansas, has been an FCC commissioner since 2012. During his roughly 15 years in government, he's been a Senate staffer and worked at the FCC and the Justice Department . He was also a lawyer for Verizon and an attorney at the law firm Jenner & Block. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "White House opens door to military cooperation with Moscow, but it would be illegal President Trump President Trump speaks at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., on Saturday. President Trump speaks at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., on Saturday. (Mandel Ngan / AFP/Getty Images) W.J. Hennigan Contact Reporter The White House indicated Monday that President Trump would be open to military cooperation with Russia to fight Islamic State , a move that would be a big policy change for the U.S. government, and one that would run afoul of current law.\u00a0 \u201cI think if there's a way that we can combat ISIS with any country, whether it's Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure, we'll take it,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, using an acronym for the militant group. U.S. military cooperation with the Russians\u00a0would upend the relationship between the two former\u00a0Cold War adversaries, which have been on the opposite sides in the Syrian conflict since the beginning of Russian military involvement more than a year ago. But a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act first passed by Congress late in 2014 and renewed since then strictly limits the Pentagon\u2019s ability to work with Russia. The law was passed in response to\u00a0Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its continued involvement in the Ukrainian civil war. Talks between the two countries' militaries have been severely limited since Congress passed the law, which\u00a0prohibits military cooperation until Russia has \u201cceased its occupation of Ukrainian territory and its aggressive activities that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\u201d The Pentagon and the Russian military established an emergency communications line\u00a0in October 2015 to ensure that the two nations' pilots do not mistakenly run into \u2014 or fire on \u2014 each other in their bombing runs over Syria. The two sides speak three times a week, U.S. officials said.\u00a0 U.S. planes have carried out thousands of airstrikes\u00a0in Syria against Islamic State as part of a coalition that has involved\u00a0NATO and Arab air forces. The coalition's strikes in Syria and in Iraq are coordinated each day by a U.S. command center in Qatar, where officials from dozens of countries are represented so each knows where others are operating. Russian aircraft have been conducting a separate air campaign to support Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country\u2019s\u00a0blood-soaked six-year civil war. Russia began bombing Syrian rebel positions in September 2015. When U.S. and Russian diplomats announced a temporary Syrian cease-fire agreement late last year, there was hope of additional communication between the two militaries. But that\u00a0truce effort quickly collapsed after a U.N. aid convoy was bombed by Russia and a U.S. airstrike hit a Syrian army base.\u00a0Each side\u00a0accused the other of bad faith. The Kremlin has repeatedly angled to collaborate further with the U.S. to share intelligence and targeting information in the Syrian war. Pentagon officials have\u00a0been uneasy about\u00a0any such arrangement because coordinating with Moscow would mean the U.S. would share responsibility for Russian actions.\u00a0 The Russian military has routinely bombed Syrian hospitals, schools, and civilian centers in addition to dropping cluster and incendiary weapons with impunity, according to U.S. officials, rebel groups in Syria and independent observers. Russia has hit few Islamic State targets, according to senior Pentagon officials. \u201cI think their activities in Syria have been backwards and counterproductive,\u201d former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in his final news conference Jan. 10. In a Senate hearing this month, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) accused the Russians of having committed \u201cwar crimes\u201d in Syria.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Monday, the Russian defense ministry said warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition had participated in a strike alongside Russian aircraft and that the U.S. had\u00a0relayed coordinates of Islamic State positions. The Pentagon quickly denied\u00a0the claim. \u201cThe Department of Defense is not coordinating airstrikes with the Russian military in Syria,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said in a statement.

Sarasota County Sheriff Tom Knight told reporters Monday that 46-year-old Deputy Frankie Bybee had befriended the victim, a 79-year-old Sarasota woman, while responding to a service call in October. Knight said when the woman entrusted Bybee -- an 18-year agency veteran -- with her dog, the deputy sold the dog through Craigslist. Knight said Bybee was placed on administrative leave earlier this month after the deputy\u2019s fingerprint was found on checks totaling $65,000 that the victim said had been fraudulently signed. Days later, Knight said Bybee attempted to kill the woman and make it look like a suicide.

Jail records didn\u2019t show whether he had an attorney. CBS Tampa affiliate WTSP reports the woman first reported the harassment two months after befriending the deputy. He reportedly took possession of the dog while she was in the hospital, and sold it without warning her. After alerting officials to Bybee fradulently cashing checks in her name, he allegedly tried to kill the woman by forcing her to take pills. Bybee allegedly then tried to cover up her death by leaving the door from her house to the garage open with the car running, fulling the home with carbon monoxide. \u201cIt is beyond unacceptable an individual who works in a postilion of trust and guardianship to their community and is capable of the heinous crimes like Frankie Bybee committed. It is a disgrace to this agency and to the law enforcement profession,\u201d Sheriff Knight said. \u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

They say the first three rows in front of the president were largely made up of supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u00a0 An official with knowledge of the make-up of the crowd says that there were about 40 people who\u2019d been invited by the Trump, Mike Pence and Rep. Mike Pompeo teams. The Trump team originally expected Rep. Pompeo, R-Kansas, to be sworn in during the event as the next CIA director, but the vote to confirm him was delayed on Friday by Senate\u00a0 Democrats. Also sitting in the first several rows in front of the president was the CIA\u2019s senior leadership, which was not cheering the remarks. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday denied that there were \u201cTrump or White House folks\u201d in the first rows.\u00a0 \u201cThere were no Trump or White House folks sitting down. They were all CIA (unintelligible). So, not in rows one-through-anything, from what I\u2019m told.\u201d Spicer said at the\u00a0 White House briefing Monday. He did not address whether Pompeo invitees were in the first rows. A source who is familiar with the planning of the president\u2019s CIA visit saw Spicer\u2019s briefing, however, and firmly denied Spicer\u2019s response was accurate. Officials acknowledge that Mr. Trump does have his supporters within the CIA workforce, many of whom were interspersed among the rank and file standing off to the president\u2019s right.\u00a0 There were about 400 members of the workforce who RSVP\u2019d for the event out of thousands who received an invitation in their email late last week. Officials dismiss White House claims that there were people waiting to get into the event. Intelligence sources say many in the workforce were stunned and at times offended by the president\u2019s tone which seemed to evolve into a version of speeches he\u2019d used on the campaign trail.\u00a0 The intelligence community sees itself as above politics even though as president-elect, Mr. Trump was critical of it and accused it of politically motivated leaks.\u00a0 The CIA was Mr. Trump\u2019s first official agency visit for a reason, it was to signal a new beginning. At the outset of the speech, the president expressed his support for the CIA, \u201cThere is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump.\u201d\u00a0 But it is what he said later in front of the CIA\u2019s revered Memorial Wall (a monument to CIA officers killed in the line of duty) -- complaints about the media\u2019s coverage of his relationship with the intelligence community and its assessments of the crowd size at his inauguration\u00a0-- \u00a0that may be harder to erase from the minds of the intelligence community.

    "text": "Email President Trump\u2019s first official trip was to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday. His speech there was supposed to smooth over any bad feelings with the intelligence community, but it may have done exactly the opposite. Before being sworn in as president, Mr. Trump reminded the intelligence community of the failures leading up to the war in Iraq and accused it of being the source of leaks, reports CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues. The speech Saturday didn\u2019t appear to mend fences, it left some current and former CIA officials stunned and angered. \u201cThere is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Despite that pledge of support, U.S. intelligence officials tell CBS News Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to CIA headquarters was \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d and that he \u201cmade relations with the intelligence community worse.\u201d\u00a0 During the speech in front of a memorial wall dedicated to fallen CIA officers, Mr. Trump blamed the media for creating drama between him and the agency. \u201cThey sort of made it sound like I had a feud with intelligence community. And I just want to let you know the reason you\u2019re the number-one stop, it is exactly the opposite,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think that sounded right. And in fact, we rated it false,\u201d Politifact editor Angie Holan said. Holan looked into President Trump\u2019s claims and found that over the last couple of months, Mr. Trump had been critical of the intelligence community, even saying at one point he didn\u2019t trust them. \u201cVery easy to use them, but I won\u2019t use them because they\u2019ve made such bad decisions,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview last August. He stepped up his criticism after all 17 intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government was behind a wave of cyberattacks to influence the election. \u00a0 \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Fox News Sunday in December 2016. ",

The actions, signed Monday at the White House , implement a federal employee hiring freeze, formally withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and reinstate a GOP-backed policy regarding foreign aid and abortion funding. A memorandum outlining the federal hiring freeze states that \"no vacant positions existing at noon on January 22, 2017, may be filled and no new positions may be created, except in limited circumstances.\" Play Trumps Signs Three Executive Orders, Including TPP Withdrawal 1:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170124012030if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/860769859737\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump noted that his long-promised action to shrink the federal government would not apply to the American military. Related: Why Trump Killed TPP \u2014 And Why It Matters To You Trump's action to nix the TPP trade deal with 11 Pacific Rim countries also fulfilled one of his most consistent campaign promises from the 2016 election. The trade agreement, backed by the Obama administration as part of a pivot toward strengthening economic ties with Asian nations, earned criticism from both Trump and his Democratic foe, Hillary Clinton, during their protracted general election fight. But pro-business groups and many of Trump's Republican allies have voiced support for the deal. Ultimately, the deal was never ratified by Congress and was unlikely to pass. In a statement, Republican Sen. John McCain called Trump's move \"a serious mistake that will have lasting consequences for America's economy and our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's opponent in the Democratic presidential primaries, applauded the move. The lawmaker has long been critical of international trade deals he views as harmful to American workers. \"I am glad the Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead and gone. For the last 30 years, we have had a series of trade deals \u2014 including the North American Free Trade Agreement, permanent normal trade relations with China and others \u2014 which have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs and caused a 'race to the bottom' which has lowered wages for American workers, \" Sanders said in a statement. \"If President Trump is serious about a new policy to help American workers then I would be delighted to work with him .\" President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., January 23, 2017. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images Trump also acted Monday to reinstate the so-named \"Mexico City policy\" first instituted by Ronald Reagan. That directive essentially barred recipients of U.S. foreign aid from promoting abortion as a method of family planning. In the early days of his presidency, Bill Clinton reversed the Reagan-backed policy; President George W. Bush reinstated it shortly after his election; and President Barack Obama revoked it - each in their first few days as president. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire plans to introduce legislation this week in the Senate that would permanently repeal the Mexico City policy. Trump's team has also indicated that he will take executive action soon to jump start his promised renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA \u2014 a trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico that was first enacted in 1994 \u2014 was one of Trump's top targets during his presidential campaign. Earlier on Monday, Trump suggested that companies that move outside of the United States should expect to face \"a substantial border tax.\" \"We want to start making our products again,\" he said. \"We don't want to bring them in, we want to make them here and that doesn't mean we don't trade, because we do trade, but we want to make our products here.\" On Friday, Trump announced his first executive order, which pledged to \"minimize the economic burden\" of Obamacare pending the law's eventual repeal.

Scott Walker is seen on the field at the Georgia Dome before the NFL football NFC championship game between the Green Bay Packers and the Atlanta Falcons Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017, in Atlanta. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is seen on the field at the Georgia Dome before the NFL football NFC championship game between the Green Bay Packers and the Atlanta Falcons Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017, in Atlanta. (Mark Humphrey / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Parents who work fewer than 80 hours a month could face food stamp benefit cuts under a proposal Gov. Scott Walker released Monday. Walker's proposal would also require adults with children between age 6 and 18 to attend job training and search for work five days a week. It was part of a package of welfare reforms called \"Wisconsin Works for Everyone\" that Walker released during a series of news conferences across the state. Under current state law, only childless adults in the FoodShare program have to meet the work requirement. They lose all food stamp benefits after three months of non-compliance. Since that law took effect in April 2015, about 21,000 able-bodied food stamp recipients have found work and about 64,000 have lost their benefits. Under Walker's new proposal, adults with children who don't meet the program's work requirements would face a \"partial\" reduction in benefits. Walker didn't say how much the loss in benefits could be. Walker is also calling for a similar work requirement for people receiving housing vouchers from the federal government. Democrats and child advocates blasted the move, saying it was counterproductive and would hurt more families than it would help. But Republican legislative leaders and the state chamber of commerce, which typically backs conservatives, praised the idea as giving incentives to put more people back to work. Walker's proposals could require law changes by Congress and waivers from President Donald Trump 's administration before taking effect. They would also have to pass the Republican-controlled state Legislature. Walker has been saying that he hopes to work closely with the Trump administration on a variety of initiatives, including welfare reform. Walker is expected to seek a third term in 2018 and will be spelling out his priorities for the next two years in the state budget he releases in February. Walker provided few details of the welfare reform package on Monday, saying those would come in the budget. Both of the new work requirements would begin as pilot programs, but Walker didn't say where. His outline also doesn't say how much the new requirements would cost. Walker said he also wants to ease people off receiving child-care assistance from the state once they become employed and start earning more money. Once someone becomes employed and hits 200 percent of the poverty line, they would start contributing $1 copay for child care for every $3 they earn. He also wants to expand programs to help people released from prison re-enter the workforce; create a tax credit to help young people aging out of foster care and those with disabilities who are working; and create a new tax credit for low-income parents who do not have custody of their children but are fulfilling their child support obligations. Walker is also calling on the Trump administration to clear the way for the state to drug test some welfare recipients. \"All of these with the idea that we want to get people to work,\" Walker said at a Milwaukee news conference. \"We fundamentally believe that public assistance should be a trampoline not a hammock.\" Walker said the new proposals are based on the fundamental principle that work is dignifying and connects people to society. \"We believe our public assistance programs should ask able-bodied adults to take steps toward self-sufficiency through work, while also providing comprehensive told to help them get a job and keep a job,\" Walker said in a statement. But Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jen Shilling said the proposal is another example of Walker setting a double standard, making it hard for poor families to get benefits while the state hands out millions of dollars in tax breaks to wealthy corporations \"with no strings attached.\" Walker said the proposals build off welfare reform championed by fellow Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson in 1996. Thompson was joining Walker on Monday to announce the plans. Walker promised in his State of the State speech earlier this month to be a national leader in welfare reform, just as Thompson was in the 1990s. Thompson left midway through his fourth term as governor in 2001 to become U.S. Department of Health Services secretary under then-President George W. Bush. Associated Press ",

The couple's 72-year marriage is the longest of any presidential couple in U.S. history, according to The Associated Press. \"They're therapy for each other,\" Doerr said of the Bushes' interaction in the hospital.

Wochit Beck Bennett as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump in sketch on Nov. 5, 2016. (Photo: Dana Edelson, NBC) Saturday Night Live's role\u00a0as an inexhaustible source of Trump mocking hit an obstacle Monday when one of the show's writers was suspended indefinitely for a tasteless tweet about President Trump's youngest child, 10-year-old Barron. \"Barron will be this country's first homeschool shooter,\" Katie Rich tweeted on Friday during the Trump inauguration celebrations. Rich's offensive remark was not the only jab\u00a0at the child but it stirred up a social-media storm.\u00a0Rich was deluged with angry responses, and not just from Trump supporters. Many tweeters demanded she be fired. POLL: Should SNL Writer Katie Rich Be Fired For Attacking Baron Trump? https://t.co/AqpNsJpTYV pic.twitter.com/RFUXPsmGCe \u2014 DonaldTrumpNews (@NewssTrump) January 22, 2017 Her bosses at SNL weren't happy, either. She was suspended immediately after her tweet for an indefinite period, according to a source familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. Rich, 33, and a SNL writer since 2013, deleted her Twitter account after the pushback but\u00a0revived it Monday afternoon to post an apology. \"I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry,\" it said. I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry. \u2014 Katie Rich (@katiemaryrich) January 23, 2017 The Rich debacle played out on the same day that SNL announced that\u00a0Alec Baldwin \u2014 lately most famous for his taunting Trump\u00a0impressions \u2014 would get another chance to lampoon him when he hosts the show's\u00a0Feb. 11 episode for a record-breaking 17th time. Baldwin's impersonation,\u00a0repeatedly tweet-condemned by Trump (\"Totally biased, not funny...just can't get any worse. Sad.\"), features the actor in a custom-made Trump wig and tan makeup. He's opened the show\u00a0 multiple times this season , often joined by\u00a0Kate McKinnon's as Trump amanuensis Kellyanne Conway\u00a0and\u00a0Beck Bennett as bare-chested Vladimir Putin. Baldwin has vowed to stop his mockery only when the president releases his tax returns. ",

(Photo: NOAA) The USA's newest weather satellite \u2014 GOES-16 \u2014 has sent back its first images of our planet, federal scientists\u00a0announced Monday. The photos are of weather and the Earth in high detail \u2014 at four times the image resolution of existing spacecraft.\u00a0It's like \"high-definition from the heavens,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u00a0said in a statement.

This means it\u00a0hovers in the same spot above the planet, about 22,000 miles above the equator. It moves as the Earth rotates. In May, NOAA will announce the final planned location for GOES-16. By November 2017, GOES-16 will be operational as either GOES-East or GOES-West. NOAA will use the satellite\u2019s six new instruments to generate new or improved meteorological, solar\u00a0and space weather products. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "By Jenna Johnson By Jenna Johnson January 23 at 3:46 PM Follow @wpjenna White House spokesman Sean Spicer promised reporters to always be truthful in his role as White House press secretary and addressed misstatements he made about Metro ridership on Inauguration Day. (Reuters) White House press secretary Sean Spicer acknowledged Monday that there were some problems with the\u00a0explanation he gave over the weekend for why he considers President Trump's inauguration audience the largest ever, but he continued to stand by the assertion. Spicer said figures he provided Saturday about the number of trips taken on Metro during the inauguration were at odds with numbers provided by the Metro system itself. He said the numbers he used were not made up but were given to him by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which received them from an \u201coutside agency.\u201d [ Sean Spicer\u2019s defense of himself and explanation of Donald Trump\u2019s sensitivity, annotated ] Beyond the number of people at the ceremony in Washington on Friday, Spicer\u00a0clarified that his definition of a viewing audience does not just include\u00a0those standing on the Mall or watching on television but also the \u201ctens of millions\u201d who watched online. \u201cIt's unquestionable,\u201d Spicer said of his argument that Trump's inauguration had the largest viewing audience, although he did not provide exact numbers or comparisons with previous inaugurations to back up his assertion. \u201cAnd I don't see any numbers that dispute that when you add up attendance, viewership, total audience in terms of tablets, phones, on television. I'd love to see any information that proves that otherwise.\u201d [ Analysis: There\u2019s no evidence that Trump\u2019s inauguration was the most-watched in history. Period. ] Spicer did not address some of the other questionable data points he listed on Saturday, when he summoned the press corps to deliver a statement criticizing coverage of Trump's inauguration while\u00a0arguing Trump had \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\u201d While criticizing the media for reporting crowd counts, because the U.S. Park Service does not provide them, Spicer insisted that when the president took the oath of office, there were 720,000 people sitting in three sections on the Mall. He implied that aerial photos of the crowd, which appeared to show a far smaller turnout than for former president Barack Obama's first inauguration, could not be trusted because\u00a0a white ground covering\u00a0was used, accentuating empty spaces.\u00a0Spicer left the Saturday briefing without taking questions from reporters. On Monday, Spicer took dozens of questions from reporters during a briefing that lasted more than 90 minutes. He opened the\u00a0briefing \u2014 his first official one \u2014 by vaguely joking about his controversial statements over the weekend and saying his Twitter feed proves he is not the most popular press secretary. But soon, a reporter pressed Spicer on what happened and asked whether he plans as press secretary to always be truthful and never knowingly say something that isn't factual. \u201cOur intention is never to lie to you,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cYou're in the same boat: I mean, there are times when you guys tweet something out or write a story and you publish a correction. That doesn't mean that you were intentionally trying to deceive readers and the American people, does it? And I think that we should be afforded the same opportunity. \u201cThere are times when we believe something to be true or we get something from an agency or we act in haste because the information available wasn't complete, but our desire to communicate with the American people and make sure that you have the most complete story at the time, and so we do it. But, again, I think that when you look net-net, we're going to do our best every time we can. I'm going to come out here and tell you the facts as I know them, and if we make a mistake, I'll do our\u00a0best to correct it.\u201d Spicer continued to push reporters to hold\u00a0themselves to the same levels of accountability that they hold the White House. He again pointed to an inaccurate report Friday night by a reporter who mistakenly thought the bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. When it was revealed that the bust was still there, the reporter quickly issued a correction and an apology to his colleagues. Spicer responded on Twitter on Friday: \u201cApology accepted.\u201d \u201cWe had a tweet go out about Martin Luther King \u2014 think about how racially charged that is,\u201d Spicer said Monday. \u201cAnd someone\u00a0rushes out and says to the entire press corps that the president of the United States has removed the bust from his office.\u201d Spicer said that while the reporter apologized to his colleagues, \u201cWhere was the apology to the president of the United States? Where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive that was. Where was that apology?\u201d politics ",

Eric Draper/AP hide caption toggle caption Eric Draper/AP Former U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., has been selected as President Trump's nominee for secretary of the Air Force. Eric Draper/AP President Trump has announced his pick for secretary of the Air Force \u2014 former Rep. Heather Wilson. If confirmed, Wilson would be the first Air Force Academy graduate to hold the position, according to the White House. Wilson currently leads the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, a public college focused on engineering and science. She represented New Mexico in Congress from 1998 to 2009. \"She served as an Air Force officer in Europe during the Cold War and on the National Security Council Staff under President George H.W. Bush during the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact,\" according to a statement from the White House. She also obtained a doctorate from Oxford during her time as a Rhodes scholar. \"Heather Wilson is going to make an outstanding Secretary of the Air Force,\" Trump said in the statement. \"Her distinguished military service, high level of knowledge, and success in so many different fields gives me great confidence that she will lead our nation's Air Force with the greatest competence and integrity.\" Article continues after sponsorship Wilson, a Republican, lost Senate bids in 2008 and 2012. NPR reported in 2012 that she \"touted her moderate credentials\" during the campaign. As NPR's Greg Myre reports, Wilson would take over the Air Force as it is conducting major airstrike campaigns in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Reducing costs are likely to be one of the first items of business, Greg adds. \"And Trump has taken aim at the biggest new Air Force program \u2014 the F-35 Lightning II.\" Wilson, who is a pilot, vowed to strengthen the Air Force: \"America and our vital national interests continue to be threatened,\" she said in the White House announcement. \"I will do my best, working with our men and women in the military, to strengthen American air and space power to keep the country safe.\" ",

USA TODAY President Trump holds up an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership after signing it alongside White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus in the Oval Office Monday. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) 8486 CONNECT TWEET 8 LINKEDIN 457 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Trump signed three presidential directives Monday, withdrawing U.S. support for a Pacific trade deal, imposing a hiring freeze in civilian agencies, and restoring and expanding the so-called Mexico City policy that prohibits U.S. aid from supporting international groups that promote abortion. Along with an executive order signed Friday on Obamacare and another White House memo freezing unpublished Obama-era regulations,\u00a0Trump's first-week executive actions signal a U-turn from signature Obama administration policies. But they also show a determination to put his own stamp on the executive branch, and assert\u00a0a muscular presidential role in trade policy. \"Everybody knows\u00a0what I'm about to do,\" Trump said before withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal signed by the Obama administration but not ratified by the Senate. \"We\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time.\u00a0A great thing for the American worker, what we just did.\" After meeting with union leaders later in the day, Trump called it \"a very powerful document\" and promised an end to multi-nation trade pacts. \"We're going to have trade but we're going to have it one-on-one, and if somebody misbehaves, we're going to send them a letter of termination, 30 days, and they'll either straighten it out or we're gone,\" he said. \"Not one of these deals where we can't get out of them. It's a disaster.\" The Mexico City policy, referred to as the \"global gag rule\" by abortion rights groups, was first adopted by President Ronald Reagan\u00a0in 1984 and has been subject to presidential ping-pong ever since. Democratic presidents repeal it as one of their first acts in office; Republicans reinstate it. In restoring the Mexico City policy, Trump reinstated Reagan-Bush language that \"taxpayer funds appropriated pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act should not be given to foreign nongovernmental organizations that perform abortions or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\" But Trump also went a step further, applying the ban to \"global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies\" \u2014 not just family planning programs by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. And he included new language banning the use of taxpayer funds to support organizations that participate in \"coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\" \"There's one big, big thing that this does,\" said Jen Kates, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which takes no position on the policy. \"Bush made it clear\u00a0that the policy didn't apply to non-family planning money. So this is a big expansion of the restriction.\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the policy should not have come as a surprise. \"The president has made it no secret that he's a pro-life president,\" Spicer said. \"He wants to stand up for all American's including the unborn and I think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value but respects taxpayer funding as well.\" The federal hiring freeze is in line with a similar freeze by Reagan on his first day. Trump made exceptions for military, national security and public safety positions, as well as others deemed \"otherwise necessary\" by the Office of Personnel Management. \"Control\u00a0over the administrative\u00a0state is key\u00a0to presidential power,\" said Andrew Rudalevige, a Bowdoin College professor who studies presidential power. \"It\u2019s important\u00a0for president\u00a0to get an early grasp on what they control.\" None of the directives were executive orders, but rather presidential memoranda. Sometimes known as \" executive orders by another name ,\" presidential memoranda became President Obama's executive power tool of choice, signing more of them than any president in history even as he tempered use of executive orders. Trump already signed his first executive order on Friday, directing agencies to allow more flexibility to states, companies and consumers in carrying out the Affordable Care Act while the Republican-controlled Congress works to repeal it.

It is 22,300 miles above Earth. The 16 in its name refers to its imaging device , which measures 16 different \"spectral bands,\" including two that are visible to the human eye and 14 that we experience as heat. It is significantly more advanced than the current GOES satellite, which measures only five spectral bands. GOES-16 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in December and is a collaboration between NOAA and NASA. When it is fully up and running, the satellite will \"provide images of weather pattern and severe storms as frequently as every 30 seconds, which will contribute to more accurate and reliable weather forecasts and severe weather outlooks,\" according to its mission overview page . Enlarge this image GOES-16 captured this view of the moon while looking across the surface of the Earth on Jan. 15.

One of our GOES-16 scientists compared this to seeing a newborn baby's first pictures \u2014 it's that exciting for us.

The satellite will not be fully operational until November, says a spokesman for NOAA's satellite division. Between now and then, the agency will have to decide where to park GOES-16. There are two choices: the Eastern U.S., or the Western part of the country. NOAA was not able to immediately explain its criteria for determining which part of the country will get the new technology's weather forecasting benefits. YouTube A second, similar satellite known as GOES-17 is being tested in Colorado, and NOAA says it expects it to begin operating about nine months after GOES-16. ",

    "text": "The White House press secretary signals he'll be as sensitive to media coverage as his boss Sean Spicer Holds Daily Press Briefing At The White House Alex Wong / Getty Images White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. (Alex Wong / Getty Images) Noah Bierman Contact Reporter President Trump\u2019s top spokesman gave an unusually raw assessment of his boss\u2019s views about the media Monday. Even after moving into the White House , the new leader of the free world doesn\u2019t appear to have gotten over the slights of not being taken seriously. Trump finds what\u2019s written and said about him\u00a0frustrating, disillusioning,\u00a0demoralizing and undermining to his credibility, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters gathered for his first formal briefing. \u201cIt's not about one tweet. It's not about one picture. It's about a constant theme,\u201d Spicer said in a lengthy monologue.\u00a0\u201cIt's about sitting here every time and being told, \u2018No.\u00a0Well, we don't think he can do that.\u00a0He'll never accomplish that.\u00a0He can't win that.\u00a0It won't be the biggest.\u00a0It's not gonna be that good. The crowds aren't that big. He's not that successful.\u2019\"\u00a0 Spicer spent more time on the subject than on any other issue during a briefing of more than an hour in which he was asked about such weighty topics as the U.S. Embassy in Israel, immigration and tax reform. Of course, presidents and their staffs have been complaining\u00a0about the press long before the advent of Twitter or\u00a0television. Usually, they gripe to reporters privately while accepting that the intense scrutiny is part of the job. But it\u2019s\u00a0seldom discussed publicly, in so much detail, with so much anguish and\u00a0so soon after a president has taken office. And it helps explain why Trump has sparred so vigorously with the press over the size of the crowds at his inauguration,\u00a0sending Spicer out Saturday to falsely assert they were the biggest ever, rather than move on to more substantive battles over policy. Trump comes into office with the lowest approval ratings for a new president in decades. His clashes with the media, which helped fuel his rise but have been his foil in rallying his anti-establishment base, promise to remain a constant in his administration. One of his most influential\u00a0advisors, Stephen Bannon, until recently ran Breitbart News, a conservative website that feeds off its antagonism of the mainstream media. Another top advisor, Kellyanne Conway, coined the phrase \u201calternative facts\u201d on Sunday to explain why Trump and his aides were, once again, at odds with fact-checkers. In making his case that Trump has been mistreated, Spicer reached back to doubts expressed by pundits that began before Trump ran for president. Spicer keyed in on primary battles where he said Trump\u00a0was underestimated.\u00a0He complained about an erroneous news report, which had to be corrected, that Trump removed a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. from the White House. And he painted a vivid picture of a man staring out at a sea of supporters during the inauguration Friday, only to feel stung later that he wasn\u2019t given enough credit for his popularity. \u201cIt's an amazing view,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd then to hear, \u2018Well, look at this shot,\u2019\u00a0and ... \u2018It wasn't that big.\u2019\u00a0It's a little demoralizing because when you're sitting there and you're looking out and you're in awe of just how awesome that view is and how many people are there and you go back and you turn on the television and you see shots of comparing this and that.\u201d Even as Spicer struck a more conciliatory tone with the media on Monday than he did over the weekend, smiling often and exchanging banter, he continued to insist he had not misled\u00a0in his attempts Saturday to assert that more people viewed Trump\u2019s inauguration than any other in history. White House veterans from President Obama \u2019s staff had little sympathy for Spicer, even as they agreed the glare of the press can be harsh on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \u201cWelcome to the major leagues,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama communications advisor, in an email. And they found it rich that Trump, who grew his political following by questioning Obama\u2019s legitimacy and American birthplace, is now complaining that others are trying to undercut his credibility as president. \u201cThis is your prize,\u201d said Bill Burton, another Obama alumnus.\u00a0\u201cYou can complain about it for the next four years or you can accept the fact there is a press corps\u00a0that is going to write things that you don\u2019t agree with on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\u00a0 But Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for George W. Bush, said he thought Spicer and Trump were voicing a frustration felt by many Republicans, who believe the press has a liberal bias and a particular grudge against Trump. Fleischer had been critical of Spicer\u2019s performance Saturday, where he felt Spicer was on thinner ground, but he gave the press secretary high marks Monday. \u201cIn the past, a lot of Republicans\u00a0have thought what Trump thinks, and then they bite their tongue,\u201d Fleischer said.\u00a0\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t bite his tongue.\u201d Caption Huge crowds converge on Washington, D.C., for Women's March on Washington Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Caption Huge crowds converge on Washington, D.C., for Women's March on Washington Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Caption Thousands stream into downtown L.A. for women's march Thousands converge on downtown Los Angeles to march for women's rights Thousands converge on downtown Los Angeles to march for women's rights Caption Recap: Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C.

Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson was still conducting an investigation after the lockdown was lifted and employees were allowed to go back to their duties. The lockdown also affected two schools that are on the base, but both schools said students were accounted for and safe. Davis-Monthan is home to the 355th Fighter Wing, which provides training and deploys the A-10 jet. Officials sent an email to base personnel shortly after 10 a.m. MST with the word \"LOCKDOWN\" written three times in capital letters, followed by an alert of an \"active shooter.\" They later said in a news release that reports of gunshot sounds were unconfirmed. About 6,500 active duty military and 1,000 Reserve and Air National Guard personnel work on the base, along with about 3,000 civilians. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to say all the students were accounted for, not unaccounted for. 0 Shares ",

Edward Majerczyk, right, leaves the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Sept. 27, 2016, after pleading guilty to charges that he hacked into hundreds of email accounts, including many female celebrities, whose nude photos were displayed online. (Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A Chicago man is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday for his role in the \"Celebgate\" hacking scandal that resulted in dozens of nude photos of celebrities being posted online, including actress Jennifer Lawrence, model Kate Upton and U.S. soccer star Hope Solo. Edward Majerczyk, 29, likely faces nine months in prison under a deal worked out with federal prosecutors. He pleaded guilty last September to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, a charge that carries a maximum of five years in prison. His lawyer, Thomas Needham, said in a recent court filing that at the time Majerczyk took part in the now-infamous hack, he was \"suffering from depression and looked to pornography websites and Internet chat rooms in an attempt to fill some of the voids and disappointment he was feeling in his life.\" A self-described computer nerd, Majerczyk, of the Southwest Side, was accused of using a phishing scheme to illegally gain access to more than 300 Apple iCloud and Gmail accounts from November 2013 to August 2014, including at least 30 belonging to celebrities in the Los Angeles area. According to his plea agreement, Majerczyk sent emails to victims that appeared to be from security accounts of internet service providers seeking the victims' usernames and passwords. For those who provided that private information, he then illegally accessed their email accounts and obtained \"personal information including sensitive and private photographs and videos,\" the plea deal said. Majerczyk was not accused of selling the material or posting any of it online himself. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said in September that the investigation into who leaked the sensitive information was ongoing. Timothy Justen French had already been warned once by the FBI to stay away from computer hacking when he was caught in an online chat two years ago talking about his desire to hit higher-profile targets, including city traffic grids and government intelligence satellites, federal prosecutors say. ... ... (Jason Meisner) As many as 100 celebrities were targeted as part of Celebgate, including Kirsten Dunst as well as Upton and her boyfriend, Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. Many of the embarrassing and intimate photos were posted on websites like Reddit.com and 4chan.org. Also targeted was the Oscar-winning actress Lawrence, who broke down at a meeting with federal agents in September 2014 about nude photos of her that had been splashed on the internet as part of Celebgate. \"She became very distraught and I had to stop the interview at one point because of her emotional reaction to the information being discussed,\" an FBI agent wrote in a court filing about the meeting with Lawrence in Los Angeles. \"(She) stated she was having an anxiety attack, and was visibly shaken.\" In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2014, Lawrence called the breach of her privacy a \"sex crime.\" \"I was just so afraid. I didn't know how this would affect my career,\" Lawrence told the magazine. \"Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this. It does not mean that it comes with the territory.\" Celebrity photo hacking tied to Chicago address U.S. authorities investigating the 'Celebgate'\u00a0photo-hacking scandal have seized computers and cellphones from a small home in Chicago, according to court documents.

Needham said in his sentencing memo that Majerczyk was \"deeply affected\" by the fallout of the Celebgate scandal and had to see a therapist for anxiety and panic attacks. The son of two Chicago police officers, Majerczyk was working at the time as a customer service representative for ComEd. He also has an 11-year-old son who lives with the boy's mother, Needham said.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 23, 2017 7:29 PM EST WASHINGTON -- When President Trump left CIA headquarters on Saturday, a couple of steps behind him was his national security adviser -- retired General Michael Flynn.\u00a0 Retired General Michael Flynn, who is President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Close CBS Evening News CBS News has learned that U.S. investigators have been looking into at least one phone call -- in late December --\u00a0 between Flynn and Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States , Sergey Kislyak. The call came just as the Obama administration expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and announced sanctions in response to the wave of election cyberattacks . On December 30, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested on Russian television that the Kremlin would retaliate by expelling American diplomats -- but shortly thereafter, President Vadimir Putin sent out a note saying that he would not kick U.S. diplomats out of the country, and instead talked about \u201crestoring Russian-U.S. relations... based on the policies of the Trump administration.\u201d President-elect Trump then responded in a tweet: \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) -- I always knew he was very smart!\u201d Investigators are trying to determine whether the Trump team was coordinating with the Russians leading up to and after the election. So far, sources say, they have found no evidence of wrongdoing. Today, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador covered four topics. \u201cOne was the loss of life that occurred in the plane crash that took their military choir,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cTwo was Christmas and holiday greetings. Three was to talk about a conference in Syria on ISIS . And four was to set up -- to talk about -- after the inauguration -- setting up a call between President Putin and President Trump.\u201d\u00a0 Flynn is not the only Trump associate being scrutinized. Sources tell CBS News investigators are also trying to determine if others shared sensitive U.S. information with Russia, including corporate trade secrets, and if any criminal laws were broken. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order Monday announcing the U.S. will withdraw from negotiating the TPP, or Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. \"Great thing for the American worker, what we just did,\" he told the press corps after signing, as his chief adviser Steve Bannon, former executive editor of the alt-right platform Breitbart.com, looked on with a tight grin. During a campaign stop in Ohio this summer, Trump said, \"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country.\" From left, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, National Trade Council adviser Peter Navarro, Senior Adviser Jared Kushner, policy adviser Stephen Miller, and chief strategist Steve Bannon watch as President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House, Jan. 23, 2017, in Washington. Evan Vucci / AP As divisive as that language sounds, whoever got into the White House was likely to ditch the TPP. Hillary Clinton, adopting a progressive issue from Bernie Sanders, also came out against the deal during her run, saying in August, \"I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election and I'll oppose it as president.\" So what was the TPP, and why did some people hate it so much \u2014 on both the right and the left? Jobs Created and Destroyed The Trans-Pacific Partnership, pushed hard by the Obama administration, was essentially an attempt to create a single market for the U.S. and 11 countries that border the Pacific Ocean, including Canada, Mexico, and Chile. The idea was to make goods flow more freely and cheaply between all partners \u2014 who together represented one third of global trading. Specifically, the TPP's largest goal was to maintain U.S. trade dominance in Asia, bringing the various trading partners under America's wing as a way to ward off China's growing economic influence, said MSNBC business correspondent Ali Velshi.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said this month that the unemployment rate for December was 4.7 percent, up slightly from 4.6 percent the month before. Spicer first said there are \"several versions\" of those figures. Trump \"sees people that are hurting\" and \"it's not just a number to him,\" Spicer said. He said the president's \"not focused on statistics\" but rather \"if people are doing better off.\" \"I think that's where his head is at,\" he said, charging that questions over unemployment have previously \"been about what number we're looking at instead of what face we're looking at.\" During the campaign, Trump repeatedly dismissed the declining unemployment rate, charging it was \"fiction\" and that the economic reality faced by many Americans was much worse. U.S. Open to Working With Russia on Fighting ISIS Spicer said the U.S was open to working with Russia to combat ISIS. \"I think if there's a way that we can combat ISIS with any country, whether its Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure, we'll take it,\" he said. However, while the U.S. has an open channel of communication with the Russian military on such matters as ensuring aircrew safety and de-confliction operations in Syria \"the Department of Defense is not coordinating airstrikes with the Russian military in Syria,\" U.S. Marine Corps Major Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, told NBC News in a statement. Play ",

Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images Ajit Pai, the senior Republican at the Federal Communications Commission, is slated to be the agency's new chairman. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images Ajit Pai, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, will be the country's new chief telecommunications regulator. He's a proponent of limited government and a free-market approach to regulations. Pai's promotion within the FCC under the administration was long rumored and confirmed on Monday by his office. In a statement, Pai said he looked forward \"to working with the new Administration, my colleagues at the Commission, members of Congress, and the American public to bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans.\" On Twitter, Pai also added : \"There is so much we can do together to bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans and to promote innovation and investment. From broadband to broadcast, I believe in a 21st-century version of Jefferson's 2nd Inaugural: we are all Republicans, we are all Democrats.\" U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Net Neutrality Rules In Full Pai is a longtime Washington lawyer who has worked in the Senate, at the Justice Department and the FCC and had a stint at Verizon before becoming an FCC commissioner in 2012. As a regulator, he voted reliably against many policy proposals by former Democratic Chairman Tom Wheeler, including the contentious and high-profile move to establish so-called net neutrality rules. Under Wheeler, the FCC moved to impose the no-blocking, no-throttling and no-discrimination rules on Internet service providers in a way that put them under the strictest-ever regulatory regime. (The agency's Democratic majority later moved to leverage new oversight powers to set the first privacy restrictions for the ISPs, which Pai opposed.) Though the net neutrality rules \u2014 after years in limbo \u2014 have now been affirmed in court , Pai and his fellow Republican FCC commissioner Mike O'Rielly have indicated plans to revisit those Internet regulations as well as other FCC rules. Article continues after sponsorship \"In the months to come, we also need to remove outdated and unnecessary regulations,\" Pai said in a speech in December . \"The regulatory underbrush at the FCC is thick. We need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.\" The FCC is an independent five-member commission whose majority usually flips in party affiliation depending on the party of the president, who nominates the members. With a Republican majority under Pai \u2014 who has often made the case for industry-led solutions \u2014 the FCC is expected to chart a deregulatory and fiscally conservative approach. As The New York Times points out , Pai's view of competition in telecommunications drastically differs from that of his predecessor: \"Mr. Pai has said web firms such as Google and Facebook are competitors to wireless, cable and broadcast companies in voice calls, messaging and streaming video. The F.C.C. under Mr. Wheeler, Mr. Pai said, strapped too many rules on internet service providers without providing real evidence that consumers were harmed without regulations.\" As commissioner, Pai put personal focus on several telecom issues, including a push to connect more rural communities to high-speed Internet and a quest to help struggling AM radio stations. His FCC speeches were also known for clever pop culture references. In statements, industry groups praised Pai for his integrity and forward-thinking leadership. Consumer advocacy groups decried him as reactionary and pro-industry. \"While he doesn't always agree with our industry on every issue, he is both thoughtful and willing to listen,\" the Internet Association chief, Michael Beckerman, said.

    "text": "After tweets insulting women marchers, school board member resigns Dathan Paterno Jennifer Johnson and Tony Briscoe Contact Reporters Tribune Newspapers A Park Ridge - Niles School District 64 board member has resigned over comments he made on Twitter in which he used an offensive term for women to describe participants in Saturday's Women's March. In a letter shared by District 64 Superintendent Laurie Heinz on Monday morning, Dr. Dathan Paterno announced his immediate resignation from the board, citing recent posts from his personal Twitter account. \"I wrote some provocative tweets re: the recent women's marches,\" the letter says. \"In retrospect, they were inappropriate and pushed too far in some ways. While I merely meant to harshly criticize some of the protestors (especially the very angry, hostile, vulgar and violent ones) and question the motives of some of them, my tweets were understandably misinterpreted to mean that I disrespect or hate all the protestors. Of course, this isn't true, but the damage was done.\" D64 tweet In one of the tweets, which was posted Sunday morning, Paterno, a clinical psychologist with Park Ridge Psychological Services in Uptown Park Ridge, wrote, \"Most of these vagina screechers didn't vote, but they mean business. Riiiiiiiight. What a farce.\" Later, in response to a comment that referred to the tweet as \"an interesting way for someone on the School District 64 board to speak about women,\" Paterno replied that he was \"referring very specifically to the hyper-angry women dressed in vagina costumes.\" In a separate tweet, Paterno wrote, \"Alas, the 300 million pound Women March provides a strong argument for doing away with women's suffrage.\" D64 tweet Paterno's Twitter account has since been deleted. Reached via email on Monday, Paterno responded to the controversy. \"My harsh and inappropriate comment was not about most of the women who marched,\" he said in the email. \"I'm sure that the vast majority of women were civil, appropriate, self-controlled, and had noble intentions. But enough did not \u2014 I saw and heard plenty \u2014 and I was upset by that. Many who are now castigating me are suggesting that this represents my general view of women, which is far from the truth. At the same time, I recognize that some people are genuinely hurt by my comments; for that, I am truly sorry. That was never my intention. \"Even though my comments were foolish, they mirror or are less vulgar than many of the placards viewed and some of the speeches given in D.C. I think there is a double standard at work here which is fundamentally unfair.\" Stephanie Murphy, a Park Ridge parent who was planning to attend Monday's school board meeting with a group of other parents, said she was pleased with Paterno's resignation. Women's March on Chicago Hundreds of thousands of people march through the streets during the Women's March on Chicago\u00a0on Jan. 21, 2017. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) Hundreds of thousands of people march through the streets during the Women's March on Chicago\u00a0on Jan. 21, 2017. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) See more videos Prior to the announcement of Paterno's resignation, a number of parents told the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate they planned to attend tonight's meeting of the District 64 school board to express their anger over Paterno's comments. \"I was highly offended,\" said Elena Demos, the mother of a Roosevelt Elementary School student. \"I marched in the Women's March on Chicago, and I don't appreciate being called a 'vagina screecher.' And I did vote.\" \"It's offensive and abusive language,\" said parent Steve Kopka. \"If a child in a District 64 school said this, they would be suspended \u2014 and rightly so. And here is somebody who (is) supposedly representing our students and our education system. I couldn't believe it.\" Paterno's four-year term on the school board ends in April, and he was not running for re-election. He was in his first term as a board member. Paterno was among the group of seven candidates who ran for four open seats on the Board of Education in April 2013. Of the four elected, he received the fewest votes, with 3,860 ballots cast in his favor. District 64 School Board President Anthony Borrelli said the district would be releasing a statement later on Monday. He said he did not read Paterno's Twitter comments, but did say that Paterno did not violate any school board rules pertaining to the use of social media because he was posting on his personal Twitter page. On the website of Park Ridge-Niles School District 64, the Board of Education operating principles includes, \"refrain from speaking negatively about others,\" and \"use social media in a positive way only to express individual (not entire Board) citizen views.\" Fred Sanchez, a candidate running for the District 64 school board this April, denounced Paterno's comments in a Facebook posting on his candidate page. \"No one with integrity would talk about women this way,\" he wrote. \"This board desperately needs more honesty, integrity, transparency and accountability.\" Paterno has been a licensed clinical psychologist since 2006 and has no record of discipline, according to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. His license is due to expire in September 2018. He is the founder and clinical director of Park Ridge Psychological Services, a mental health counseling service for all ages, according to the business' website. According to the website's biography of Paterno, he has a background in assessing attention deficit disorder and calls a \"myth\" the idea that emotional disorders are the result of genetics or biochemical imbalances. Paterno also \"denies that psychotropic medications are necessary, effective, or generally safe,\" the website says, adding that he prefers \"non-medical alternatives, which have been proven \u2014 in an ever-expanding body of research and also in his professional experience \u2014 to be largely more effective, safe, and humane.\" In the days since his Twitter posts, a number of people upset by the social media remarks lowered his business' rating on Yelp, published screen shots of the tweets and took him to task for the comments. \"From Dr. Paterno's twitter comments, I would be hesitant about taking a child in for counseling services,\" one Yelp reviewer wrote on Monday. \"I wouldn't want this man influencing my children, and find it surprising that he even still has a practice. Do your research before consulting with him.\" This isn't the first time Paterno has shared a strongly worded and potentially controversial opinion as a school board member. In late 2015, after a transgender student in nearby Palatine-based High School District 211 filed a complaint with the American Civil Liberties Union for full access to the girls locker room, Paterno weighed in on a show called \"American Trends,\" hosted by conservative pundit Gina Loudon. \"I'm hearing from parents and I'm hearing from the teenagers,\" he said when asked the reaction by District 64 constituents. \"Particularly, the teenage girls are disgusted by this. They don't want boys in the bathroom, whether they're hormonally different or they are wearing the accouterments of girls. They don't want it. \"And I know that parents almost overwhelming they don't want boys (in the girls' locker room),\" Paterno continued. \" \u2026 No matter what he wears or what he wants to go by, every last cell in his body is male. So, they don't want that to happen, either. But they are afraid of lawsuits and they are afraid, I think, of being called bigots.\" Paterno and Loudon co-wrote a 2012 book called \"Ladies and Gentlemen: Why the Survival of Our Republic Depends on the Revival of Honor.\" According to the Amazon.com description of the book, atheism, liberalism and radical feminism have undercut the virtues of the \"ideal woman and man.\" \"Readers will understand the crucial contributions of government, family, literature/media, and churches in producing a culture that either esteems or debases the best of each gender.\" The book was published by God and Country Press, an Evangelical Christian publishing house. jjohnson@pioneerlocal.com ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Kellyanne Conway, his counselor, contributed to the combative mood in an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd when she described the falsehoods that the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, had told reporters Saturday night as \u201c alternative facts \u201d \u2014 an assertion that lit up Twitter. However, Mr. Trump later adopted the more above-it-all demeanor that presidents typically take. \u201c Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump faces a challenge few of his predecessors have confronted. Having won an Electoral College victory but not the popular vote, he entered office with less public support in the polls than any other president in recent times. After a transition in which he did relatively little to reach out to his opponents on the left and they hardly warmed to him, he found hundreds of thousands of protesters chanting just a few blocks from his new home on the first morning he woke up there. That has left the new White House feeling besieged from Day 1, fueling the president\u2019s grievances and, in the view of some of his aides, necessitating an aggressive strategy to defend his legitimacy. \u201cThe point is not the crowd size,\u201d Reince Priebus , the White House chief of staff, said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d before the mood began to soften. \u201cThe point is that the attacks and the attempts to delegitimize this president in one day \u2014 and we\u2019re not going to sit around and take it.\u201d Mr. Trump grew increasingly angry on Inauguration Day after reading a series of Twitter messages pointing out that the size of his inaugural crowd did not rival that of Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. But he spent his Friday night in a whirlwind of celebration and affirmation. When he awoke on Saturday morning, after his first night in the Executive Mansion, the glow was gone, several people close to him said, and the new president was filled anew with a sense of injury. He became even more agitated after learning of a pool report by a Time magazine reporter incorrectly reporting that a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. (The reporter, Zeke Miller, did not see the bust and, after realizing the error, quickly issued a correction and apology .) While Mr. Trump was eager to counterattack, several senior advisers urged him to move on and focus on the responsibilities of office during his first full day as president. That included a high-stakes trip to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency , where he had been coached to demonstrate support of the agency and criticize Senate Democrats for delaying confirmation of his nominee to lead it, Mike Pompeo . The advisers left thinking he agreed. But Mr. Spicer, who often berated reporters for what he called biased coverage during the campaign, shares Mr. Trump\u2019s dark view of the news media and advocated an opening-day declaration of war. After racing through his words of reconciliation at the C.I.A. in Langley, Va., Mr. Trump launched into a rambling, unscripted discussion that drifted to the topic of crowd size, making a series of verifiably false claims. Mr. Spicer then went to the White House briefing room for his first turn at the lectern and issued a blistering attack on reporters , made his own false claims and then stormed out without taking questions. Some of the president\u2019s supporters found the first weekend troubling. L. Lin Wood, a prominent libel lawyer who was a vocal defender of Mr. Trump\u2019s on Twitter during the campaign, said that he considered it a dangerous debut. \u201cTo someone who believed we might have a good opportunity to change, it\u2019s just a terrible start. Because he\u2019s got a long way to go,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cThis is going to go downhill quickly if it\u2019s not changed, and that\u2019s not good for any of us.\u201d A version of this news analysis appears in print on January 23, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump\u2019s Rocky Start Jeopardizes Leverage.

(Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports) CHARLOTTE\u00a0\u2014\u00a0NASCAR on Monday unveiled a detailed overhaul of its competitive model that series officials hope fans will distill to one premise: performance throughout individual races and the regular season will be relevant to the championship run. Whether older fans already disgruntled with a culture of change are willing to give the new system a chance remains to be seen. But it is clearly an attempt to make the sport more digestible for a new generation unwilling to log four hours watching motorsports. Under the new format unveiled for all three national touring series, races will be divided into three stages, with the top 10 drivers in the running order at the first two breaks awarded points, from 10\u00a0for the leader to one for 10th place. Races will be halted at a pre-determined lap decided\u00a0by the length and size of the track. At the end of the race, the winner will be awarded 40 points, the second-place driver 35, with descending values to 35th place. The 36th-40th place drivers will receive one point. A major change in the system is that drivers also will earn bonus points, or championship points, during the 26-race regular season: 15 for the regular-season championship; 15 for finishing in the top 10 at the regular-season finale at Richmond International Raceway; five for each victory; and one for each stage win. Those bonus points will establish playoff seeding for the final 10 races and carry over into the 10-race playoff. MORE COVERAGE: Sebastian Vettel defeats Busch brothers for Nations Cup Drivers still would\u00a0qualify for the playoffs under the current system \u2014 the Chase nomenclature is gone \u2014 by virtue of a win or by finishing in the top 16 in points without a win. The 16 drivers who qualify for the championship run will maintain those playoff\u00a0bonus points through each of the three elimination rounds before the points are\u00a0reset for the four-driver finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway in November. NASCAR officials and series stakeholders have been working on changes since last summer. \u201cSimply put, this will make our great racing even better,\u201d NASCAR chairman Brian France said in a release. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the unprecedented collaboration from our industry stakeholders, each of whom had a common goal \u2013 strengthening the sport for our fans. This is an enhancement fully rooted in teamwork, and the result will be an even better product every single week.\u201d The Daytona 500 and its preliminaries will have added value with a win in each of the Duels worth 10 points in the series standings. The Daytona 500, therefore, could\u00a0be worth 70 points: a Duels win (10), a 500 win (40) and winning both segments (10 apiece). Other races would max out at 60 points. Everything you need to know about NASCAR's new format. pic.twitter.com/ATkJ6dwizn \u2014 NASCAR (@NASCAR) January 23, 2017 Dale Earnhardt Jr., NASCAR's most popular driver who will return to racing next month after missing half of last season because of a concussion, said he's glad to see the sport reward drivers for their entire performance and not just a win. \u201cAs a driver, I\u2019m happy to be rewarded for how I performed and not how I finished,\u201d he said. Seven-time NASCAR Cup champion and team owner Richard Petty said in part via statement: \"... This new format just adapts to the current and next generation of fans. It's something to help create more excitement during the races. You have to put on a good race, a good show where people want to watch at home and enjoy coming to the track. Having two additional winning moments is a good step in that direction to keep the drivers competitive and fans excited throughout the race and season.\" Track president Eddie Gossage, who runs Texas Motor Speedway, site of two NASCAR Cup races including one in the playoff, said: \"Not that there has ever been a time to kind of ride around, but now there is going to be a lot of points on the line. You've got to race hard the first 100 laps, race hard through those second 100 laps and then for the finish, of course, you're always running hard. It's going to make it better for the fans.\" In case of rain, races will be declared official after the second\u00a0segment is completed. Segments can end under caution, but overtime finishes still are in place for the race's final laps. For fans who found it difficult to sit for an entire race uninterrupted, this offers them built-in breaks. And TV built-in commercial time, plus the chance to interview segment winners. \u201cThis new format is another step toward bringing racing in line with other professional sports,\" said Mike Joy, Fox's NASCAR play-by-play announcer. \u00a0\"Football is played in quarters. Baseball is played in innings and hockey in periods. Fans of other sports are more familiar with this type of format. The idea of trying to get the viewer in front of a TV set for 500 miles of straight competition has proven difficult in this century. People are consuming sports differently than ever before, and every sport is discussing evolving to suit the target audience. This race-stage format provides a better alternative than shortening races, because fans will still get their money\u2019s worth with just as much competition as previously.\u201d In related news, NASCAR eliminated the competition clock in the Camping World Truck Series and also is prohibiting teams from replacing panels in-race.

Jessica Hill/AP hide caption toggle caption A federal judge has ruled against Aetna's proposed merger with its rival, Humana. Jessica Hill/AP A federal judge has ruled against the proposed acquisition of the health insurance company Humana by its larger rival, Aetna. The decision is a victory for former President Obama's Justice Department, which sued Aetna last year to block the $34 billion merger, NPR's Yuki Noguchi reported. The suit alleged that the merger would hurt competition in the health care market, leading to higher prices for consumers and fewer services for Medicare patients. Justice Department Moves To Block 2 Big Health Insurance Mergers U.S. District Judge John Bates found that to be the case, writing in his decision that, \"the merger of Aetna and Humana would be likely to substantially lessen competition in markets for individual Medicare Advantage plans and health insurance sold on the public exchanges\" in 364 counties. Medicare Advantage plans are privately run but reimbursed by Medicare. Bates also spent a considerable chunk of the 158-page decision analyzing Aetna's decision, announced last summer, to withdraw its insurance plans from 17 counties where Aetna and Humana both sold plans on the public exchanges. The company also pulled back from 11 of the 15 states in which it offered individual plans in 2016, as we reported . As NPR's Scott Hensley reported at the time: \"Aetna said the pullback was a business decision stemming from a loss in the second quarter on individual plans and uncertainty about the policy outlook for the exchanges. \"In the company's statement , [Aetna CEO Mark] Bertolini said, 'As a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured, we regret having to make this decision.' ... \"Bertolini was talking up the business potential of the exchanges as recently as April, when he said during a call with analysts and investors that the exchanges were 'a good investment,' despite the losses incurred.\" Article continues after sponsorship Bertolini and his company \"have long been supporters of the public exchanges,\" today's decision noted. But, as Scott also reported, a letter leaked to reporters last summer indicated Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini had tied his company's decisions about participating in the exchanges to the Justice Department's decision on the merger. In the letter to the DOJ, Bertolini wrote, \"if the DOJ sues to enjoin the transaction, we will immediately take action to reduce our 2017 exchange footprint.\" Aetna CEO To Justice Department: Block Our Deal And We'll Drop Out Of Obamacare The company subsequently did just that. In his Monday decision blocking the merger, Bates found, \"Aetna tried to leverage its participation in the exchanges for favorable treatment from DOJ regarding the proposed merger.\" He found Aetna had withdrawn from the 17 counties where it competed with Humana \"at least in part for the purpose of improving its litigation position\" in the government's lawsuit against it. The judge concluded that Aetna would be likely to do business in the future in those 17 counties, and that, as a result, \"The merger would also be likely to substantially lessen competition on the public exchanges in three Florida counties\" that were among the 17. Yuki reported Aetna said it was reviewing the opinion and is considering an appeal. \"Meanwhile, the same court is considering another case brought by the Justice Department's antitrust division against the proposed merger of Anthem and Cigna,\" she reported. \"A decision in that case is also expected soon.\" ",

    "text": "GOP senators unveil ObamaCare replacement bill Published               January 23, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Two Republican senators on Monday unveiled one of the first ObamaCare replacement bills of the new Congress -- a state-centric plan they admit is imperfect but describe as a tangible start to overhauling the 2010 health care law on a bipartisan basis.\u00a0 \u201cWe recognize that our bill is not perfect,\u201d said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who introduced the 2017 Patient Freedom Act with Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and fellow Republican. \u201cWe need comprehensive legislation,\u201d Collins continued. \u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress. ... But if we don\u2019t start putting specific legislation on the table that can be debated, refined, amended and enacted, then we will fail the American people.\u201d The senators introduced the bill amid a host of pending alternatives from fellow congressional Republicans, including from Georgia Rep. Tom Price, Trump\u2019s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, also a doctor. Among the highlights of the plan are measures allowing states to continue to offer ObamaCare, urging \u201cprice transparency\u201d on medical procedures, keeping existing subsidies and tax credits provided in the 2010 law and extending coverage to 30 million more uninsured Americans. \u00a0 They said the plan would slow -- or \u201cbend\u201d-- the cost of such a plan to the federal government and allow young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 policies. They suggested their plan would take about three years to be fully implemented. \u00a0\u00a0 Cassidy made clear the bill -- particularly the option to stay on ObamaCare -- was created with the intent to win support from Senate Democrats, considering at least eight of them will be needed to join the chamber\u2019s 52 Republicans to vote to pass such legislation. \u201cWe think that gets us to 60,\u201d Cassidy said. President Trump, like other Washington Republicans, campaigned on promises, if elected, to swiftly repeal and replace ObamaCare. However, GOP congressional leaders in the weeks following Trump\u2019s White House victory have hit pause, fearing a hasty repeal without a comprehensive replacement plan would leave a projected 20 million Americans uninsured. Trump and other Republicans now favor simultaneously repealing and replacing former President Obama\u2019s signature health care law -- created to provide coverage for millions of uninsured Americans but struggling under rising premium costs. \u201cSignificant changes are going to have to be made to keep the [insurance] market from going into a tailspin,\u201d Collins said. She also acknowledged being unsure about the impact of the executive order Trump signed Friday to ease the regulatory burden of ObamaCare.\u00a0 She called the measure \u201cvery confusing\u201d and suggested that the specifics of the repeal and replace process \u2013 including \u201crulemaking\" -- will become clearer after a secretary of Health and Human Services is in place. Cassidy said the joint proposal, like Price\u2019s, includes health savings accounts, which Paul\u2019s also includes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who vowed to dismantle ObamaCare on \u201cDay One\u201d on the start of the 115th Congress -- told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that congressional Republicans are working with the Trump administration on a repeal-and-replace strategy and that a new plan would still cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. The Kentucky Republican also said Trump will be able to \u201cundo a lot of it himself\u201d and that eight out of 10 Americans want ObamaCare replaced. \u201cThe status quo is not an option,\u201d he said.

The Emoluments Clause has not been tested in the modern era. And there is no comparable example of a president owning such a large business empire. The suit alleges that Trump violated the Constitution the moment he was sworn in as president on Friday because he had not divested his interests in the Trump Organization, including leases held by foreign governments in Trump Tower, bookings by foreign governments at Trump International Hotel in Washington and payments from foreign government-owned broadcasters related to \"The Apprentice.\" The lawsuit also cites Trump deals involving China, India, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkey, Scotland, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.

    "text": "Video and Analysis From the First Press Briefing of the Trump White House JAN. 23, 2017 White House Correspondent 12:59 PM ET Greetings, all. This is Julie Hirschfeld Davis, and I\u2019m a White House correspondent at The Times. Today is White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s first official on-camera briefing with reporters since President Trump was sworn in. It\u2019s always a high-stakes event in the life of any new administration. But this one is particularly fraught, because of an extraordinary episode on Saturday night, when Spicer went to the podium to angrily berate the press for their reporting on the size of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. He gave a series of demonstrably false data points pushing back, and didn\u2019t take any questions that night. Today, he will field plenty, and I\u2019ll be here with my White House teammates Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman and Mark Landler to decode and analyze. Julie Hirschfeld Davis To the extent that there was a plan to take advantage of the first days of his administration, when a president is usually at his maximum leverage, President Trump threw it aside. The New York Times White House Correspondent 1:03 PM ET And good afternoon, everyone. This is Michael Shear, and I\u2019m in the briefing room today, ready for the first briefing. I\u2019ll send some updates once it begins about what it\u2019s like here. Julie Hirschfeld Davis Looks like a standing-room-only crowd over there, Mike. What\u2019s the vibe? Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:38 PM ET Yeah, Julie. It\u2019s totally packed. Not like the Josh Earnest briefings toward the end of the Obama era. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:39 PM ET Lots of anticipation here. No one is quite sure how Sean is going to approach the beginning of the briefing. Will he make reference to Saturday? Will he just jump right into questions? Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:41 PM ET We definitely have plenty of them, by the way: health care, trade (T.P.P., Nafta), immigration, ethics and businesses, relations with Congress, the C.I.A. visit, Russia\u2026 Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:43 PM ET It\u2019s interesting that Kellyanne Conway, the senior counselor, and Hope Hicks, the director of strategic communications, are both in the room for this, in seats usually reserved for junior press staff. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:47 PM ET Sean kicks it off by trying to puncture the tension with some self-effacing humor, saying that he emailed his predecessor, Josh Earnest, last night after checking his Twitter feed and reassured him that his title as most popular White House press secretary is secure at least for the next few days. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 1:47 PM ET Well, there\u2019s the answer: a quick couple of jokes to cut the tension and then right on into the news of the day. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 1:48 PM ET When Spicer talks about trade policy, it\u2019s worth recalling that he once served as a spokesman to George W. Bush\u2019s trade representative, Susan Schwab. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:49 PM ET He made only a glancing reference to the crowd-size fight he picked on Saturday night, saying he had planned to start by recapping the inauguration, but we\u2019ve already been over that quite a bit. But there\u2019s been no acknowledgment of having given false information from the podium or any offer of conciliation. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:52 PM ET Spicer\u2019s joke did not seem to get many laughs, as best as I can tell watching remotely. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:53 PM ET The message that Spicer is delivering now about the holdup of Mike Pompeo\u2019s confirmation was the message that Trump was supposed to deliver at the C.I.A. on Saturday. Peter Baker Humor is usually a good way to defuse tensions but it felt a little forced. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:53 PM ET This is quite a long topper. Almost as if he realizes that once he stops talking, he\u2019s going to lose control of this forum and have to field a lot of tough questions. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:53 PM ET And it felt as if it\u2019s going to take a little more than a glancing self-effacement to move on. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:54 PM ET That was the warmest readout of a phone call between an American president and an Egyptian president in years. Maggie Haberman Julie, you are so right. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:54 PM ET More joking allusions to the weekend episode from Spicer as he announces the addition of four \u201cSkype seats\u201d in the briefing room: \u201cAs you know, we are all about big viewerships and large audiences here\u2026\u201d Maggie Haberman Chief White House Correspondent 1:54 PM ET Always the least candid part of any White House briefing \u2014 \u201cI look forward to taking your questions.\u201d Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET Spicer breaks with the tradition of granting the first question to The Associated Press, and instead goes to The New York Post. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET This is going to be a real test of Spicer\u2019s level of granular knowledge of policy. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET And not just skipping the A.P. but moving off the front row, which in recent years has tended to dominate the first half or more of each briefing. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:55 PM ET He dodged the question from Daniel Halper from The New York Post about whether they will enforce the mandate. Peter Baker The front row includes the big networks and wire services. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 1:56 PM ET Second question goes to the Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent, who asks about the anti-abortion language Trump signed this morning. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET One of Trump\u2019s favorite things is watching how his aides do on TV. He was displeased with how Spicer sounded and looked and the overall performance on Saturday. He is almost certainly watching this right now. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET He\u2019s going to reporters on a list, something presidents usually do but press secretaries don\u2019t. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET Can I confess to being happy we\u2019re not enduring 25 minutes of questions from TV networks? Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 1:57 PM ET Yes, for all the attention on what will happen in the briefing room, there are some things that could be done to make the briefing better, one of which is to spread the questions around. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:00 PM ET Glenn Thrush and I did a podcast before he left Politico in which we characterized Trump as the Page Six President, in honor of the gossip page at The New York Post that he has thrived on and nurtured for decades. The Post got the first question. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:01 PM ET Asked what Trump will do about the so-called DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents whom Obama shielded from deportation by executive order, Spicer strongly hints that rescinding that policy is not a priority. He says Trump wants to focus on undocumented immigrants with criminal records or \u201cthose who pose a threat to the American people.\u201d Peter Baker Which is pretty close to the Obama policy, right? Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:01 PM ET Yes, although saying they\u2019re not a priority for deportation is not the same as affirmatively shielding them from it, so it\u2019s still an open question whether he will narrow or remove that protection, and what if anything Trump would do to replace it. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:03 PM ET Yes, for sure. But it\u2019s interesting that the philosophy undergirding it \u2014 that it\u2019s not a wholesale sweep but targeted mainly on those who have criminal issues \u2014 is similar. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:04 PM ET The Sean Spicer we are seeing here is a completely different person from the irate, reading-from-a-script, unwilling-to-take-questions person who appeared in the briefing room on Saturday night. He started out seeming a bit nervous, but seems to have relaxed into this. But nobody has directly challenged him yet either. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:06 PM ET Julie, that is absolutely true.  I\u2019m a little surprised that there haven\u2019t been questions about Michael Flynn and the debacle of Saturday. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:06 PM ET And Julie, to your observation about what they\u2019re saying on DACA, they seem to be channeling pretty clearly that they don\u2019t have a clear plan yet. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:06 PM ET Spicer refers questions on joint U.S.-Russian action in Syria to the Pentagon, but in general says if there\u2019s a chance to work together, \u201cSure, we\u2019ll take it.\u201d Maggie Haberman Peter, he certainly bounced off that rather fraught statement quickly. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:08 PM ET A reminder: The Trans-Pacific Partnership originated under George W. Bush, when Spicer worked at the trade representative\u2019s office. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:09 PM ET Jon Karl welcomes him to the job and then drops the hammer: \u201cWill you always tell the truth?\u201d Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:09 PM ET Spicer says, \u201cIt is.\u201d This doesn\u2019t quite get to how he didn\u2019t do that on Saturday. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:10 PM ET Just one more thought on Spicer\u2019s initial joke about Josh Earnest\u2019s position as most popular press secretary being safe: It is a softer-edged way of making the argument he and the Trump team have been for months, that the press loved Obama and was never willing to give them a fair shake. By calling attention to Earnest\u2019s good rapport with the media, he is driving that home while seeming to brush off the sour start. Maggie Haberman He literally said sometimes we can disagree with the facts. Maggie Haberman \u201cIt was the most-watched inaugural,\u201d Spicer says. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:12 PM ET In his discourse on honesty as press secretary, Spicer just said, \u201cSometimes we can disagree with the facts.\u201d That sounds remarkably like Kellyanne Conway\u2019s statement on Sunday that he was offering \u201calternative facts.\u201d And now he is defending the false statements, saying he was given inaccurate information on Metro ridership from the Presidential Inaugural Committee, and when he talked about the largest audience ever, he was also counting internet streams that are unquantifiable. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:12 PM ET Jon Karl is an appropriate person to kick off this phase of the briefing. He was combative with Jay Carney after Benghazi. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:13 PM ET The alternative fact that Spicer appears to be trying to hold to is that Trump\u2019s inauguration viewership was biggest, \u201cperiod.\u201d Maggie Haberman This is going a bit downhill. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:14 PM ET \u201cWhere was the apology to the president of the United States?\u201d Spicer asks of Zeke Miller\u2019s mistake (an honest one that he apologized for) about the Martin Luther King Jr. bust being moved from the Oval Office. Maggie Haberman This is ultimately what this is about, guys. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:14 PM ET And if someone is watching this on television, I imagine that their sympathies lie with Spicer, not the press. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:15 PM ET The White House has made the mistake about the bust, quickly corrected, far more prominent than it ever was originally. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:15 PM ET \u201cOver and over again, there is this attempt to go after this president,\u201d Spicer says. \u201cThere\u2019s a rush to judgement every time.\u201d He is back to talking about the King bust flap. This is the White House putting journalists on notice to watch what they report. Maggie Haberman This is Spicer channeling Trump pretty purely. Trump genuinely believes he\u2019s been treated unfairly. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:20 PM ET I\u2019d like to make the point, by the way, as we await the visit by the British Prime Minister Theresa May later this week, that Trump has been politically wise to make trade his kickoff issue. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:20 PM ET It was the heart of the concern for most of his voters. And meeting with unions is part of an effort he\u2019s made since the spring to draw Bernie Sanders supporters from the left into his populist coalition. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:22 PM ET It also reinforces Trump\u2019s status as a more independent president, going against longstanding Republican orthodoxy from the start. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:22 PM ET Spicer\u2019s background at the trade representative\u2019s office is useful for arguing trade issues, which are arcane. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:24 PM ET And Peter, on making this bust mistake prominent, it really is a reminder of how asymmetrical covering this administration will be. Any mistake by the press, no matter how quickly it\u2019s addressed, will be amplified to Trump\u2019s supporters, even as the press secretary makes untrue statements. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET Good thing Spicer used to be the spokesman for the Budget Committee. He is practiced at answering detailed questions about the economy and fiscal policy, like the one about unemployment numbers he just fielded. Glenn Thrush White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET Spicer seems both more broadly conversant with policy than most press secretaries and more willing to freely discuss policy than other flacks. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET Never a bad thing politically to make the media the enemy. That\u2019s one area where Americans can agree. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:25 PM ET Yes,  he seems to be pretty fluent in aspects of policy, and able to think on his feet. Peter Baker None of which is actually making news, however. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:26 PM ET And yes, Peter, this is the challenge. We are equal-opportunity offenders in the minds of voters. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:28 PM ET Seeing this version of Spicer is a reminder, if I may, of how most people tend to change the closer they get to the ring of power in Trump\u2019s orbit. This was a constant throughout the 2016 campaign. Glenn Thrush White House Correspondent 2:28 PM ET What a difference between Sean today vs. Saturday \u2014 Dr. Banner vs. the Hulk \u2014 staff-prep vs. Donald prep. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:29 PM ET On the other hand, Spicer didn\u2019t really answer the question of what metric this White House will use to measure the unemployment rate. Trump routinely said during the campaign that the rate could be as high as 40 percent (it was 4.7 percent in December and around there for most of 2016). Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:29 PM ET No, he did not. He completely deflected it. But that kind of elision from one thought to another, without answering the question, is not endemic to him! Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:30 PM ET The argument, of course, being whether people who aren\u2019t counted in the 4.7 percent \u2014 people who have stopped looking, people who hold down two part-time jobs but want one full-time job, etc. \u2014 should be counted, too. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:33 PM ET Spicer is now asked whether the president has spoken to the intelligence agencies about the investigation into potential Russian contacts during the campaign and after by his advisers. He said he didn\u2019t believe they had spoken. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:33 PM ET Also says he has made no indication that he would stop an ongoing investigation, but that\u2019s not exactly the same as saying he won\u2019t stop one. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:35 PM ET Pretty quick brush-off of the question of whether when Trump says he\u2019ll work with anyone to defeat ISIS, he is including President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Spicer said let\u2019s not take it too far, but doesn\u2019t give a flat \u201cno.\u201d Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:36 PM ET This is the way this White House will work: \u201cWe\u2019re done with executive orders for today \u2014 but as I say, stand by.\u201d Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:36 PM ET Yes. And leaving options open for almost everything, while then appearing to close them off when they aren\u2019t. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:38 PM ET Spicer came back to the briefing room on Friday just a couple of hours after Trump was inaugurated and basically said, for the next eight years, stand by. Essentially telling the press corps they can expect little of the usual concrete guidance on logistics and planning that they have traditionally relied on to cover the White House. It\u2019s a new day. Maggie Haberman Our colleague Michael Shear is now getting a question. Peter Baker I actually gave Spicer credit for conceding the obvious out of the gate. Maggie Haberman In terms of how much spur-of-moment Trump has always done and will do. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:39 PM ET Spicer reiterated a tough line on the South China Sea, saying the U.S. will defend areas that are in international waters. But he didn\u2019t repeat Rex Tillerson\u2019s comment during his confirmation hearing about denying China access to islands. China\u2019s argument is that these islands are in Chinese waters. Maggie Haberman I wonder how what Spicer said about China will be received there. Maggie Haberman The news on ending DACA is quite something. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:41 PM ET He\u2019s taking a number of questions from foreign reporters, which White House press secretaries don\u2019t always do. Foreign reporters in Washington are usually given the back of the hand; more willingness to engage by the White House would go a long way to building good will. Mark Landler Spicer underlines how Trump views China almost purely through an economic/trade prism. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:42 PM ET Maggie, that concession about Trump\u2019s unpredictability is important for Spicer\u2019s own credibility. He\u2019s setting expectations low on whether he will be able to accurately forecast what his boss is going to do. Which is quite a position to be in as the White House press secretary. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 2:42 PM ET I tried to pin Sean down on what Trump thinks about legislation on immigration, and in particular the Dreamers. It seems clear that they are not going to end the DACA program right away, but not clear what they will do in the long run. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:43 PM ET Absolutely true, Julie. I\u2019d also argue that Sean needs to earn credibility back after Saturday\u2019s mess. Today is a step, but it will take awhile. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:43 PM ET That said, Spicer has one of the hardest jobs in Washington traditionally, and all the more so under a president like Trump. Mark Landler White House Correspondent 2:45 PM ET Spicer is right that General Flynn has met with lots of counterparts in his National Security Council prep. Obama folks complained that he met with too many foreign officials, not enough with their staff. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:45 PM ET Spicer seems to be conceding a non-alternative fact, that Trump did not have the biggest in-person inaugural crowd. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:46 PM ET This is extraordinary. Spicer, who literally put up pictures of the crowd size on the National Mall as he talked on Saturday about how this was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, is saying he actually meant total audience including on TV and online. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:46 PM ET And explained in grassy-knoll-level detail how many factors colluded against Trump that he claimed the media was unfairly characterizing. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:49 PM ET This is a good example of why you take questions. If reporters had gotten a chance to ask, they could have pinned Spicer down on Saturday about precisely what he meant on the inaugural crowd size. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 2:51 PM ET Spicer is dissembling about what Trump has said about about the intelligence community. Trump compared them to Nazis . Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:52 PM ET In denying what we have all heard and seen with our own ears and eyes about the degree to which Trump has publicly disparaged the intelligence community, Spicer is back to what Trump perceives as a vendetta against him in the media. \u201cThere is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has.\u201d Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:52 PM ET Spicer is now taking on the entire American tradition of second-guessing and speculation. Discussing whether it makes sense for a candidate to go to Michigan is not really delegitimization. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:52 PM ET The kind of things that he describes are pretty typical of any White House. When he says he\u2019s never seen anything like this, it\u2019s because he\u2019s never been the White House press secretary before. My guess is his predecessors felt the same. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 2:53 PM ET It\u2019s really remarkable how Spicer is acknowledging what we all know \u2014 that Trump and his top people are obsessed by the coverage and the sometimes negative reaction to what he says and does. Michael D. Shear White House Correspondent 2:54 PM ET As Peter says, much of this is the normal back and forth. But normally presidents and their aides litigate the coverage behind closed doors, yelling at reporters but not taking the fight public. Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:55 PM ET No question it must be \u201cdemoralizing\u201d for people in the White House to wake up and read all the media, but that\u2019s hardly new or unique to this president or White House, not even close. Julie Hirschfeld Davis White House Correspondent 2:56 PM ET Spicer says \u201cit\u2019s a little demoralizing\u201d to see the coverage Trump has received since being inaugurated and argues that \u201cthe default narrative is always negative.\u201d The White House press corps is skeptical of every president and challenges assertions all the time. It seems he is suggesting that the media is responsible for bucking them up and providing coverage they consider \u201cpositive.\u201d Peter Baker Chief White House Correspondent 2:56 PM ET This recalls the old saying: The media doesn\u2019t report on the planes that land safely every day.

Cercone told ABC News that Murphy's wife witnessed the shooting. Murphy, 42, and his wife loved each other \"as much as any couple I've ever seen,\" Cercone said. \"I just think they were happy ... every single day,\" he said. Murphy, whose name was released by the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office, was the only person killed in the incident, on Sunday afternoon at the Rolling Oaks Mall.

The shooting began as an attempted robbery by two suspects at the mall's Kay Jewelers store, the San Antonio Police Department said. Murphy intervened and was shot and killed by one of the suspects, police said. Another person then intervened and shot the suspect who shot Murphy, police said.

Cercone, who made a GoFundMe page to support the family, said Murphy was a manager of sales at a few car dealerships and often worked 80 hours per week. Cercone described Murphy as \"a regular guy in some ways, who went above and beyond to take care of his family. [He] tried hard to do the right thing.\" \"I hope justice is served,\" Cercone told ABC News. The suspect injured in the shooting, whose name was not released by the police, was hospitalized in critical condition, police said. The second suspect, identified by police as 34-year-old Jason Matthew Prieto, who police said fled after the shootings, was later caught and taken into custody. Both suspects are facing one capital murder charge and two counts of aggravated robbery, police said. 0 Shares ",

More From Newser Pet rats linked to outbreak of rare virus But at 28 she began to mysteriously lose weight and vomit after eating. By the time she stepped on a scale to check her weight, she was 112 pounds, down from 140 pounds, reported Good Housekeeping in 2015. Her eventual diagnoses a few years later? Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a condition in which her small intestine was being pinched and not allowing food to pass through, and gastroparesis, which kept her stomach from emptying correctly, reports People . On Saturday, after many therapies and surgery, the 34-year-old\u2014who'd dropped down to 77 pounds and entered hospice\u2014died in Brookfield, Wis. \"It's my time to go,\" she told People last week. Brown said she'd gotten countless stares from strangers; some were so bold as to tell her to eat a burger or ask why she was starving herself. \"It was very hard to hear,\" she said, \"but I knew the truth.\" Brown's story went viral after she posted a video to YouTube to offer hope to others fighting similar battles, though her disorder is so rare there are only 400 other reported cases, per People. Brookfield Now reported that doctors recommended she get a small intestine transplant, but she was unable to gain the 20 pounds doctors said she'd need to add to her frame in order to have the surgery. Brown's husband, Patrick, who started a GoFundMe page to help pay for her memorial and his unpaid leave from work, says the last thing he told her was, \"Go be free.\" (This toddler has to eat every hour to survive .)

The car has been cut up and taken apart without Breedlove's knowledge generating a lawsuit. Jan. 23, 2017. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Craig Breedlove loaned his record breaking jet car to the Museum of Science and Industry 50 years ago. The car has been cut up and taken apart without Breedlove's knowledge generating a lawsuit. Jan. 23, 2017. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Robert Channick Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Craig Breedlove reached an agreement Monday with the Museum of Science and Industry over a lawsuit alleging his record-setting Spirit of America jet car was damaged during its 50 years on display. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, according to a joint statement released by Breedlove and the museum. Breedlove had been seeking $395,000 to cover estimated repair costs. \"For more than 50 years, millions of museum visitors were able to get an up-close view of the racecar,\" the joint statement said. \"The confidential agreement fully resolves a lawsuit brought against the museum regarding the condition of the car.\" When Breedlove loaned his Spirit of America jet car to the Museum of Science and Industry in 1965, it was freshly repaired from a harrowing crash during a land speed record run at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Fifty years later, the museum took the car off display and returned it \u2014 in far worse shape than after the record-setting crash, Breedlove said in an interview with the Tribune. \"Unquestionably, the damage from the museum was much, much more severe than the crash,\" Breedlove said. \"It was in beautiful shape when we loaned it to them.\" Breedlove and his attorney were in Chicago on Monday for settlement discussions before a federal magistrate judge in their lawsuit against the museum, seeking funds to repair the historic jet car. Filed in June and amended in October, the lawsuit alleged negligence and breach of fiduciary duty by the museum. Craig Breedlove set the land speed record of 526.26 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in 1964. His car, the Spirit of America, was displayed for decades at the Museum of Science and Industry. He is suing the museum over alleged\u00a0damage to the car. Breedlove, now 79, designed, built and piloted the world's fastest car while still in his early 20s. In 1963, he became the first to cross the 400 mph threshold, and set a record the following year, topping 526 mph before crashing into a saltwater pool far beyond the course. It was the last time he drove the car. At the urging of his sponsors, the Spirit was cosmetically repaired and loaned to the Museum of Science and Industry for exhibition \u2014 minus the jet engine, which was subsequently destroyed in a flood. Breedlove and the museum entered into an \"oral agreement\" that the car would be returned to him in the event it was pulled from display. \"At the time, I was a young guy, I didn't have experience, I didn't have an attorney,\" Breedlove said. \"It was something the sponsors wanted and the museum wanted it. It seemed like the right thing to do and they had this marvelous reputation. I just had no idea that something like this could happen.\" When the car was taken off display and shipped to his Rio Vista, Calif., home in October 2015, damage included exterior panels that no longer fit, stretched intake duct mountings for the jet engine and graffiti where schoolchildren carved their initials in the aluminum finish, Breedlove said. In addition, Breedlove said the vehicle's frame had been cut and \"unprofessionally\" rewelded, and the driver's seat was missing. The car was taken to a professional restoration shop, which estimated repair costs at $395,000. \"It was a real art piece and an icon in automotive history for the United States,\" Breedlove said. \"I was just totally stunned at the condition. I couldn't believe the amount of damage that was done to it. I'm just broken-hearted over the thing.\" While Breedlove expected normal wear and tear over 50 years of kids' field trips and hands-on admirers, he said the decision to cut the car was by far the most damaging \u2014 to the vehicle and his faith in the museum. Breedlove said he wasn't looking for damages \u2014 only the cost of repair. He believes the car can be restored to its glory, and despite his \"disappointing\" experience with the Museum of Science and Industry, he may donate it to another museum for display. While the Spirit of America is permanently retired from racing, Breedlove, who turns 80 in a couple of months, hasn't lost his need for speed. He is hoping to help recapture the title of world's fastest car, currently held by England, with a new car \u2014 and his son at the wheel. \"We're hoping to put a car together for the United States to take them on,\" Breedlove said. \"The good news is I won't have to drive it anymore.\" ",

Under the Cassidy-Collins bill, states could enroll people who would otherwise be uninsured in health plans providing basic coverage. These high-deductible health plans are intended to protect consumers against catastrophic medical expenses. They would cover generic versions of prescription drugs, and they would also have to cover recommended childhood immunizations without co-payments. States would contract with one or more insurers to offer this coverage. Consumers could buy \u201cmore robust coverage\u201d if they want, Mr. Cassidy said, but they could be automatically enrolled, by default, in the high-deductible health plans providing basic coverage. \u201cA state could say, \u2018All those eligible are enrolled unless they choose not to be,\u2019\u201d he explained. This \u201cpassive enrollment\u201d would provide insurers with a large pool of customers, including many healthy people, without the coercion of an \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe think that we could cover more people than Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said, although he acknowledged that the effects of his bill had not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, which serves as Capitol Hill\u2019s official scorekeeper. If a state opts out of the Affordable Care Act, many of the federal insurance standards established under the law would no longer apply. The bill would repeal federal benefit mandates that \u201coften force Americans to pay for coverage they don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. But some protections would remain in place. Parents would still be allowed to keep children on their insurance until the age of 26, and insurers could not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits. The Cassidy-Collins bill, called the Patient Freedom Act, would eliminate not only the unpopular individual mandate, but also the federal requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to full-time employees. Mr. Cassidy said that Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, both Republicans, were also sponsors of the bill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, were sponsors of a similar bill that Mr. Cassidy introduced in 2015. But the legislative landscape is different now. Republicans in Congress can repeal the Affordable Care Act, with support from Mr. Trump. In the Senate, they will need help from Democrats to adopt a replacement because Republicans are eight votes shy of the 60 needed to stop a filibuster . ",

    "text": "Email A federal judge has rejected health insurer Aetna's bid to buy rival Humana on grounds that the deal would hurt competition in hundreds of Medicare Advantage markets, ultimately affecting the price consumers pay for coverage. U.S. District Judge John Bates said in an opinion filed Monday that federal regulation would probably be \"insufficient to prevent the merged firm from raising prices or reducing benefits,\" and neither new competitors nor an Aetna plan to sell some of the combined company's business to another insurer, Molina Healthcare Inc., would be enough to ease competitive concerns. Aetna spokesman TJ Crawford said the insurer was reviewing the decision \"and giving serious consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case.\" Aetna, the nation's third-largest health insurer, had announced in 2015 its plan to spend around $34 billion on Humana Inc. and become one of the top providers in the fast-growing Medicare Advantage market. Medicare Advantage plans are privately run versions of the government's Medicare program for people who are over age 65 or disabled. The Justice Department sued last summer to block Aetna's deal and Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Anthem Inc.'s separate, $48-billion purchase of Cigna Corp. Both cases went to trial late last year. An opinion has yet to be rendered for the Anthem case. The two deals would consolidate the nation's five largest insurers into three, a list that includes UnitedHealth Group Inc., currently the largest. The big insurers had argued that by getting bigger they will be able to negotiate better prices with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and doctor groups that also are growing. They also expect to cut expenses and add more customers, which helps them better spread out the cost of investing in technology to manage and improve care. But Bates, who is based in Washington, D.C., said in a 158-page opinion that the Aetna-Humana combination would \"likely substantially lessen competition\" for Medicare Advantage plans in 364 counties and, separately, in some Florida public insurance exchanges. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder said in a statement that the decision was \"a victory for American consumers - especially seniors and working families and individuals.\" Industry experts have said any impact from the deals on consumers would take years to materialize and could lead to savings in some areas, along with the risk of higher costs elsewhere. Shares of Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna Inc. fell about 3 percent, or $3.33, to $119.20 Monday, while broader indexes slipped less than 1 percent. In contrast, Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana Inc.'s stock climbed $4.49 to $205.02. \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Writer Eric Tucker contributed from Washington, D.C. Murphy reported from Indianapolis. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "The researchers concluded that this wolf-sized prehistoric creature is \"two to three times larger than any modern otter species,\" Denise Su, the head of paleobotany and paleoecology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History , tells The Two-Way. The fossilized cranium was nearly complete, but flattened to about an inch and a half thick. \"The bones are pretty fragile, so we couldn't really reconstruct it physically,\" Su said. \"So what we did is we took CT scans of the cranium, and then we digitally reconstructed it.\" The cranium was particularly interesting because it revealed that the animal's teeth had \"some badger features,\" Su explains. The species name Siamogale melilutra, is a nod to that \u2013 in Latin, meles means badger and lutra means otter. A comparison of the cranium size of the newly discovered ancient otter with other otter species. Xiaoming Wang hide caption toggle caption Xiaoming Wang And the completeness of the cranium provided the researchers with important information about how otters evolved, Su said. It shed light on a dental mystery in particular. The giant otters possessed large bunodont, or round-cusped, teeth. Scientists have wondered whether different species of otters inherited these teeth from a common ancestor, or evolved them separately because they were eating similar things \u2013 a process known as convergent evolution. But by comparing this specimen to modern and other fossil otters, Su says they found \"these bunodont teeth actually arose at least four different times within the greater otter lineage.\" That finding suggests they emerged because of convergent evolution, rather than inheritance from a common ancestor. Article continues after sponsorship The scientists initially found other bones from the species in 2009, including an upper arm bone. Su remembers looking at that bone and thinking, \"This looks like an otter but it's huge. ... Is this really an otter?\" There are big questions about why the animal was so large and how it moved on land and in water. \"A lot of times in modern carnivores, the large size is partly due to subduing prey, so their prey is bigger and the carnivores also get bigger,\" Su explains. But the scientists think that this animal likely ate small creatures such as mollusks \u2013 so, \"why the big size?\" ",

But a co-sponsor was told by the Centers for Disease and Prevention that the agency was worried how the conference would be viewed by the Trump administration. FILE - In this July 26, 2011 file photo, drops of water fall from a melting iceberg near Nuuk, Greenland. AP The incoming administration did not ask or order that the meeting be canceled, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. \"They had no idea whether the new administration would be supportive,\" said Benjamin, whose group was a co-sponsor of the event with the CDC. \u201cThey had no idea whether the new administration would be supportive.\u201d Rather, the decision was \"a strategic retreat,\" intended to head off a possible last minute cancellation or other repercussions from Trump officials who may prove hostile to spending money on climate change science, Benjamin said Monday. Related: Obama Caps Legacy With Paris Climate Change Deal \"They decided the better part of valor was to stop and regroup\" until it could be discussed with Trump's new health leadership, Benjamin said. A new CDC director has not been named. Benjamin called the decision understandable but worrisome. He was echoed by Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was invited to speak at the conference. \"In the long run, climate change is affecting the health of Americans,\" she said. \"At some point, I hope they will go forward with the conference.\" Related: White House Says Climate Change is Ruining Health A CDC official confirmed the agency's decision last month to cancel the Climate and Health Summit scheduled for Feb. 14-17 but offered no explanation when asked. In a statement to those registered, the CDC said the summit may take place later in the year. Public health experts say climate change is a human-made problem that contributes to a range of health issues and illnesses, including heat stroke and diseases spread by tropical insects. The CDC has a $10 million program on climate and health, and published guidelines to help local health officials deal with human vulnerability to climate change. Related: Is Global Warming Making us Sick? In 2012, Trump tweeted that the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. He later said he was joking, but during the presidential campaign referred to global warming as \"a hoax.\" Before he took office, Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio, both prominent climate activists. Trump picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. During his confirmation hearing, Pruitt backed away from his own past statements and said climate change is real. ",

USA TODAY NETWORK White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks in the briefing room on Jan. 23, 2017. (Photo: Shawn Thew, European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON \u2014 After a weekend blowup about inaugural crowd sizes, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that reporters are too negative toward\u00a0President Trump \u2014\u00a0part of an initial media briefing that displayed a new approach to choosing questioners and the Trump administration's desire to get credit for its early work in office. \"It's not about one Tweet, it's not about one picture\u00a0\u2014 it's about a constant theme ... the default narrative is always negative, and it's demoralizing,\"\u00a0Spicer said during his first formal briefing as presidential spokesman. Spicer also announced a new effort to bring new types of reporters into the briefing: Four daily \"Skype seats\" in the press room, available to journalists from outlets not based in Washington. The new press secretary joked and jousted\u00a0with reporters about the tense start to Trump\u00a0White House relations with the press \u2014\u00a0a short and combative statement he read to reporters late Saturday afternoon about their coverage of the size of the crowds for Trump's inauguration last Friday. Seeking to leaven any remaining tension, Spicer opened the proceedings Monday by saying, \"I was going to start with a recap of the inauguration, but I think we've covered that pretty well.\" Inauguration issues still surfaced, however, and\u00a0Spicer defended his still-disputed claim that Trump had the most-watched inauguration in history, as well as his approach to the new job. Read more: Spicer slams reporters, but evidence doesn't match up \"It's an honor to do this, and, yes,\u00a0I believe that we have to be honest with the American people,\" the veteran Republican Party spokesman said about his opening weekend as press secretary. \"I think sometimes we can disagree with the facts. There are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out. But our intention's never to lie to you.\" Fact-checkers bashed Spicer for his statement that \"this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014\u00a0period \u2014\u00a0both in person and around the globe\" \u2014 even though aerial photographs showed much fewer people for Trump than\u00a0for newly sworn-in President Obama eight years ago,\u00a0as well as much lower mass transit ridership that day. Defending that statement Monday, Spicer claimed the online viewership of YouTube, Facebook, and news networks. Trump himself raised the crowd issue, claiming that 1 to 1.5 million people attended, even bringing it up during Saturday remarks to CIA employees. Aides said the president personally ordered Spicer to go out and deliver his statement Saturday. During his Monday briefing, Spicer said that Trump's frustration with the crowd size story reflects frustration with what he called a trend: \"There's this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and movement [Trump] represents,\" Spicer said. Aides said Trump was particularly incensed with a mistaken Friday media pool report \u2014\u00a0quickly retracted \u2014\u00a0that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., from the Oval Office. \"Think about how racially charged that is,\" Spicer said. The rest of Spicer's first briefing focused on standard White House and political fare, from discussion of the executive orders signed by Trump to the\u00a0new president's upcoming meetings with the leaders of Great Britain and Mexico. Change in protocol Spicer's briefing drew a packed house to the briefing room, with reporters and\u00a0television cameras lining the walls. White House aides watched from the sidelines, including presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway and communications adviser \u2014 and former Apprentice star \u2014\u00a0Omarosa Manigault. In a break from long-held protocol, Spicer did not give the first question to the Associated Press correspondent, opting instead for the New York Post and then moving to the Christian Broadcasting Network. Over the weekend, criticism of\u00a0Spicer spread across social media \u00a0and even spilled into the world of professional sports. Steve Kerr, coach of basketball's Golden State Warriors, invoked the press secretary's name in joking about his long-ago, short playing stint with the Orlando Magic:\u00a0\"Sean Spicer will be talking about my Magic career any second now \u00a0...\u00a014,000 points! Greatest player in Magic history!\" Trump scorned many journalists throughout his presidential campaign, and there is evidence it helped him with many voters. Conservative Republicans have long distrusted the media, and the journalism profession's approval ratings are low \u2014\u00a0in some cases lower than those of politicians. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to Trump during the campaign, described reporters as \"mortal enemies,\" and told Fox News that Trump's team should realize that \"every\u00a0day they\u2019re in office\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether it\u2019s four years or eight years, every day \u2014 they're going to have absolute hostility from the propaganda wing of the left.\u201d Combative at times, conciliatory at others, Spicer also cracked a joke about his predecessor, Obama White House press secretary Josh Earnest. \"I know that Josh Earnest was voted the most popular press secretary by the Press Corps,\" Spicer said. \"So after reading \u2014\u00a0checking my Twitter feed \u2014\u00a0I shot Josh an email last night letting him know that he can rest easy, that his title is secure for at least the next few days.\" ",

One presidential memorandum called for the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fulfilling a promise made on the campaign trail in a move he says will help American businesses. \"Great thing for the American worker, what we just did,\" Trump said as he signed that presidential memorandum at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. The next presidential memorandum he signed was a hiring freeze on all federal workers \"except for military,\" he said. The final presidential memorandum of the morning was a reaffirmation of an existing law that bans federal funding for foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or pay for abortions. Trump previously said that he considers today his first \"real\" workday after Friday's inauguration, though he did do some business over the weekend. He made a trip to the CIA on Saturday, addressing members of the intelligence community, and then swore in his senior staff on Sunday. In a video message two weeks after his election, Trump pledged that on \"Day One\" he would take the following actions: Withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Cancel \"job killing\" restrictions on American energy Institute a rule that for every new regulation put in place, two old ones should be eliminated Ask the Department of Defense and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to develop a plan to protect infrastructure from cyberattacks Direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs Impose a five-year ban on executive officials' becoming lobbyists after leaving the administration Other White House officials tell ABC News that other executive actions could come related to a declaration of intention to renegotiate NAFTA, to immigration and to repealing the Affordable Care Act .

By Juliet Eilperin By Juliet Eilperin January 23 at 7:00 PM Follow @eilperin President Trump instituted a government-wide hiring freeze Monday, signing a presidential memorandum that would affect a large swath of the government but leave wide latitude for exemptions for those working in the military, national security and public safety. The move \u2014 coming on the new president\u2019s first full working day in the White House -- represents the opening salvo in what could be the most concerted effort to overhaul the federal workforce in 35 years. Critiquing the Washington establishment was central to Trump\u2019s campaign, and he placed federal employees at the center of his effort to \u201cclean up corruption and special interest in Washington D.C.\u201d His \u201cContract with the American Voter\u201d listed a hiring freeze as a key element. It was one of several executive actions the new president issued on Monday, including to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and to block U.S. funds from being distributed to international organizations that perform or discuss abortions. Trump\u2019s memorandum states that \u201cno vacant positions existing at noon on Jan. 22, 2017, may be filled and no new positions may be created, except in limited circumstances,\u201d though it does not apply to military personnel. \u201cThe head of any executive department or agency may exempt from the hiring freeze any positions that it deems necessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities,\u201d it reads, adding the head of the Office of Personnel Management can allow for hiring \u201cwhere those exemptions are otherwise necessary.\u201d 1 of 15 See what President Trump has been doing since his inauguration View Photos The new president met with business leaders the day after swearing in senior members of his White House staff.

Weeks, center, listen to Trump during the meeting. Matt McClain/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Speaking to reporters on Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said there\u2019s been \u201ca lack of respect for taxpayer dollars in this town for a long time and I think what the president\u2019s showing through the hiring freeze... that we\u2019ve got to respect the American taxpayer.\u201d \u201cSome people are working two, three jobs just to get by,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd to see money get wasted in Washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work that they do to pay their taxes.\u201d House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who is hoping to enact broader civil-service reforms that could make it easier to remove workers for misconduct and replace federal pensions with retirement plans often used in the private sector, said in an interview that he was \u201cvery supportive of freezing the net numbers of federal employees.\u201d But he said some agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service and those dealing with cybersecurity operations, had to be able to fill open positions. \u201cThe president is obviously working to fulfill a campaign promise. I concur with the goal,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of the details on the execution, we would love to work with him.\u201d The details at this point are a little bit murky. Officials at the Pentagon said on Monday evening that it wasn\u2019t yet clear whether the freeze would exempt civilian DoD personnel, which number roughly 750,000, or just uniformed employees. One Defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to address internal discussions, said that Pentagon lawyers were examining the directive. Vice President Pence, left, and National Trade Council adviser Peter Navarro, right, wait for President Trump to sign three executive orders, Monday, Jan. 23, 2017, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Evan Vucci/AP) Veterans \u2014 who make up 31 percent of the federal workforce \u2014 could also be disporportionately affected by the move because they receive a hiring preference when it comes to federal jobs. One unit of the Pentagon, according to an official who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters, is in the process of hiring between 20 and 30 veterans and is now looking at whether to put the hires on hold. Depending on how the exemptions are interpreted, according to New York University public service professor Paul Light, the freeze might affect fewer than 800,000 employees, or more than a fifth of the overall federal workforce. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s looking at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is looking in the wrong direction,\u201d Light said. \u201cThe real action\u2019s going to be on the Hill.\u201d Still, the move sparked an immediate outcry from federal employee union officials and some public service advocates. \u201cThere\u2019s real need for change in the federal government, and this is not the kind of change that\u2019s constructive,\u201d said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, in an interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t freeze into place what is already not what you want.\u201d Richard G. Thissen, president of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, noted that the federal workforce is now roughly 10 percent smaller than it was in 1967. Thissen said the freeze \u201cwould undermine the efficiency of government operations by creating hiring backlogs and inadequate staffing levels, and it is unlikely to save any money,\u201d he said. [ Federal officials rush to hire before Trump takes office ] The last two major, across-the-board freezes were instituted by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, who imposed them after taking office. In 1982, the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) issued a report concluding that both freezes ended up costing more money than they saved and were \u201cnot an effective means of controlling federal employment.\u201d Part of that expense stemmed from the hiring contractors to compensate for staff reductions; Trump\u2019s memorandum makes clear, however, \u201cContracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted.\u201d President George W. Bush imposed a hiring freeze in 2001, but it affected only selected agencies. Under President Obama some agencies, including the Pentagon, imposed hiring freezes due to budget constraints . Trump also instructed the head of OPM to \u201crecommend a long-term plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through attrition\u201d within 90 days, at which point the hiring freeze would expire. Rachel Greszler, a senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, said it made sense for Trump to impose an initial freeze so he can \u201cevaluate things and see where the waste and inefficiencies are\u201d in the federal government. \u201cHe needs that time so that more federal employees don\u2019t come onto the rolls, because it\u2019s extremely difficult to fire federal employees,\u201d Greszler said. However Stier said there are real deficiencies in the federal government already, and a freeze will just exacerbate them. The government spends nearly 80 percent of its $90 billion IT budget on operations and maintenance, and there are nearly three times as many employees over age 60 as under age 30. \u201cThat\u2019s not the workforce you want to freeze; you want to refresh it,\u201d he said. [ What does the hiring freeze mean for the federal workforce? ] The move will likely translate into a grayer federal workforce, where the average age is around 50. Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat who represents federal workers in his Virginia district, noted that a third of career employees are eligible for end-of-career benefits in September 2017. Without replacements, the average age \u201cgets a year older every year.\u201d And Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who also represents federal employees, said hey are \u201cused as a political punching bag,\u201d warning that the instructions will affect people across the country. Eighty-five percent of the federal workforce, he noted, \u201clives outside the Beltway.\u201d \u201cSo for lawmakers who think this only affects people inside the Beltway, think again,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis will affect your veterans\u2019 services, your Social Securty services your national parks, your forests.\u201d Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock also does not support what she called in a statement \u201cthis type of across-the-board freeze.\u201d Missy Ryan and Lisa Rein contributed to this report. ",

    "text": "(Jennifer A. Dlouhy) Another scheduled speaker, Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University , argued that the summit should have gone forward, no matter who had just been sworn in as the next president. He said he fears the move will set a precedent of government officials self-silencing, in part over fears of reprisal or loss of funding, rather than standing behind the established science around climate change. \"I don't know why they canceled the meeting, but I do know the meeting was important and should have been held. Politics is politics, but protecting the health of our citizens is one of our government's most important obligations to us,\" Maibach said in an email. \"Climate change is bad for America, and bad for the world, in so many ways. One of these ways is that it is harming our health, already, and is likely to get much worse over the next few decades unless we take action. As the nation's public health agency, we need CDC to be fully engaged in protecting our health from climate change.\" Evidence has continued to mount that climate change could pose major health risks to people around the world over the course of the 21st century. A report published in the Lancet last year, which included 45 authors in Europe and China, found that aggressively tackling the problem of climate change could be \"the greatest global health opportunity of this century,\" but that not addressing the problem \"threatens to undermine the last half century of gains in development and global health.\" The Obama administration also viewed the problem as a serious threat, and the White House last year held its own summit on climate change and public health. The Obama White House also undertook multiple initiatives to highlight the links between climate and health, most recently issuing a 300-page report last summer that underscored how a warming climate could exacerbate major public health problems. Among the threats: Millions more deaths caused by extreme heat. More frequent outbreaks of diseases transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes. Longer allergy seasons. Worsening air quality that could result in thousands more premature deaths each year from respiratory problems. Benjamin said Monday that he hopes the CDC is able to reschedule the summit, as it mentioned in its email. But even if it doesn't, he said his organization and other nongovernment groups will continue to spotlight the ominous connections between the planet's changing climate and threats to human health. \"We're committed to making sure the nation knows about the effects of climate change on health,\" he said. \"If anyone doesn't think this severe problem, they are fooling themselves.\" ",

    "text": "White House Pushes \u2018Alternative Facts.\u2019 Here Are the Real Ones. By NICHOLAS FANDOS Continue reading the main story Photo Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, before speaking live on TV outside the White House on Sunday. Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press WASHINGTON \u2014 Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the White House had put forth \u201calternative facts\u201d to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. She made this assertion \u2014 which quickly went viral on social media \u2014 a day after Mr. Trump and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had accused the news media of reporting falsehoods about the inauguration and Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the intelligence agencies. In leveling this attack, the president and Mr. Spicer made a series of false statements. Here are the facts. In a speech at the C.I.A. on Saturday, Mr. Trump said the news media had constructed a feud between him and the intelligence community. \u201cThey sort of made it sound like I had a \u2018feud\u2019 with the intelligence community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is exactly the opposite, and they understand that, too.\u201d In fact, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intelligence agencies during his transition to office and has questioned their conclusion that Russia meddled in the election to aid his candidacy. He called their assessment \u201cridiculous\u201d and suggested that it had been politically motivated. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him, Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material. \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d he asked in a post on Twitter. Advertisement \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 11, 2017 Mr. Trump said of his inauguration crowd, \u201cIt looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.\u201d Aerial photographs clearly show that the crowd did not stretch to the Washington Monument. An analysis by The New York Times , comparing photographs from Friday to ones taken of Barack Obama \u2019s 2009 inauguration, showed that Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd was significantly smaller and less than the 1.5 million people he claimed. An expert hired by The Times found that Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd on the National Mall was about a third of the size of Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. Mr. Trump said that though he had been \u201chit by a couple of drops\u201d of rain as he began his address on Inauguration Day, the sky soon cleared. \u201cAnd the truth is, it stopped immediately, and then became sunny,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I walked off, and it poured after I left. It poured.\u201d The truth is that it began to rain lightly almost exactly as Mr. Trump began to speak and continued to do so throughout his remarks, which lasted about 18 minutes, and after he finished. Speaking later on Saturday in the White House briefing room, Mr. Spicer amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u201d he said. There is no evidence to support this claim. Not only was Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd far smaller than Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009, but he also drew fewer television viewers in the United States (30.6 million) than Mr. Obama did in 2009 (38 million) and Ronald Reagan did in 1981 (42 million), Nielsen reported. Figures for online viewership were not available. Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009. Mr. Spicer said that Washington\u2019s Metro system had greater ridership on Friday than it did for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration. \u201cWe know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama\u2019s last inaugural,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. Neither number is correct, according to the transit system, which reported 570,557 entries into the rail system on Friday, compared with 782,000 on Inauguration Day in 2013. Mr. Spicer said that \u201cthis was the first time in our nation\u2019s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\u201d In fact, similar coverings were used during the 2013 inauguration to protect the grass. The coverings did not hamper analyses of the crowd size. Mr. Spicer said that it was \u201cthe first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\u201d The Secret Service said security measures were largely unchanged this year. There were also few reports of long lines or delays. Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting. Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

    "text": "WATCH Behind Trump's Plan to Move the US Embassy to Jerusalem 0 Shares Email Israeli officials are awaiting what could be one of the first announcements from the new Trump administration: a decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Such a move, which Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail, may please many Israelis but anger Palestinians as well as officials in Arab nations, who could see it as directly provocative and a hindrance to future peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinians claim Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and Trump, like the Israeli government, views Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201ceternal capital.\u201d Since Israel\u2019s creation, the United States has maintained that the status of the holy city of Jerusalem should be settled only in negotiations between the two parties, and Trump appears prepared to dramatically break with tradition. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, but neither leader\u2019s report of their conversation referred to a U.S. Embassy move. \u201cThe president emphasized that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties and that the United States will work closely with Israel to make progress towards that goal,\u201d the White House said in a statement. It also said that Trump invited Netanyahu to visit the White House in early February, making him one of the first foreign leaders invited to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. under the new administration. Ronen Zvulun via AP Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Jan. 22, 2017. \u201cWe are at the very beginning stages of even discussing the subject,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer told ABC News on Sunday about the embassy\u2019s location. Aides to Netanyahu told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz over the weekend that that no announcement of a U.S. Embassy move was imminent, leaving questions about when a decision could be announced or if it might be a gradual process. The right-wing mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, said that the Trump administration is committed to the move, telling Army Radio today that he\u2019s had conversations with people in the new administration that show \u201cthey are serious about their intentions.\u201d Barkat has long advocated for the move. \u201cI applaud President Trump on his historic announcement that the White House has begun discussions regarding moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem,\u201d Barkat said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump has proven that he is a true friend of the state of Israel and a leader who keeps his promises. This evening\u2019s announcement has sent a clear message to the world that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as the indivisible capital of the state of Israel. We will provide any and all necessary assistance to the U.S. administration to ensure that the embassy move is done seamlessly and efficiently.\u201d In December, Trump spokesman Jason Miller affirmed Trump\u2019s commitment to moving the embassy, telling reporters on the phone that Trump made that promise \u201cnumerous\u201d times during the campaign. Miller did not speculate on a timeline for a move or a site for the embassy. At an October Trump rally in Israel, Trump\u2019s nominee for the next U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, told ABC News that if State Department employees refuse to move the embassy, they would be fired. The most recent ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, a veteran policy adviser, has already packed up and vacated his office in Tel Aviv. Israeli Settlements in East Jerusalem Israel continues to build Israeli settlements \u2014 Jewish towns and cities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem and elsewhere in the West Bank. Right-wing Israelis, including Netanyahu, defend settlement construction for various historical, religious, political and security reasons. But the United Nations considers Israeli settlements in occupied territory illegal under international law. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, passed last month, states such settlements have \u201cno legal validity.\u201d The U.S., Israel\u2019s oldest and strongest ally, has traditionally seen the settlements as a one of the key obstacles to a two-state solution. For this reason, the Obama administration routinely and strongly warned Israel to freeze settlement expansion. Weeks before leaving office, Obama directed the U.S. to abstain from UNSC 2334 \u2014 a move that angered Trump and Netanyahu. Donald Trump\u2019s Pick for US Ambassador to Israel Signals Changes in US Policy According to former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power , more than 590,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank. Over the weekend, Israel announced plans to build nearly 600 Jewish settlement homes in East Jerusalem, with Netanyahu pledging \u201cunrestricted\u201d building in East Jerusalem soon, angering Palestinians. \u201cThe rules of the game have changed with Donald Trump\u2019s arrival as president,\u201d Meir Turgeman, Jerusalem\u2019s deputy mayor, said on Sunday. Turgeman, who serves as the chairman of the city\u2019s planning and building committee, told Israel Radio, \u201cWe no longer have our hands tied as in the time of Barack Obama. Now we can finally build.\u201d On Monday, Netanyahu said he too sees \u201csignificant opportunities\u201d under the Trump administration. In an interview with Israel\u2019s Army Radio, Jason Greenblatt, a co-chairman of the Trump campaign\u2019s Israel Advisory Committee, said, \u201cIt is certainly not Mr. Trump\u2019s view that settlement activities should be condemned and that it is an obstacle for peace, because it is not an obstacle for peace.\u201d Bloomberg via Getty Images Billionaire real estate developer Donald J. Trump, center, his daughter Ivanka Trump, right, and attorney David Friedman exit U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, Feb. 25, 2010. In an ABC News interview in October, Friedman took a similar position as Greenblatt, saying he believed Trump saw the settlements as legal. Friedman, as the president of the American Friends of Bet El Institutions, associated with the Jewish settlement of Bet El, has consistently and actively supported the construction of settlements. He was a frequent visitor to Israel before his appointment and owns property in West Jerusalem. The Battle for Jerusalem Previous U.S. administrations from both parties have long recognized Jerusalem as the thorniest issue in the peace process, maintaining that the final status of the city should be resolved in negotiations. East Jerusalem contains some of the holiest sites for Christians, Jews and Muslims, making it a particularly contentious topic between Israelis and Palestinians, who both lay claim to the city for historic and religious reasons. Most foreign nations keep their embassies in nearby Tel Aviv, including the U.S. since 1966. Jerusalem has been contested for centuries. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Israel and Jordan decided to divide the city, giving East Jerusalem to the Jordanians. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel captured East Jerusalem. While never officially annexed, the eastern part of the city is under the jurisdiction of the Israeli government, but Palestinians living in East Jerusalem do not enjoy Israeli citizenship, as do residents of West Jerusalem. In 1980 an Israeli law declared that \u201cJerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Jerusalem.\u201d A later amendment to that law stipulated that Jerusalem\u2019s boundaries were those from after the 1967 war. In 2002, Yasser Arafat, then the head of the Palestinian Authority, ratified a law that proclaimed Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Palestine.

    "text": "Environmental Activist Killed by SUV While Walking Barefoot Across US By KARMA ALLEN Jan 23, 2017, 3:27 AM ET 0 Shares Email A Rhode Island activist who was on a mission to walk across the country barefoot was struck and killed by an SUV while walking on a Florida highway on Saturday afternoon. Mark Baumer was walking on the shoulder of Highway 90 in Walton County, Fla. when the driver of the SUV veered off the road and hit him, ABC News affiliate WEAR reported on Sunday. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver has been identified as Sonja Siglar of Westville, Fla. The Florida Highway Patrol ruled out alcohol as a factor and said that charges are pending, according to WEAR. Baumer said he was hiking across the country to \u201csave earth\u201d and to raise funding for the FANG Collective, a non-profit organization that protests the natural gas industry. FANG confirmed Baumer\u2019s death in a Facebook post and asked the public to honor his memory by looking back at the blog posts and poems he produced during his barefoot trek across the U.S. \u201cWe are shocked and devastated to learn about the passing of our friend Mark Baumer,\u201d the organization said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cWe will work to commemorate and honor Mark's life in the best way that we can.\u201d According to his website, Barefoot Across America, Baumer began the journey in October of last year, when he vowed to chronicle the trip in daily video and blog posts. \u201cI began the journey on Oct. 13, 2016. I don\u2019t know when it will end,\u201d Baumer said on his website, urging visitors to donate to his YouCaring campaign. As of Monday, the \u201cCrossing America Barefoot to Save Earth from Climate Change \u201d campaign had raised more than $14,000, exceeding its goal by more than $4,000. \u201cEvery day corporations continue to profit from earth's destruction. I decided cross America barefoot to see if I could save Earth,\" the campaign said in its mission statement. \"I know this is a lofty goal, but I hope through my walk I can raise awareness about climate change.\" The campaign posted its last update on Jan. 16, when it announced that it was \u201c three-quarters of the way to $10,000.\u201d At least 50 donations had been made since yesterday, bringing the total number of supporters to about 400. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer moved swiftly Monday to change up how the daily press briefing is conducted, giving the first questions to publications seated toward the back while announcing the creation of \u201cSkype seats\u201d \u2013 as he also tried to hit reset with the media after a weekend dispute over inauguration crowd estimates.\u00a0 Instead of calling on front-row outlets like the Associated Press and others, Spicer gave the first questions of his first full-blown White House briefing to a New York Post reporter. He also called early on reporters from the Christian Broadcasting Network, Fox Business Network and Univision.\u00a0 Spicer further announced the White House would create four \u201cSkype seats\u201d for reporters not in the Washington area or who don\u2019t have a hard pass to attend the briefings in person. While doing so, Spicer moved to dial down the temperature with the media after a heated dispute broke out Saturday, when he excoriated reporters for allegedly underplaying President Trump\u2019s inauguration turnout. At the Saturday briefing, Spicer also condemned a reporter\u2019s erroneous claim, since retracted, that a Martin Luther King Jr. bust was removed from the Oval Office. But he focused on the dispute over crowd sizes \u2013 and in making his case, incorrectly cited\u00a0statistics from the Metro transit system to suggest Trump\u2019s inauguration attendance was bigger than that of then-President Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration. Spicer joked Monday that he wouldn\u2019t be claiming his predecessor Josh Earnest\u2019s title as most-popular press secretary any time soon, and went on to acknowledge he made a factual mistake. \u201cKnowing what we know now, we can tell that WMATA\u2019s numbers are different,\u201d Spicer said, referring to the agency that controls the Metro system. He said he was operating off stats given to him, and didn\u2019t pull them from \u201cthin air.\u201d He also noted the media routinely publish corrections, and said the administration \u201cshould be afforded the same opportunity.\u201d \u00a0 Spicer, though, stood by a claim he made Saturday that Trump\u2019s audience was the largest \u201cto ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\u201d Spicer said Monday: \u201cIt was the most-watched inaugural.\u201d He cited online audiences around the world in addition to television audiences and the in-person attendance. \u201cI\u2019d love to see any information that proves that otherwise,\u201d Spicer said. It is difficult to verify the claim, as such comprehensive statistics are not available. There is little question that Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration drew a bigger in-person crowd than Trump\u2019s ceremonies on Friday, based on aerial photography, Metro ridership statistics and other factors. Monday\u2019s press briefing and agenda, however, saw a return to some of the core issues Trump campaigned on in 2016 \u2013 especially on the economy.\u00a0 After Trump took action earlier in the day to withdraw the U.S. from the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Spicer highlighted Trump's meetings on \"working day one\" with business and union leaders.\u00a0 \"The president's top priority is to retain and attract American jobs,\" he said.\u00a0 Spicer also slammed Senate Democrats for holding up Cabinet nominations. \"It's time for Senate Democrats to stop playing political games with the core functions of government,\" he said.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Email CAMP HILL, Penn. -- A man who broke into a classmate\u2019s home in 2007 and stabbed the teenager and his parents to death has killed himself in prison, authorities said Monday. Cumberland County Deputy Coroner Jeff Miller said Alec Kreider, 25, was found hanging in his cell Friday at the state prison in Camp Hill. The Department of Corrections said staff members tried to revive Kreider after a guard found him unconscious in his cell.\u00a0 The State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill said that staff provided CPR, which EMS personnel continued, CBS Harrisburg affiliate WHP reported . Holy Spirit Hospital medical command pronounced Kreider dead at 4:31 p.m. Kreider was 16 when Kevin Haines and his parents, Thomas and Lisa Haines, were killed in May 2007. The couple\u2019s daughter, a college student, was awakened by the attacks and escaped unharmed. Kreider pleaded guilty in June 2008 to first-degree murder and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.\u00a0 Prosecutors in Lancaster County said Kreider lived with his mother in 2007, and their home was about a 10-minute walk from the home of Kevin, his 10th-grade Manheim Township High School classmate. Kreider was wearing dark clothing and wielding a hunting knife with a four-inch blade when he entered the victims\u2019 suburban Lancaster home through an unlocked door around 2 a.m., prosecutors said. He attacked Kevin\u2019s parents and then the youth in their bedrooms, they said. The couple\u2019s daughter, a Bucknell University student home that night, awoke to the sounds of a struggle in Kevin\u2019s room and rushed to her parents\u2019 room, where her mortally wounded mother told her to get help. She ran to a neighbor\u2019s home to call police. Prosecutors read aloud excerpts from a journal Kreider wrote after the slayings expressing a \u201cwant/need to kill people\u201d and admitting having \u201cmurderous thoughts.\u201d Told by the judge at his 2008 sentencing that the family and community deserved an explanation, Kreider replied, \u201cThere is none.\u201d He told the judge he had received treatment for depression and continued to take medications daily. Kreider\u2019s father, Tim, told Lancaster newspapers in 2014 that when his son confessed, he \u201cnever gave a motive ... only said something about Kevin annoying him lately.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mui January 23 at 2:10 PM Follow @ylanmui On his fourth day in office, President Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Crafted by the Obama administration, the trade deal failed to be ratified by Congress during Obama's two terms. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) President Trump began recasting America\u2019s role in the global economy Monday, canceling an agreement for a sweeping trade deal with Asia that he once called a \u201cpotential disaster.\u201d Trump signed the executive order formally ending the United States\u2019 participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the Oval Office after discussing American manufacturing with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room. The order was largely symbolic \u2014 the deal was already essentially dead in Congress \u2014 but served to signal that Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade during the campaign will carry over to his new administration. Trump did not directly address the North American Free Trade Agreement on Monday as he had promised during the election. However, he repeated his threat to punish U.S. companies that build factories overseas and ship products back home \u2014 a charge he has primarily leveled at automakers with operations in Mexico. And his hard-line opening stance could portend a contentious renegotiation of the 22-year-old deal with Mexico and Canada that Trump\u2019s senior advisers have called a top priority for the new administration. \u201cThis abrupt action so early in the Trump administration puts the world on notice that all of America's traditional economic and political alliances are now open to reassessment and renegotiation,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, trade policy professor at Cornell University. \u201cThis could have an adverse long-run impact on the ability of the U.S. to maintain its influence and leadership in world economic and political affairs.\u201d [ President Trump outlines his top priorities for trade and the economy ] The TPP was one of former president Barack Obama\u2019s signature efforts, part of a broader strategy to increase American clout in Asia and provide a check on China\u2019s economic and military ambitions. Several of the executives Trump met with Monday initially had supported the agreement, while the chief architect of the administration\u2019s trade policy, Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, was also once a booster for the deal. But ending TPP was one of the clarion calls of Trump\u2019s campaign, part of a global backlash against the drive toward greater internationalization that has defined the world economy since the end of World War II. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is in the midst of navigating her country\u2019s own break from established trading partners, is slated to visit with Trump later this week. A White House spokesman said meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto are in the works. \u201cWhat we want is fair trade,\u201d Trump said during his meeting with executives. \u201cAnd we're gonna treat countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly.\u201d President Trump started his first full week in office Jan. 23 by signing an executive order ending U.S. participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Since the election, TPP has become politically toxic in both parties. On Monday, five Democratic senators introduced legislation that would require the president to notify each of the 11 other countries involved in the deal of the United States\u2019 withdrawal. It would also block any so-called \u201cfast track\u201d approval of the agreement in the future. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka hailed the president\u2019s executive order and called for additional action. \u201cThey are just the first in a series of necessary policy changes required to build a fair and just global economy,\u201d he said in a statement. On Monday, Trump highlighted his proposal for a border tax as a centerpiece of the administration\u2019s trade policy. Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, who was among the business leaders who met with Trump on Monday morning, said the border tax was discussed extensively. He said the executives were asked to return in 30 days with a plan to shore up the manufacturing industry. \u201cI would take the president at his word here,\u201d Liveris said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything to harm competitiveness. He\u2019s going to actually make us all more competitive.\u201d Still, it remains unclear exactly how a border tax would be implemented. Testifying before the Senate finance committee last week, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Treasury Department said any border tax would be targeted at specific businesses. However, the president does not have the power to levy taxes, and international trade experts have warned singling out companies could violate existing treaties. [ Trump to CEOs: Stay here, and I\u2019ll wipe out 75 percent of regulations, fast-track factories ] House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has proposed allowing businesses that export goods to deduct many of their expenses, while those that import would not receive the same benefit. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump dismissed the plan, known as border adjustment, as \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d Economists have warned that many of Trump\u2019s proposals \u2014 including suggestions that he would impose blanket double-digit tariffs on goods from Mexico and China \u2014 could backfire on the American economy by causing prices to rise or igniting a trade war. And business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had lobbied extensively for passage of TPP, touting the deal as an engine of job growth and an important check on China\u2019s growing ambitions. \u201cTPP withdrawal will slow U.S. [economic] growth, cost American jobs, & weaken U.S. standing in Asia/world,\u201d said Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a tweet early Monday. \u201cChina could well be principal beneficiary.\u201d But other industry groups argued that Trump\u2019s approach would better leverage America\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest economy. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said his group is hoping that opening up NAFTA could provide more leeway to combat currency manipulation in countries outside the agreement. His group, which represents both industry and unions, is also seeking more stringent rules of origin that dictate how much production must occur with member countries to qualify for free trade status. \u201cThe details are going to matter a lot,\u201d Paul said. \u201cRenegotiating NAFTA obviously entails some risks and some rewards.\u201d Read more:\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Video Trump Cuts Business Regulations President Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday and proposed massive cuts in taxes and regulations for businesses. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump formally abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday, pulling away from Asia and scrapping his predecessor\u2019s most significant trade deal on his first full weekday in office, administration officials said. Mr. Trump sharply criticized the partnership agreement during last year\u2019s campaign, calling it a bad deal for American workers. Although the deal had not been approved by Congress, the decision to withdraw the American signature at the start of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is a signal that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors. In other action on a busy opening day, Mr. Trump ordered a hiring freeze in the federal work force, exempting the military. And he reinstituted limits on nongovernmental organizations that operate overseas and receive American taxpayer money from performing abortions. Republican presidents typically impose those restrictions soon after taking office, and Democratic presidents typically lift them when they take over. The president\u2019s withdrawal from the Asian-Pacific trade pact amounted to a drastic reversal of decades of economic policy in which presidents of both parties have lowered trade barriers and expanded ties around the world. Although candidates have often criticized trade deals on the campaign trail, those who made it to the White House, including President Barack Obama, ended up extending their reach. The enormous trade deal became a flashpoint in American politics this year, inflaming a debate over international commerce and lost jobs. The election of Donald J.Trump as president has essentially killed it. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he signed a document formalizing his decision. The withdrawal from the trade pact, he added, is a \u201cgreat thing for the American worker.\u201d Aides signaled that Mr. Trump may also move quickly on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement . He is scheduling meetings with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the two main partners in that pact, first negotiated by the elder President George Bush and pushed through Congress by President Bill Clinton. Nafta has been a major driver of American trade for nearly two decades, but it has long been divisive, with critics blaming it for lost jobs and lower wages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump outlined his views in his Inaugural Address on Friday , when he promised an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to the world. \u201cWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cProtection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\u201d He said that his policy would be to \u201cbuy American and hire American.\u201d The Obama administration arduously negotiated the Pacific trade pact over eight years. Under legislation passed by Congress, the accord could not be amended once completed, nor could it be joined without congressional approval. Mr. Obama never submitted the partnership for approval, understanding that a defeat in Congress would be worse than leaving the deal in hibernation.

This afternoon, I was informed that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump designated me the 34th Chairman of the @FCC .

No Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee supported Tillerson. Still, Tillerson passed through the committee with the support of all Republicans on the committee after Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, announced that he would support the former Exxon Mobil CEO, clearing the way for a vote before the full Senate. Rex Tillerson appears at his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. NBC News Sen. Rubio was holding out on support out of concerns that Tillerson refused to say that he would support the continuation of sanctions against Russia over their aggression in Ukraine and refused to say he would support sanctions in reaction to meddling in the U.S. elections. And, in opposition to Rubio's position, Tillerson also wouldn't call Putin a war criminal for killing civilians in Syria during air attacks. But in a Facebook post Monday morning, Rubio announced his support.

Two other critics, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also announced that they'd support Tillerson in a vote on the Senate floor. \"Business deal making is not diplomacy,\" said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, said before the vote. Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said he is concerned Tillerson refused to recuse himself from issues that could impact Exxon Mobil. \"The American people have a right to know that it's their interest and not Exxon Mobil's interest,\" Markey said. Tillerson has resigned his position from the oil conglomerate but said he would recuse himself from issues impacting Exxon for one year. His confirmation moves to the Senate floor where he needs the support of 51 senators for confirmation. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",
