    "text": "Jan. 10, 2017, 5:22 p.m. Trump is hit with allegations that Russia gathered compromising information on him Del Quentin Wilber On the eve of his first news conference in more than five months, President-elect Trump faces unverified allegations that Russian officials had gathered compromising information about his personal life and political associates, further deepening the controversy over Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The information is contained in a 35-page file that was published Tuesday by BuzzFeed , which said it was publishing the material in the interest of \u201ctransparency,\u201d but had not been able to corroborate it. Several news organizations reported that senior U.S. intelligence officials had included a two-page synopsis of the file in the materials they presented to Trump when they briefed him last week on evidence of Russian involvement in the election and that they had also informed top leaders of Congress about the allegations. The purpose of including the material was to back up their conclusion that Russia had acted to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, gathering information on both sides in the election, but only publicly releasing information damaging the Democrats, according to CNN, which first reported on the briefing. Trump responded in a tweet Tuesday evening that did not address any of the specific allegations, but denounced the stories. The material alleged that Russia for years had been \u201ccultivating, supporting and assisting\u201d Trump\u2019s political rise and possessed damaging personal and financial information that could be used to blackmail the president-elect. According to BuzzFeed and CNN, the dossier was compiled by a former British intelligence agent who was hired to do opposition research by Trump\u2019s Republican opponents and later by Democrats. The report was prepared over the summer and was provided to U.S. analysts. The two-page summary contained allegations that there was a \u201ccontinuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for Russian government,\u201d CNN reported, citing two national security officials. It also alleged that information sharing between Trump\u2019s team and the Russians went both ways. The Russians provided Trump\u2019s aides with \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d on Clinton, the report said, while Trump\u2019s associates gave Russian operatives information about Russian oligarchs. CNN reported that the U.S. intelligence community vetted the former British operative and found him and his network of sources to be credible enough to justify including some of the information in reports provided to elected officials. The existence of the file has circulated among political figures and reporters in Washington since at least October, when then-Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey saying that the FBI possessed \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.\u201d Mother Jones ran an article at that time reporting on the existence of the file and saying that the former British intelligence operative had provided his dossier to the FBI. The report on Tuesday became a viral sensation on social media, and even provided fodder for questioning at Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 Senate confirmation hearing. Sessions (R-Ala.), who was picked by Trump to be his attorney general, said he was not aware of the report and had no contacts with the Russian government. Latest updates ",

Established in 2008 by Notre Dame head football coach Brian Kelly and Paqui Kelly, the Kelly Cares Foundation has donated over $2 million to support causes locally, nationally and globally. Stuart Ramson/Invision for Kelly Cares Foundation/AP Images Email NEW YORK \u2014 A hero NYPD detective, known for forgiving a gunman who left him paralyzed, has died days after suffering a heart attack. He was 59. Steven McDonald died shortly after 1 p.m. Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital, where he\u2019d been admitted Friday, NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said. McDonald was appointed to the NYPD on July 16, 1984. CBS New York reports he was investigating a bicycle robbery in Central Park on July 12, 1986 when he was shot three times. Doctors told his wife that he wouldn\u2019t live through the afternoon. He was left quadriplegic and had to breathe on a ventilator. He publicly forgave the teen shooter, Shavod Jones, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In the years after the shooting, McDonald became one of the world\u2019s foremost pilgrims for peace. In 1995 he met with Pope John Paul II. That same year he was promoted to detective. He spoke at two Republican conventions. In 2004, he was promoted to detective first grade. McDonald took his message of forgiveness to Israel, Northern Ireland and Bosnia. \u201cNo one could have predicted that Steven would touch so many people, in New York and around the world,\u201d said Commissioner O\u2019Neill. \u201cLike so many cops, Steven joined the NYPD to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. And he accomplished that every day. He is a model for each of us as we go about our daily lives. He will be greatly missed, and will always remain a part of our family.\u201d Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, called McDonald \u201ca true American hero.\u201d \u201cSteven McDonald was the most courageous and forgiving man I have ever known,\u201d Lynch said in a statement. \u201cDespite the tremendous pain in his life, both physical and emotional, his concern for his fellow police officers and for the people of New York City never wavered. Since that fateful day in 1986, Steven dedicated his life to fighting hate and encouraging forgiveness through his actions. He was a powerful force for all that is good and is an inspiration to all of us. His, was a life well lived. We join his family, a true New York City police family, his friends and fellow officers in prayer and mourning the loss of a truly special man.\u201d Numerous New York politicians, public figures, and entities took to social media to pay tribute to McDonald.

    "text": "In Chicago farewell, Obama warns of threats to democracy Barack Obama, the citizen Barack Obama makes his presidential farewell address from\u00a0McCormick Place, Chicago. Jan. 10, 2017. (Chicago Tribune) Barack Obama makes his presidential farewell address from\u00a0McCormick Place, Chicago. Jan. 10, 2017. (Chicago Tribune) Privacy Policy Barack Obama said goodbye Tuesday night to a nation that delivered him a historic presidency and challenged Americans to fulfill democracy's promise as a new era of government in Washington, led by Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump , is about to begin. Even as Obama exits the world and national stage in little more than a week, he pledged to an estimated 18,000 gathered at McCormick Place in his adopted hometown of Chicago that his social and civic activism will continue \u2014 as a citizen. Joined by first lady Michelle Obama, daughter Malia, and Vice President Joe Biden , the president credited Chicago with playing a crucial role in his path to public service. Daughter Sasha remained in Washington because of a Wednesday morning school exam, the White House said. \"I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties and I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose in my life,\" Obama said in a nationally broadcast speech. \"And it was in a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss,\" Obama said. \"Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, and they get engaged, and come together to demand it.\" President Barack Obama gives his farewell address at McCormick Place in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. (Chicago Tribune) The address presented a dichotomy of Obama's traditional attempts to inspire optimism while also warning his belief that democracy was showing signs of gradual erosion. He cited perceived dangers that include rising income inequality, growing racial tensions, fear of terrorism and a fracturing of media that allows people to exist in their own political preference \"bubbles\" to hear what they want to hear regardless of fact or science. If anything, the speech demonstrated that while Obama is leaving the White House, the 55-year-old president is not headed to quiet retirement amid one-party Republican control of the nation, a controversial successor in the White House and a Democratic Party that finds itself in disarray and without focused leadership. And while he only mentioned the incoming president once by name \u2014 discussing the peaceful transfer of power that will come on Jan. 20 \u2014 Obama's message sought to combat some of the concepts and demographic appeals that Trump embraced to win the White House. Citing the growth of automation in displacing middle-class jobs in the future, Obama called for a new social compact \"to guarantee all our kids the education they need, to give workers the power to unionize for better wages, to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now and make more reforms to the tax code\" so corporations and wealthy individuals don't \"avoid their obligations to the country.\" \"We can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we can't be complacent about the goals themselves. For if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come,\" he said. While Obama said his election as the nation's first black president inspired optimism toward a \"post-racial America,\" he added that such a vision \"was never realistic.\" He also warned economic divisions have intensified racial divisions, particularly at a time when the growth of the nation's Hispanic population continues. To be serious about race, Obama said laws to fight discrimination in hiring, housing, education and criminal justice must be upheld \u2014 and \"hearts must change.\" President Barack Obama is a good and decent man.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I thought, over and over, as I watched his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago.\u00a0 This is a good and decent man. Among some, that\u2019s a wildly unpopular opinion. Obama, they shout or tweet or comment, is a tyrant! A racist! Un-American!... President Barack Obama is a good and decent man.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I thought, over and over, as I watched his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago.\u00a0 This is a good and decent man. Among some, that\u2019s a wildly unpopular opinion. Obama, they shout or tweet or comment, is a tyrant! A racist! Un-American!... (Rex Huppke) \"For blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face,\" Obama said, including \"the middle-aged white man who, from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages, but who's seen his world upended by economic, cultural and technological change.\" For whites, Obama said, \"it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the '60s, that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; when they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment but the equal treatment that our founders promised.\" Noting the increasing partisanship that marked his tenure as president, Obama warned another threat to democracy was the trend of people becoming \"so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions instead of basing our opinions on the evidence is out there.\" \"Without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent is making a fair point and that science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible,\" he said. In what may have been his most direct criticism of Trump, Obama spoke of the threat of terrorism as he hailed the vigilance of first responders and the military and vowed \"ISIL will be destroyed.\" But the president also warned that \"democracy can buckle when we give in to fear.\" \"So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are,\" Obama said. \"That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans,\" he added, drawing loud applause. \"That's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights \u2014 to expand democracy and human rights, and women's rights, and LGBT rights \u2014 no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem.\" Here's the text of President Barack Obama 's farewell address Tuesday at McCormick Place in Chicago: THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Chicago!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s good to be home!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 All right, everybody... Here's the text of President Barack Obama 's farewell address Tuesday at McCormick Place in Chicago: THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Chicago!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s good to be home!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 All right, everybody... Read the story Obama also warned of complacency toward government and politics, particularly among younger Americans. He urged citizens, regardless of party, to \"throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.\" Democracy's potential, he said, only works \"if our politics better reflects the decency of our people\" and if everyone helps to \"restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.\" \"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life. If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures and run for office yourself,\" Obama said. \"Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose.\" It was a celebratory atmosphere that greeted Obama for his final return as president to the city that shaped his career, the place he moved after becoming the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review to get his start as a community organizer, then to serve as a state and U.S. senator and ultimately for eight years as president. Chicago-area native Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam helped lead the Chicago Children's Choir in \"People Have the Power\" as a prelude to the speech and supporters chanted one of the Obama campaign themes, \"Fired up! Ready to go!\" as the lights dimmed. The president walked on stage, standing before a blue background filled with flags as a large presidential seal loomed atop. After initially failing to persuade people to sit down, Obama joked, \"You can tell I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions.\" The speech represented a continuation of a tradition launched by the nation's first president, George Washington, to present a farewell message to the country. By delivering it in Chicago, Obama gave a nod to the city of his politically formative years. But his address of about 50 minutes was not Chicago-centric and was one of the few instances in recent visits in which he did not touch upon one of the city's most troubling problems \u2014 the issue of gun violence \u2014 after last year saw more than 760 homicides. His remarks were interrupted early on when a woman shouted at him from the audience, holding a sign saying, \"Pardon us all now.\" That prompted supporters to try to shout down the protester by chanting, \"Four more years.\" Police removed the protester. The president only briefly touched on a list of accomplishments during his tenure, including the Affordable Care Act, which has provided health insurance to 20 million previously uninsured, that the new GOP administration and leadership in Congress has promised to dismantle.

Company management is set to approve the deal \u2014 which will also include appointing an independent monitor for the next three years \u2014 today or tomorrow, Volkwagen said in a statement. The courts must approve the company's settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Volkswagen Announces $15B Emissions Settlement Today\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of the arrest of Volkswagen emissions executive Oliver Schmidt this weekend. According to a criminal complaint unsealed yesterday, Schmidt allegedly conspired with other Volkswagen employees to defraud the federal government \u2014 and American consumers \u2014 by concealing the installation of a device designed to cheat emissions tests. As the company admits, the defeat device software, which was installed on about half a million diesel cars sold in the U.S. from 2009 to 2015, could detect when the car was undergoing emissions evaluations and adjust its nitrogen oxide emissions to comply with U.S. standards. When the software recognized the car was on the road, however, it would allow emissions up to 40 times higher than standards permit. The company has already agreed to pay more than $15 billion on the issue, repairing or buying back the polluting vehicles and setting aside money for environmental mitigation and the development of zero-emissions technology. 0 Shares ",

Jeff Sessions, Trump's attorney general pick, answers critics in first Senate confirmation hearing In a confirmation hearing repeatedly interrupted by protesters, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions became President-elect Donald Trump's first Cabinet pick to answer senators vetting his political record. Jan. 10, 2017.\u00a0 In a confirmation hearing repeatedly interrupted by protesters, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions became President-elect Donald Trump's first Cabinet pick to answer senators vetting his political record. Jan. 10, 2017.\u00a0 Del Quentin Wilber Contact Reporter Sen. Jeff Sessions forcefully defended\u00a0his civil rights record Tuesday and pledged, if confirmed as the nation\u2019s next attorney general, to put aside his personal views and uphold laws protecting abortion and same-sex marriage. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee as President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s pick to lead the Justice Department , Sessions also vowed to\u00a0recuse himself from decisions involving former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \u2019s handling of classified material. The daylong confirmation hearing was a mostly collegial\u00a0affair with fellow senators politely prodding the 70-year-old former federal prosecutor\u00a0to explain his record on issues ranging from torture to immigration. As a longtime member of the committee now reviewing his expected nomination to become the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer, Sessions has sat on the opposite\u00a0side of the witness table for five previous confirmation hearings for attorney general candidates. So it\u2019s no surprise that the seasoned Alabama lawmaker avoided any self-inflicted wounds during his testimony, keeping his composure amid questioning and periodic disruptions from protesters in the audience. Read the story When pressed on his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, for example, the conservative senator\u00a0told Democratic colleagues that both issues had been settled by the Supreme Court and that he would abide by those decisions.\u00a0Similarly, on the use of waterboarding against terrorism suspects, which Sessions has previously supported, he said Congress had clearly outlawed the practice. Session began\u00a0his testimony by offering\u00a0his most steadfast denial yet of allegations that as a U.S. attorney in the 1980s he had improperly targeted civil rights advocates for prosecution on voter fraud charges and had made racially insensitive comments about the Ku Klux Klan and minorities. \u201cThese are damnably false charges,\u201d Sessions said,\u00a0adding that he \u201cdid not harbor the race-based animosities I am accused of. I did not.\u201d Those accusations, made by fellow Justice Department attorneys at the time, helped torpedo Sessions\u2019 1986 nomination by President Reagan to become a federal judge. \u201cThere was an organized effort to caricature me as something that wasn't true,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt was very painful. I didn't know how to respond and didn't respond very well. I hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate. It wasn't accurate then and it's not accurate now.\u201d Sessions is again being assailed by civil rights groups , who point to his Senate record of voting against hate-crime legislation, immigration reform and efforts to ban torture\u00a0as evidence that he would not\u00a0fairly enforce the laws protecting minorities. Sessions testified he hoped to work closely with local police and would aggressively combat gun violence, gang crimes\u00a0and drug trafficking. He said he felt criticism of police misconduct should be \u201cnarrowly focused on the right basis\u201d because too often mistakes are used to\u00a0\u201dto smear whole departments\u201d and that \u201cplaces those officers at greater risk.\u201d The senator did not stray from his long-held hard-line views on immigration enforcement, testifying he would aggressively \u201cprosecute those who repeatedly violate our borders\u201d and\u00a0support rescinding an Obama administration program that deferred deportation of hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers, those brought to the country illegally as children. \"It is very questionable constitutionally,\" Sessions said of President Obama\u2019s\u00a02012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. He did not say whether he believed the 742,000 immigrants protected under the program should be deported. An unabashed opponent of marijuana use, Sessions was noncommittal about whether he might use his authority\u00a0to resume raids of pot-growing operations and dispensaries. Such law enforcement actions, deeply unpopular in states like California and Colorado, were effectively halted in recent years. Marijuana is now legal for recreational use in both those states, among others.\u00a0 On counter-terrorism, Sessions said he would fight the \u201cscourge of radical Islam\u201d and believed that the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, should continue to house terrorism suspects. Obama was unable to fulfill his pledge to close the prison, which still holds 55 detainees,\u00a019 of whom have been cleared for release. Sessions added that he does not support\u00a0\u201cthe idea that Muslims as a religious\u00a0group should be denied admissions to the United States,\u201d a position Trump once backed. The hearing is scheduled to continue Wednesday with a long list of witnesses, including Democratic Sen. Cory Booker , who said he will take the unprecedented step of opposing a fellow senator\u2019s candidacy for a Cabinet job.\u00a0 Sessions was the first of Trump\u2019s Cabinet contenders to begin what is expected to be a combative confirmation process over the next few weeks. Comparing Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet Open link Sessions, one of the most conservative members of Congress, is widely expected to win confirmation from his colleagues\u00a0in the Republican-controlled Senate.\u00a0No sitting U.S. senator has ever been rejected for a Cabinet position, and GOP senators on the committee offered nothing but unstinting support on Tuesday. Even so,\u00a0Sessions has a long and complicated history on racial\u00a0matters, and the toughest questions posed by senators focused on how he would deal with civil rights laws,\u00a0hate crimes and access to the polls.\u00a0 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, set a tough tone by saying that since the election, many citizens have expressed \u201cdeep anxiety about the direction of this country and whether this nominee will enforce the law fairly, evenly and without personal bias.\u201d \u201cToday we are not being asked to evaluate him as a senator,\u201d the California senator said, acknowledging that many of her Democratic colleagues like Sessions personally and professionally. \u201cWill he be independent of the White House? Will he tell the president \u2018no\u2019 when necessary?\u201d Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.)\u00a0grew testy when questioning Sessions about several\u00a0civil rights lawsuits Sessions had listed on his Senate questionnaire as examples of\u00a0\u201csignificant\u201d cases that Sessions personally litigated during his career. The Trump transition team later said that the cases were worthy of being mentioned, even though Sessions had not been actively involved in them. Franken suggested that the Trump campaign or Sessions were trying to inflate his civil rights accomplishments. Sessions replied\u00a0that he had\u00a0listed the cases because they were \u201chistoric\u201d and that they \u201cwere the kind of cases that were national in scope, and deserved be listed on the form.\u201d The would-be attorney general waded into many of controversial issues that have long dogged the Justice Department, including whether it\u00a0should reopen its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of State. The FBI and Justice Department decided that criminal charges were not warranted despite having determined that Clinton and her aides unintentionally sent classified information over the system. During the campaign, Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the matter but has since backed off that pledge.\u00a0 Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential bid, said he would recuse himself from any Clinton-related matters because he had often attacked her on the campaign trail. Sen. Lindsey Graham \u00a0(R-S.C.)\u00a0asked whether Sessions believed Russia was behind the the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta . Emails hacked from the DNC and Podesta\u2019s email account\u00a0disrupted the Clinton campaign, and the intelligence community and the FBI have concluded that the cyberattacks were ordered by high-ranking Russian officials with the goal of hurting Clinton and helping Trump.\u00a0 Sessions said he had not been briefed on the investigation but has \u201cno reason to doubt\u201d the findings. As attorney general, Sessions would play a large role in helping decide how to respond to such an attack during Trump\u2019s tenure. \u201cWhen a nation uses their improperly gained \u2026 information to take policy positions that impact another nation's democracy or their approach to any issue, then that raises real serious matters,\u201d Sessions said. Trump, by contrast, has questioned the intelligence findings of Russian\u00a0hacking, calling the assertions\u00a0an effort to delegitimize his election. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would recuse himself from any investigations involving Russia and the Trump campaign, saying he had not publicly commented on that and would review any such case to determine whether \"it should stay within the jurisdiction of the attorney general or not.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Tonight, President Obama returns to Chicago to give a prime-time farewell address. \u00a0 Attorney general nominee Sen.

Guede was in court for the court\u2019s decision, after an hour\u2019s deliberation. When the Cassation court upheld Guede\u2019s conviction in 2010, it ruled he didn\u2019t act alone but didn\u2019t name any accomplices. His lawyers argued that conclusion conflicts with the Knox and Sollecito acquittals. Italy\u2019s justice system involves two levels of appeals. Convictions aren\u2019t considered final until all appeals are exhausted, a process that can take years. Revising final verdicts is extremely rare in Italy. The Florence court didn\u2019t elaborate on why it rejected Guede\u2019s bid. His lawyer, Tommaso Pietrocarlo, said the defense will consider appealing to the Cassation court on the same issue that failed to persuade the lower level tribunal Tuesday. Guede has denied killing Kercher. Guede was initially sentenced to 30 years in prison, reduced on a previous appeal to 16 years. Last year, for good behavior behind bars, Guede was allowed an overnight stay at a house run by volunteers assisting inmates. In a case closely followed in the United States, Knox and Sollecito steadfastly proclaimed their innocence. Their judicial saga included time in prison following convictions, and release after an acquittal, before being definitively acquitted of the murder in 2015. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Six months after a Democratic National Committee staffer was gunned down on a Washington, D.C., street, suspicion that he may have been the source who passed incriminating DNC emails on to WikiLeaks persists despite his own parents' strong doubts. Seth Rich, who was killed July 10 and would have turned 28 earlier this month, worked as a DNC data analyst and had recently built a database for spurring voter turnout. Despite speculation -- fueled by WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's own cryptic comments -- that he may have provided some of the emails that rocked the 2016 presidential election, Rich's father rejects such rumors. \u201cAnyone who knew Seth knew that wasn\u2019t the way he would have handled the problem,\" Rich\u2019s father, Joel Rich, told FoxNews.com in an exclusive interview, calling Assange\u2019s statements \u201cbizarre.\u201d \"He would not go outside the system.\u201d Seth Rich, shown here with his mother, Mary, had long dreamed of working in Washington. (Courtesy: Rich family) Like the Washington police, Rich believes his son was more likely killed in a robbery gone awry. \u201cThe reason Seth was killed is probably because he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d said his father. \u201cThere are all kinds of scenarios, but until something else is proven, these are just scenarios.\u201d Rich was a cheerful, compassionate person, who wanted to make a positive impact, said his father. \u201cSeth above all wanted to make a difference in the world,\" Rich said of his son. \"At work, Seth was able to extend his desire to make everyone feel included to the basic right to vote in American elections.\u201d Expand / Contract Rich often dressed in patriotic colors, and believed his job with the DNC allowed him to serve his country. (Courtesy: Rich family) One reason for the speculation that Rich may have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks is that Assange offered a $20,000 reward leading to the arrest of the killers. That sum, added to Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman's $100,000 reward and the D.C. police's $25,000, tally more than any other reward offered in such a case in the nation\u2019s capital. During an Aug. 9 interview on Dutch television and in subsequent media interviews, Assange implied that Rich was killed because he was the WikiLeaks source of emails from top DNC officials showing they conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party\u2019s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz having to resign as DNC chairperson. \u201cWe're interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeaks sources, Assange later told Fox News Channel. On the morning of his death, Rich had left his favorite watering hole, Lou\u2019s City Bar, about 1 a.m. to walk home, something that normally took 20 or 30 minutes. He tried twice to call his father, who had gone to sleep. He then called a fraternity brother and after that had two separate conversations with his girlfriend, Kelsey Mulka. Around 4:17 a.m., when Rich was about a block and a half from his home, his girlfriend heard other voices over the phone but was reassured by Rich that he was nearly home. Two minutes later, Rich was shot multiple times. Rich died at a nearby hospital. Security footage from a nearby market showed two men following Rich through a crosswalk by his home moments before he was shot, FoxNews.com has learned. The camera only captured the assailants\u2019 legs and Rich after he was shot and fell onto the street. Police said Rich, who was shot twice in the back, was likely the victim of a robbery, though nothing of value, including his wallet, phone, keys, watch and gold necklace, were stolen. \u201cThe Metropolitan Police Department is committed to bringing the person or persons responsible for Seth Rich\u2019s death to justice, D.C. police told FoxNews.com in a statement. \"As we mark the six-month anniversary of his death, we urge anyone with information to come forward and help bring his family the answers they deserve.\u201d Rich would have had access to sensitive DNC information. His main duty at the DNC was to build an online system to get out the vote. The system, which combines government data, technologies and formats from all 50 states, allows anyone to check if they are registered to vote and, if not, where to register and how. His talent was noticed. Four days before he was killed, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign had offered Rich a job, according to his father. His parents believe he would have accepted the position. On August 3 of last year, Rich\u2019s parents went to D.C., where they attended a tribute to their son at Lou\u2019s City Bar. \u201cAbout 150 people came and the event went on for hours,\u201d his father said, noting many of his friends shared fond memories. Many of those same friends have done work in the community in his honor. On Jan. 3, just a day before what would have been his 28th birthday, Rich's friends volunteered at the D.C. Humane Society, a place Rich had served. \u201cThis was rewarding and made my wife Mary and I feel good that Seth touched people who also want to make a difference.\u201d Joel Rich said his son was a people person, someone who went out of his way to welcome new people into his circle. He was a patriot, who often dressed in red, white and blue and slept with an American flag above his bed. \u201cWhat makes Seth stand out is wanting to help others and wanting to make a difference,\" his father said. \"As a parent, you always think your children are great, but after speaking to people who knew him who started calling the day after he was killed, we realized we didn\u2019t have to be as modest about what we said about him.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 The same jury that convicted Dylann Roof in the 2015 massacre at Emanuel AME church reached a unanimous verdict on his sentence: death. Roof looked down silently as the panel announced its decision in U.S. District Court in Charleston, S.C. late Tuesday afternoon. After the jury left the courtroom, Roof asked Judge Richard Gergel for new lawyers. Gergel told Roof he could make that argument at his formal sentencing hearing Wednesday morning. Insisting on representing himself in the sentencing phase of his trial, Roof\u2019s court-appointed defense team, which included renowned lawyer and capital punishment opponent David Bruck, was largely sidelined. \"We want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof's actions,\" Roof's defense said in a statement. \"Today's sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.\" Roof's family said in a statement they will \"continue to pray for the Emanuel AME families and the Charleston community.\"\u00a0 \"We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people,\" the statement read. \"We wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt.\" Earlier in the day, Roof delivered his own closing argument, in which the white supremacist denied that he was filled with hatred. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fair to say that the prosecution hates me because they\u2019re trying to give me the death penalty?\u201d Roof asked rhetorically. \u201cAnyone who hates anything, in their mind has a good reason for it. And sometimes that\u2019s because they\u2019ve been misled and sometimes it isn\u2019t. But I would say that in this case the prosecution, along with anyone else who hates me, are the ones who have been misled.\u201d Roof concluded his closing argument after only five minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d he said. The brevity of Roof\u2019s statement stood in stark contrast to the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, which lasted for two hours. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson reminded jurors how the nine victims at\u00a0\u201cMother Emanuel\u201d Church had welcomed Roof, a stranger who had shown up at their Wednesday evening Bible study. AIRPORT SHOOTING SUSPECT'S MOM PLEADS: 'DON'T EXECUTE MY SON' \u201cThe defendant had come not to learn, not to receive the Word, but he came with a hateful heart and a Glock 45,\u201d Richardson said. Richardson mentioned all of the victims by name, describing their importance to the community and their families, and the terrible loss caused by their untimely deaths. He contrasted these \u201cparticularly good people\u201d with the horrific nature of Roof\u2019s crimes, his racist views and \u201chis belief in Hitler as a saint, as an icon, as someone to be emulated.\u201d The prosecution showed the jury photos of Roof with his now familiar blank stare, pointing a pistol at the camera during target practice. \u201cHe also chose to videotape himself doing it so that he could see the very last images that these victims would see,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cHe wanted to see what he would look like as he stood over them.\u201d Inside the courtroom, Roof looked straight forward, displaying no obvious emotion as the prosecution showed the jury graphic photos of the deceased victims\u2019 bodies lying on the bloodstained floor of their church meeting room. Richardson then went on to cite Roof\u2019s apparent lack of remorse for the crimes. He quoted from a journal removed from the defendant\u2019s jail cell back in August of 2015 in which Roof writes, \u201cI do not regret what I did. I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.\u201d The prosecutor reminded jurors that even during this trial, Roof had entered the courtroom wearing hand drawn racist symbols on his shoes. \u201cUnrepentant, no remorse,\u201d Richardson added. At the conclusion of his closing argument, Richardson urged jurors, \u201cSentence this defendant to death for killing Clementa Pinckney.\u201d He repeated the phrase eight more times to add the names of each victim. The same panel of three black jurors and nine whites that convicted Roof back in December once again sided with the prosecution, unanimously calling for the ultimate punishment.

(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) 4799 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 505 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, facing a barrage of challenges to his record on civil rights enforcement and questions about racial tolerance as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee, on Tuesday rejected the \"false caricature'' that has long shadowed his public life and asserted that the Justice Department under his direction would \"never falter in its obligation to protect the rights of every American, particularly those who are most vulnerable.\u2019\u2019 The first of the Trump administration\u2019s most controversial nominees to appear for Senate confirmation, the 70-year-old former federal prosecutor and state attorney general\u00a0arrived in the marble encrusted hearing room packed with protesters\u00a0in an attempt to allay myriad grievances left in the wake of the nominee\u2019s past racially charged statements and long anti-immigration record. Yet even before he could take his seat at the witness table, protesters wearing Ku Klux Klan costumes erupted with shouts of \"white power'' before they were ushered out, the first clash of several pitting demonstrators against Capitol Police. At least eight others had to be dragged out during the course of the\u00a0session, some yelling, \"No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA.\" Sessions sat silently while protesters were moved before pressing ahead each time, at one point affirming to the Senate Judiciary Committee that\u00a0\"I deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters.\u00a0\u201cI have witnessed it. ...\u00a0While humans must recognize the the limits of their abilities \u2014 and I do \u2014 I am ready for this job. We will do it right.'' Directly addressing claims that he sympathized with hate groups, including the KKK, and sought to intimidate black voters in a controversial 1985 voting fraud prosecution, Sessions called the assertions \"false.'' And he denied referring to civil rights organizations as \"un-American,'' an allegation made during his failed 1986 bid for a federal judgeship. That 1986 hearing, Sessions said, propelled a inaccurate \"caricature'' of his views on race and equality. \"I do hope that I'm perhaps wiser and maybe a little better today,'' he said. \"I did not harbor the kind of racial insensitivity that I was accused of. I did not.'' Responding to questions from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., he also rejected any attempt, as once proposed by Trump, to deny prospective Muslim immigrants to the U.S., on the basis of their religion. \"I do not believe that Muslims as a religious group should be denied entry to the U.S.,'' Sessions said. As he offered the remarks, Khizr Khan, a vocal critique of Trump and the father of a Muslim soldier killed while serving in Iraq, sat a few rows behind the nominee. Khan has urged the Senate to reject Sessions' nomination. On the broader issue of immigration, where he stands as the Congress' chief opponent to Obama administration efforts at reform, the senator conceded that the federal government lacked the resources to engage in a mass deportation of illegal immigrants, as Trump has previously suggested. \"We are not in a position, financially or otherwise, to seek out and remove (all illegal immigrants),'' Sessions said. \"Let's fix the system.'' Nevertheless, he affirmed an unstinting stance on border security. \"We will prosecute those who repeatedly violate our borders,'' the nominee told the panel. \"It will be my priority to confront these crises vigorously, effectively and immediately.''

We've run our leg in a long relay of progress, knowing that our work will always be unfinished. And we've reaffirmed the belief that we can make a difference with our own hands, in our own time.\" Speaking to NBC News' Lester Holt Tuesday aboard Air Force One, President Obama said he hoped he could properly convey the gratitude he felt, both for his staff and his supporters. \"You know when you when you reflect back on eight years, for all the highs and the lows, the one thing that is a constant is the incredible dedication of the people who got you there,\" Obama said, adding that he meant everyone from his staff to \"the people who, you know, would say that the work we did made a difference.\" \"I think that that sense of gratitude that I feel for those folks, I just hope I'm able to express that,\" he said.

Obama is likely to buttress his case with a battery of statistics as he touts the accomplishments of his two terms, which among other things includes a record 75 straight months of job growth, more than 15 million new jobs, a long-awaited rise in hourly wages \u2014 and the removal of Osama Bin Laden as a threat to America.

    "text": "Dangerous Blizzard, Flooding as New Storm Hits California By janie har and jocelyn gecker, associated press SAN FRANCISCO \u0097 Jan 10, 2017, 1:46 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Severe Weather in the West Causes Flooding, Mudslides 0 Shares Email The latest in an onslaught of winter storms bore down on California Tuesday with what authorities warned was a life-threatening blizzard for the Sierra Nevada mountains and a new round of flooding for Northern California river towns where thousands of people remained under evacuation orders. Forecasters warned of up to 8 feet of snow in the highest mountains, with up to 5 feet of snow around the resorts of Lake Tahoe, high risk of avalanches, and wind gusts of over 50 miles an hour. White-out conditions were possible, said Scott McGuire, a forecaster for the National Weather Service based in Reno, Nevada. Forecasters called conditions potentially deadly for drivers in the mountains. \"People need to avoid traveling if at all possible,\" McGuire said. Many ski resorts shut down Tuesday because of the dangerous storm. At Mammoth Mountain, one of the state's southernmost big ski resorts, gales forced operators to close all but one ski lift. \"We'll open more if we can,\" spokeswoman Joani Lynch said. \"We have high winds and pretty heavy snowfall right now.\" Tuesday's storm was the latest in days of back-to-back systems that have brought the heaviest rain in a decade to parts of Northern California and Nevada. The storms are part of an \"atmospheric river\" weather phenomenon that draws precipitation from the Pacific Ocean as far west as Hawaii. Its impact can be catastrophic for areas hit by the heaviest rain. In Sacramento, workers with California's Department of Water Resources opened a half-dozen century-old spill gates on the state's biggest river, the Sacramento, before dawn Tuesday to ease pressure on the swollen river and on levees. California is in a six-year drought, and the last time state workers had needed to open the gates and spill water into side channels was December 2005. \"They were a little bit rusty,\" department spokesman Ted Thomas said, \"but they were able to open them fine.\" Heavy rain were fell Tuesday for hours in areas of Northern California that were soaked by more than a foot of rain over a 72-hour period that ended early Monday, forcing hundreds to evacuate and leaving thousands without power. The heavy rains forced rivers out of their banks and toppled trees, among them the famed \"Pioneer Cabin\" giant sequoia in Calaveras Big Trees State Park that had a drive-thru tunnel carved into its base more than a century ago. In Northern California's wine region, authorities expected the Russian River to rise 4 feet above flood stage Tuesday afternoon, after spilling out of its banks and flooding vineyards and riverside resorts and mobile-home parks over the weekend. Parts of California's wine country in Sonoma County were among the hardest hit, receiving up to 13 inches of rain from the weekend storms. Rolling hills and vineyards along the scenic route known as River Road were submerged with just the tips of the vines rising above flood water. Melba Martinelli, who lives in the Russian River town of Guerneville, waded through her yard Monday in knee-high rain boots, surrounded by flooded streets. \"I'm watching the water come up higher and higher, and my boots are almost going underwater now,\" Martinelli said. \"The river is coming up the street now. It's pretty scary.\" In the San Francisco Bay Area, a coastal flood advisory was in effect through Friday, with a forecast for up to 7-foot \"king tides\" that could pose a flooding risk for coastal roadways, said Steve Anderson, a National Weather Service forecaster in Monterey, California. After closing over the weekend, Yosemite National Park planned to reopen the valley floor to visitors Tuesday morning after a storm-swollen river forced its closure through Monday, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. Emergency workers in Nevada voluntarily evacuated about 1,300 people from 400 homes in a Reno neighborhood as the Truckee River overflowed and drainage ditches backed up. In Colorado, snow and strong winds worked together to set off an avalanche up to 15 feet deep that closed Interstate 70 at Vail Pass in Colorado early Tuesday. A tractor-trailer carrying mail was caught in the slide, but the driver wasn't injured, the Colorado State Patrol reported. The avalanche risk for most of Colorado's mountains is expected to remain high through at least Wednesday. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Gecker reported from San Francisco. Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer in San Francisco, Christopher Weber in Los Angeles, Scott Sonner in Reno, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Scott Smith in Fresno also contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 This version corrects that Sonoma County residents are under evacuation advisories, not evacuation orders. 0 Shares ",

The pair of confirmation hearings have been delayed at by at least one day after negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, according to a Democratic Senate aide.

The hearing for billionaire businesswoman Betsy DeVos to be Education Secretary was originally scheduled to begin Wednesday but has been postponed until Jan. 17. The confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Pompeo to be director of the CIA has been delayed from Wednesday to Thursday because of incomplete paperwork. Related: Confirmation Hearings Highlight Pitfalls for Trump In addition, Andrew Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants who is nominated to be Labor Secretary, was tentatively scheduled for Thursday but has been pushed back until next week at the request of Republican leadership, according to a Republican Senate aide. Puzder has come under fire from Democrats because of his opposition to the minimum wage and his views about the treatment of workers. Trump's \"proposed cabinet is unlike any other in terms of its wealth, corporate connections and hard right ideological views, and the American people deserve nothing less than open and deliberate hearings going forward,\" Schumer said.

The head of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, sent a letter to Schumer over the weekend calling the lack of paperwork by nominees unprecedented. Because they are in the minority, Democrats have no ability to block the hearings outright, but their public pressure campaign seems to have helped to slow the process. McConnell is hoping to have seven of Trump's nominees confirmed by Trump's first day in office on January 20. He said on Sunday that Democrats should \"grow up\" and drop their \"little procedural complaints.\" Here's the updated list of confirmation hearings over the next few days: January 10 Attorney General -- Sen. Jeff Session, R-Alabama: His confirmation hearing is currently underway. He is a colleague of the senators who will vote on his confirmation but his conservative positions on immigration, LGBTQ issues and voting rights could complicate his confirmation hearings. Homeland Security Secretary -- retired Marine Corp General John Kelly: Kelly will be questioned beginning Tuesday afternoon about Trump's proposed Muslim ban and border wall with Mexico. January 11 Secretary of State -- ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson: Tillerson's ties to Russia will be a hot topic and Democrats want his complete tax returns. Transportation Secretary -- Elaine Chao, former Secretary of Labor: Will be instrumental in Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan and as a past member of President George W. Bush's cabinet is unlikely to draw much real opposition. (continued) Attorney General -- Sen. Jeff Session, R-Alabama (continued) Homeland Security Secretary -- retired Marine Corp General John Kelly January 12 Housing and Urban Development Secretary -- Ben Carson, surgeon: The former Republican presidential candidate was an early supporter of Trump after his own bid failed but he has no experience managing a large organization. Defense Secretary -- retired Marine Corp General James Mattis: Well-liked and will likely be easily confirmed. Commerce Secretary -- investor Wilbur Ross: The billionaire has no public service record and vast financial holdings CIA Director -- Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas: Will be asked about Trump's views on the intelligence community. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

Barrack, addressing the press pool gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower, described the President-elect\u2019s vision for the ceremony in artistic terms. \"What we've done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers,\" he said, \"is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place.\" \"It's a much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration that's a coronation,\" Barrack continued. \"That's the way this president-elect wanted it. I think it will be contributive. It will beautiful. The cadence of it is going to be 'let me get back to work.'\" Barrack said that Trump was determined put his stamp on the proceedings. \"It's a delicate balance between abiding by tradition and the President-elect, having his own fingerprint on a fresh canvas.\" \"Mostly he's abiding by tradition, especially in the swearing in ceremony. In the moment, when you look up that west Capitol entrance and that shift of power in a moment goes from a very strong powerful man of one party to another very strong powerful man of another, that cadence and tradition of America allowing the power to change like that? It's sacred. So he's kept that pretty much the way it is.\" Trump has been criticized for the lack of A-list celebrities participating in Inauguration events. But Trump is not concerned. \"The so-called 'A' list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!\" Trump tweeted . \"We're fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the President-elect,\" Barrack told reporters. The Presidential Inaugural Committee has not yet announced a list of performers for the \"Make America Great Again! Welcome Concert,\" which is scheduled for the day before the Inauguration. Before heading to the Capitol, Trump and his wife Melania will join President and First Lady Obama for \"coffee or tea\" at the White House before riding together to the event. \"That's a great moment, that's a great moment,\" said Barrack. 0 Shares ",

No one was injured in the incident inside the One Credit Union, according to Tuscaloosa Police Lt. Teena Richardson. Police Chief Steve Anderson said the incident began as a bank robbery. According to Anderson, police responded so quickly to the call that the suspect was still in the credit union when police arrived. The suspect then started taking hostages, he added. Police stormed the bank, bringing the incident to an end, Anderson said. The suspect's connection to the bank is not immediately clear, police said. The credit union is across the street from the University of Alabama's law school. The University of Alabama issued a campus alert when the hostage situation was reported, urging people to avoid the area. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "CBS News January 10, 2017, 2:03 PM USA Gymnastics, Michigan State, Dr. Larry Nassar sued by 18 athletes over alleged sexual assaults Larry Nassar, an osteopathic physician, works with patient Kim Wilson, 15, in East Lansing, Mich., on July 15, 2008. Nassar was a doctor for the U.S. gymnastics, trampoline and tae kwon do teams during the Olympics in Beijing. Becky Shink/Lansing State Journal Email Last Updated Jan 10, 2017 7:36 PM EST DETROIT - A Michigan doctor accused of sexually abusing gymnasts was sued Tuesday by 18 women and girls, the latest legal action over alleged assaults, mostly at his clinic at Michigan State University . The lawsuit against Dr. Larry Nassar , Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and a Lansing-area gymnastics club was filed in federal court in western Michigan. It makes claims of civil rights violations, discrimination and negligence. CBS News usually doesn\u2019t name people who allege sexual abuse, but one of the plaintiffs, Rachael Denhollander of Kentucky, talked publicly about the lawsuit . She said she was assaulted by Nassar in 2000 when she was 15 and visited him because of wrist and back injuries. Denhollander, who was a gymnast, said she didn\u2019t file a complaint at the time because she believed her \u201cvoice would not be heard.\u201d She said Nassar was held in high esteem at Michigan State. He also was affiliated with USA Gymnastics. The abuse alleged by the 18 women and girls occurred over 20 years. Most were minors at the time and \u201ccloaked with innocence and trust of their youth,\u201d attorney Stephen Drew told reporters. Nassar now faces at least five lawsuits. Through lawyers, he\u2019s denied the allegations. He\u2019s also charged with possessing child pornography and sexually assaulting a girl at his Holt, Michigan, home and is being held in jail without bond. In a statement, Michigan State declined to comment on the lawsuit but said campus police are investigating Nassar with state and federal authorities. Outside lawyers also are advising the university on an internal review of Nassar\u2019s clinical work. He was fired in 2016. In a statement to CBS News, USA Gymnastics said it finds the allegations against Nassar \u201cvery disturbing.\u201d \u201cWhen we first learned of athlete concerns regarding Dr. Nassar in the summer of 2015, we immediately notified the FBI and relieved him of any further assignments,\u201d the statement read. \u201cUSA Gymnastics has fully cooperated with the FBI in its investigation. We find it appalling that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in this manner, and we are grateful to the athletes who have come forward.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY NETWORK In this Dec. 28, 2016, file photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) During a special briefing last Friday, leaders of the intelligence community gave President-elect Donald Trump a synopsis of unsubstantiated and salacious allegations that Russian operatives had obtained potentially compromising personal and financial information about the president-elect, a U.S. official confirmed Tuesday. The official who is not authorized to comment publicly, said that the document was provided along with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. The separate document presented to the president-elect represented a summary of a much larger 35-page compilation of documents prepared by a former foreign intelligence officer.\u00a0The officer, the official said, is known to U.S.\u00a0intelligence, but the contents of the specific contents of the document have not been verified. Trump responded Tuesday evening by Twitter, calling the report \"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\" Read more: Clinton allies react to reports on Russia, Trump The decision to present the information to Trump, first reported by CNN , was made after it was determined that the document \u2014 in many forms \u2014 had been circulated widely to political opposition researchers, U.S. lawmakers, journalists and others. CNN said it reviewed the compilation of the memos, described as originating as opposition research first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats.\u00a0Buzzfeed has\u00a0 posted the intelligence documents . In the end, U.S. authorities determined that Trump needed to know the information, if he didn\u2019t know its existence already, the official said, adding that the contents remained the subject of investigation.\u00a0The official declined to comment on Trump's reaction to the presentation. And the president-elect, who has scheduled his first news conference Wednesday , did not immediately comment on the revelations. The summary document also includes allegations that information was exchanged over a long period of time between the Russian government and Trump representatives. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, accused of meeting with a Russian operative in Prague last year, said in a tweet that \"I have\u00a0never been to Prague in my life.\" The news came on a day in which the Senate Intelligence Committee\u00a0conducted hearings into the reported Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and emails provided to the website Wikileaks. Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C.,\u00a0said the panel will conduct an independent review of the intelligence community's report about Russian interference to help Trump. FBI Director James Comey declined to answer questions from\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about whether the FBI is investigating possible contacts between the\u00a0Trump campaign\u00a0and the Russian government during the presidential campaign. \"I think the American people have a right to know this,\" Wyden said. \"And if there is a delay in declassifying this information and releasing it to the American people, and it doesn\u2019t happen before Jan. 20\u00a0(Inauguration Day), I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to happen.\" Wyden declined comment late Tuesday about the unsubstantiated reports that Russians have compromising information about Trump. The senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, also had no comment, said spokeswoman Rachel Cohen. Read more: Putin ordered hacking to help Trump, intelligence report says Then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., angry over FBI statements about the email investigation of Clinton, referenced these allegations in an October letter to the bureau. It said in part, \"it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.\" Rep. Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, D-N.Y., said late Tuesday that she finds the latest reports about Russia and Trump alarming and called on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to appoint a special counsel to continue investigating the allegations \"until all facts have been unearthed.\" \"I find troubling these reports that Russian intelligence apparatuses sought compromising information on the Republican candidate, as well, but released only information related to Democrats,\" the congresswoman said. \"However, particularly alarming are suggestions that surrogates for an American presidential campaign were actively exchanging information with Russian government intermediaries.\" She said the allegations \"raise important legal issues that need to be investigated quickly, thoroughly and impartially, without political interference.\" Contributing: Erin Kelly Posted!

The 22-year-old man charged with killing nine black worshipers at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. faces two death penalty trials, a first in U.S. history. Jenny Jarvie A federal jury on Tuesday condemned unrepentant white supremacist Dylann Roof to death for the June 2015 massacre of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina Bible study class. Roof stood stone-faced, showing no emotion, as U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel announced the jury's unanimous verdict, which came after about three hours of deliberation. Relatives and friends of the victims were quiet. Some left court smiling and embracing. \"Today we had justice for my sister,\" Melvin Graham, the brother of slain churchgoer Cynthia Hurd,\u00a0said outside the courthouse. \"This is a very hollow victory because my sister is still gone.\" Graham said the\u00a0death penalty was fitting for Roof, who last month was convicted of the killings, because his act was so brutal and he\u00a0showed no remorse. \"He just took them away from us because he wanted to,\" Graham\u00a0said. \"He decided the day, the hour, the moment my sister was going to die. And now someone is going to do that for him\u2026. He's in God's hands now.\"\u00a0 Before the jury began deliberating, Roof, who decided to represent himself during the sentencing phase of the trial,\u00a0offered the panel\u00a0no explanation or apologies for the shooting, saying that he felt he had to do it. In his last words to jury members before they decided whether to punish him with death or life in prison without parole,\u00a0Roof said he was misunderstood. Yet he ultimately declined to give jurors any explanation for the massacre or a single reason to spare his life.\u00a0 Roof acknowledged that he told FBI investigators after he was arrested that he had to do it. \u201cBut obviously that\u2019s not really true,\u201d he told the jury. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do it. I didn\u2019t have to do anything.\u2026\u00a0What I meant when I said that was that I felt that I had to do it, and I still do feel like I had to do it. \u201cAnyone, including the prosecution, who thinks that I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hate is,\u201d Roof said awkwardly, his face flushed as he read haltingly from notes. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything about me. They don\u2019t know what real hatred looks like. They think they do, but they don\u2019t really.\u201d White supremacist Dylann Roof opened fire June 2015 at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., killing nine people: six women and three men. A federal jury on Jan. 10 condemned Roof to death. Here is what we know about the victims: Cynthia Hurd,... (James Queally, Christine Mai-Duc and Kurtis Lee) Prosecutors, in turn, told jurors that Roof was a cold and calculated racist who dismissed a whole class of people as \u201cbrute animals\u201d and continued to believe the shootings were worth it, even after hearing of the \u201cimmeasurable loss\u201d of\u00a0his victims\u2019 loved ones. \u201cHe wants you to believe that you have been misled and that indeed he was justified,\u201d Assistant\u00a0U.S. Atty. Julius \u201cJay\u201d Richardson told the panel of nine white and three black jurors. \u201cHe wants you to believe he was justified in committing a modern-day lynching. Don\u2019t let that be.\u2026\u00a0Render the full measure of justice for this defendant. Sentence this defendant to death.\u201d The jury began deliberating Tuesday afternoon after Roof\u2019s closing arguments. Earlier, as federal attorneys wrapped up their case, they provided\u00a0a lengthy list of aggravating factors that they said justified the death penalty, rather than\u00a0life in prison. Not only had Roof killed multiple people and endangered others, prosecutors said, but he also conducted substantial planning, was motivated by racial prejudice\u00a0and hoped to incite others. They insisted\u00a0Roof continued to show \u201cnot one ounce of remorse.\u201d Last month, the same jurors found Roof guilty of all 33 charges related to the June 2015 massacre at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, including multiple counts of committing a hate crime against black victims, obstructing the exercise of religion and using a firearm to commit murder. Roof, who has developed a tense relationship with his defense team, asked the judge whether he would appoint new lawyers to help file a request for a new trial. Gergel told Roof he was \"strongly disinclined\" to appoint new attorneys but would listen to any motions Roof made Wednesday. Anyone, including the prosecution, who thinks that I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hate is. \u2014 Dylann Roof In closing arguments, the trial\u2019s lead prosecutor offered a window into each of the nine victims\u2019 lives, showing jurors family photos of them at ballgames, weddings, vacations and graduations.\u00a0 \u201cYou now know the last moments this last group of 12 spent together,\u201d Richardson told the jury, reminding them the nine victims were among a dozen who had gathered together that muggy June evening to study the gospel of Mark\u2019s parable of the sower. \u201cYou also now know how extraordinarily good these people were. \u201cThey welcomed the defendant with a kind word, a Bible, a handout and a chair,\u201d he said. Yet Roof \u201chad come not to learn, not to receive the word.\u2026 He\u2019d come with a hateful heart and a Glock.\u201d After showing images of Roof posing with a pistol and a Confederate flag, and engaged in target practice in his backyard, Richardson argued that the defense had failed to show any possibility that Roof was capable of any meaningful change or redemption. \u201cWe may indeed wish it to be true, but there\u2019s no evidence to support it,\u201d Richardson said. The 22-year-old high school dropout addressed the jury for only a few minutes during an opening statement in the death penalty hearing\u00a0last week to insist he was not mentally ill. \u201cOther than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn\u2019t, there is nothing wrong with me psychologically,\u201d he told the jury, referring to his attorneys\u2019 attempts to present evidence of mental health problems. Although Roof admitted he wanted to prevent his attorneys from presenting such evidence, he said, \u201cit isn\u2019t because I have a mental illness that I don\u2019t want you to know about and it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m trying to keep it a secret from you. The point is, I\u2019m not going to lie to you.\u201d At the beginning of the penalty phase of the trial, jurors learned that Roof had continued to show no remorse\u00a0weeks after the crime. \u201cI would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,\u201d Roof wrote in a journal found in his jail cell six weeks after his arrest. \u201cI am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.\u201d Roof added that he did feel sorry for the \u201cinnocent white children forced to live in this sick country\u201d and \u201cI have shed a tear of self-pity for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place.\u201d Usually during the sentencing phase of a death penalty case, the defense tries to mitigate the prosecution\u2019s case by presenting evidence about background issues, such as childhood upbringing and mental health problems, in an effort to encourage jurors to be more lenient. Yet from the beginning, Roof has resisted any idea of mounting a defense on the premise that he is mentally ill. \u201cI am morally opposed to psychology,\u201d he scrawled in a journal that investigators found in his car after the massacre. \u201cIt is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don\u2019t.\u201d In his statement to the jury Tuesday, as he spoke about how he felt the need to commit the killings, Roof\u00a0said: \u201cI think that it\u2019s safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go into a church and kill people.\u201d Over the last week, Roof declined to cross-examine any of the prosecution\u2019s 25 witnesses or present any witnesses of his own. Yet he filed several motions last week objecting that the prosecutor\u2019s victim impact testimony was excessive. \u201cThis part of the trial can be easily prejudiced by so much victim impact evidence, and I think the limits of due process have already been passed,\u201d Roof wrote last Thursday, objecting not only to the number of people testifying, but to the \u201cextent and depth\u201d of the testimony.

    "text": "SocjosensPG/Getty Images SocjosensPG/Getty Images Jamaica is facing a crisis as specialized nurses leave the island to take jobs in North America and Europe. The exodus has forced Jamaican hospitals to reschedule some complex surgeries because of a lack of nursing staff on their wards. James Moss-Solomon, the chairman of the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, says the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom are, in his words, \"poaching\" Jamaica's most critical nurses. \"Specialist nurses is the problem. We have tons of regular nurses,\" he says. He's talking about nurses trained to work in such settings as intensive care units, operating theaters and emergency rooms. They're the ones being lured away. Moss-Solomon says it's very hard to replace them. \"We do very good training of specialist nurses here,\" he says. \"We train them at a fraction of the cost of what it costs you in the United States or Canada or the U.K.. So it's an economic issue. There's a great saving [for foreign countries] in just poaching instead of training.\" Article continues after sponsorship Moss-Solomon says the exodus is crippling hospitals across Jamaica. Last week his hospital was forced to cancel several complex elective surgeries because it didn't have the staff to handle the procedures. Jamaica has tried to re-staff those wards by offering free training for nurses to get advanced degrees. The nurses agree to work for three or four years in Jamaica in exchange for the heavily-subsidized education. But those efforts have backfired as foreign recruiters have snapped up the newly minted specialists the moment they graduate. The nurses are slapped with a fine of typically $5,000-$6,000 if they skip their in-country service. But the recruiting agencies simply pay off the obligation. Kevin Allen, the CEO of the University Hospital of the West Indies, says Jamaica simply can't compete with the deep pockets of hospitals in North America and Europe. The starting salary for a nurse in Jamaica is less than $8,000 a year. With some specialized training and working overtime, she (and the island's nurses are almost all women) could possibly make up to $20,000 a year. Recruiters are offering two to three times that to take a job in the U.S. or London. About 200 of the country's 1,000 specialist nurses left the country last year, says Janet Coore-Farr, the head of the Nurses Association of Jamaica. She says this hemorrhaging of nursing staff has continued in the first week of 2017. In one 500-bed hospital, ten nurses have left since the new year, she says, \"and more are leaving. And these nurses are trained in accident and emergency.\" As more nurses leave, the work load grows even heavier for those who stay behind. Coore-Farr says many nurses in Jamaica are now regularly expected to work double shifts, which might make some of them think about taking a job in Phoenix or Toronto. \"There's no retention strategy for the nurses who are here,\" she says. \"We feel quite frankly that nobody cares. But it's a serious problem.\" The Jamaican Minister of Health says he does recognize the huge problem the island is facing with the loss of nurses. In the short term, University Hospital of the West Indies is bringing in 25 nurses next month from Cuba to help staff some wards and has plans to recruit nurses from India and the Philippines in what's become a crazy global race that extends far beyond Jamaica to snap up health care professionals.

President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference Dec. 16, 2016, in the briefing room of the White House. (Susan Walsh / AP) Disappointment. And Donald Trump . What we can't measure, not completely, not yet, is the inspiration he's given to millions of people \u2014 particularly to African-Americans \u2014 who years ago couldn't dare dream that a black man would ever be elected president. And we can't measure what his presidency has triggered in the minds and imaginations of the young. It's all part of his charm that offered hope for future generations, and the long lines of proud families waiting to see him speak Tuesday night in Chicago are testimony to that. But Americans have an obligation to assess the past, before the historians rewrite it all. And if you look back, you might remember that he was an unknown, presented to America as a transformational figure from Chicago who was somehow unsullied by Chicago politics. His mouthpieces from Chicago politics \u2014 straight from City Hall and the Daley machine \u2014 promised that his election would transcend the broken politics of the  past. And they offered him up as a messiah, though later his White House helped keep the Democratic machine in power in Chicago and Illinois, to run the failing city in the failed machine state. The Senate intelligence committee's top Democrat criticized the Obama administration on Tuesday for its slow response to allegations of Russian hacking during the presidential campaign as the panel heard from the director of the FBI , whom several Democrats criticized for announcing a new probe... The Senate intelligence committee's top Democrat criticized the Obama administration on Tuesday for its slow response to allegations of Russian hacking during the presidential campaign as the panel heard from the director of the FBI , whom several Democrats criticized for announcing a new probe... (Tribune wire reports) And now, eight years later, consider: Chicago's president of so much hope leaves a Democratic Party in absolute tatters. Democrats have lost not only the White House and Congress, but a horde of state legislatures and governorships. And Trump will be the next president, having won a remarkable election in state after state by running an anti-establishment campaign of referendum, first against the Bush Republicans and later against Obama and his proxy, Hillary Clinton. You can talk about Obamacare as his legacy, although that will be undone. You can talk about the symbolism of his politics, but that will fade, at least in Washington. But there is a part of his legacy that is just beginning: Trump. Donald Trump is Obama's true legacy. Obama prepared the ground for him, watered and fertilized it with his failed and questionable policy, like Obamacare, which, according to Obamacare guru Jonathan Gruber, was built on lies. (John Kass) And all the shrieking by the talented Meryl Streep and other theatrical personalities of the wounded left won't change this. Disappointment follows him, too, a sense of things that could have been, but weren't, an understanding of promise unfulfilled. Yet I don't think that's entirely all his fault. He had a willing partner in the American news media. Mr. Obama understood what he was doing. His strategist, David Axelrod , knew messianic politics, having helped Harold Washington become Chicago's first black mayor before hopping on to the Daley machine. And so Obama played the political messiah to defeat Clinton in 2008. And journalists were his apostles. All that pent up white liberal media guilt and childlike yearning was perfect for him and he knew it. Yet with so many thrills running up and down the legs of American journalism, it all became just too much. A messiah wouldn't disappoint. But a man couldn't help but fall short. And was Obama not compared, in glowing terms, to Jesus Christ? \"Some princes are born in palaces. Some are born in mangers,\" began an Obama profile written by Nancy Gibbs in Time Magazine in 2008. \"But few are born in the imagination, out of scraps of history and hope.\" That Jesus Obama business wasn't an outlier, but typical of the media attitude. Messianic Obama became the theme. The thrilled crowds in Berlin and the throngs in Grant Park, the weeping. And some thought the Kennedys and Camelot were over the top. Even Obama's pectorals were gushed over, as if he were a sea god on the sands of Hawaii. \"The sun glinted off chiseled pectorals sculpted during four weightlifting sessions each week, and a body toned by regular treadmill runs and basketball games,\" wrote Eli  Saslow in The Washington Post on Christmas Day 2008. Chiseled pectorals. Jesus. No one could live up to all that, and to the president's credit, he understood this more than most. Yet for all the media holy oil drizzled over his forehead by the high priests of American journalism, the fact was that Obama's passive-aggressive nature, honed in the Chicago Democratic politics of bosses and clout, didn't exactly prepare him for the presidency. You could see it when he'd bow low to the emperor of Japan and the Saudi king. You can see it in the misery in Syria (where he drew that red line in the sand and then forgot about it) and the failed state of Libya that he ignores, and the aggression of Vladimir Putin, who was encouraged by Obama's passivity. He could have done more for the inner cities, but that wasn't in his political DNA. He wasn't about to threaten Democratic Party institutions, like big city public education, even as it fails the very children he would otherwise inspire. And he wouldn't challenge Chicago's corrupt politics. When he left Illinois, a Daley was mayor and Boss Madigan ran the state. And as he leaves Washington, his former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is the caretaker mayor and Boss Madigan still runs the bankrupt state. Barack Obama might not have been the worst president in history, but he certainly wasn't the greatest. He wasn't a messiah. He wasn't a sea god. He was a man from Chicago who tried and failed and disappointed some, like all presidents. But unlike many, he's not going away quietly. He's still in the game.

Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 The chiefs of America\u2019s intelligence agencies last week presented President Obama and President-elect Donald J. Trump with a summary of unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. Trump, two officials with knowledge of the briefing said. The summary is based on memos generated by political operatives seeking to derail Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Details of the reports began circulating in the fall and were widely known among journalists and politicians in Washington. The two-page summary, first reported by CNN, was presented as an appendix to the intelligence agencies\u2019 report on the Russian hacking of the election , the officials said. The material was not corroborated, and The New York Times has not been able to confirm the claims. But intelligence agencies considered it so potentially explosive that they decided Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders needed to be told about it and that the agencies were actively investigating it. Intelligence officials were concerned that the information would leak before they informed Mr. Trump of its existence, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the summary is classified and talking about it would be a felony. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More The decision of top intelligence officials to give the president, the president-elect and the so-called Gang of Eight \u2014 Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress and the intelligence committees \u2014 what they know to be unverified, defamatory material was extremely unusual. The appendix summarized opposition research memos prepared mainly by a retired British intelligence operative for a Washington political and corporate research firm. The firm was paid for its work first by Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals and later by supporters of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The Times has checked on a number of the details included in the memos but has been unable to substantiate them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memos suggest that for many years, the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has looked for ways to influence Mr. Trump, who has traveled repeatedly to Moscow to investigate real estate deals or to oversee the Miss Universe competition, which he owned for several years. Mr. Trump never completed any major deals in Russia, though he discussed them for years. The former British intelligence officer who gathered the material about Mr. Trump is considered a competent and reliable operative with extensive experience in Russia, American officials said. But he passed on what he heard from Russian informants and others, and what they told him has not yet been vetted by American intelligence. The memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump in a 2013 visit to a Moscow hotel. The videos were supposedly prepared as \u201ckompromat,\u201d or compromising material, with the possible goal of blackmailing Mr. Trump in the future.

That\u2019s a 63 percent increase from the 468 murders recorded in 2015 and almost double the murders in 2014, according to Chicago Police. Shootings also are way up -- 4,331 people were shot in Chicago in 2016, up from 3,550 in 2015, according to police. In recent months, the president has been mostly quiet about an aggressive solution to Chicago\u2019s violent crime epidemic. The city saw more murders in 2016 than New York and Los Angeles combined, yet is considerably smaller in population than either city. Chicagoans wonder if the president will address the city\u2019s crime \u2013 the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2013 during his speech Tuesday night. \"I cannot recall a time that President Obama said directly about Rahm Emanuel that he needs to do something about this violence,\u201d said Chicago community leader and activist Pastor Corey Brooks. In a series of interviews last week previewing his speech and visit to Chicago, Obama discussed the city\u2019s carnage, noting a lot of the crime is happening in the \u201cbackyard\u201d of the home he and the first lady own on the city\u2019s South Side. \u201cWe've been trying even from the federal level to provide assistance to the city. I don't think that we're going to be able to reverse these things overnight,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOn the other hand, the fact that crime overall is much lower around the country when it was when I took office and that Chicago is the one big city where you've seen this huge spike means that there's something specifically happening there and that means we can fix it if we work together.\u201d Community leaders all agree Chicago\u2019s violent crime and murder rate is unacceptable but the exact cause and how to fix it is a matter of debate. The issues most often pointed to are the city\u2019s uncontrollable illegal gun market, gang wars, cheap heroin and increasing disrespect for law enforcement. Former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who is credited with a drop in the city\u2019s crime up until 2015 through his community-policing approach, says officers haven\u2019t felt a ton of support from the Obama administration. \u201cI can't help but just look at criminal justice, and criminal justice in this country has not had a friend in the federal government during this administration,\" McCarthy said. Lori Lightfoot, president of the Chicago Police Board\u2014an independent entity tasked with investigating complaints into misconduct and corruption\u2014says Chicago\u2019s crime is not something police can arrest their way out of and requires all levels of the government and community to work together beyond analyzing crime stats and police performance. \u201cWe need to make sure we are out there with job training, everything we can to drive down unemployment, make sure kids aren\u2019t living in poverty, good schools,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cThis really does take a multi-faceted approach.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has already weighed in, making headlines when he tweeted that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal help if he can\u2019t fix the city\u2019s crime\u2014which also raises the question if policing in the city and even nationwide might grow beyond a state and local operation under the Trump administration. \u201cPresident-Elect Trump is directly putting the ball in the mayor\u2019s court and that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d Brooks said. Emanuel\u2019s spokesperson replied to the Trump tweet with a statement, in part writing, \u201cAs the president-elect knows from his conversation with the mayor, we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety\u2026we are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.\u201d All this comes as the Department of Justice is in the midst of a patterns and practice investigation into the Chicago Police Department for allegations of racism and police brutality. This follows the release of a highly controversial, graphic dash cam video depicting a Chicago police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The DOJ\u2019s findings are expected to be released before or shortly after the inauguration of Trump on Jan. 20 and could result in an expensive Consent Decree with CPD that will continue to keep Chicago\u2019s crime problems in the national spotlight. Pfleger said he reached out to Trump during the campaign but did not hear back. He says he hopes the DOJ\u2019s findings and the new administration could make a difference in Chicago. \u201cThe question being will they reach out and want to really see some substantive changes and make a difference or do they\u00a0just want to continue to Band-Aid,\u201d Pfleger said.\u00a0 Matt Finn is a Fox News correspondent based in the Chicago bureau.

John Kelly says closing the border to illegal activity would be his top priority as secretary of Homeland Security. (Jan. 10) John Kelly, nominee for Homeland Security secretary, testifies on Capitol Hill on Jan. 10, 2017, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY ) 36 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 72 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 Building a wall won't be enough to secure the U.S. border with Mexico, retired Marine\u00a0Corps general John Kelly, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, told senators during a confirmation hearing Tuesday. \"A physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job,\" Kelly said. \"It has to be really a layered defense.\" He told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that would require\u00a0patrols, sensors, and \"observation devices,\"\u00a0and also working with other countries to stem illegal travel toward the U.S. border from as far south as Peru. \"We could have better partnerships,\" Kelly said. If confirmed, he would be responsible for spearheading the implementation of Trump\u2019s campaign pledges to build a wall along the southern border, ramp up deportations of immigrants living in the United States illegally, and track foreigners who overstay their visas. Kelly said the government needs a better system to alert DHS officials when visas expire and the bearer hasn't left the United States\u00a0so that DHS could notify local law enforcement or others who could visit the visa-holders\u00a0at their last known addresses and ask why they haven't left. As for deportations, Kelly said that the department currently doesn't have the capacity to deport everyone living in the country illegally so prioritization would be required, and he didn't think it would be a priority to deport children brought here illegally by their parents, a group currently allowed to stay at least temporarily under an executive order from President Obama. \"There's a big spectrum of people who need to be dealt with in terms of deportations... I would guess that this category wouldn't be the highest priority for removal,\" he said, but cautioned\u00a0that the incoming administration is still determining exactly what the immigration policies will be. In his opening statement, Kelly said that just as he did when entering the Marine Corps, he pledges he would do \"everything within my power to preserve our liberty, enforce our laws, and protect our citizens.\" Kelly said\u00a0he also believes in \"respect, tolerance, and diversity of opinion,\" and he has \"never had a problem speaking truth to power, and I firmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment and recommendations.\" The lead Democrat on the committee, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., hailed those sentiments, and said she would count on him to speak truth to Trump. \"Given your experience I expect you to be up to that challenge,\" she said. Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., in his opening remarks, ticked off Kelly's accomplishments in the military and said he is the perfect choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Kelly, 66, is a tough-talking\u00a0Boston native who spent more than 40 years in the service, first as an enlisted Marine and then as an officer who, among other missions, led troops into combat in Iraq. Kelly\u2019s son was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2010. Kelly also did stints as legislative assistant to the commandant, liaison for the commandant to the U.S. House of Representatives, and more recently as an adviser to former Defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, who introduced Kelly at Tuesday's hearing and called him \"superbly qualified.\" Before retiring last year, he was head of the U.S. Southern Command, where he oversaw military operations in South and Central America and the Caribbean and developed relationships with countries in the region that could be useful if he is confirmed. The Department of Homeland Security, which has more than 240,000 employees, includes the Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

    "text": "What to Expect From President Obama's Farewell Address By Jordyn Phelps Jan 10, 2017, 4:32 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Obama to Deliver Farewell Address 0 Shares Email President Barack Obama will return to his adopted hometown of Chicago on Tuesday to deliver a farewell address to the American people. In an email announcing the speech to supporters last week, Obama said the speech would be \"a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey \u2026 and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.\" In giving a final speech, Obama is continuing in a tradition first started by the President George Washington in 1796 and continued by many outgoing presidents since. Most recently, President George W. Bush gave a farewell speech eight years ago from the East Room of the White House. On Monday, the White House said Obama was still deeply involved in crafting and revising the speech, which White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest described on Friday as \u201cforward-looking\u201d and \u201cheartfelt.\u201d Earnest, who read an early draft of the speech, said the president will \u201cbriefly\u201d discuss the accomplishments of his own administration in the speech before turning to offer his thoughts on addressing \u201cthe challenges that lie ahead.\u201d \u201cMost of those solutions, in the mind of the president, rest on the deeply held values that just about every American subscribes to,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThe president believes that obviously, that diversity of this country is a strength. And that for all our differences, there's much more unites us than that separates us. And, our country is stronger when we remember that principle and we draw upon those common values.\u201d In describing the president\u2019s writing process, Earnest said the president dictates large portions of the speech to his speechwriters, who then work to refine drafts that the president then further revises. \u201cIt is not uncommon for the president to take a typewritten piece of paper, and in his very compact left-handed script, to be including detailed edits on that piece of paper,\u201d Earnest said. The decision to return to Chicago for the speech is not only because it is his adopted hometown but also because it is significant as the place where his career in service, as a community organizer, began, Obama said. \u201cThe running thread through my career has been the notion that when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together in collective effort, things change for the better,\u201d the president said in his weekly address released Saturday. The speech will take place at McCormick Place and is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. ET. The trip will also mark the last time the president is expected to travel outside of Washington, D.C ., as president and the final time he will ride on Air Force One . ",

Wakil Kohsar /AFP/Getty Images Two bomb blasts near the parliament building in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, have killed at least 30 people and injured at least 70. \"The first bomb exploded near a parked minibus,\" NPR's Nishant Dahiya reported. \"The second, when the police arrived to help the victims.\" It happened during the evening rush hour as parliament staff were leaving work. A female lawmaker was said to be among the injured, Nishant added, and other parliament staff were also reportedly victims of the attack. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the bombings. \"We planned this attack for quite some time and the plan was [to] target some senior officers of the intelligence agency. We sent one suicide bomber to target a mini bus that was carrying these officers,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, according to Reuters. \"We did exactly what we planned.\" Dozens Killed In Attack On Protest March Of Minority Hazara Community In Kabul It happened during a period of relative calm in Kabul, Nishant said. This appears to be the deadliest attack in the capital since July , when at least 80 people were killed during a protest march of the minority Hazara community. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State group. There were at least two other bombings today in other parts of Afghanistan. In the southern province of Kandahar, a blast killed five people, according to the Associated Press. It happened at the provincial governor's guest house, injuring the United Arab Emirates' ambassador to Afghanistan and \"a number of Emirati diplomats who were accompanying him,\" according to a statement from the UAE Foreign Ministry . The ambassador was on a \"humanitarian mission\" to Kandahar, the Foreign Ministry added. Article continues after sponsorship Another bombing, in the capital of Helmand province, killed at least seven people, according to the BBC . President Ashraf Ghani vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, the broadcaster reported. \"The Taliban shamelessly claim credit for the attack on civilians and they're proud of it,\" Ghani said in a statement.

(Photo: Heidi Gutman, ABC) PASADENA, Calif. \u2013 \u00a0Here\u2019s a Match Game question for host Alec Baldwin: The most surprising thing about playing Donald Trump has been \u2014 blank. \u201cHow difficult it\u2019s been,\u201d answers Baldwin, who\u2019s drawn lots of praise and some derision \u2014\u00a0from Trump himself \u2014 for his portrayal of the president-elect on NBC's\u00a0Saturday Night Live. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to imitate people you have a lot of admiration for,\u201d he explains to USA TODAY. \u201cIf you\u2019re imitating Pacino, De Niro, Tony Bennett or Anthony Hopkins, there\u2019s a degree of admiration for and appreciation, of which I have none for Trump. I don\u2019t hate (or) despise Trump \u2026 \u00a0but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to accept where we are.\u201d The New York actor, visiting the Television Critics Association press tour  to promote ABC\u2019s prime-time revival of Match Game, which he hosts\u00a0(Wednesday, 10 ET/PT), says he's been surprised by the president-elect\u2019s post-election response to his portrayal in Trump's signature\u00a0 harsh tweets. \u201cI thought, just in terms of human nature, that once he won he would change his tone, he\u2019d become a little more humble. He would think, \u2018Well, now I\u2019ve won and I want to reach out to all people and be less malicious, petty and defensive,\u2019 he says. \u201cAnd he remains as malicious, petty and defensive as he was months ago, before he won.\u201d Alec Baldwin sends up Donald Trump with Beck Bennett as bare-chested Vladimir Putin on 'Saturday Night Live.' \u00a0(Photo: NBC, Will Heath, NBC) Baldwin, 58, says he will continue to play Trump on SNL \u201ca little bit, per my availability. I\u2019m not available every Saturday night.\u201d Viewers likely would \u201cbe ready for it maybe like, every other week or once a month.\u201d He also hinted about other opportunities to play the president-elect. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do SNL, we can maybe do some other kind of programming. I\u2019ve been offered a lot of things, but I\u2019m not allowed to discuss them.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s next SNL appearance is scheduled for Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration. He is confident the writers will be able to turn around a topical segment quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re good at.\u201d He credits Trump with providing much of the best material. \u201cHe\u2019s our head writer. He provides us with a gift basket of ideas every week.\u201d Baldwin's availability, whether he's playing Trump, doing his podcast or appearing in films (he'll play a crisis negotiator in Emilio Estevez's The Public), is contingent on family considerations. He and wife Hilaria have three young children, none older than 3. Alec Baldwin, center, gets his nose pinched by his daughter at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting, as Kate McKinnon stands to his left. \u00a0(Photo: Gilbert Carrasquillo, FilmMagic) Match Game, which tapes an entire season\u00a0in a five-day span, accommodates his family needs,\u00a0provides money for his charity and has been enjoyable, he says. \"It's been a great thing because of my kids. We go to work and it's fun. We got a lot of the people we really wanted\" for the celebrity panel, which includes Jason Alexander, Ellie Kemper and Ice T. Baldwin\u00a0remembers watching the 1970s version of Match Game, along with such other classic game shows as The Newlywed Game, The Dating Game, Password, To Tell the Truth and I've Got a Secret. The\u00a0new Match Game\u00a0features the familiar music, set design, suggestive \"blanks\" (although they don't seem as risque today)\u00a0and even the long, skinny microphone that host Gene Rayburn used. \"If I want something that relaxes and comforts me, I'll watch old Dick Cavett shows, Lunt and Fontanne. Game shows are like that for me,\" he says. \"For some people now, that's the same thing.\" 31 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jsuIA4 NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

By Matt Zapotosky , Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima January 10 at 3:34 PM Follow @mattzap Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @nakashimae (Video: Reuters; Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Sen. Jeff Sessions sought to assure the American public Tuesday that he could set aside campaign rhetoric and fairly enforce the law as the next U.S. attorney general, asserting repeatedly at his confirmation hearing that he would not let his personal views interfere with court precedent or the will of Congress. Sessions (R-Ala.) said, although his politics might indicate otherwise, that he would abide by the Supreme Court decision underpinning abortion rights, and that he would similarly follow the 5-to-4 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He said he understands that the waterboarding of suspects to elicit information is \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal,\u201d and, though he voted against a law that banned the government\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records, that he would uphold it as attorney general. He declared that he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices or her family\u2019s charitable foundation \u2014 mindful that his previous comments \u201ccould place my objectivity in question.\u201d \u201cWe can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute,\u201d he said. On the first day of his two-day confirmation hearing, Sessions came under tough questioning from Democrats about his conservative, often controversial views on immigration, hate-crimes legislation and national security matters. He answered politely, although often forcefully, and frequently referred to his decades of experience in the Senate. He is expected to be confirmed. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cYou know what I believe in. You know that I am a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do.\u201d On some topics, Sessions, 70, held his ground. He said, for example, that he supports the continued operation of the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for terrorism suspects. He said would not object if \u00adPresident-elect Donald Trump abandoned an executive action by President Obama that allows people who came to the United States illegally as children to receive work permits and a reprieve from possible deportation, although he offered no solution for what to do with those who had received such reprieves. He refused to agree to keep intact consent decrees prompting reform in police departments across the country, saying such agreements and the lawsuits that prompt them \u201cundermine the respect for police officers\u201d and should be approached with \u201ccaution.\u201d Justice Department officials have been pressing to negotiate such reforms in Baltimore and Chicago before the end of the Obama administration. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t commit that there would never be any changes in them, and if departments have complied or reached other developments that could justify the withdrawal or modification of a consent decree, of course I would do that,\u201d Sessions said. He said, though, that he would enforce existing agreements. Sessions declined to say that he would adopt the policies of former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. when it comes to investigations involving the news media, including a promise not to jail reporters for doing their job. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said when asked whether he would keep that Holder promise. \u201cI have not studied those regulations.\u201d But Sessions also seemed to recognize that, if confirmed, he would have to abandon his persona as a far-right lawmaker and an unabashed Trump supporter. He said that the attorney general should enforce the law regardless of the president\u2019s views, and that if the president presses for illegal action, the attorney general should resign. \u201cHe or she must be willing to tell the president or other top officials \u2018no\u2019 if he or they overreach,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cHe or she cannot be a mere rubber stamp.\u201d Sessions spoke in a room packed with demonstrators, reporters and his family members, and the proceedings were interrupted several times by protesters declaring him \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d Capitol Police said 25 were arrested \u2014 18 at the hearing and seven in Sessions\u2019s office. The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Sessions for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations of racially insensitive remarks, and civil rights advocates and others have mounted a campaign to deny him the attorney general post. Democratic senators took up many of their issues Tuesday, questioning Sessions on his opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate-crimes law to include sexual orientation and gender identity, and his decision not to support an iteration of the Violence Against Women Act that gave Native Americans special protections . Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Sessions about prior comments in which he suggested, after a video emerged of Trump talking about grabbing women by the genitals, that such conduct was not necessarily sexual assault. \u201cSenator, is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?\u201d Leahy said. \u201cClearly, it would be,\u201d Sessions responded. He later suggested that a sitting president could be prosecuted for doing so \u201cif appropriate.\u201d Sessions said that he supported the Violence Against Women Act broadly, and that he thought hate crimes \u201cwere being prosecuted effectively in state courts where they would normally be expected to be prosecuted.\u201d He sought to portray the allegations that sunk him in 1986 \u2014 when even Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., urged Congress to turn him down \u2014 as inaccurate. Sessions said his controversial prosecution of civil rights advocates \u2014 rather than being an effort to stifle voting \u2014 was done in response to complaints from African American incumbent officials. He assailed white supremacists. \u201cI abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,\u201d he said. He denied calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d \u2014 a charge leveled against him by a fellow lawyer. \u201cI hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate,\u201d he said. Sessions\u2019s assertion on the Clinton investigations was an early highlight of the hearing, notable because the future of the inquiries has long been a source of public speculation. Trump said during the campaign that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton, his Democratic rival, even after the FBI concluded that it could not recommend criminal charges. But he has since softened that stance and suggested that he wanted to move past the matter. Sessions has been critical of the Clinton email investigation, and he has said it \u201cseems like\u201d the FBI had not fully investigated the dealings of the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state. The two inquiries are separate, and although the email investigation has ended, the status of the foundation matter is murkier. Justice Department public integrity prosecutors told FBI agents last year that they had no case, but agents have apparently continued to press the matter. A defense attorney for Clinton declined to comment on Sessions\u2019s claim that he would recuse himself. Later in the hearing, pressed on whether he would recuse himself on Trump investigations, Sessions said he \u201cwould review it, and try to do the right thing.\u201d Of Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the United States, Sessions said he thought the president-elect favors stringent vetting of those coming from countries with a history of terrorism. He said he voted against a resolution that would have objected to a Muslim ban because he thought it would not allow for religion to be considered in the vetting process. \u201cMany people do have religious views that are inimical to the public safety of the United States,\u201d Sessions said. He said he would not support an immigration ban that excluded people solely because they are Muslim. Sessions also addressed issues of policing, saying that officers have come to feel \u201cunfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors.\u201d He cited violent-crime statistics, such as Chicago\u2019s 4,368 shooting victims in 2016 and the 11\u00a0percent increase in homicides nationwide from 2014 to 2015 \u2014 and promised that he would prioritize turning the tide. (Reuters) Sessions acknowledged that he is not well-informed about the recent high-profile cyber provocations by Russia. When asked by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) if he thought that the Russian government was behind the hacking of the Democratic Party computers, he said, \u201cI have done no research into that.\u201d When Graham pointed out that the FBI had concluded Russia was behind the intrusion, Sessions observed, \u201cat least that\u2019s what\u2019s been reported.\u201d Later, he allowed, \u201cI have no reason to doubt that,\u201d and he said the response to such action might not be as simple as prosecuting a case. \u201cIn many ways, the political response, the international foreign policy response, may be the only recourse,\u201d he said. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked Sessions whether he would let an investigation of Russian interference continue \u201ceven if it leads to the Trump campaign and Trump interests and associates.\u201d Sessions replied: \u201cIf the law is violated and they can be prosecuted, then you\u2019ll have to handle that in an appropriate way.\u201d On Wednesday, 15 witnesses are scheduled speak about the nominee, including a former attorney general, the president of a national police union, and several civil rights and other advocates. Late Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said that one of Sessions\u2019s colleagues, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is expected to testify against him. Read more: ",

Pence talked with the Republican Senators about repealing and replacing Obamacare. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) By Kelsey Snell , Sean Sullivan and Amy Goldstein January 10 at 12:43 PM Follow @kelsey_snell Follow @WaPoSean Follow @goldsteinamy After years of promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a growing number of Republicans are balking at the prospect of doing so quickly without a firm plan to replace it. As the Senate prepares to vote Wednesday to set in motion a way to eliminate the landmark health-care bill, some Republicans are worried about the political fallout and uncertainty of starting to roll back Obamacare without knowing how the process will end. President-elect Donald J. Trump was among the Republicans expressing concern Tuesday. \u201cI feel that repeal and replace have to be together, for very simply, I think that the Democrats should want to fix Obamacare,\u201d Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cThey cannot live with it, and they have to go together.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) insisted Tuesday that they have no intention of moving ahead with repeal without a consensus replacement plan. But some Republicans remained concerned about taking a single vote before they get through what is likely to be an extremely difficult process of producing an alternative. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) speaks with reporters following a GOP caucus meeting with (L-R) Sen. Corey Gardner (R-Colo.), Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The chaos focused attention on the political peril Republicans face in seeking to deliver one of their top political promises. Repealing the 2010 health-care law would be certain to have powerful ripple effects for both patients \u2014 20 million of whom have gained coverage through various ACA mechanisms \u2014 and the health-care system as a whole. The speed with which leaders had hoped to act became part of the problem on Tuesday as Republican leaders considered extending a Jan. 27 deadline for completing a repeal bill. Conversations with Republican senators and a review of their statements show that nearly a dozen have publicly expressed some level of concern about repealing the law without a replacement. \u201cThere are a lot of people that have concerns about doing a repeal with no replacement or at least some guidance on replacement,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) who has co-sponsored language to delay the nonbinding deadline for repeal legislation until March 3. \u201cThe train leaving the station this week is not a big event, it\u2019s when the train pulls back into the station that\u2019s the big event,\u201d Corker explained. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said that while there is a lot of dissatisfaction on health care among Alaskans, \u201cThey at least know what they are dealing with right now.\u201d She added: \u201cThe thought that we would take away what they are seeing now, whether it\u2019s the benefits they are getting from Medicaid expansion, the subsidies that they are getting on the individual market . . . there is a lot of anxiety and a lot of uncertainty, and they are basically asking me: \u2018What comes next?\u2019 We want to know.\u2019 \u201d Such concerns did not appear to jeopardize the frenzied set of procedural votes slated to begin Wednesday known as a \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d Those votes are an attempt to tinker with a budget measure to establish a process repealing the health-care law \u2014 first by referring it to the relevant committees and culminating in floor votes, likely this spring. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) McConnell argued Tuesday that Trump\u2019s comments on repeal and replace are \u201cnot in any way inconsistent with what we\u2019re all aiming for.\u201d But the timeline being pursued by congressional Republicans does not square with Trump\u2019s demand in his interview to vote on repeal as early as next week, highlighting the disconnect between the president-elect and GOP congressional leadership. \u201cIt is difficult for us to sit here and have a serious conversation about repealing and replacing next week,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Tuesday. In addition, Trump\u2019s firm commitment to quick replacement legislation is at odds with some Republicans seeking a more gradual process. \u201cThis is going to be a joint effort of the administration, the House and the Senate to put together the replacement. And, obviously, we\u2019re going to be talking to [Trump] about how to do that and the people that\u2019s he putting in place that we\u2019re going to confirm will be key players,\u201d said McConnell of Trump. \u201cIn my view, we need to cast most of our votes on [replace] before summertime,\u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). \u201cThat will probably take two or three steps and then take two or three years to implement it over time.\u201d McConnell did not offer specifics about the timing of repeal or replace votes while Ryan insisted that full repeal would not happen until Republicans had rallied behind a replacement plan. \u201cWe are going to use every tool at our disposal, through legislation, through regulation to bring replace concurrent with repeal,\u201d Ryan told reporters. Ryan tried to reassure skittish rank-and-file Republicans Tuesday during a weekly closed-door session by vowing to move swiftly so that some replacement elements can move in tandem with a repeal measure in the coming months. The Obama administration, meanwhile, continued its efforts to demonstrate that the insurance created under the ACA is popular, despite what officials euphemistically term \u201cheadwinds\u201d caused by the law\u2019s uncertain future. Federal health officials on Tuesday released updated enrollment figures, which show that, by Christmas Eve, 11.5 million people had chosen health plans for 2017 through HealthCare.gov and similar marketplaces run by a dozen states. That is nearly 300,000 more than during the equivalent time a year ago, the officials said. However, the number of people signing up for the first time, about 2 million, is 1 million fewer than last year. It remains unclear exactly which portions of the law Republicans will seek to dismantle through the budget process. But repeal legislation Republicans pushed through Congress slightly more than a year ago might offer a guide. Under that bill, vetoed by President Obama, most Americans no longer would be required to carry health insurance or pay a fine, and subsidies would have ended that currently help more than 80 percent of about 10 million people who use the ACA\u2019s marketplaces. The previous repeal legislation also would have eliminated an expansion of Medicaid that 31 states have adopted. All these changes would, in turn, have an impact on insurers, hospitals, and the pharmaceutical industry. While there is broad consensus about doing away with the law, Republicans do not agree on the shape or timing of a substitute. \u201cI think people are concerned about us having the flexibility . . . to deal with things like how do we keep the meltdown on Obamacare from occurring while we\u2019re trying to make the longer-term replacement,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the second-ranking Republican. Cornyn, McConnell and Ryan all insisted they are confident they can craft a replacement that satisfies the majority of their party. But they are likely to need the votes of at least eight Democrats to replace the ACA. Republican leaders are relying on special budget procedures to repeal portions of the health-care law without the threat of a blockade by Senate Democrats. Senate rules allow budget legislation to be approved with 51 votes rather than the normal 60 needed to pass nearly everything else. There are 52 Republicans in the Senate, ensuring that a unified GOP can act on repeal without Democrats. But any new health-care legislation would be subject to normal Senate rules and Democrats warn they are not going to rescue Republicans on replacement. That is exactly what some Senate Republicans are trying to avoid. \u201cI want to be sure people who are depending on their subsidies or Medicaid expansion are held harmless in this transition,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who is co-sponsoring the amendment delaying the deadline for writing a repeal bill. Some Republicans, like Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), have pitched fully fledged replacement plans attempt to resolve those concerns by allowing states to vote to retain exchanges and offering a tax credit to help people buy insurance on the private market. But there is no plan yet for how to pay for those goodies.

By Kevin Sullivan January 10 at 5:54 PM Follow @sullivank Jurors deliberated for about three hours before sentencing Dylann Roof to the death penalty for killing nine black parishioners at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. (Gillian Brockell,Bastien Inzaurralde,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 A federal jury sentenced Dylann Roof to death on Tuesday for killing nine black parishioners during a massacre inside a church here in 2015. Roof was convicted last month of 33 counts of federal hate crimes. The same jury that found him guilty on all counts last month deliberated Tuesday for just under three hours before deciding his sentence. [ Dylann Roof has been sentenced to death. Will the government ever be able to execute him? ] Relatives of the victims said the decision was the just outcome. \u201cJustice was served,\u201d said Kevin Singleton, whose mother, Myra Thompson, was killed. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t change anything for the families, but I hope it can be a deterrent in the future.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think the verdict would affect me the way it has; I haven\u2019t stopped crying,\u201d said Aja Risher, granddaughter of victim Ethel Lance. \u201cBut I\u2019m so happy that their lives matter. It\u2019s not just a terrible tragedy that happened. It renews my faith a little bit.\u201d \u201cIf this case didn\u2019t warrant the death penalty, what case would?\u201d Risher said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe took it upon himself to take nine beautiful lives. Now 12 people of all races have said his life is the price he needs to pay for that.\u201d Risher\u2019s mother, the Rev. Sharon Risher, said that she \u201cfelt like my heart was going to pop\u201d as she sat in the courtroom and listened to the sentencing decision. She said that she had been ambivalent about the death penalty, but had resigned herself to accept whatever decision the jury made. \u201cBut now that they have said he will get the death penalty, I feel that they have given him what he deserves,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is well with my soul.\u201d Earlier Tuesday, Roof, 22, had stood before the jury and delivered a halting and cryptic closing argument, suggesting that the prosecution \u201chates me\u201d and that his killing of nine parishioners at a Bible study meeting in 2015 was not motivated by hatred of black people. \u201cAnyone that thinks I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hatred is,\u201d said Roof, a self-described white supremacist who has said he hoped his high-profile killings would incite a race war in America. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything about me. They don\u2019t know what real hatred looks like. They think they do, but they don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI would say that in this case, the prosecution and anyone else who hates me are the ones that have been misled,\u201d Roof said in a soft voice, standing before the eight women and four men who, shortly after, began deliberating whether to sentence him to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fair to say that the prosecution hates me?\u201d Roof said, noting that prosecutors were seeking the death penalty. Roof told the jury they might think, \u201c\u2018Of course they hate you; everyone hates you. They have good reason to hate you.\u2019 I don\u2019t deny it.\u201d For the first time, Roof also obliquely seemed to raise the possibility that some emotional or mental condition may have led to his killing rampage. Previously, Roof had clashed with his court-appointed attorneys who wanted to introduce evidence of mental illness. \u201cUm, I think it\u2019s safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go into a church and kill people,\u201d said Roof, wearing a light blue cable-knit sweater and gray khakis, at the start of his seven-minute closing argument. Roof pointed out to the jury that in his confession to the FBI, \u201cI told them I had to do it. \u2026 Obviously that\u2019s not true. Nobody made me do it.\u201d Without directly explaining his meaning, Roof then said, \u201cI felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.\u201d Roof also noted that he had a right to ask the jury to spare his life, but \u201cI\u2019m not sure what good that would do.\u201d Roof said FBI officials in his interrogation asked him, \u201cSo is it safe to say that you don\u2019t like black people?\u201d \u201cMy response to them was, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like what black people do,\u2019 \u201d he said. If he hated black people, Roof said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t I have just said, \u2018Yes, I don\u2019t like black people?\u2019\u201d He noted that imposition of the death penalty required a unanimous decision by the jury. \u201cOnly one of you needs to disagree,\u201d he said, noting that each of them said during jury selection that they would stand up for what they thought was right. With that, Roof paused, looked up and said: \u201cThat\u2019s all, thank you.\u201d [ Dylann Roof says it\u2019s \u2018not fair\u2019 he has to hear so much from his victims\u2019 families. ] Roof\u2019s closing statement followed a detailed two-hour closing argument by prosecutor Jay Richardson, who recapped the facts of the case, which have been uncontested by Roof. Roof\u2019s guilt was never in doubt; he admitted to FBI interrogators that he had planned for months to kill black worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, known as Mother Emanuel, because of the church\u2019s historic significance in the black community \u2014 he said it would \u201cmake the biggest wave\u201d and hopefully inspire other white people to kill black people. The only question was whether Roof, a ninth-grade dropout, would be sentenced to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Roof seemed to all but guarantee his fate by choosing to fire his court-appointed lawyers \u2014 including a respected death-penalty specialist \u2014 and represent himself during the penalty phase of the trial. Richardson told the jury how Roof had planned the shootings for months and had become a radicalized racist online in recent years \u2014 especially since the killing of black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a white man. \u201cHe feels no remorse because it was worth it to him,\u201d Richardson said. Richardson displayed photos of all nine victims, who ranged in age from 26 to 87 \u2014 contrasting photos of them smiling in life and lying crumpled and bloody on a church basement floor after being shot by Roof. Richardson also noted that Roof considered Adolf Hitler \u201can icon, someone to be emulated,\u201d and even loaded 88 bullets into his gun\u2019s magazines \u2014 a common white supremacist symbol: H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 represents \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d Richardson urged the jury to \u201cspeak the truth and hold this defendant accountable for his actions. Sentence this defendant to death.\u201d Following the jury\u2019s decision, U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in a statement it will \u201chold him accountable for his choices.\u201d \u201cNo verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel. And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof\u2019s callous hand. But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston \u2014 and the people of our nation \u2014 with a measure of closure.\u201d 1 of 53 ",

    "text": "Cruise passengers sue Royal Caribbean over Jamaican bus ride excursion gone wrong Published               January 10, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 It wasn\u2019t exactly smooth sailing for a group of Royal Caribbean passengers and now they\u2019re suing the cruise line for an excursion that turned deadly for one traveler.\u00a0 Eight passengers sailing on board the Independence of the Seas last year decided to book a day excursion to Jamaica\u2019s famous Dunn\u2019s River Falls near Ocho Rios on Jan. 14, 2016 when the ship docked. The crew reportedly enjoyed a day at the waterfall and even swam with dolphins.\u00a0 But the bus driver that took them back from the cruise ship drove recklessly, the passengers claimed, and continuously changed lanes while speeding. When passengers asked to slow down, according to TMZ , the driver reportedly said that he was driving \u201cthe way everyone typically drove in Jamaica.\u201d That \"way\" wound up being deadly. INSIDE THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE CRUISE SHIP SUITE As the bus entered the port city of Falmouth, a major collision occurred in which one passenger was killed and three others were wounded. The crash also involved a truck, a panel van and another car, according to Cruise Critic . According to the lawsuit, the excursion group's driver had a slow reaction to a vehicle that had entered their lane. The passengers said the driver didn\u2019t get out of the way and the bus was subsequently broadsided, causing it to flip multiple times. At the time, Royal Caribbean released a statement called the accident a \"terrible incident.\" \"We are saddened to report that one of our guests passed away,\" the line said on Jan. 15, 2016. \"Three other guests were injured and are being treated at the local hospital. Crew members are at the hospital with our guests in order to help respond to this terrible incident. The other guests that were on the bus have been treated and released, and have continued on the ship.\" FOR THE LATEST TRAVEL FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK Those suing the cruise line say that Royal Caribbean placed them with an inept driver and thus failed to provide a safe experience even though the driver was not directly employed by the line. Independence of the Seas was sailing a five-night itinerary that departed from Florida with port calls to Labadee, Haiti and Falmouth, Jamaica. Advertisement ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! Got it (The Washington Post) By Abby Phillip , Lena H. Sun and Lenny Bernstein January 10 at 5:55 PM Follow @abbydphillip Follow @bylenasun Follow @LennyMBernstein Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a proponent of a widely discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump asked him to chair a new commission on vaccines. Hours later, however, a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s transition said that while Trump would like to create a commission on autism, no final decision had been made. If Trump follows through, the stunning move would push up against established science, medicine and the government\u2019s position on the issue. It comes after Trump \u2014 who has long been critical of vaccines \u2014 met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws. \u201cThe President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas,\u201d Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. \u201cThe President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. \u201cThe President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of autism with many groups and individuals,\u201d she added. (CNN) [ The facts about vaccines, autism and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s conspiracy theory ] Speaking to reporters earlier Tuesday in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, Kennedy said that Trump called him to request the meeting and that he accepted the offer of a position on the commission during the meeting. \u201cPresident-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cHis opinion doesn\u2019t matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science. \u201cAnd that everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have \u2014 he\u2019s very pro-vaccine, as am I \u2014 but they\u2019re as safe as they possibly can be,\u201d he added. There is a federal advisory committee on immunization, made up of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on how vaccines are used in the United States. The announcement was met with alarm from health professionals who say that putting a proponent of a conspiracy theory in a position of authority on the issue is dangerous. [ The origins of Donald Trump\u2019s autism/vaccine theory and how it was completely debunked eons ago ] (The Washington Post) \u201cThat\u2019s very frightening; it\u2019s difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science,\u201d said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a nonprofit that works to control, treat and eliminate vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases. \u201cThe science is clear: Massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism, and as both a scientist who develops vaccines for poverty-related neglected diseases and the father of an adult daughter with autism, there\u2019s not even any plausibility for a link,\u201d Hotez continued. \u201cAutism is a genetic condition.\u201d \u201cOur nation\u2019s public health will suffer if this nascent neo-antivaxxer movement is not stopped immediately,\u201d he added. Kennedy has been a proponent of nonmedical exemptions for parents who seek to prevent their children from being vaccinated, which is mandatory in most states. He has argued that mercury-based additives in vaccines explain the link to autism. And he has alleged that government scientists, journalists and pharmaceutical companies have colluded to hide the truth from the public. \u201cThey get the shot. That night they have a fever of 103. They go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said at the premiere of an anti-vaccination film screening in California in 2015 . \u201cThis is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d [ A horrifying reminder of what life without vaccines was really like ] Kennedy is known to be an occasional conspiracy theorist and longtime opponent of mandatory vaccination laws. In 2006, he wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that the Republican Party had stolen the 2004 election from Democratic candidate John F. Kerry. At a 2013 speech in Dallas, he said he doesn\u2019t believe the lone gunman theory of the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy. Trump notably expressed support for the theory that vaccinations are linked to autism at a Republican presidential debate in 2015. [ The GOP\u2019s dangerous \u2018debate\u2019 on vaccines and autism ] \u201cWe had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic,\u201d Trump said. The comments were widely denounced by medical professionals who say that there is no evidence that vaccines lead to autism. In fact, the study that popularized the idea has been retracted and discredited as fraudulent . Multiple high-quality studies have found no link between vaccines and autism. Trump\u2019s claim was rejected on the same debate stage by retired neurosurgeon Benjamin Carson, whom Trump has now nominated to serve as his secretary of housing and urban development. \u201cThe fact of the matter is we have extremely well-documented proof that there\u2019s no autism associated with vaccinations,\u201d Carson said. The controversy began in 1998 after The Lancet, a respected medical journal, published a paper by researcher Andrew Wakefield and colleagues linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. It had a sample of only 12 subjects and speculative conclusions but launched a global movement joined by celebrities including Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, who warned parents to stop vaccinating their children. A drop in MMR vaccinations followed. But the study was a fraud. The Lancet determined that Wakefield had been funded by attorneys for parents who had brought lawsuits against vaccine companies. In 2010, the journal retracted the paper. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. Large studies that examined whether there is an association between vaccines and autism, including one that examined 96,000 U.S. children, found none. [ Robert Kennedy Jr.\u2019s belief in autism-vaccine connection, and its political peril ] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said flatly that there is no link between vaccines and autism and that vaccine ingredients do not cause autism. Scores of studies from around the world since then have shown conclusively that vaccines do not cause autism. Every relevant scientific and medical organization has examined the evidence and concluded that vaccines are safe and effective and that the real danger lies in skipping or delaying them. Still, the theory has retained its adherents. The United States has experienced recent measles outbreaks linked to unvaccinated residents, including one in 2014 that infected 383 people, most of them in Amish communities in Ohio. In 2015, another multistate outbreak was linked to California\u2019s Disneyland theme park. In both years, the source of the infection was believed to be people who brought the virus home after visiting the Philippines. In tweets as early as 2012 , Trump expressed skepticism about vaccines, and in 2014 he said that \u201c doctors lied\u201d about vaccines . In other tweets, Trump has referred to vaccines as the cause of \u201cdoctor-inflicted autism.\u201d \u201cMassive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism,\u201d Trump said in an August 2012 tweet. At the presidential debate in 2015, he claimed that his children had been vaccinated in small doses. \u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines, but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause you take a baby in, and I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two- or three-year period of time.\u201d Trump\u2019s statements at the Republican debate in 2015 were denounced as \u201cfalse\u201d by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which released a strongly worded condemnation. [ The challenges to public health under a Trump administration ] \u201cClaims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproved by a robust body of medical literature,\u201d said Karen Remley, executive director of the AAP. \u201cIt is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise.\u201d \u201cThere is no \u2018alternative\u2019 immunization schedule. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease for a longer period of time; it does not make vaccinating safer. Vaccines work, plain and simple,\u201d she added. Autism is now considered a spectrum of brain disorders with a multitude of causes. According to Autism Speaks, people with the disorder can have trouble with social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. One in 68 U.S. children are considered to be on the autism spectrum \u2014 a tenfold increase from 40 years earlier, largely due to changes in how autism is defined and diagnosed.

According to the regulatory filing, the purpose of the change was \"to facilitate the transition of the Company to an investment company\" following the sale to Verizon. But it's still unclear whether the sale will go forward. Following revelations of multiple major hacks of Yahoo user accounts, Verizon said it would \"evaluate\" the potential impact on the deal. Last week, AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong told CNBC that \"I remain hopeful the deal will close and I think we'll see what the outcomes are of the Yahoo investigations in the meantime.\" Verizon purchased AOL in 2015.

Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP President Obama waves to supporters at an election night party in Chicago to proclaim victory in the 2012 presidential election. Carolyn Kaster/AP President Obama's adopted hometown of Chicago is often the stage for pivotal moments in his career. He claimed victory in Chicago in 2008 and again in 2012. And it's where he will give his farewell address on Tuesday night. Many Chicagoans use the word \"pride\" when talking about Barack Obama. You can hear it in their voices. In this city, where President-elect Donald Trump got only 12 percent of the vote, admiration for President Obama is strong. Kim Chisholm stood with thousands of others in the bitter cold this weekend to get a ticket to Obama's speech. Scorecard For A Departing President: Assessing Obama's Successes And Shortcomings \"I'm so excited,\" she says. \"History in the making. I never made it to the White House, but I will see him here in Chicago.\" Chicago officials say there are pluses and minuses to having such close ties to the Obama administration. On Monday, the city won a federal grant for nearly $1 billion to upgrade a major portion of the city's elevated commuter rail line. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's first White House chief of staff, worked to make sure the funding came through before the administration changed hands. \"This will over the next four years create 6,000 jobs in the city of Chicago,\" he says. Illinois' senior U.S. senator, Dick Durbin, says the city has been able to make significant infrastructure improvements with the help of federal funds, including high-speed rail and upgrades to O'Hare International Airport. \"Time and again, the Obama administration has not forgotten where he came from,\" Durbin says. \"[He] has not forgotten the city of Chicago.\" Article continues after sponsorship Obama's Farewell Address: How Presidents Use This Moment Of Reflection That's in part because the administration included a bevy of Chicagoans as Cabinet members and advisers, such as former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, advisers Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Tuesday night's speech and talk about an Obama legacy in Chicago are much more personal for some. Jacky Grimshaw worked in Chicago government under Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, and was Obama's next-door neighbor for years. She says the country's first black president faced the same sort of opposition that Washington did and both men prevailed. \"And he put through the stimulus package that allowed communities across the country to deal with infrastructure projects that needed to get done,\" Grimshaw says of Obama. Some community organizers take a more nuanced stance. Jitu Brown of the Institute for Educational Leadership says that while the president conducts himself with grace, he disagrees with many of his administration's education policies. \"And I think the disappointment is in a president who started as a community organizer. I would have really hoped there would have been space to really listen to the voices of the people directly impacted,\" Brown says. 'That's Our Guy': Chicagoans Welcome Obama Back To D.C. At Valois Restaurant, not far from the president's Chicago home, customers can order a variety of Obama specials on the menu. Kimberly Barnes Staples was eating breakfast with her husband. \"For Chicago, specifically, he gave us a national profile,\" she says. \"He showcased who we are as Chicagoans. He made us proud.\" And Devi Austin, a retiree, says she personally benefited from policies Obama advanced. \"Because of the laws that he put in place for people who had just bought homes and was underwater, I got forgiven \u2014 forgiven, not modified \u2014 forgiven $60,000,\" she says. \"I will miss President Obama.\" Obama Says Goodbye This Week, But His Message Hasn't Always Gotten Through Jan. 8, 2017 While some Chicagoans express disappointment that the president didn't provide more help to deal with gun violence and gangs, others give him a pass, saying that's a problem for the mayor, not the president. So as Obama says farewell, Patty McNamara, a museum consultant, says she will be watching wistfully. \"It's kind of bittersweet,\" she says. \"It's going to be a tough transition, I'm afraid.\" There will be a tangible Obama legacy for Chicagoans, though. His presidential library and foundation will be built on Chicago's South Side. That means that even if the Obamas don't return there to live, the president will remain engaged in the city that gave him his political start. ",

Jeff Sessions , Donald Trump \u2019s pick to become the next attorney general, further clarified today his position on controversial comments the president-elect made about women, telling a Senate panel that grabbing women by the genitals without their consent would \"clearly\" be sexual assault. Several months ago , Sessions came under fire for saying that it would be a \u201cstretch\u201d to call such behavior sexual assault -- a position he clarified shortly afterwards. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, Sessions, R-Alabama, went even further. \"Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?\" Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont, asked the Republican nominee. Sessions was unequivocal: \"Clearly it would be ... Yes.\" Leahy, who until recently was the top Democrat on the committee, then pushed Sessions on whether he would be able to prosecute and investigate \"a sitting president or any other high federal official ... accused of what the president-elect described\" on tape, assuming federal laws were implicated. \"The president is subject to certain lawful restrictions, and they would be required to be applied by the appropriate law enforcement official,\" Sessions replied. Sessions said he could not recall exactly what Trump said on the tapes, including whether the talk included \u201cunwanted\u201d advances. But, Sessions said, \"if that\u2019s what the tape\" indicated, then \"certainly it would meet the definition\u201d of sexual assault. In October 2016, just a month before Election Day , the New York Times obtained and released video from a 2005 interview with Trump for \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d \u201cYou know, I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful [women] \u2014 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump could be heard telling TV personality Billy Bush . \u201cGrab \u2019em by the p----. You can do anything.\u201d During a presidential debate days after the video surfaced, Trump described the recorded discussion as just \u201clocker room talk.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologized to the American people,\" he said. \"Certainly, I am not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\u201d Trump said he never actually did the things he described on the tapes, insisting he has \u201ctremendous respect for women.\u201d Shortly after the debate, Sessions came under fire for appearing to suggest he did not believe Trump\u2019s taped comments about women amounted to sexual assault. \u201cI don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that's a stretch,\u201d Sessions was quoted by The Weekly Standard as saying. Two days later, Session issued a statement saying he was confused by the questions posed to him \u201cin a chaotic post-debate environment,\u201d and the subsequent \u201cinaccurate article ... misrepresented my views.\u201d \u201cOf course it is crystal clear that assault is unacceptable. I would never intentionally suggest otherwise,\" Sessions said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "By Greg Miller January 10 at 7:23 PM Follow @gregpmiller A classified report delivered to President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week included a section summarizing allegations that Russian intelligence services have compromising material and information on Trump\u2019s personal life and finances, U.S. officials said. The officials said that U.S. intelligence agencies have not corroborated those allegations, but believed that the sources involved in the reporting were credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign. A senior U.S. official with access to the document said that the allegations were presented at least in part to underscore that Russia had embarrassing information on both major candidates, but only released material that might harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 a reflection of Russian motivation that bolstered U.S. spy agencies\u2019 conclusion that Moscow sought to help Trump win. The inclusion of such unsubstantiated allegations in the election report, a development first reported Tuesday by CNN, adds a disturbing new dimension to existing concerns about Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine American democracy. If true, the information suggests that Moscow has assembled damaging information \u2014 known in espionage circles by the Russian term \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2014 that conceivably could be used to coerce the next occupant of the White House. The claims were presented in a two-page summary attached to the full report, an addendum that also included allegations of ongoing contact between members of Trump\u2019s inner circle and representatives of Moscow. U.S. officials said the claims about Russian possession of compromising material were based not on information through traditional intelligence channels but research done by an outside entity engaged in political consulting work and led by a former high-ranking British intelligence official. The material was first mentioned in a Mother Jones report in October. U.S. officials said that while the FBI had so far not confirmed the accuracy of the claims, U.S. officials had evaluated the sources relied upon by the private firm, considered them credible, and determined that it was plausible that they would have first-hand knowledge of Russia\u2019s alleged dossier on Trump. The CIA, the FBI and the White House declined to comment on the matter. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. K.T. McFarland, Trump\u2019s designated deputy foreign service adviser, declined to respond to a question about the report. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the story that you\u2019re talking about that\u2019s broken. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate\u2026I know in Washington people prefer to talk about something about which they know nothing, but I\u2019m going to refrain,\u201d she said during participation in a panel at the U.S. Institute of Peace. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say what Donald Trump thinks about the election and what involvement the Russians had. I think I\u2019d just say what [Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, Jr.] said, which is that nothing the Russians did had any effect on the outcome.\u201d Clapper, however, testified that the report never attempted to assess what effect the Russian intervention had on the election result. The two-page summary was attached to the most highly classified of three separate versions of the report on Russian election interference that were circulated in Washington last week, including an abbreviated declassifed draft that was made public. It was unclear whether the claims in the summary were even considered by FBI, CIA and DNI analysts who were responsible for the main body of the report, of whether the information from the outside group had any influence on those analysts\u2019 conclusions. Senior lawmakers who were briefed on the most classified version of the report on declined to comment. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Ca.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team, said that \u201cwe can\u2019t comment on what goes on in\u201d classified briefings, but added that the idea that Moscow would seek to gather incendiary material on U.S. leaders \u201cshould not be a surprise to anyone.\u201d \u201cThe Russians are always looking for dirt on any politician,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be news.\u201d Asked whether he was aware of any contacts between the Trump team and Russia, Nunes said, \u201cNo. I found that hard to believe. I have not heard that.

First lady Michelle Obama speaks Jan. 6 at a ceremony honoring the 2017 school counselor of the year in the East Room of the White House. (Chip Somodevilla / Getty) Heidi Stevens Contact Reporter Balancing Act Those of us who love Michelle Obama \u2014 and we are legion \u2014 have high hopes for her post-White House career. Even as we concede she would be justified to quietly tend an organic garden in her new, private backyard, in our minds, we're sizing her up for a superhero cape (designed by Jason Wu), which she'll don with aplomb as she rescues us from doom. Naturally we want a memoir. Nearly all the first ladies write them, after all: Laura Bush (\"Spoken From the Heart\"), Hillary Clinton (\"Living History\"), Barbara Bush (\"Memoir\"), Nancy Reagan (\"My Turn\") and so on. Pat Nixon was the rare exception. Even Helen Taft, back in 1914, penned one (\"Recollections of Full Years\"). RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR While we wait, there's \"The Meaning of Michelle: 16 Writers on the Iconic First Lady and How Her Journey Inspires Our Own,\" a marvelous collection edited by Veronica Chambers that taps into the love \u2014 not just admiration, though that's certainly there; not just respect, though it's there too \u2014 so many Americans have for the South Side girl-turned-Washington royalty. In it, voices as diverse as Chirlane McCray (the first lady of New York City), Roxane Gay (author of \"Bad Feminist\" and \"Difficult Women\") and Marcus Samuelsson (the chef who prepared the first family's first state dinner) offer reflections on Michelle's life and legacy. \"Michelle Obama is everything a black man raised by a white single mother in Hawaii needed,\" writes Rebecca Carroll. \"She is everything a country with an utterly disgraceful history of emotional and physical violence against black women should champion and elevate. And I would argue that she represents at least 60 percent of what America will miss most about the Obama presidency.\" 'The Meaning of Michelle' \"The Meaning of Michelle: 16 Writers on the Iconic First Lady and How Her Journey Inspires Our Own,\" by Veronica Chambers. \"The Meaning of Michelle: 16 Writers on the Iconic First Lady and How Her Journey Inspires Our Own,\" by Veronica Chambers. Carroll, an author, producer at New York Public Radio and critic-at-large for the Los Angeles Times, writes my favorite of the 16 essays. She wonders how her own childhood would have been different had she grown up with Michelle Obama in the White House. \"My fifth-grade teacher, who was mean anyway, made sure to let me know that I was less than all the others \u2014 lucky, but in a defying nature sort of way: 'very pretty ... for a black girl. Most black girls aren't very pretty.' And with that, I turned inward and lost a faith in my blackness that I never even knew I had until it turned into pride years later.\" Would a black first lady have strengthened her faith? We'll never know, of course. Obama entered the White House after Carroll was well past childhood. But millions of other little girls have grown up with the image of the Obamas at the top, and with Michelle, in particular, reminding them that she sees them. \"She has mentioned teachers who openly underestimated her intelligence and prospects to succeed,\" Carroll writes. Indeed, Michelle Obama has spoken about feeling tangled up in her own self-doubt through much of her childhood. Carroll continues, \"The beauty, though, of having created her own fears and doubts, is the way in which she has effectively, even casually, decimated them along her path to Princeton, then Harvard Law School, as a successful corporate lawyer, and as a prominent badass in the public sector.\" Michelle Obama: 'Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great' First Lady Michelle Obama praised Hillary Clinton and the United States at the Democratic National Convention July 25, 2016, saying, \"Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great.\" (C-SPAN) First Lady Michelle Obama praised Hillary Clinton and the United States at the Democratic National Convention July 25, 2016, saying, \"Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great.\" (C-SPAN) Tiffany Dufu, a Fortune 500 consultant and women's leadership speaker, writes about Obama's willingness to reshape the first lady mold into something recognizable, certainly, but also a bit revolutionary. \"For the first time in our nation's history we saw a sweaty first lady,\" Dufu writes. Obama got her hands dirty in the garden. She challenged Ellen DeGeneres to an on-air dance-off. She gave hugs \u2014 including, Dufu points out, to the Queen of England, who hadn't been hugged in 57 years. (By a public figure anyway.) \"Her complexity is her dichotomy,\" Dufu writes. \"That is why she resonates. American society has a knack for punishing complex women. We like them to fit one mold. But because Michelle lives in the middle, no matter who you are when you look at her you see yourself.\" Not everyone does, of course. The first lady has been the subject of small-minded taunts and racist venom since her husband's first run for the presidency. Those are addressed here, but mostly in passing. The book is largely a love letter. Damon Young, a columnist and contributing editor for Ebony magazine, says it was Michelle who helped him fall for Barack \u2014 a budding politician who remained a bit of a mystery. (\"Where is he from? What is he about? Is he for real? Can he hoop?\") Then Young learned about Michelle. \"A level-lifter,\" he writes. \"An aspiration. An ambition. The woman you'd want to meet if you planned on taking over the world, together. \"And then my tepid and halting support for Barack Obama became a fervent following,\" Young writes. \"How could I not throw all of my chips in with a black man who had the wherewithal, the foresight, the wisdom and the game (Yes. The game.) to marry her?\" Roxane Gay speaks most directly to the first lady's post-White House career. \"I hope Michelle Obama does whatever her heart most desires when her husband's presidency ends,\" Gay writes. \"But I would love to see her make space for black girls and women in the public sphere and the public imagination. In a perfect world, she might create and lead a robust and well-funded organization dedicated to black girls and women, one that implements a set of initiatives that encourage black girls and women to flourish.\" (Not unlike My Brother's Keeper, the program created in 2014 by the Obama administration to support young black men.) Soon enough we'll learn how Michelle Obama will spend the next decade. In time, I hope, we'll read her reflections on the previous one. In the meantime, \"The Meaning of Michelle\" is a thank-you note, of sorts, and a reminder of all that she represents. \"This reach toward confidence in our belonging is perhaps one of the most important struggles of our time,\" Chambers writes. \" James Baldwin knew this, and it is why he once wrote that he hoped future generations of black Americans would remember that 'your crown has been bought and paid for. All you have to do is wear it.' Thank you, Michelle Obama, for showing us how to wear it.\" ",

    "text": "By Paul Farhi January 10 at 2:46 PM Follow @farhip Fox News quietly settled sexual-harassment allegations lodged by a former network host against Bill O\u2019Reilly and the network\u2019s co-president, according to published reports. Juliet Huddy , who appeared on the network from 1998 to 2012, reportedly settled for an amount in the high six figures in September, the website LawNewz.com and the New York Times said. Huddy had appeared semi-regularly on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s top-rated show, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d for several years but said her career was derailed after she rebuffed advances by both men. The allegations were settled several weeks after Fox News chairman and founder Roger Ailes was pushed out by parent company 21st Century Fox amid claims of widespread sexual harassment during his 20-year tenure. Ailes\u2019s ouster was set in motion by a sexual-harassment suit filed by former host Gretchen Carlson , which Fox reportedly settled for $20 million . Both publications said they obtained a draft of an intent-to-sue letter sent by Huddy\u2019s attorneys to Fox News last year that contained lurid allegations about O\u2019Reilly\u2019s relationship with Huddy. It included details of unwanted propositions and harassing phone calls, during some of which O\u2019Reilly apparently was masturbating, according to the letter. It further claimed that Jack Abernethy , who was named co-president of Fox News after Ailes was ousted from the network, had harassed Huddy and harmed her TV career while he was the head of the Fox TV station group. \u201cJuliet Huddy\u2019s letter of intent to sue contained substantial falsehoods which both men vehemently denied,\u201d Fox spokeswoman Irena Briganti said in an email. Huddy also alleged that O\u2019Reilly kissed her against her will during a tour of his home on Long Island and on one occasion lured her to his hotel room in New York and answered the door wearing only boxer shorts. The letter said she rejected O\u2019Reilly\u2019s demands for a personal relationship and was booted from his show as a result. O\u2019Reilly \u2014 who separated from his wife in 2010 and later divorced her \u2014 settled a sexual harassment claim in 2004 with a former producer of his program, Andrea Mackris. He admitted no wrongdoing. Mackris, who received a multimillion-dollar payment, also claimed that O\u2019Reilly made unwanted advances and engaged in sexually explicit phone conversations with her, allegedly while he was masturbating. Fox was aware of Huddy\u2019s allegations when it named Abernethy and senior executive vice president Bill Shine to be co-presidents in August, according to people briefed on the matter. Huddy\u2019s father, John Huddy, was a longtime colleague of Ailes\u2019s, serving as a consultant to the network. Her brother, also named John, is a Middle East correspondent for Fox News. Juliet Huddy had a regular segment on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d called \u201cDid You See That?\u201d and then another called \u201cMad as Hell,\u201d where she would appear on set with O\u2019Reilly. She left Fox News in 2012, transferring to the New York Fox broadcast station, WNYW. She left that station in September, saying she planned to start a website covering the music industry. Huddy and 21st Century Fox agreed to settle Huddy\u2019s claims with an agreement that binds all parties to confidentiality, the news reports said. lifestyle ",

    "text": "Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute have developed a minimally invasive gene transplant procedure that changes heart muscle cells into ce... The company\u2019s Merlinhome Transmitter electronically sends details on the device\u2019s performance to a website where the patient\u2019s physician can review the information. But that device can also be hacked. The FDA\u2019s review is ongoing, agency spokeswoman Angela Stark said. Its investigation confirmed the vulnerabilities of the home transmitter, which could potentially be hacked and used to rapidly deplete an implanted device battery, alter pacing and potentially administer inappropriate and dangerous shocks to a person\u2019s heart. The software patch issued by St. Jude \u201caddresses vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to patients,\u201d Stark said. Stark said the company is working to address remaining vulnerabilities quickly. She said any new cardiac devices submitted to the FDA for review that use the affected transmitter will not be cleared or approved without the software update. St. Jude disclosed details about the problem after it merged with Abbott. The company has previously denied findings that their devices could be hacked and filed a lawsuit against Muddy Waters LLC and MedSec, alleging that they tried to manipulate the markets to profit from the vulnerability research disclosures. The revelations about a hacker\u2019s ability to potentially gain remote access and affect even the workings of a human heart shed light on the pressing problems of cybersecurity in an increasingly networked world. The advisory also highlights the dilemma for security researchers who may feel an obligation to inform the public of possible dangers but don\u2019t want to cause unnecessary panic. \u201cYour average patient isn\u2019t going to be targeted by assassins,\u201d said Matthew Green, an assistant professor for computer science at Johns Hopkins University. He was hired by Muddy Waters to help validate the MedSec findings after St. Jude filed its lawsuit. \u201cAn attack on this level is low-probability but very high-impact.\u201d He called it \u201cprobably the most impactful vulnerability I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Green said many of the more severe vulnerabilities identified by MedSec for the devices themselves have not been fixed, but the new software would make the home system a little more secure. The FDA has been urging manufacturers to update their products, software and security measures since at least 2013. However, agency guidelines issued last year are not binding. The FDA does not review the vast majority of cyber security updates made to devices, under its own rules intended to streamline medical device upgrades. In 2015 the FDA issued two separate safety alerts to hospitals over drug pumps made by Hospira, now owned by Pfizer. In the second notice, regulators told hospitals to stop using the company\u2019s Symbiq Infusion System after the company confirmed the system could be remotely hacked, allowing an outside party to potentially reprogram the drug pumps. The devices are used to slowly dose intravenous drugs for pain, infection, nutrition and other uses and are usually programmed through a wireless hospital network. No patient injuries were reported in connection with the issue, but the agency urged users \u201cto begin transitioning to alternative infusion systems as soon as possible.\u201d Hospira discontinued the pumps for unrelated reasons prior to the FDA announcement, according to the agency. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Barack Obama during a rally against war with Iraq in front of the Federal Plaza in Chicago on Oct. 2, 2002. Bettylu Saltzman talks with Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama during a rally against war with Iraq in front of the Federal Plaza in Chicago on Oct. 2, 2002. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Leonor Vivanco Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune After eight years in office, President Barack Obama is set to give his last speech as the nation's leader in a farewell address Tuesday evening in Chicago, where he says it all started. But before he entered the race for the nation's highest office, coined the slogan \"Yes, we can\" or celebrated his historic presidential victory in Grant Park, the Chicago Tribune revisited Obama's political rise from a relatively unknown community organizer to lawyer to elected official. One of the first stories published in the Tribune that mentions Barack Obama \u00a0appeared in 1985, the year he moved to Chicago. He worked with the Calumet Community Religious Conference, which was a recipient of a $40,000 grant awarded by The Campaign for Human Development, a nationwide Roman Catholic antipoverty program. Obama said in the story that the grant was to be used to assess skills of unemployed workers and to aid them in finding jobs. Obama spoke to the Tribune a number of times before he hit the national stage. In several instances, his first name was misspelled and later corrected. Here are five excerpts from the newspaper's archives, many of which foreshadow his political future.\u00a0 Read the story here. Harvard Law Review president In 1990, at age 28, Obama was named the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, the nation's most prestigious student legal journal. \"People don't feel that they can have much impact,\" Obama said at the time . \"I want to get people involved in having a say in how their lives are run. More and more of that needs to be done.\" He said he planned to spend a couple of years practicing law after he graduated from Harvard and most likely return to community organizing \u2014 and maybe politics. \"I'll definitely be coming back to Chicago,\" he said.\u00a0 Read the story here. Minority law partners A few months later,\u00a0 Obama spoke to the Tribune about a survey that showed law firms were slow to hire minority partners, with minorities representing only nine of the 250 new partners brought into Chicago's 21 top law firms. As a Harvard Law School student, editor of the Harvard Law Review and summer associate at Chicago-based Hopkins & Sutter firm, Obama said the problem stemmed from how law firms recruited students. \"If these law firms want to solve these problems, they should go beyond Yale and the University of Chicago to recruit,\" Obama said. \"I think there are a lot of excellent minority law students who have families that can't incur a $25,000 debt for a law school education. So they don't go to nationally ranked schools.\"\u00a0 Read the story here . State Senate seat State Sen. Alice Palmer decided to throw her name in for the congressional seat vacated by U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds, who was convicted of sex crimes. But after losing to Jesse Jackson Jr. in a Democratic primary in 1995, Palmer sought re-election to the state legislature. By then, she had backed Obama as her successor. \"Since she endorsed me, I can always use, 'Even my opponent wants me' as a campaign slogan,\" Obama said in 1995 . Palmer withdrew her bid for the office after signatures on her nominating petitions were challenged. Obama went on to claim victory in 1996 and served in the Illinois Senate until he was elected in 2004 to the U.S. Senate.\u00a0 Read the story here. Congressional run In 1999, Obama set his sights on a congressional run against Bobby Rush, an incumbent who was seeking a fifth term after losing the mayoral election months earlier as a challenger to Richard M. Daley. \"I think an elected official's vision is more important than his seniority,\" Obama told the Tribune . \"Rep. Rush was unconcerned with seniority when he ran against his prior incumbent because he felt he would bring more energy to the office, and that's what I intend to do.\" Obama came in second behind Rush in the 2000 primary, claiming only 30 percent of the vote. It would be four more years before he won a U.S. Senate seat.\u00a0 Read the story here . Missing a vote Obama was visiting his grandmother in Hawaii around Christmastime in 1999 and missed a vote on a gun control bill during a special session in Springfield. He was criticized for it.\u00a0 Obama said his 18-month-old daughter Malia was sick with the flu, and he decided to stay with his family. \"We have a lot of politicians who like to talk about family values. At some point you have to live those families values,\" he said.\u00a0 Read the story here . ",

While Tillerson was CEO of ExxonMobil, new reports show the company made business deals with countries who were under U.S. sanctions at the time. USA TODAY NETWORK ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson is President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of State. (Photo: 2006 photo by LM Otero, AP) President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of State\u00a0expressed interest in a 2016 interview\u00a0as\u00a0CEO of ExxonMobil about doing business with Iran if sanctions were lifted, a view\u00a0that puts him at odds with\u00a0Republicans weighing his confirmation. Rex Tillerson\u00a0is scheduled to testify Wednesday at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which includes members opposed to deals between U.S. companies and Iran. Such business ties are\u00a0possible following the lifting of sanctions under the nuclear deal negotiated by Iran, the Obama administration and\u00a0five other world powers. ExxonMobil and Iran did business under secretary of State nominee Tillerson Last March,\u00a0Tillerson told CNBC that his company would consider doing\u00a0business in oil-rich Iran if the opportunity arose. While U.S. companies are\u00a0still unable to conduct business there, a lot of European competitors can,\u00a0Tillerson told the business cable channel . Investment opportunities with Iran opened up after some sanctions were lifted as part of the nuclear deal, which went into effect a year ago. \u201cI also learned a long time ago that sometimes being the first in is not necessarily best,\u201d Tillerson\u00a0said. \u201cWe'll wait and see if things open up for U.S. companies. We would certainly take a look because it's a huge resource-owning country.\u201d Republicans in Congress\u00a0oppose\u00a0the nuclear deal, saying it puts billions of dollars in the hands of an anti-U.S. regime that sponsors terrorism around the world. Last year, they moved to block financing for a large sale of Boeing commercial aircraft to Iran. Trump also has assailed the nuclear pact and vowed to scrap it. ExxonMobil\u00a0spokesman Alan Jeffers told USA TODAY on Tuesday that Tillerson, who resigned from the company to join Trump's Cabinet, was answering a hypothetical question in the CNBC interview. \"Anywhere we can work legally, we would do so, but the current situation in Iran now is not one that allows us to do that,\" Jeffers said. According to correspondence between ExxonMobil and the U.S. Securities\u00a0and Exchange Commission, the company did business with Iran through a European joint venture, Infineum, from 2003 to 2005, when\u00a0U.S. companies were barred from doing business with Tehran. The oil giant said the transactions were legal because they were conducted and managed by a European company co-owned with Shell whose management was independent and involved no U.S. personnel. Tillerson was a senior vice president at ExxonMobil from August 2001 until he became\u00a0president and director in March 2004. He became chairman and chief executive on Jan. 1, 2006. In a letter to USA TODAY on Tuesday, Suzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil\u2019s vice president for public and government affairs, said: \u201cThe transactions in question complied fully with all laws and regulations and no federal agency took action following the company\u2019s responses to the SEC\u2019s routine inquiry more than a decade ago.\u201d \u201cThe company had limited business in the countries during the 2003-2005 period asked about by the SEC, which strictly complied with all applicable regulations,\u201d McCarron said. Jeffers said no such joint ventures are currently in place with foreign companies doing business in Iran. Tillerson's career at ExxonMobil involved finding,\u00a0exploring and producing petroleum, and he was unlikely to have been involved in the joint venture before he became president of the company in 2004, Jeffers said. \"Prior to his time as president, he never would have been responsible for Infineum operations,\" Jeffers said. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox News on Tuesday that there was a loophole in the legislation that existed that allowed doing business with Iran. But that was closed in 2012. \"I don't think that any\u00a0violations took place in that\u00a0regard,\" Corker said. \"But these are legitimate questions,\u00a0and I'm sure he (Tillerson) is going to be\u00a0very prepared to answer those.\" 1966 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2js5mlY NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

USA TODAY Sports Jordan Hankins, back left, with her teammates after Saturday's loss to Maryland (Photo: Courtesy of Christine Brennan, USA TODAY Sports) She sat to my right as I spoke to the team, one of a dozen faces looking at me as I looked back at them in the visiting locker room at the University of Maryland Saturday afternoon. I didn\u2019t know her. We had met briefly a year earlier, just a handshake, nothing more. Nonetheless, 19-year-old sophomore guard Jordan Hankins, sitting in a chair in her purple uniform just minutes after a tough loss to the Terrapins, was someone I had come to talk to, and to thank. In addition to being a columnist and commentator, I\u2019m on the board of trustees at my alma mater, Northwestern University. One of my great joys is to be a part of the lives of as many NU students as possible, including our women\u2019s sports teams. MORE COVERAGE: Northwestern women's basketball player Jordan Hankins' death ruled suicide So, when the basketball team was coming to play in the Washington, D.C., suburbs near my home,\u00a0it was only natural that I\u2019d pay a visit to the locker room after the game. Coach Joe McKeown asked me to say a few words. It had been a difficult game, a 96-65 loss to third-ranked Maryland, but I didn\u2019t want to focus on that. I wanted to focus on the players. They are amazing students. They are terrific athletes. And they will be great leaders in our country for the next 50 years. I said all of that. I also made sure to thank them for the wonderful way they represent the\u00a0university. It was just a few minutes, but I hoped they felt a little better when I was done. The game was important, yes, but there was so much more ahead for each of them. As the players got up, I said hello to a few of them. I\u00a0didn\u2019t happen to speak to Jordan, but my sister did. She\u00a0had come to the game with me and snapped a few photos. In that cramped space as we were about to leave, she happened to find herself next to Jordan for a moment. \u201cGood game,\u201d she said. Jordan thanked her. And that was that \u2013 until Monday night, when the news broke that Jordan had died in her dorm room on campus in Evanston, Ill., the same dorm I lived in my freshman and sophomore years. My sister had texted me the photos she took, so I started looking through them, and sure enough, there was Jordan. She was partially obscured by a teammate, but I could see that she was listening intently. The photo was heartbreaking. In a room full of young women with their whole lives ahead of them, one would be gone in less than 48 hours. On Tuesday, the Cook County (Ill.) Medical Examiner\u2019s report on Jordan was released. Her death was ruled a suicide. She hanged herself. It\u2019s hard to take my eyes off the photo from the locker room. There are Jordan and her teammates, looking serious, even glum, because they had just lost an important Big Ten basketball game. These are competitive, strong, bright women. It was understandable, of course, that they would feel that way. They, and all of us around them, had no idea what was to come. 1512 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

Jones , USA TODAY Published 4:04 p.m. ET Jan. 10, 2017 | Updated 5:34 p.m. ET Jan. 10, 2017 1.6k Shares x Share Madonna describes the roller coaster ride of emotions that she and her agent experienced on the night of the election in a Harper\u2019s Bazaar interview. USA TODAY NETWORK On election night, Madonna was sitting at a table with her agent, the Quran and Zohar both open. A vocal Hillary Clinton supporter, the pop star prayed for an upset. She woke up to a historic one: Donald Trump had clinched the presidency. In conversation with Difficult Women author Roxane Gay for Harper\u2019s Bazaar , Madonna discusses the outcome of the election, which she says left her \"broken.\" \"Donald Trump is the president. It's not a bad dream. It really happened.\" @Madonna talks politics in our new issue: https://t.co/7tYr98uHGK pic.twitter.com/qEGA2AqcLN \u2014 Harper's Bazaar (@harpersbazaarus) January 10, 2017 \"I wake up every morning and it's like when you break up with somebody who has really broken your heart,\" she says in the cover story, published Tuesday. \"You wake up and for a second you're just you, and then you go, \u2018Oh, the person I love more than anything has just broken my heart, and I'm devastated and I'm broken and I have nothing. I'm lost.\u2019 That's how I feel every morning. I wake up and I go, \u2018Wait a second. Donald Trump is the president. It's not a bad dream. It really happened.\u2019 It's like being dumped by a lover and also being stuck in a nightmare.\" But that nightmare isn\u2019t paralyzing the singer-songwriter, for whom the label \"provocateur\" has become de rigueur. \"I have to get way more vocal and become a little bit less mysterious,\" Madonna says. 'What I find really astonishing is how quiet everybody is in my industry. I mean, nobody in the entertainment business except for maybe a handful of people ever speak out about what's going on. Nobody takes a political stance or expresses an opinion.\" \"They want to maintain a neutral position so they can maintain their popularity,\" she continues. \"I mean, if you have an opinion and people disagree with you, you might not get a job. You might be blacklisted. You might have fewer followers on Instagram. There are any number of things that would be detrimental to your career. Everyone's really afraid. Because it doesn't affect their daily life\u00a0yet,\u00a0no one's doing anything about it.\" But for Madonna, the plan is to use her work as a tool \u2014 whether it be for resistance or evolution. \"For me, it's either you're part of creation or you're part of destruction,\" she says.

Jerry Brown predicts a $1.6-billion deficit as he unveils state budget Less than four years after declaring California\u2019s budget was balanced for the foreseeable future, Gov. Jerry Brown on Jan. 10 said the state is now projected to run a $1.6-billion deficit by next summer. (Jan. 10, 2017) Less than four years after declaring California\u2019s budget was balanced for the foreseeable future, Gov. Jerry Brown on Jan. 10 said the state is now projected to run a $1.6-billion deficit by next summer. (Jan. 10, 2017) John Myers Contact Reporter Less than four years after declaring California\u2019s budget balanced for the foreseeable future, Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday said the state is  projected to run a $1.6-billion deficit by next summer \u2014\u00a0a noticeable shift in the state\u2019s fiscal stability that could worsen under federal spending cuts championed by\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump . \u201cThe trajectory of revenue\u00a0growth is declining,\u201d Brown said in unveiling his $179.5-billion plan for the fiscal year that begins in July. The governor\u2019s sober assessment comes on the heels of several months of lagging tax revenue collections, a change in the state\u2019s fortunes\u00a0that could stifle his fellow Democrats\u2019\u00a0call for additional spending and give fuel to Republican demands for additional cuts. Brown\u2019s budget advisors lowered the\u00a0official tax revenue forecast, in part, because of slower than expected growth in wages. They also reduced expectations for sales and corporate taxes because of broader national trends. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Brown proposed to address the deficit primarily by slowing the\u00a0growth in spending on public schools by $1.7 billion, a change that brings funding down to the minimum required by formulas enshrined in California\u2019s Constitution. The governor also proposed scrapping $1.5 billion worth of\u00a0spending ideas left over from last year\u2019s budget negotiations, including higher subsidies for child-care programs\u00a0and awarding new college scholarships to California students from middle-class families. \u00a0 \u201cTo manage\u00a0unreliability requires prudence,\u201d Brown said of his decisions to address the projected budget shortfall. The governor\u2019s fiscal blueprint is the ceremonial first pitch in Sacramento\u2019s annual budget writing season, and, as such, the details will shift in coming months to address changing fiscal conditions.\u00a0That could include any effort by the nation\u2019s ruling Republicans to rethink any of the $105 billion in federal funding promises the state expects to receive for a variety of services.\u00a0 The most\u00a0consequential of those is the $16.1-billion subsidy for Medi-Cal, the program offering\u00a0healthcare to\u00a0the state\u2019s most needy, provided through the Affordable Care Act. Those funds have helped the state add more than 3.8 million people to the Medi-Cal system, a network of providers that reaches one in every three Californians. Republican leaders in Congress and the president-elect\u00a0have vowed to repeal the law championed by President Obama, though they have yet to identify when or how that will happen . That uncertainty is why Brown\u2019s new budget plan does not officially lay out a path forward, though the governor made it clear on\u00a0Tuesday that he thinks GOP leaders should rethink their political promises in regard to Obamacare. \u201cThat\u2019s very bold and, I think, a move that isn\u2019t very consistent with decency,\u201d the governor said Tuesday. He also offered national leaders some advice as they weigh the merits of various federal subsidies. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u00a0this country needs any more divisive kinds of moves that divide the poor and the rich, split the middle class and all those other things that will be the result if the rhetorical thrust, as suggested in the last few weeks, becomes the operational reality in Washington,\u201d\u00a0Brown said. Gov. Jerry Brown often gets his way when it comes to tax revenue forecasts, and that's a big deal \u00bb But the governor offered a dash of his own brand of raw politics Tuesday by asking legislators to approve an extension of California\u2019s system for buying and trading greenhouse gas pollution credits.\u00a0 That cap-and-trade program faces an uncertain future beyond 2020, as business groups have challenged its legality in court. On Tuesday, Brown proposed\u00a0that the Legislature officially reauthorize the program \u2014\u00a0which would require a supermajority vote in both houses \u2014\u00a0and hinted that he might otherwise\u00a0block the spending of $2.2 billion in proceeds from the auctions of those credits. \"Given the fact that the federal government\u00a0is going in the\u00a0opposite direction,\u201d Brown said\u00a0of\u00a0the climate change debate, \u201cI would think that Californians want to strengthen their own commitment.\u201d Advocates for social services, though, saw the\u00a0budget plan as lacking any new strength for the state\u2019s most needy. \u00a0 \"This is just a very conservative budget that really doesn't do anything to reduce poverty in the state of California,\u201d said Mike Herald of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, who pointed to a lack of new money for welfare assistance efforts or affordable housing. The governor\u2019s budget also offers less than expected for backers of Proposition 56, last year\u2019s tobacco tax increase earmarked to boost healthcare funding. While Brown pegs the tax\u2019s infusion of new money at $1.2 billion, it is offset by overall sagging tax revenues, and therefore, unlikely to boost the reimbursement rates sought by doctors who\u00a0treat Medi-Cal patients. Democrats, in general, sounded positive notes about the governor\u2019s proposal. One key source of early criticism, though, was his plan to phase out the scholarships offered to middle-class students attending University of California and Cal State campuses. The budget proposes to renew scholarships for 37,000 current recipients but offers no new assistance beyond that. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount)\u00a0said the plan, coupled with proposed tuition increases , would be unfair. \u201cWe must work to keep college affordable for California students,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will not support burdening them with higher fees and greater student debt.\u201d In all, Brown\u2019s budget continues a long trend toward allowing additional spending while restraining the political desires of Democrats to do more. And while it doesn\u2019t spell out a specific need to respond to\u00a0changes pushed by Trump and congressional Republicans that are\u00a0on the horizon, the governor made clear that all budget decisions in Sacramento are in some way subject to the national debate. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to have to hold on to our hat here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a rough ride.\u201d Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

    "text": "Email A spongy new super-material could be lighter than the flimsiest plastic yet 10 times stronger than steel . The new super-material is made up of flecks of\u00a0 graphene \u00a0squished and fused together into a vast, cobwebby network. The fluffy structure, which looks a bit like a psychedelic sea creature, is almost completely hollow; its density is just 5 percent that of ordinary graphene, the researchers said. What\u2019s more, though the researchers used graphene, the seemingly magical properties of the material do not totally depend on the atoms used: The secret ingredient is the way those atoms are aligned, the scientists said. \u201cYou can replace the material itself with anything,\u201d Markus J. Buehler, a materials scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) \u00a0 said in a statement . \u201cThe geometry is the dominant factor. It\u2019s something that has the potential to transfer to many things.\u201d Graphene, a material made up of flaky sheets of\u00a0 carbon \u00a0atoms, is the\u00a0 strongest material on Earth \u00a0\u2014 at least in 2D sheets. On paper, ultrathin sheets of graphene, which are just an atom thick, have unique electrical properties and indomitable strength. Unfortunately, these properties don\u2019t easily translate to 3D shapes that are used to build things. [ 7 Technologies That Transformed Warfare ] Past simulations suggested that orienting the graphene atoms a specific way could enhance strength in three dimensions. However, when researchers tried to create these materials in the lab, the results were often hundreds or thousands of times weaker than predicted, the researchers said in the statement.\u00a0 Stronger than steel To address this challenge, the team got down to basics: analyzing the structure at the atomic level. From there, the researchers created a mathematical model that can accurately predict how to create remarkably strong super-materials. The researchers then used precise amounts of heat and pressure to produce the resulting curvy, labyrinthine structures, known as gyroids,\u00a0 which were first mathematically described by a NASA scientist in 1970 . \u201cActually making them using conventional manufacturing methods is probably impossible,\u201d Buehler said. The material\u2019s strength comes from its enormous surface-area-to-volume ratio, the researchers reported in a study published Jan. 6 in the\u00a0 journal Science Advances . In nature, sea creatures like coral and diatoms also leverage a large surface-area-to-volume ratio to achieve incredible strength at tiny scales. \u201cOnce we created these 3D structures, we wanted to see what\u2019s the limit \u2014 what\u2019s the strongest possible material we can produce,\u201d study co-author Zhao Qin, a civil and environmental engineering researcher at MIT, said in the statement. The scientists created a series of models, built them, and then subjected them to tension and compression. The strongest material the researchers created was about as dense as the lightest plastic bag, yet stronger than steel. One obstacle to creating these superstrong materials is the lack of industrial manufacturing capability for producing them, the researchers said. However, there are ways the material could be produced at larger scales, the scientists said For instance, the actual particles could be used as templates that are coated with graphene through chemical vapor deposition; the underlying template could then be eaten or peeled away using chemicals or physical techniques, leaving the graphene\u00a0 gyroid \u00a0behind, the researchers said. In the future, massive bridges could be made of gyroid concrete, which would be ultrastrong, lightweight, and insulated against heat and cold because of all the myriad air pockets in the material, the researchers said.

    "text": "January 10, 201711:01 AM ET Katherine Hobson Folic acid in food might not be enough to prevent birth defects, a federal advisory panel says. Thus the recommendation for supplements. Mary Altaffer/AP hide caption toggle caption Mary Altaffer/AP If you can get pregnant, you should be popping at least one pill a day: a folic acid supplement to lower the risk of a type of serious birth defect in any future offspring. So says the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which Tuesday reiterated its 2009 recommendation that all women who can conceive take 400 to 800 micrograms daily of the B vitamin in case their diet isn't providing enough of it. Back in 1991, a study found that folic acid supplementation greatly reduced the risk of neural tube defects, a type of birth defect that includes anencephaly and spina bifida . In 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that women take 400 micrograms as a daily supplement. And starting in 1998, to reach more women, the FDA required that manufacturers fortify cereal and other enriched grains with folic acid, which is the synthetic version of vitamin B9. Fortification was associated with a drop in neural tube defects, from 10.7 cases per 10,000 live births before fortification to seven cases after fortification, the USPSTF says. (It's not clear how much of that decline was due to fortification.) And not all of these defects are caused by a folate deficiency, so it's not known how that number would change if every woman had enough in the critical early days in pregnancy, often before a woman realizes she is pregnant. Article continues after sponsorship Despite the unknowns, \"the evidence is pretty clear that [supplementation] reduces risk ... and it's strong enough that all women who can potentially become pregnant should take it,\" says Alex Kemper , a pediatrician and member of the Task Force. The recommendation was published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Associaition. Coming Soon To A Tortilla Near You: A Vitamin To Prevent Birth Defects For some women, eating fortified foods may do the job, but for others that may not be enough, says Joseph Biggio , who chairs the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Genetics. \"It's highly diet-dependent,\" he says. Women on gluten-free or low-carb diets may not be eating fortified grain products. Nor may many be getting enough sources of folate , the naturally occurring version of vitamin B9, including dark, leafy green vegetables, beef liver and beans. Adolescents as well as ethnic minorities may be at particular risk of deficiency, says Biggio. (Last year the FDA allowed manufacturers to fortify foods made from corn masa, to help prevent birth defects among Hispanic women.) To be safe, ACOG recommends supplementation of 400 micrograms a day. The neural tube is a part of the embryo that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord. \"Picture a pancake that rolls up and forms a tube. That's literally how it forms,\" says James Mills , a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who wrote an editorial in JAMA accompanying the recommendations. That closure happens within 28 days of conception, leaving a short window for women to benefit from supplementation. Not much is known about how the vitamin actually helps prevent defects. So it's unclear, for example, whether a woman who ate a lot of fortified cereal and bread before conception would be OK, or whether she needs to be consistently taking in some form of vitamin B9 throughout those 28 days, says Mills. Because the critical developmental stage comes so soon after conception, the USPSTF, ACOG and other groups recommend that all women who might become pregnant should take a supplement, not just those who are planning to conceive. Almost half of pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, according to the Guttmacher Institute. You'd Think We'd Have Baby-Making All Figured Out, But No Folic acid is available as an individual supplement or as part of a multivitamin. Just check the label to make sure it contains at least 400 micrograms, advises Kemper. The USPSTF found little evidence of serious harm from folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age, he says. One known problem is that it can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia in elderly people, says Mills. For that reason, the Institute of Medicine recommends 1,000 micrograms as an upper limit of folic acid consumption from supplements and fortified foods.

Energized by Republican moves to roll back the Affordable Care Act , leading patient advocates, consumer groups, labor unions and Democratic officials are mobilizing a nationwide campaign to defend the law and protect millions of Americans who depend on\u00a0the law and other government health\u00a0programs. ... (Noam N. Levey and Michael A. Memoli) Obama will convene friends, longtime supporters and alumni of his campaigns and his White House to deliver his parting message. He\u2019ll be near the scene of the speech he gave in Grant Park on the night of his historic election in 2008, but with temperatures forecast in the 30s,\u00a0he will speak inside the sprawling McCormick Place convention center near Lake Michigan. Senior advisors say Obama knows that many progressives, religious and ethnic minorities, and immigrants are feeling apprehensive\u00a0with the approach of the handover to\u00a0Trump, who was elected after promising to crack down on immigration, scrutinize Muslims in the U.S. and challenge what he termed political correctness. Elections have consequences, Obama told fellow Democrats recently, and they need to work hard to elect candidates they believe in. But he also wants to remind supporters that they are not powerless just because Democrats are out of power in the White House and Congress. \u201cThis is the great gift our founders gave us: the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat, toil and imagination \u2014 and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a greater good,\u201d Obama was to say. The remarks are expected to be Obama\u2019s final address in office, though he may still conduct one more news conference before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Throughout his presidency, Obama has used his bully pulpit to inspire, condemn and cajole.

    "text": "Jan 10 2017, 3:38 pm ET Trump's Call For 'Quick' Obamacare Replacement Complicates GOP Efforts by Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe Share advertisement President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wants to see Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act soon and pass a replacement \"very quickly or simultaneously.\" His urging contradicts Republican leaders who have been cautioning that overhauling the massive health care law would take time. Trump would like Obamacare repealed within days and contended that \"the replace will be very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter,\" he told the New York Times in an interview Tuesday . \"Long to me would be weeks,\" Trump added. Trump's statements could be an effort at public persuasion but they are complicating efforts for congressional Republicans working to plot out plans to repeal and replace the ACA in a manner that would be politically and economically viable while maintaining the support of enough Republicans to pass the legislation. While the repeal effort is scheduled to be complete by the end of January, if all goes according to plan, Republican leaders have said replacement could take much longer, possibly months or even years. Play How quickly will GOP replace Obamacare? 3:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170110222559if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/850747459849\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Republican leaders are feeling pressure from some rank-and-file members who are feeling jittery to speed up the multi-step process and replace the health care law at the same time it is repealed. House Speaker Paul Ryan indicated Tuesday morning, before Trump's comments, that he is taking into consideration the concerns of some in his GOP conference about a long lag between repeal and replace. \"It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently,\" Ryan said for the first time. \"We are going to use every tool at our disposal through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal so we can save people from this mess.\" Related: More Republicans Express Concern About Repealing Obamacare The Senate and House are expected to vote on the first step of the repeal process this week as part of a budget resolution known as reconciliation. The legislation directs that the second part of the repeal process, which would actually start to dismantle the health care law, be complete by January 27. But Trump's latest remarks have put him in front of the debate, putting even more pressure on Republican leaders to speed up the process. Republican leaders Tuesday declined denounce - or support - Trump's timeline and insisted they are on the same page. Trump's plans are \"not any way inconsistent with the timeline we're aiming for,\" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said. One member of leadership, Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said that Trump's public pronouncements and apparent lack of understanding of the complexities of how Congress works - and the difficulty in passing legislation so quickly - are complicating their efforts. \"From a messaging standpoint, yes I worry,\" Thune said about Trump's comments. Trump had been publicly cautioning Republicans for the past week, telling them via Twitter to \"be careful\" in their health care repeal efforts, which could be politically challenging. Five Republican senators have proposed an amendment that would postpone the repeal deadline until March 3, giving legislators enough time to draw up a replacement plan to vote on simultaneously. There is division among Republicans about that idea and Republican leaders haven't committed to allowing a vote on it. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, is one of the members sponsoring that amendment. He said about Trump's accelerated timeline: \"I'm looking forward to hearing how they would anticipate that occurring.\" Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

Kennedy Jr. takes part in a panel discussion following a screening of the film \u201cTrace Amounts\u201d on March 24, 2015 in New York City. Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Trace Amounts Email President-elect Donald Trump met with Robert Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday. According to incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, the two discussed \u201cthe issues pertaining to vaccines and immunizations.\u201d After the meeting concluded, Kennedy told reporters that Mr. Trump had asked him to \u201cchair a commission on vaccination safety and scientific integrity.\u201d Kennedy said he told Mr. Trump he would chair such a commission, and that their meeting was held at Mr. Trump\u2019s request.\u00a0 Kennedy, the eldest son of liberal icon Sen. Robert Kennedy, was best known as an environmental advocate before increasingly devoting his time to the supposed dangers of vaccines.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has repeatedly shared his belief that there is a link between vaccines and autism .\u00a0 \u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a 2015 GOP primary debate. \u201cBut I want smaller doses over a longer period of time. Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump--I mean, it looks just like it\u2019s meant for a horse, not for a child, and we\u2019ve had so many instances, people that work for me. ... [in which] a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back and a week later had a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d He also also tweeted about the issue multiple times:\u00a0 Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2014 Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose. Kennedy has argued that vaccines, specifically those containing the element thimerosal, may cause autism, a view unsupported by scientific evidence and dismissed as a conspiracy theory by experts. \u201cResearch does not show any link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder,\u201d says the Center for Disease Control on its website. Moreover, studies linking vaccines and autism have been repeatedly been debunked and discredited, although many parents continue to insist that their children were damaged by immunizations. Kennedy, who criticized Mr. Trump during the election campaign, has also written a book and promoted a documentary on the subject. During one showing of that documentary, according to the Sacramento Bee, Kennedy compared the damage done by vaccines to \u201ca holocaust.\u201d \u201cThey get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said at the screening in 2015. \u201cThis is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d It was a comment which he later apologized for , saying, \u201cI employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Betsy DeVos, picked by President-elect Donald Trump for education secretary, speaks during the USA Thank You Tour last month in Grand Rapids, Mich. Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images The confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, the billionaire philanthropist who is President-elect Donald Trump's choice for secretary of education, has been delayed for almost a week. DeVos' hearing was scheduled for Wednesday, but late on Monday night, the Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions announced it had been delayed until Jan. 17, next Tuesday. Senate Democrats Question Vetting Of Cabinet Picks With Slew Of Hearings The move comes after Democrats had raised concerns about the wealthy philanthropist's incomplete financial disclosures and unfinished ethics review, as Politico reported last week . The top Democrat on the HELP committee asked for a rescheduled hearing, saying she was concerned about \"extensive financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest,\" Politico says. DeVos submitted her financial disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics last month but has not yet finalized or signed the paperwork, Politico reported Friday. Trump's Pick For Education: A Free Market Approach To School Choice The Washington Post reports that DeVos' \"vast wealth and considerable financial holdings have overwhelmed the bipartisan Office of Government Ethics,\" which vets Cabinet nominees. The office has not finished examining DeVos' investments for possible ethical concerns, the newspaper reported Saturday. But in announcing the delay, the HELP committee made no reference to concerns over conflicts of interest. Instead, the committee said the delay was \"at the request of Senate leadership to accommodate Senate schedule.\" DeVos is a \"strong supporter of school choice\" with \"limited experience with public education,\" as NPR's Eric Westervelt has reported : \"DeVos, 58, is a former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and helped push a failed 2000 ballot proposal to amend the Michigan state Constitution to create a voucher system for students to attend nonpublic schools. \"DeVos is chairman of The Windquest Group , a Michigan-based investment management company. She is married to billionaire Richard DeVos Jr., the son of Richard DeVos, who co-founded the home care products company Amway. \" ... Largely unknown outside of Michigan political and philanthropic circles, her appointment signals that Trump intends to make school choice and a voucher plan for low-income families a centerpiece of his education agenda. \"School choice plans are controversial because in some cases they can allow families to use public funding for private schools. Critics say choice plans undermine public education, are often underregulated and can amount to profiteering.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "US Intelligence Agency Leaders Squarely Blame Election Hacking on Russia By JUSTIN FISHEL Jan 10, 2017, 4:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Obama Weighs In on Intelligence Report 0 Shares Email In his most stark comments on the matter to date, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper today squarely blamed the cyber-hacks of the 2016 presidential election on the Russian government. During a hearing of the Senate Committee on Intelligence, Clapper outlined key findings of a classified intelligence report on Russian election hacking that concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin \"ordered\" a campaign to influence the U.S. presidential election in an attempt by Russia to \"undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.\" \"We have high confidence that President Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\" Clapper said. \"The goals of this campaign were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency. Putin and the Russian government also developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" \"Moscow's influence campaign blended covert intelligence operations with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users,\" Clapper added. \"We are highly confident that the Russian intelligence services conducted cyber-operations against people and organizations associated with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including both major U.S. political parties.\" Russia's election meddling is not limited to the United States, Clapper said, noting that Russia has targeted a \"couple dozen\" elections in other countries and that he fears that if Russia's capabilities evolve, it will continue to employ them. Republican committee member Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pointed out that the report made no determination about whether the hacks had any influence on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, saying he believes Trump won \"fair and square.\" Clapper testified alongside other leaders of the intelligence community, including CIA Director John Brennan, NSA and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers, and FBI Director Jim Comey, all of whose agencies contributed to the report. Intel Officials Warn About Skepticism From the Top The report was produced after President-elect Donald Trump for months publicly doubted the intelligence community's assessment about the Russia's role in hacking the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 president campaign. Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said this weekend that following a formal briefing by intelligence leaders, Trump had accepted the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was to blame. But in a statement Trump released after his briefing, he chose not to concede to the findings he publicly questioned and instead was critical of the DNC for not properly defending itself against cyber-threats. Comey testified today that the FBI tried to access the DNC's computer servers once it learned they had been compromised, but was denied by and only granted that access from a hired, third-party security firm. Comey said the FBI would have preferred to have access to the original devices. Today's hearing was also Comey's first opportunity to offer public comments on his stunning announcement days before the presidential election that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, but Democrats did not pursue that line of questioning. Instead, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, asked Comey if he knew of any ongoing investigations into \"contacts\" between Trump campaign officials and Putin's government. Comey said he couldn't confirm or deny any pending investigations, promting Wyden to say he was \"troubled\" that by answer. \"The American people have a right to know,\" Wyden said. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, also took a swipe at Comey, contrasting Comey's discretion in this instance to his decision to publicly announce just days before the presidential election that he'd reopened the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server and after he had already determined she should not be prosecuted for a crime. \"The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,\" King said to Comey. Comey eventually closed the Clinton investigation on Nov. 6, just two days before the election, again without recommending any charges. Clinton later blamed him in part for her loss to Donald Trump. Later during the hearing, Comey was asked if the intelligence report on Russia was in any way politicized at the direction of the White House. Comey said it was not, and added, \"I hope I've demonstrated by now, I'm tone-deaf when it comes to politics, and that's the way it should be.\" 0 Shares ",

The Cabinet nominee said recusing himself would be appropriate given some of the comments he made during the campaign. \"This country doesn't punish its political enemies,\" Sessions said after repeatedly pledging to remove himself from investigations into Clinton's email use as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation. \"Lock her up!\" became a rallying cry for Trump supporters throughout the contentious 2016 campaign. The president-elect has signaled he would not pursue more investigations into his former opponent, but Republicans in Congress have pledged to continue the inquiries. An FBI inquiry into Clinton's email use found no criminal wrongdoing. Racism Charges 'Damnably False' The Democratic case against Sessions has focused in part on the racism charges that cost him a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama after being nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Four former Justice Department colleagues testified that Sessions made racially offensive statements. In the previous hearing, also in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions was accused of suggesting a white lawyer who represented African-American clients was a disgrace to his race, calling civil rights groups \"un-American, and being sympathetic to the KKK.

Cory Booker will make history this week by becoming the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow senator nominated for a Cabinet position. \"We've seen Jeff Sessions \u2014 that's Senator Jeff Sessions \u2014 consistently voting against or speaking out against key ideals of the Voting Rights Act, taking measures to try to block criminal justice reform,\" Booker said on MSNBC on Monday. Rep. John Lewis and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus will also testify against Sessions. \"I deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters,\" Sessions said in opening remarks that were interrupted by protesters, some dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein used her opening remarks to list off a number votes Session made against further protections of voting rights, women's rights, and the LBTG community. \"This hearing must determine clearly whether this senator will enforce laws he votes against,\" she said. Sessions said he is \"totally committed\" to maintaining to the progress the country has made on minority rights. \"We can never go back,\" he said.

Sessions said the president-elect has amended his original campaign declaration that the U.S. should not admit Muslims amid the continued threat of ISIS. \"I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious groups should be denied admission to the United States,\" Sessions said. The Alabama senator defended his 2015 vote to against legislation aimed at preventing a religious litmus test for people entering the United States, saying he did not want to advance legislation that would not allow religion from being a consideration. When pressed on how he would handle Trump's pledges to deport undocumented immigrants, Sessions said it is his duty to enforce the laws passed by Congress. \"We're not able financially or any other way to seek out and remove every body that is in the country illegally,\" Sessions said. Criminals in the country illegally would be the top target for deportation, he added. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal grilled Sessions on an award he received from David Horowitz, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center has dubbed \"a driving force of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-black movements.\" Sessions is not familiar with the award, which Blumenthal said was left off his disclosure forms, or Horowitz's inflammatory remarks. He called Horowitz a \"brilliant\" writer. Trump's Inflammatory Remarks Resurface While defending Trump on the campaign trail, Sessions struggled to talk about the infamous 2005 tape in which Trump is heard brazenly talking about grabbing women's genitals. \"I don't characterize that as sexual assault. I think that's a stretch,\" Sessions told The Weekly Standard in October. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy pressed Sessions on the issue at the hearing: Play ",

Republicans were also targeted in the cyberespionage campaign although they did not suffer the same email leaks as the Democrats did. Comey told senators Tuesday that there were intrusions at state-level voter registration databases, but there was no evidence that Russian hackers targeted the Trump campaign or current Republican National Committee domains. Clapper said that only stolen information from Democrats was released. He added that Russia could be seeking to influence political views in about a couple dozen other countries. Related: U.S. Has ID'd Russians Who Gave Hacked Emails to WikiLeaks Commitee member Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said the Russians got what they wanted by creating chaos \"to get us to fight each other over whether our elections were legitimate.\" Rubio also raised the worry \u2014 and Clapper endorsed it \u2014 that the Russians could plant incriminating information on a U.S. politician to discredit him or her. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, said Russia's motive was simply to \"help Russia and to weaken America.\" \"In the next election, the shoe could be on the other foot, and a foreign power could decide they want a Democrat to win next time,\" he added. Trump has said he would put together a plan within 90 days to \"aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks,\" but indicated discussions on how to do so wouldn't be done publicly. In retaliation against Russia, President Barack Obama last month unveiled sanctions against the country's intelligence service and expelled 35 of its diplomats from the United States. Erik Ortiz ",

USA TODAY NETWORK President Obama arrives before speaking at McCormick Place in Chicago on Jan. 10, 2017. (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP) President Obama called for Americans to seek solidarity over division in a celebratory farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday, calling for a \"new social compact.\" Obama's final major speech as president was the same sort of rallying cry to activism that propelled him to the national stage a decade ago, asking supporters to continue the work to \"form a more perfect union.\" \"For all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title:\u00a0Citizen,\" he said to a crowd of approximately 18,000. \"Ultimately, that\u2019s what our democracy demands.\u00a0It needs you.\u00a0Not just when there\u2019s an election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime.\" Lamenting racial, economic and social divisions in the country, he exhorted Americans not to retreat into their \"bubbles.\" \"If you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life,\" he said. The address mentioned his successor only once, promising to facilitate \"the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next.\" But it was hard not to see in Obama's parting words a repudiation of a Trump era that has already begun. \"If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,\" he said. Obama lauded the contributions of immigrants and Muslim-Americans\u00a0and denounced \"naked partisanship,\" income inequality and a splintering media.\u00a0And he exhorted Americans not to \"retreat into our own bubbles\" of neighborhoods or churches or even social media feeds. \"Increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that\u2019s out there,\" he said. The \"selective sorting of the facts\" was self-defeating, he said, \"because as my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.\" Read more: In speech to Greeks, Obama warns against nationalist impulses He singled out climate change as an example. \"We can and should argue about the best approach to the problem.\u00a0But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our founders,\" he said. Obama's farewell covered the gamut of administration accomplishments, from the auto bailout to the Affordable Care Act to the killing of Osama bin Laden. But like George Washington, whose farewell address Obama quoted from, Obama warned against internal divisions. \"After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America.\u00a0Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic,\" he said. \"For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u00a0I\u2019ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were ten, or twenty, or thirty years ago \u2014 you can see it not just in statistics, but in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.\" Obama consciously chose Chicago as the venue for the speech, departing from a modern tradition that has mostly used the Oval Office as the set for a televised address. \"I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties, still trying to figure out who I was; still searching for a purpose to my life,\" he said. \"It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills.\u00a0It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.\u00a0 This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it. \"After eight years as your president, I still believe that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just my belief.\u00a0 It\u2019s the beating heart of our American idea \u2013 our bold experiment in self-government.\" Early on, the speech was interrupted by cheers and shouting. \"Four more years!\" Read more: Full text of Obama's farewell speech \"I can't do that\" \"I can't do that,\" Obama said.\u00a0\"In ten days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy:\u00a0the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next,\" he said, to a smattering of boos. On the way to Chicago, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that Obama is \u201cnot one to be overly sentimental,\u201d but it would be unrealistic for anyone in his position tonight not to feel some nostalgia But Obama teared up when he addressed first lady Michelle Obama. \"You took on a role you didn\u2019t ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor,\" he said. \"You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody.\u00a0And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.\u00a0You\u2019ve made me proud.\u00a0You\u2019ve made the country proud.\" The speech also hearkened back to the campaign rhetoric of 2008, ending in the chant of \"Yes we can!\" Obama did not specifically address his post-presidential plans. \"There will be a time and place\u201d for Obama to speak at length about that, Earnest said. But Obama promised to remain engaged in the causes of his presidency. \"I\u00a0won\u2019t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\u00a0 For now, whether you\u2019re young or young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president \u2014 the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. \"I am asking you to believe.\u00a0 Not in my ability to bring about change \u2013 but in yours. \"I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written.\" A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

USA TODAY NETWORK Convicted shooter Dylann Roof is escorted June 18, 2015, from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C. (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014\u00a0A federal district court jury decided Tuesday to sentence Dylann Roof to death for\u00a0his June 2015 attack on a black church's Bible study group after the panel found that life in prison offered no possibility of redemption for the 22-year-old. Jurors took about three hours to make their decision after listening to closing arguments from prosecutors and Roof, who told the panel in a brief, disjointed statement that he continues to stand by his\u00a0slaying of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church here. Roof looked\u00a0down and shuffled\u00a0papers as U.S. District\u00a0Judge\u00a0Richard\u00a0Gergel read his death sentence. Following the decision, Roof asked Gergel\u00a0to appoint a new defense team in preparation for a motion in which he will ask for a new trial. The judge said he would take that matter up after a formal sentencing hearing, scheduled for Wednesday morning. Roof, who served as his own attorney, had been represented by David Bruck and Kimberly C. Stevens, who continue to serve as his standby counselors. Following the sentencing, the team sent out a brief statement. Is death for Dylann Roof justified? \"We want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof\u2019s actions,\u201d the statement read. \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that\u00a0despite our best efforts\u00a0the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.\" In his brief address to jurors, Roof clarified a confession he made to FBI agents the day after the June 17, 2015, attack, one in which he told them, \u201cI had to do it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do anything, and no one made me do it,\u201d Roof said, his voice carrying no emotion. \u201cWhat I meant is I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.\u201d His five-minute address came in response to a two-hour closing statement from a federal prosecutor who repeatedly urged the jury of 10 women and two men to vote for a death sentence. Roof asked the jurists to consider a life sentence, telling them only one of them needed to vote for life for that sentence to be imposed.\u00a0Gergel later instructed the panel that a hung jury would result in a sentence of life in prison rather than a mistrial. Full statement from Roof lawyers and family. pic.twitter.com/l0ZEKNzQe4 \u2014 Maurice Chammah (@MauriceChammah) January 10, 2017 If the U.S. District Court jury had not decided on the death penalty, Roof would have faced a death-penalty trial in South Carolina's 9th Judicial Circuit Court. Whether he will still go on trial in state court\u00a0is now unclear. Judge J.C. Nicholson on Thursday ordered that trial to be put on hold indefinitely. It was to have begun Jan. 17. In December, Roof was convicted of 33 federal counts in his attack on Emanuel AME Church, which included charges based on hate crime laws. In the sentencing phase, Roof represented himself in a successful bid to keep his team of capital defenders from offering evidence that he might suffer from a mental illness. Had his lawyers been at the helm, they were expected to offer testimony from mental health experts and other witnesses that would have lasted at least a week, much of it likely centering on an undisclosed mental defect. Instead, Roof offered no evidence or witnesses and asked no questions of the government\u2019s witnesses. \u201cHe spent years acquiring this deep hatred. ... He chose to target them knowing they would be particularly good people.\u201d Jay Richardson, U.S. Attorney's Office In his convoluted address to jurors, Roof seemed to contradict his earlier insistence that he is not mentally ill. \u201cI think that it\u2019s safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go to a church and kill people,\u201d the self-avowed\u00a0supremacist said. \u201cAnyone, including the prosecution, who thinks that I\u2019m filled with hatred has no idea what real hate is.\u201d Tuesday's closing arguments began with\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson framing the crime, one that struck at both race and religion, with a subtle Biblical reference. The parishioners gathered at Mother Emanuel that June were a group of 12 who learned from one another and worked together, Richardson told jurors, an allusion to Christ's disciples. \u201cWe heard how after they started the Bible study, they welcomed a 13th\u00a0person that night,\u201d Richardson said of the stranger who concealed a .45-caliber Glock handgun in his utility pouch. In another bit of symbolism, Richardson reminded the panel that Roof carried 88 hollow-point bullets into the church. The letter \u201cH\u201d is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 88 is often used in white supremacist circles as a reference to \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d In jailhouse writings, Roof said the Nazi leader would one day become a saint. Dylann Roof jail writings: 'I've done all I can do' In telling jurists to vote for death, Richardson chronicled the lives of the nine church members killed, from the congregation's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney; to the lost, bright future of Tywanza Sanders, 26; to Susie Jackson, who at age 87 remained dedicated to her church. \u201cHe went to Mother Emanuel to find the best among us, and he did indeed find them,\u201d Richardson said, saying he shot each victim because \"to him they were brute animals,\" part of his racist ideology that looked at African-Americans as subhuman. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do anything, and no one made me do it. What I meant is I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.\u201d Dylann Roof, convicted killer The prosecutor noted that Jackson and two other older victims were particularly vulnerable, urging the panel to use that aggravating factor as a reason to impose a death sentence. The prosecutor outlined eight other aggravating factors, including Roof\u2019s racism, his planning of the murders, his lack of remorse and his attempts to incite others. Those outweighed any mitigating factors such as Roof's age, his lack of a felony conviction or history of violence, he said. In determining Roof's sentence, the jury was to weigh\u00a0any aggravating circumstances against mitigating circumstances. In a capital case, defense lawyers typically offer mental health evidence as a possible mitigator. In Roof\u2019s case those efforts were blocked not only by a client who relegated them to the role of standby counselors, but also by the presiding judge, who twice ruled that Roof was competent to stand trial and serve as his own attorney. The high school dropout rested his case Monday, offering neither witnesses nor evidence in his defense. Convicted killer Dylann Roof: 'I am not sorry.' Jurors began deliberating at 1:35 p.m. ET Tuesday, and about two hours later asked several questions about the mitigating factors presented to them on a verdict form. The gist of two questions went to any danger he might pose in inciting violence should future prison writings be released, and in a third question, the jury asked to see a video of one of Pinckney's speeches. Pinckney\u00a0also was a state senator at the time of his death. Prosecutors presented their sentencing case in about 3\u00bd days\u00a0and questioned\u00a025 witnesses, most of them family members of victims who suffered multiple gunshots in a rampage that came after Roof sat with the parishioners in their Bible study for about 40 minutes. Roof shot Pinckney with a Glock .45 as the worshipers bowed their heads in prayer.\u00a0As others tried to hide beneath folding tables, he moved around the room, firing more than 70 bullets, most finding a human target. U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, in a statement released Tuesday, said \"We hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston \u2013 and the people of our nation \u2013 with a measure of closure.\" \"Dylann Storm Roof sought out and opened fire on African-American parishioners engaged in worship and bible study . . . He did so because of their race.\u00a0 And he did so to interfere with their peaceful exercise of religion,\" Lynch said. For Roof counsel, a life\u2019s work fighting the death penalty During the trial proceedings, Roof\u2019s mother, Amy Roof, appeared at opening statements\u00a0while his grandparents came to the courtroom a handful of times. Following the sentencing decision, Roof\u2019s family sent out a statement. \u201cWe will always love Dylann. We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt. We continue to pray for the Emanuel AME families and the Charleston community.\" Tonya Maxwell reports for the Asheville (N.C.) Citizen-Times;\u00a0Tim Smith reports for The Greenville (S.C.) News.

Sessions of Misrepresenting His Record on Civil Rights 0 Shares Email During today's Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general, Sen. Al Franken , D-Minnesota, accused Sen. Sessions, R-Alabama, of misrepresenting the number of desegregation cases he filed as United States attorney in Alabama. \u201cOur country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their level of involvement on any given issue,\u201d Franken said. In a 2009 interview with the National Review, Sessions said he handled \u201c20 or 30\u201d civil rights cases -- a claim he was not able to prove when pressed by Franken. \u201cTell me, did you file 20 or 30 desegregation cases, or is it some other number?\u201d Franken asked. Sessions conceded that the number of desegregation cases he filed had been distorted, and blamed his memory. \u201cIt is important, first, to be accurate,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThe records don't show that there were 20 or 30 actually filed cases. Some of the cases involve multiple defendants and multiple parties, like to a school board and a county commission being sued for racial discrimination or things of that nature, but the number would be less than that, as we've looked at.\u201d Alex Brandon/AP Photo Sen. Al Franken questions Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions on Capitol Hill in Washington,Jan. 10, 2017, during the committee's confirmation hearing for Sessions. In a questionnaire submitted by Sessions for his Senate confirmation, he answered a prompt about the \u201cten most significant litigated matters you personally handled.\u201d Sessions answered that he personally litigated four civil rights cases during the 1980s, but Franken challenged the level of his actual involvement. In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, three former Department of Justice attorneys, J. Gerald Hebert, Joseph D. Rich, William Yeomans, wrote that Sessions had \u201cno substantive involvement\u201d in any of the desegregation cases referenced by Sessions, an accusation Sessions denied. The three attorneys wrote in their op-ed: \u201cWe worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, which brought those lawsuits; we handled three of the four ourselves. We can state categorically that Sessions had no substantive involvement in any of them. He did what any U.S. attorney would have had to do: He signed his name on the complaint, and we added his name on any motions or briefs. That\u2019s it.\" Franken said that while he\u2019s not a lawyer, he thinks \"filed\" means more than having a name at the top of a case. \u201cWe need to be accurate in what we say,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWhen this issue was raised, I did do a supplemental that said I provided assistance and guidance to civil rights division of attorneys and had an open door policy with them and cooperated with them on these cases. I signed them. I supported cases, and I attempted to be as effective as I could be in helping them be successful in these historic cases. I do feel that they were the kind of cases that were national in scope and deserved to be listed on the form. If I'm in error, I apologize to you. I don't think I was.\u201d 0 Shares ",

The jury, the same that convicted Dylann Roof in the murders last month, announced its verdict after deliberating less than three hours. Dylann Roof speaks in the courtroom in Charleston on Jan. 10. Robert Maniscalco Roof, 22, who represented himself in the penalty phase, did very little to persuade the panel to spare his life. He declined to present any witnesses or evidence, blocked standby defense lawyers' attempts to raise questions about his mental health, and suggested in his closing statement that arguing for life in prison wasn't worth the effort.

But he added, \"This is a very hollow victory because my sister is still gone.\" Graham said he did not argue with the death penalty for Roof. \"He just took them away from us because he wanted to. He decided the day, the hour, the moment, my sister was going to die. And now someone is going to do that for him,\" Graham said. Graham also argued that if Roof had a Muslim sounding name, he would have been called a radicalized terrorist. \"He was radicalized, but not in the way some people think. He radicalized himself to think he had to act on it just like any other terrorist.\" Roof's relatives said in a statement that they would \"always love Dylann\" but would \"struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people.\" His defense lawyers, sidelined for much of the trial, said the sentenced meant that \"this case will not be over for a very long time.\" They also expressed dismay that the trial \"shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.\" Roof now becomes the 63rd person on federal death row, and the first to be put there since Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015. Nevertheless, it will likely be years before he is put to death; the federal government has put executions on hold out of concerns about lethal injection drugs, and appeals could put off the date even further. The last federal execution took place in 2003. And Roof still faces a second trial, by the state of South Carolina, where he also faces the death penalty. The date of that trial has not been determined. From the start of the trial, Roof's guilt was hardly in doubt. It took the 12-person jury a little over two hours to convict Roof last month on all 33 counts, including two dozen that fall under federal hate crime statutes.

In it, Roof admitted he was guilty and that the motive was to spark a race war. He told the FBI men he was surprised he was able to kill as many people as he did with his .45-caliber Glock pistol. Witnesses included two women who survived the shooting, Felicia Sanders and Polly Sheppard, who testified that Roof told her , \"I'm going to leave you here to tell the story.\" Related: Charleston Massacre Survivor Says Suspect Dylann Roof Opened Fire as Victims Stood to Pray For the penalty phase, a judge allowed Roof to represent himself, but only after conducting a competency hearing that remains under seal. Roof told the jury that \"there is nothing wrong with me psychologically,\" and that he chose to mount his own defense to prevent lawyers from presenting mental health evaluations.

The government used photos, video, audio recordings and testimony from loved ones to explore the killings' aftermath. Also key to the government's case was was showing Roof's planning for the June 17, 2015 massacre, in which Roof targeted a group of worshipers who'd invited him to study the Bible with them on a Wednesday night, waiting nearly an hour before opening fire. The government has also stressed Roof's apparent lack of remorse afterward, a contrast with the expressions of forgiveness from some victims' relatives at Roof's first court appearance after the attack. At trial, prosecutors shared with the jury portions of Roof's jailhouse journal, dated six weeks after the killings. \"I do not regret what I did,\" Roof wrote. \"I am not sorry.\" After the verdict, U.S. Sen Tim Scott of South Carolina said the jury had made the right decision, and that it would mark \"a pivotal moment\" in the victims' families' \"road toward some sort of closure.\" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement that \"no verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel. And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof's callous hand. But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston \u2014 and the people of our nation \u2014 with a measure of closure.\" Jon Schuppe ",

    "text": "Jan 10 2017, 6:25 pm ET Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Redrawing of North Carolina Districts by Associated Press advertisement RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling ordering North Carolina legislators to redraw state legislative districts by March 15 and hold special elections within the altered districts this fall. Tuesday's court order granted the request of North Carolina Republican legislative leaders and state officials to delay November's ruling by a three-judge panel. The panel last summer threw out 28 state House and Senate districts as illegal racial gerrymanders. The Supreme Court says its order will stay in place at least until the court decides whether to hear an appeal the state previously requested. If the justices take up the case, the stay will remain in effect pending a decision. If no special elections are required, the next round of General Assembly elections would be held in late 2018. The GOP currently holds majorities large enough to override any vetoes by newly installed Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Special elections could give Democrats a chance to narrow those margins and give leverage to Cooper. Related: \"Why Is North Carolina's Legislature So Extreme? HB2 and the Cost of Gerrymandering\" The voters who sued alleged that Republican lawmakers drew the boundaries to create more predominantly white and Republican districts by effectively cramming black voters into adjacent Democratic districts. GOP lawmakers said the majority-black districts were drawn to protect them against lawsuits alleging they violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act. The state's attorneys filed the request for a delay of the lower court's ruling with the U.S. Supreme Court late last month. They noted that the Supreme Court already had heard oral arguments in lawsuits involving congressional districts in North Carolina and state legislative districts in Virginia, and that its decisions in those cases are pending. The justices' eventual ruling could provide guidance about the use of race in North Carolina's maps, the attorneys said. Requiring the remapping could have affected more than two-thirds of the 170 House and Senate districts, according to GOP leaders, meaning most lawmakers elected to two-year terms in November would actually only serve one year. Republicans at the legislature have been suspicious of other court rulings striking down boundaries that have been upheld in state court. \"We are grateful the U.S. Supreme Court has quashed judicial activism and rejected an attempt to nullify the votes of North Carolinians in the 2016 legislative elections,\" House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger \u2014 two of the defendants in the lawsuit \u2014 said in a release.

    "text": "WATCH Obama 'Skeptical' GOP Will Be Able to Replace 'Obamacare' 0 Shares Email Republicans will work on unraveling and replacing the health care law at the same time, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday as GOP leaders struggled to align their zeal to rapidly erase one of President Barack Obama's proudest achievements with Congress' legislative and political pitfalls. Ryan, R-Wis., spoke to reporters amid growing concern among Republican lawmakers about erasing Obama's overhaul \u2014which expanded coverage to 20 million people \u2014 without having an alternative to show voters. Republicans have been divided for years over how to replace the statute, and the process of crafting replacement legislation they can unify behind is likely to take months or longer. \"It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently,\" Ryan said. \"We will pass as much as we can\" initially, Ryan said. He said Republicans would then produce a second bill to \"show you the full scope of what a real replacement effort looks like.\" President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports erasing Obama's law and replacing it simultaneously. Congressional leaders had said in recent weeks that they would quickly repeal the statute and with a delayed effective date, and then work on replacing it. According to Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., Ryan told Republicans Tuesday that \"he had a conversation yesterday with Donald Trump, and they're on the same page.\" As if on cue, both of Congress' top Republicans used a similar phrase on Tuesday. \"For people across the country, repeal means relief,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. And at a closed-door meeting Tuesday, Ryan told House Republicans, \"Repeal is relief,\" according to Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C. GOP leaders have made dismantling Obama's treasured health care overhaul their premier 2017 priority. But at least six GOP senators and some House members have expressed qualms about repeal without having a substitute. The Senate and House are expected to approve a GOP-written budget this week that will serve a crucial procedural purpose \u2014 blocking Democrats from using a Senate filibuster to derail a future bill dismantling the health care statute. That's important because filibusters take 60 votes to halt in a chamber that Republicans control by only a 52-48 margin. Republicans plan to then write legislation erasing much of the health care law and adding some new elements they prefer, perhaps including expanded use of health savings accounts. But Senate rules limit the provisions that can be put into a bill that's protected against a filibuster. That means Republicans would need a second, subsequent bill to fully rewrite the health care law, and that measure would need at least eight Democratic votes to pass the Senate. Even if Congress passed repeal rapidly, Republicans say they would phase it in, perhaps over two or three years. Republicans don't want to be vulnerable to Democrats already accusing them of preparing to tear down the statute without knowing how or if they'll replace it. \"Turn back before it's too late,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor late Monday as Democrats lambasted Republicans with five-and-a-half hours of speeches. \"It will damage your party, and it will hurt millions of Americans, far more importantly.\" The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, has required people to obtain coverage. It also created subsidies to help lower-earning people buy policies and expanded Medicaid, but the overhaul has been troubled by rising costs for many consumers and markets that some insurers abandoned. The burgeoning Republican divisions come as the GOP-led Senate pushed toward a final vote this week on a budget that would prevent Democrats from using a filibuster to block a later repealing Obama's overhaul. Republicans voicing a desire to work on repeal and replacement together include Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. The budget gives congressional committees until Jan. 27 to produce legislation annulling much of the health care law, although consequences for missing that deadline are minor. Corker, Collins and three other GOP senators introduced a budget amendment delaying that target date until March 3. Corker said that would provide \"additional time to get the policy right.\" Besides health care, senators are focused this week on confirmation hearings for Trump's Cabinet picks. In Tuesday's initial hearings, committees were examining Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's selection for attorney general, and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, his choice for homeland security secretary. Seven others were set for hearings this week. Also Tuesday, a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing explored spy agencies' conclusion that Russia meddled in the U.S. election by hacking and distributing Democratic party emails to help Trump win the White House . \u2014\u2014\u2014 AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story A change in tone on marijuana Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic. He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs, said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol, and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana. He said in 2015 : It\u2019s still a federal offense to deal in marijuana in the United States, and so even though a state doesn\u2019t have that law, the federal government does. They said, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t enforce it, we won\u2019t enforce it.\u2019 Another relaxation of federal law. Flash forward to Tuesday. Mr. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the Justice Department behind drug prosecution in those states. Doing so would set up a huge fight over states\u2019 rights and federal drug policy. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be an easy decision,\u201d he said. No vitriol Senate Democrats do not have the votes, by themselves, to prevent Mr. Sessions from becoming attorney general, and they have spared their colleague any vitriol, doing little to undermine his confirmation. Mr. Sessions was prepared to face renewed questions about race and comments he was accused of making in the 1980s regarding the N.A.A.C.P., the American Civil Liberties Union and \u201cun-American\u201d views. Liberal activists have repeatedly disrupted the hearing, screaming \u201cK.K.K.\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d But the questioning from Democrats has mostly focused on his Senate record and whether he would enforce laws that he disagreed with. He has said he would. Photo Code Pink members protesting before the confirmation hearing for Senator Jeff Sessions. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times In short, there is no indication so far that his confirmation is in jeopardy. No workaround on waterboarding Mr. Sessions, who has supported the use of waterboarding as an interrogation tactic, said that current law makes it \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal.\u201d That\u2019s important because it suggests that Mr. Sessions sees no workaround that would allow Mr. Trump to reinstate such tactics. Mr. Sessions has previously said he supported the Justice Department legal analysis that authorized harsh interrogation in C.I.A. prisons, and has said that waterboarding works. By saying that the law against waterboarding is clear, Mr. Sessions makes it much harder, if not impossible, for Mr. Trump to bring it back. No support for Muslim ban In response to a question about whether he supported a temporary ban on Muslim immigration, as Mr. Trump has suggested, Mr. Sessions said he did not. \u201cI have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious groups should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has since clarified that the restriction should be on immigration from countries that support terrorism. He said religious views \u2014 where, for example, they include justification for violence against Americans \u2014 should be considered as part of the visa progress. Would you support a law that says, \u2018You can\u2019t come to America because you\u2019re a Muslim\u2019? asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Sessions replied. A promise to recuse Mr. Sessions was a top surrogate for Mr. Trump during a campaign in which \u201clock her up!\u201d was a rallying cry against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sessions said that if there were lingering investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server or her family foundation, he would recuse himself. \u201cYou intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email matter and any investigation involving the Clinton foundation, if there are any?\u201d asked Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t punish its political enemies.\u201d Photo Senator Jeff Sessions was sworn in at the start of the hearing. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times A more forceful denial Mr. Sessions last faced the Judiciary Committee three decades ago, for a seat on the federal bench. His nomination failed, in part over allegations that he had described civil rights groups as \u201cun-American\u201d and that he had suggested a white lawyer was a disgrace to his race for representing African-Americans. At the time, he said his comments were misunderstood or taken out of context. He offered a more forceful denial this time: \u201cI never declared that the N.A.A.C.P. was \u2018un-American\u2019 or that a civil rights attorney was a \u2018disgrace to his race,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sessions said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 1986 he described it this way: The N.A.A.C.P. and other civil rights organizations, when they leave the basic discriminatory questions and start getting into matters such as foreign policy and things of that nature and other political issues \u2014 and that is probably something I should not have said, but I really did not mean any harm by it. And here\u2019s how he described the \u201cdisgrace to his race\u201d exchange. Photo Mr. Sessions testified in 1986 that he could not remember saying that a white lawyer might be a disgrace to his race for representing black clients. But he did not contest the allegation, made by a colleague. Offering assurances Mr. Sessions assured his Senate colleagues that he would strictly adhere to the Constitution and stand up to the president if needed. He\u2019s been consistent for years that senators should apply that test to Justice Department nominees. The Republican theme of the hearing is that Mr. Sessions is a known entity, and he reinforced that in his opening remarks. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I believe in.\u201d Mr. Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, has been a consistent voice for conservative policies for nearly two decades in the Senate. Here are some of his positions on the issues. The bottom line Mr. Sessions has been in the Senate for nearly 20 years and is liked by his colleagues. Moderate Republicans and at least one Democrat have said they will vote for him, which all but guarantees his confirmation. And General Kelly is likely to be easily confirmed. That does not mean Democrats will hold their fire, but they are likely to mount their most vigorous offensive against other nominees, including Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican who is Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to be health secretary. \u2018Straight-talking, candid, courageous\u2019 While Mr. Sessions faced some tough questioning, the early going for General Kelly was more gentle. Mr. Gates, a former defense secretary under Mr. Obama and George W. Bush, introduced General Kelly as a \u201cstraight-talking, candid, courageous leader who will say exactly what he thinks.\u201d But what sets him apart, Mr. Gates said, is his character. Photo Retired Gen. John F. Kelly at Trump Tower last week. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times \u201cTo put it quite simply, he is one of the finest people I have ever known,\u201d he said. \u201cI would trust him with my life.\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, asked Mr. Kelly to be ready to take tough questions, but thanked him for providing the disclosures necessary by the Office of Government Ethics, whose review was completed this week.

    "text": "WATCH Trump Announces Son-in-Law Jared Kushner as Senior Adviser 0 Shares Email The legal community is offering differing views about whether President-elect Donald Trump's decision to hire his son-in-law as a senior adviser violates a 50-year-old federal law. Trump's transition team argued there is no legal problem with having Jared Kushner serve in the White House because an anti-nepotism law enacted in 1967 does not apply to the president's staff. Trump is relying on an interpretation of the law itself, backed by a court opinion from 1993, as well as a separate provision of federal law from 1978 that allows the president to appoint White House staff \"without regard to any other provision of law\" dealing with employment. But several law professors and ethicists interviewed Monday by The Associated Press were not so certain. A \"murky legal landscape\" was the description given by Norman Eisen, who served as President Barack Obama's government ethics lawyer. Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said her analysis of the anti-nepotism statute signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson is that is does apply to the White House. \"Congress didn't in this law carve out an exception for the White House. It's quite broad in scope. It applies to the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judicial branch, the D.C. government,\" Clark said. Gerard Magliocca, a professor at the Indiana University McKinney Law school, said he doubted the law could be applied to presidential staff members without running into constitutional problems. \"It's hard to see why Congress has the authority to limit presidential staff members,\" Magliocca said. Kushner lawyer Jamie Gorelick , a former high-ranking Justice Department official in the Clinton administration, cited a 1993 opinion in a case involving Hillary Clinton's work on her husband's health care law . The anti-nepotism law was not directly at issue in the case, but Judge Laurence Silberman, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote then that the law probably does not cover White House staff. Another Reagan appointee, Judge James Buckley, agreed with the outcome in that case, but did not join Silberman's opinion partly because he considered Silberman's argument about the anti-nepotism law \"a weak one.\" 0 Shares ",

He offered no details or evidence on the case. The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement after the debate calling his comments \"dangerous to public health.\" On Tuesday, the AAP's leaders offered \"to share the extensive scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of vaccines\" with the new commission. \"Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature,\" the group said in a statement. \"Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease.\" Autism Speaks, an organization that advocates for individuals with autism, released a statement to NBC News after Trump's meeting with Kennedy, reiterating its conclusion that vaccines were unrelated to the condition. \"Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism,\" the statement said. \"The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism.\" Doctors trace the popular fear to a debunked 1998 study in the British medical journal Lancet that the publication later retracted after discovering its lead author was involved in a lawsuit against drug companies and used flawed methods. Related: Cleveland Clinic Doctor Fuels Vaccine Debate \u2014 Again The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that there is no link between autism and vaccines , citing numerous subsequent studies. An Immunization Safety Commission organized by the Institute of Medicine examined the issue and reached the same conclusion in multiple reports. But the theory persists, aided in part by celebrity advocates. Experts have warned that this small but vocal group of doubters is helping fuel outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough in communities where parents decline to vaccinate their children. Health experts who have worked on vaccination policy and science strongly criticized Kennedy's reported new role in interviews. Marie McCormick, a Harvard professor of maternal and child health who chaired the Immunization Safety Commission, expressed concern that Trump and Kennedy might lend a presidential seal to misinformation. \"If the committee comes out saying there is an [autism] association, there will be people who avoid vaccines,\" McCormick told NBC News. \"There have been actual deaths attributed to lower immunization rates.\" Dr. Peter Hotez, president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute and father of an adult daughter with autism, said he feared the commission could provide new momentum for vaccine skeptics at home and abroad. \"By appointing [Kennedy], it's going to create a new national 'anti-vaxxer' movement,\" he said.
