Chelsea Manning, then-Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, is escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Md., after the third day of his court martial. (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Obama has commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Army private serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified military secrets to Wikileaks, the White House said Tuesday. Manning will be released May 17 after serving nearly seven years for stealing and releasing secret cables that divulged U.S. military and diplomatic operations The soldier, who was convicted under the name of Bradley Manning and now identifies\u00a0herself as a woman, attracted widespread support from privacy advocates and transgender activists who complained that she couldn't get the medical help she needed in the military prison in Leavenworth, Kan. The action brought immediate rebuke from Republicans on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called it \"outrageous\" and said it set \"a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won\u2019t be held accountable for their crimes.\u201d \"I don\u2019t understand why the president would feel special compassion for someone who endangered the lives of our troops, diplomats, intelligence officers, and allies,\" Sen.\u00a0Tom Cotton, R-Ark. \"We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr.\" Obama also granted full pardons in a number of high-profile cases, including: \u25ba Former general James Cartwright, convicted last October of lying to the FBI in a leak investigation. The former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was accused of lying about his role in disclosing classified information about the use of the Stuxnet computer virus to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. \u25ba Baseball Hall of Famer Willie McCovey, convicted of tax evasion in 1996. \u25ba Ian Schrager, co-founder of New York's famed Studio 54 nightclub, convicted of tax fraud in 1980. \u25ba\u00a0Oscar Lopez Rivera, a Puerto Rican nationalist who was the last remaining member of a Puerto Rican terrorist group still in prison. President Bill Clinton commuted the sentences of 16 members of the group for setting off bombs in 1970s and '80s, but Rivera refused the clemency to protest another member who was not released. \u25ba\u00a0Stephen Lee Arrington, convicted in a drug conspiracy that involved carmaker John Z. DeLorean, known for making the car made famous in the Back to the Future trilogy starring Michael J. Fox.\u00a0DeLorean was acquitted, but Arrington pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison. Those names were among the list of 64 pardons and 209 commutations Obama granted Tuesday, with less than four days left in his presidency, bringing his total number of acts of clemency to 212 pardons and 1,385 commutations. Though the Unlike full pardons, which extinguish all the legal consequences of a conviction, a commutation has the more limited effect of shortening a sentence while leaving other consequences intact.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story In myriad ways, Mr. Xi is a strikingly ill-fitting steward of openness and connectivity. Under his direction, China\u2019s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society, tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country\u2019s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people. He has projected China\u2019s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas. Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase \u201ceconomic globalization,\u201d while avoiding unqualified \u201cglobalization,\u201d reflecting China\u2019s spurning of an open internet, universal human rights and free elections. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Indeed, the metaphor he used to reject protectionism \u2014 \u201clike locking oneself in a dark room\u201d \u2014 could just as well have been used to describe China\u2019s political path under his leadership, with the Communist Party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels Western notions such as democracy. This month, China\u2019s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary, which he said must be \u201c resolutely rejected .\u201d Not for nothing, China carries a reputation as a country willing to bend the norms of global commerce when such a course suits its interests. Steel producers around the globe complain that Beijing dumps its steel on world markets at prices lower than the cost of raw materials, costing jobs at mills from Italy to Indiana. But the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible. In the United States, the supposed citadel of free market enterprise, a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the White House on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of blue-collar workers. Here in Davos, where technology executives fret about the plight of sub-Saharan Africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks, the chairman of the Communist Party of China \u2014 an institution that rules in the name of peasant-led revolution \u2014 draped himself in the banner of globalization. None of these details were featured in Mr. Xi\u2019s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite. For Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, the participation of China\u2019s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended. Mr. Schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. He asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience. \u201cIn a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,\u201d Mr. Schwab said. That Mr. Xi chose this year to make his debut underscores China\u2019s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil. The United States is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades, from NATO to the World Trade Organization. Britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the European Union, dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems. Advertisement The growing electoral strength of populist, anti-European Union parties in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany have intensified fears that the union may not endure. Photo Mr. Xi spoke three days before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. His speech implicitly rebuked the trajectory on trade that Mr. Trump has promised. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times These developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision. Mr. Xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum, casting China as a trustworthy power in which serious-minded people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges \u2014 from climate change to a weak global economy. \u201cThis appears to be a time of uncertainty in the United States, in the U.K.,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing who invests in emerging Chinese companies. \u201cThe world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence.\u201d In keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior Chinese officials, Mr. Xi\u2019s address was long on platitudes, tortured metaphors and literary references, while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements.

Around 7 p.m. Tuesday, authorities located Loyd in an abandoned home, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said during a press conference. Police surrounded the home, but Loyd tried to escape through the back of the home before the SWAT teams arrived, Mina said. Loyd then ran back inside the home and left again through the front door, wearing body armor and carrying two handguns, including a Glock that contained a magazine with the capacity for 100 rounds of ammunition, Mina said. Loyd threw the guns to the ground and resisted arrest when police officers tried to detain him. He suffered minor injuries in the scuffle and was treated by firefighters, Mina said. Markeith Loyd was wearing body armor when he was apprehended. And had these guns in his possession. pic.twitter.com/T0AfzZibmA \u2014 Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 18, 2017 On Dec. 9, Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton was on duty by herself near a Walmart around 7 a.m. when a citizen approached her, telling her that a murder suspect was nearby, according to police. Clayton found Loyd and chased him, police said. He allegedly opened fire after Clayton told him to stop running. He was already wanted before he shot and killed Clayton for allegedly killing a pregnant woman. Clayton, a wife and mother, was shot multiple times, police said. She was wearing body armor at the time, but she later died. A funeral for the slain officer was held over the weekend. Loyd was placed in Clayton's handcuffs when he was caught, as part of a \"tradition\" in law enforcement that goes back \"many, many years,\" Mina said. These are Lt. Debra Clayton's handcuffs. Markeith Loyd was placed in these when he was arrested. pic.twitter.com/3TKs9nw2lu \u2014 Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 18, 2017 He will be charged with several offenses, including multiple counts of homicide for the deaths of Clayton and Sade Dixon and her unborn child, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, who described Loyd as a \"maniac.\" Loyd will also be charged with attempted murder for shooting Dixon's brother, who was gravely injured, as well as two counts of aggravated assault for pointing the gun at Dixon's mother and another individual, Demings said. The Orange County Sheriff's Office will serve an arrest warrant tonight, Demings said. Great police work got this cop killer and the killer of Sade Dixon and her unborn child off the street. pic.twitter.com/MkAdoHwZmM ",

    "text": "Jan 17 2017, 4:59 pm ET Trump Enters Office With Historically Low Approval Rating by Mark Murray advertisement Donald Trump starts his presidency Friday with the lowest-ever ratings for an incoming president, but also with some signs of increasing optimism for the country, according to results from a brand-new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. A majority of Americans \u2014 52 percent \u2014 say they disapprove of the way President-elect Trump has handled his transition and preparations for the presidency, versus just 44 percent who approve, which is down six points from only a month ago. To put Trump's numbers into perspective, Barack Obama's approval rating was 71 percent before he took the oath of office in January 2009, and Bill Clinton's was 77 percent in December 1992. (The NBC/WSJ poll didn't measure George W. Bush during his transition; his first job-approval rating, in March 2001, was 57 percent.) In addition, just 38 percent of Americans have a positive view of Trump, while 48 percent have a negative one \u2014 making him the most unpopular incoming president in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. And just three-in-10 Americans have a high level of confidence that Trump has the right set of goals and priorities, as well as right set of personal characteristics, to be president. \"We find a nation that is seemingly as divided today as it was during the 2016 campaign with little change for a positive lift,\" says Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies. \"A majority of the American public starts the Donald Trump presidency in opposition,\" Yang adds. Despite that opposition, however, a plurality of Americans \u2014 43 percent \u2014 believe the United States will be better off five years from now, and the percentage of respondents who say the country is headed in the right direction has ticked up four points since last month to 37 percent. Still, 52 percent of Americans think that the nation is on the wrong track, though that's down from the 60 percent-plus who said that during the 2016 general election. Public backs many of Trump's individual policy goals What's more, the public supports many of Trump's individual policy goals - even if they don't support him personally: \"Americans believe that Obama fell short in standing up to big business, special interests, and changing business as usual in Washington. These are areas where Americans believe Trump could make a positive difference,\" says McInturff, the GOP pollster. \"Trump's ability to deliver on his promise of change and to strengthen the economy for working Americans are two potential pillars of a successful presidency,\" he adds. But the public doesn't support other policy Trump goals. Just 34 percent think cutting business taxes is a priority this year; only 30 percent believe it's an immediate priority to deport undocumented immigrants; just 21 percent say it's a priority to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border; and only 16 percent say it's a priority to pass legislation providing additional restrictions on abortion. Trump's highest marks? Decisiveness. His lowest? Temperament The NBC/WSJ poll also finds that Trump gets the highest marks on being firm and decisive (a combined 54 percent give him either a \"4\" or \"5\" here on a five-point scale), on being direct and straightforward in his communications (48 percent), on dealing with the economy (46 percent) and on changing business as usual in Washington (45 percent). Trump received his worse marks for understanding average people (30 percent), uniting the country (27 percent), being easygoing and likable (27 percent), having high personal and ethical standards (26 percent) and having the right temperament (21 percent). Obama's \"second honeymoon\" as he leaves office While Trump is entering office with the worst numbers in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll, outgoing President Barack Obama is exiting with some of his highest numbers. Fifty-six percent of Americans approve of Obama's job, which is his highest rating since the first few months of his presidency. Moreover, 53 percent of Americans believe the country is better off than it was eight years ago, while 42 percent think it's worse off. A similar 54 percent say Obama mostly brought the right kind of change. And a combined 55 percent believe Obama - compared with the past several U.S. presidents - will either go down as one of the very best or be better than most. That's compared with 20 percent who said the same of George W. Bush, 56 percent who said that about Bill Clinton, 55 percent who said that about George H.W. Bush, and 55 percent who said that about Ronald Reagan. \"If Donald Trump enters office on a down note, the current occupant is enjoying a second honeymoon of sorts,\" says Yang, the Democratic pollster. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Jan. 12-15 of 1,000 adults - including nearly 500 reached via cell phone - and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. President-elect Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize national polls that have found his approval rating to be near 40 percent as \"rigged\" and \"phony,\" saying: \"The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls.\" Yet while the national polls weren't that far off - Hillary Clinton beat Trump by two points in the popular vote, 48 percent to 46 percent - this NBC/WSJ poll and other post-election surveys don't depend on pollsters' assumptions about which voters will come to the polls. Instead, they are measuring current public opinion among all Americans, not just voters or likely voters. Mark Murray ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story He has emerged as a potentially decisive vote on perhaps President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s most consequential nominee, teeing up an early, public test of how adversarial he is willing to be toward a fellow Republican in the White House \u2014 albeit one who long demeaned him as \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d For Mr. Rubio, a gifted politician chastened by a failed White House run, the choice mirrors the broader question facing Republicans on Capitol Hill: Is the price of defying Mr. Trump \u2014 who can sink fortunes 140 Twitter characters at a time \u2014 worth paying to serve as a critical check on his expansive powers? \u201cOn most major issues you are never going to make everyone happy,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in an email Monday evening, when asked how the experience of running for president had affected his view of this job. \u201cSo you might as well do what you truly feel is right and let the political chips fall where they may.\u201d Dissent does offer its share of advantages. Mr. Rubio has edged back into the political foreground for the first time since ending his own presidential bid, then reversing a pledge not to run for re-election to his Florida seat. (\u201cI have only said like 10000 times I will be a private citizen in January,\u201d Mr. Rubio wrote on Twitter in mid-May, about five weeks before announcing his change of heart.) As has happened occasionally in his years on the national stage, Mr. Rubio has appeared willing to rankle elements of his own party for at least a moment, endearing himself briefly to left-leaning skeptics who have generally found themselves disappointed. \u201cFlorida Man Actually Does His Job,\u201d read a Twitter post from the popular @_FloridaMan account, which tracks the misadventures of Sunshine State denizens. \u201cGood for Little Marco,\u201d Joy Behar, a liberal co-host of \u201cThe View,\u201d told viewers last week, after Mr. Rubio\u2019s aggressive questioning spawned a rare morning-show meditation on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Putin, a war criminal. A protesters shouting, \u201cSenators be brave!\u201d was led from the chamber. By REUTERS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb By the end of the segment, Ms. Behar appended a warning. \u201cWatch Marco Rubio vote for Tillerson,\u201d she said. \u201cJust watch.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Among some members of both parties on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Rubio\u2019s convictions on party-bucking issues have at times been called into question, this is still viewed as a possibility. Memories of Mr. Rubio\u2019s ill-fated push for immigration reform in 2013 remain fresh. So, too, do his halting attempts to distance himself from the legislation during last year\u2019s Republican primaries. Then there is Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Rubio once called a dangerous \u201ccon man\u201d with \u201cthe worst spray tan in America,\u201d going so far as to sell \u201c#NeverTrump\u201d bumper stickers on his campaign website. Weeks later, Mr. Rubio said he would support Mr. Trump if he won the nomination. At that point, he planned to set off on a lucrative private sector career. \u201cHe made a decision that probably cost him a seven-figure income,\u201d Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said of Mr. Rubio\u2019s re-election. \u201cHe\u2019s come back with a freshness and an enthusiasm and a real strong desire to make a difference.\u201d Mr. Rubio and his allies have said that the decision to return stemmed in no small part from a desire to act as a foreign policy check on either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. At the same time, Mr. Rubio said via email, he is excited to work with a Republican administration \u201crather than being on defense spending most of our time fighting to prevent bad policy\u201d under President Obama. Aides noted that Mr. Rubio had come out in favor of several other Trump nominees, playing down any lingering tensions from the campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But as Mr. Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hangs in the balance, Mr. Rubio is still the likeliest Republican defection on the committee, which includes 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, potentially imperiling Mr. Tillerson\u2019s chances. It is also possible for Mr. Tillerson\u2019s nomination to be considered by the full Senate without an affirmative recommendation from the committee. At least a few colleagues are watching closely. \u201cI certainly weigh heavily Rubio\u2019s perspective on foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Scott said, when asked if Mr. Rubio\u2019s questioning had made him think differently about Mr. Tillerson.

Civil liberties groups have praised President Obama's decision to commute the sentence, but some Republican leaders are outraged. AP hide caption toggle caption AP Chelsea Manning had been sentenced to 35 years for leaking military secrets to WikiLeaks. Civil liberties groups have praised President Obama's decision to commute the sentence, but some Republican leaders are outraged. AP In one of his last moves in office, President Obama has commuted the 35-year prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Army private who leaked a massive trove of military secrets to WikiLeaks. The former intelligence analyst's prison sentence has been shortened to expire on May 17, 2017, according to a statement from the White House. This commutation was issued along with 208 others, including one for Oscar Lopez-Rivera, who was part of a militant group that fought for Puerto Rican independence. Obama also pardoned 64 individuals, including retired Gen. James Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to federal authorities. Manning, a transgender woman formerly known as Bradley, had requested clemency from Obama and said her life was at risk in an all-male prison, as we reported . She has admitted to \"releasing more than 700,000 documents, including battlefield reports and U.S. embassy cables.\" Her lawyers at the ACLU expressed relief after the decision, saying that Manning has already served more time behind bars than any other whistleblower in U.S. history, and under difficult conditions. Article continues after sponsorship \"Since she was first taken into custody, Chelsea has been subjected to long stretches of solitary confinement \u2014 including for attempting suicide \u2014 and has been denied access to medically necessary health care,\" said lawyer Chase Strangio in a statement. \"This move could quite literally save Chelsea's life, and we are all better off knowing that Chelsea Manning will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many.\" Amnesty International USA's executive director, Margaret Huang, argued in a statement that the move was long overdue: \"Chelsea Manning exposed serious abuses, and as a result her own human rights have been violated by the U.S. government for years. ... President Obama was right to commute her sentence, but it is long overdue. It is unconscionable that she languished in prison for years while those allegedly implicated by the information she revealed still haven't been brought to justice.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement protesting the commutation: \"This is just outrageous. Chelsea Manning's treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets. President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won't be held accountable for their crimes.\" Sen. John McCain called the commutation a \"grave mistake\" that may \"encourage further acts of espionage and undermine military discipline.\" He added: \"Thousands of Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq upholding their oaths and defending this nation. Chelsea Manning broke her oath and made it more likely that others would join the ranks of her fallen comrades. Her prison sentence may end in a few months' time, but her dishonor will last forever.\" It's worth noting one name that did not appear on the list today: Edward Snowden. As NPR's Carrie Johnson has reported , the NSA leaker, who is living in Russia, has also mounted \"a last-ditch bid for clemency.\" Cartwright \"had been charged with falsely telling FBI investigators that he did not provide classified information for a book written by New York Times reporter David Sanger,\" The Two-Way has reported . Correction Jan. 17, 2017 A previous version of this story said Gen. James Cartwright leaked information. He pleaded guilty to misleading investigators who were working on a leaks case. ",

There are now more than 50 House Democrats - 52, at last count - who have declared that they will not attend the inauguration on Capitol Hill this week.

It would also have eliminated spending for the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies that help lower-income people buy private insurance. But the bill preserved requirements for insurers to provide coverage, at standard rates, to any applicant, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions. \u201cEliminating the mandate penalties and the subsidies while retaining the market reforms would destabilize the nongroup market, and the effect would worsen over time,\u201d the budget office said. The office said the estimated increase of 32 million people without coverage in 2026 resulted from three changes: about 23 million fewer people would have coverage in the individual insurance market, roughly 19 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage, and there would be an increase in the number of people with employment-based insurance that would partially offset those losses. The estimates by the budget office are generally consistent with projections by the Obama administration and by insurance companies. In its report, the budget office said that repealing selected parts of the health care law \u2014 as specified in the earlier Republican bill \u2014 would have adverse effect on insurance markets. In the first full year after enactment of such a bill, it said, premiums would be 20 to 25 percent higher than under current law.

    "text": "Nigerian Air Force Bombs Refugee Camp, More Than 100 Dead By haruna umar and bashir adigun, associated press MAIDUGURI, Nigeria \u0097 Jan 17, 2017, 4:31 PM ET 0 Shares Email A Nigerian air force fighter jet on a mission against Boko Haram extremists mistakenly bombed a refugee camp on Tuesday, killing more than 100 refugees and aid workers and wounding 200, a government official and doctors said. Military commander Maj. Gen. Lucky Irabor confirmed an accidental bombardment in the northeastern town of Rann, near the border with Cameroon, saying \"some\" civilians were killed. It was believed to be the first time Nigeria's military has acknowledged making such a mistake in a region where villagers have in the past reported civilian casualties in the near-daily bombings targeting the Islamic militants. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari expressed deep sadness and regret at \"this regrettable operational mistake.\" A Borno state government official, who was helping to coordinate the evacuation of wounded from the remote area by helicopters, said more than 100 refugees and aid workers were among the dead. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. Doctors Without Borders said its team based in Rann counted at least 52 bodies and was treating 200 wounded, many in critical condition, and the death toll was expected to rise. \"This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,\" said Dr. Jean-Cl?ment Cabrol, the aid group's director of operations. As night fell, the group's team struggled to stabilize the seriously wounded. \"We hope that during the night not many more people will die,\" said the group's head of emergency programs, Hugues Robert, describing a complex evacuation because the area is insecure. Photographs of the carnage showed a man carrying a wounded child, his clothing stained with blood, as well as bloodied victims being treated on the ground outside a tent clinic overflowing with the wounded. Nearby, corpses lay covered by blankets and prayer mats, alongside mounds of hastily dug graves. After the attack, the charred remains of makeshift corrugated iron lean-tos and mud homes filled the landscape. The International Committee for the Red Cross said six workers with the Nigerian Red Cross were among the dead and 13 were wounded. \"They were part of a team that had brought in desperately needed food for over 25,000 displaced persons,\" spokesman Jason Straziuso said in a statement from Nairobi, Kenya. Two soldiers were also wounded, as well as Nigerians working for Doctors Without Borders, Irabor said, without giving a precise figure. The general, who is the theater commander for counterinsurgency operations in northeast Nigeria, said he ordered the mission based on information that Boko Haram insurgents were gathering in the area, along with geographic coordinates. It was too early to say if a tactical error was made, he said, adding that the bombing would be investigated. Doctors Without Borders spokesman Etienne l'Hermitte in Geneva urged authorities to facilitate cross-border land and air evacuations. \"Our medical and surgical teams in Cameroon and Chad are ready to treat wounded patients. We are in close contact with our teams, who are in shock following the event,\" he said in a statement. Villagers have previously reported civilian casualties in airstrikes on Boko Haram positions in northeastern Nigeria. Some of the schoolgirls kidnapped by the insurgents in 2014 and freed last year have said three of their classmates were killed by air force bombardments, according to the freed girls' parents. Of the nearly 300 schoolgirls who were abducted, 196 remain missing. The bombings have helped drive Boko Haram out of many towns and villages and, according to Buhari, the insurgents' last stronghold in the Sambisa Forest last month. Boko Haram's 7-year-old Islamic uprising has killed more than 20,000 people and forced 2.6 million from their homes, creating the continent's worst humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations warning some 5.1 million people face starvation. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Adigun reported from Abuja, Nigeria. AP writers Ismail Alfa Abdulrahim in Maiduguri and Michelle Faul in Johannesburg contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Attorney Gloria Allred, left, accompanies her client Summer Zervos at a news conference announcing Zervos' lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump. (Valerie Macon / AFP/Getty Images) Hailey Branson-Potts Contact Reporter A former contestant on TV's \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on Tuesday filed a defamation lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump , whom she has accused of making unwanted sexual advances toward her. Summer Zervos announced the lawsuit at\u00a0a downtown Los Angeles news conference with her attorney, Gloria Allred, three days before Trump's inauguration. Zervos, who appeared on the fifth season of the reality show, said Trump had tried to seduce her at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007, kissing her on the mouth without her consent and pressing himself against her. She tearfully described darting around a hotel room to avoid physical contact with Trump,\u00a0even as she sought employment from him. Zervos said in October that she felt compelled\u00a0to go public with the accusations after seeing recordings on the set of \"Access Hollywood\" that had been released days earlier, in which Trump made crude comments about grabbing women by the genitals.\u00a0 \"For the first time, Summer Zervos saw Trump's behavior towards her for what it was: a sexual predator who had preyed on her and other women,\" the suit says. On Tuesday, Allred said her client had voluntarily taken a lie detector test regarding the allegations and had passed. The suit was filed in New York. Trump responded by denying Zervos\u2019 allegations and saying he \u201cvaguely\u201d recalled her from the reality-television show he hosted for more than a decade. \"To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life,\u201d Trump said in a statement. ",

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker By Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker January 17 at 6:44 PM Follow @ashleyrparker Follow @PhilipRucker Exactly one week after becoming president-elect, Donald Trump stepped outside his namesake fortress here for the first time. He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21\u00a0Club \u2014 a dark-mahogany-and-red-leather-banquette throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, which Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon also used) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries). So it has been for the president-elect, who has retreated to one comfortable, familiar refuge after another \u2014 his soaring Manhattan tower, his white leather-upholstered Boeing jet, his lush golf courses, his opulent beachside castle. Trump is a man isolated, increasingly cocooned away from the voters who lifted him to his seemingly improbable victory. He favors his own people and his own places, creating the veneer of accessibility \u2014 his tweets reach millions and he still answers his cellphone \u2014 while placing himself in almost entirely habitual settings. He spends most of his days in Trump Tower, with few close friends and few meaningful one-on-one interactions beyond the family members, advisers and loyalists who are whisked by gold-colored elevator to his 26th-floor office for private audiences. Trump rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air; nor does he encounter many people he does not already know or who do not work for him. 1 of 81 Inside Trump Tower: The epicenter of a presidential transition View Photos In Manhattan, the setting for Donald Trump\u2019s reality-TV show and campaign headquarters now serves as the president-elect\u2019s base of operations. Caption In Manhattan, the setting for Donald Trump\u2019s reality-TV show and campaign headquarters now serves as the president-elect\u2019s base of operations. \u00a0Jan. 16, 2017 Martin Luther King III, son of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., exits an elevator at Trump Tower in New York with President-elect Donald Trump. Mark Abramson/for The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Yet Trump remains omnipresent in American life, constantly communicating with the public via Twitter and media interviews without the varnish of news releases or the protection of handlers. Whether it is Meryl Streep\u2019s remarks about him or the question of Russian hacking, no topic is too mundane or charged for him to lend his voice to it. And he answers his personal cellphone, something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. As he prepares to enter the White House, Trump is resisting his advisers\u2019 efforts to take away his cellphone or at least restrict his use of it, said one person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private conversations. They worry about national security; he worries about losing touch. When Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) needs to reach Trump, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman does not have to go through an aide or schedule a meeting. He said he simply dials Trump\u2019s cellphone directly, and the president-elect answers, even though Corker\u2019s number registers as \u201cNo Caller ID.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything relative to access like this. Unbelievable,\u201d Corker told reporters recently. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s likely been a White House like this, maybe ever, but certainly in modern history.\u201d [ How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans ] In many ways, Trump seems most comfortable communicating at a slight remove, with a stage or a screen \u2014 television, Twitter, phone \u2014 serving as the intermediary between him and the public. Such tools are both his megaphone and his shield, allowing him to blast out a message undiluted with little risk. \u201cHe sees the power of mass communication, which goes through screens, and he recognizes its importance,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of the website Newsmax Media. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly studied the art of it and developed an online and TV persona that\u2019s very powerful. If you look, he\u2019s very much impressed by people who are on TV or come across well on TV, because he thinks it\u2019s such critical marketing.\u201d (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post) Trump has shunned some of the traditional photo ops that his predecessors have orchestrated to demonstrate compassion and forge a connection with everyday Americans. He spent Veterans Day in November not laying a wreath at a memorial site, as President-elect Barack Obama did in 2008 to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but staying inside Trump Tower (even though New York\u2019s historic parade was marching right outside along Fifth Avenue). On Thanksgiving and Christmas, he celebrated in private with family members and friends, making no public appearances at military bases or homeless shelters or soup kitchens. \u201cA lot of what you see by previous presidents are platitudes: \u2018I\u2019m going to go and pretend I\u2019m supportive of a particular entity and serve food at a soup kitchen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager of Trump\u2019s. \u201cDonald Trump wants to bring jobs back so we don\u2019t have soup kitchens. He has not been a person to do staged events for the sake of doing staged events.\u201d Trump\u2019s duality \u2014 his wariness of those not in his trusted orbit, yet his insatiable desire for constant contact and feedback \u2014 has posed challenges for his advisers and could ultimately leave him detached from everyday voters. He does not use email and rarely surfs the Internet, meaning that telephone calls, television appearances or physical proximity are the best ways to reach him. As his three successive campaign managers quickly learned, whoever controls the flow of information to Trump controls the man \u2014 at least as much as he can be contained. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, said he expects the new president\u2019s relationship with Congress to be a mix of salesmanship and accessibility. \u201cTrump will be a larger figure who\u2019s more aloof and more distant, but whose weight and effectiveness is so great he will clearly be a dominating figure,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cHe\u2019ll bounce back and forth between the two worlds. When he comes into the congressional world, he\u2019ll be very effective on the personal level.\u201d But, Gingrich added, \u201cOn another level he\u2019ll be very distant and you\u2019ll see him by tweet and you\u2019ll see him on \u2018Fox and Friends.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Trump\u2019s distance, friends say, stems in part from a certain insularity, with the developer turned politician preferring his own properties, stocked with his own people. Ruddy, who is a member of the private Mar-a-Lago club and whose Newsmax is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., said he has lived in the area for two decades, yet he can count on one hand the number of times he has seen Trump outside of his private Florida retreats. \u201cHe\u2019s an old-shoe type of guy \u2014 he likes to be in his comfort zone, which are his golf clubs and his homes,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cHe likes people he\u2019s comfortable with and likes, and if he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around you, he\u2019s not going to be inviting you around.\u201d Trump has gone out to eat only a few times since the election \u2014 twice to the 21 Club and once to Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president-elect dined on frog legs and prime sirloin with adversary-turned-job-applicant Mitt Romney. [ The nearly invisible president-elect: Trump\u2019s work keeps him mostly out of view ] For Trump, like President Obama, the links \u2014 whether at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his beloved Mar-a-Lago \u2014 are personal sanctuaries. In either place, he is most at ease. He wears boxy \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps and open-collar shirts, unwinding with friends over rounds in the morning and then retreating to the clubhouses for casual lunches. \u201cHe\u2019s always playing golf courses that bear his name,\u201d sportswriter Michael Bamberger said. \u201cThe golf cart has his name on it. The water bottle has his name on it. If the course is crowded, groups will move to the side for him. . . . When he gets to the dining room, the waitress is right there. Membership has its privileges, but ownership has a lot more privileges.\u201d Bamberger, who has closely studied Trump\u2019s golf habits for years, said the president-elect is deeply knowledgeable about the sport and plays it well. And he uses his time at the golf course to forge bonds and size people up. \u201cHe\u2019s a very social creature, a gregarious creature, and golf gives him an opportunity to do that,\u201d he said. One of Trump\u2019s preferred methods of charming, however, is the telephone, which he uses to receive advice and pepper his callers with questions well into the night. Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Trump, likened him to a mix of former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (with his ability to woo and cajole) and Nixon (with his late-night tendencies). \u201cHe is like LBJ,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe loves the telephone. He loves calling people. He really does have a very good manner with people. He can be very likable on the phone.\u201d As Trump hurries to solidify his Cabinet, he has been known to call his nominees unprompted just to check in, asking which senators he ought to lobby to help them win confirmation. \u201cWho do you need me to call? Who do I need to call?\u201d Trump asked one nominee, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, cited his prospective boss\u2019s almost constant availability during his Senate confirmation hearing when asked how he would handle an impromptu Trump tweet that undermines his own diplomatic efforts. \u201cI have his cellphone number,\u201d the former ExxonMobil chief said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s promised me he\u2019ll answer.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d added Tillerson, \u201che does.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Kelsey Snell By Kelsey Snell January 17 at 2:20 PM Follow @kelsey_snell As Republicans in Congress gear up to repeal the Affordable Care Act, two Pennsylvanians reflect on their different experiences under Obamacare. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) At least\u00a018 million people would lose health insurance in the first year if Republicans move ahead with plans to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan, estimates a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . The number of people without insurance would grow to about 32 million within the first decade if congressional Republicans follow a 2015 plan to repeal the health-care law without an alternative, the new report says. It also estimates that health insurance premiums for people buying individual non-group coverage would double within a decade, further complicating GOP promises that people will not lose coverage under their plan. The report comes as Republican leaders in Washington are working furiously to tamp down concerns within their ranks that a speedy push to repeal major portions of the law known as Obamacare could create chaos in the insurance markets and provoke a backlash from voters. Over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump promised in an interview with The Washington Post that he was nearing completion of a plan to provide \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d Trump did not provide any details of what that plan would include, but his timeline and promises of coverage for everyone clash starkly with the CBO report estimating that millions of people would lose coverage. The report increases the pressure on Republicans to come up with a replacement plan that fills in the gaps for Americans covered by the ACA while adhering to GOP\u00a0principles. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the outgoing secretary for health and human services, told reporters that the CBO report showed the importance of having a replacement health-care plan ready when the ACA is repealed. But as of now, \u201cwe really\u00a0 haven\u2019t seen a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cAn outline is not a plan. A framework is not a plan.\u201d Repealing the law without a replacement in place would send the marketplaces into a \u201cnegative\u201d spiral of falling enrollment and soaring premiums, Burwell\u00a0said. But she added that she is \u201can optimist\u201d and believes that Republicans will adjust their plans when faced with the realities. She added that she believes consumers, doctors, patients and insurers will increasingly be \u201cthe voices of reality\u201d as the debate over health care continues. Looking back on how the Obama administration handled the ACA, she said, it\u2019s clear that officials underestimated the time it would take for consumers and insurers to adjust to a new system for the individual market. \u201cWe thought it would be faster,\u201d Burwell said. [ Trump vows \u2018insurance for everybody\u2019 in Obamacare replacement plan ] The report, which is an update of a previous analysis of the 2015 repeal legislation, sparked bickering among lawmakers Tuesday. Republicans dismissed it, arguing that the forthcoming GOP repeal plan will also include some elements of replacement. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), one of four committee chairman who will help draft the repeal and replacement measures, said the report was one-sided. \u201cToday\u2019s report shows only part of the equation \u2014 a repeal of Obamacare without any transitional policies or reforms to address costs and empower patients,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cRepublicans support repealing Obamacare and implementing step-by-step reforms so that Americans have access to affordable health care.\u201d AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said, \u201cThis projection is meaningless, as it takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by Obamacare.\u201d Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), requested the report to provide an updated\u00a0estimate of the effect of\u00a0a 2015\u00a0repeal measure\u00a0that ended in a veto from President Obama. Republican leaders have said that bill was a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for efforts in 2017. \u201cNonpartisan statistics don\u2019t lie: it\u2019s crystal clear that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act will increase health care costs for millions of Americans and kick millions more off of their health insurance,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. But Republicans insist that they are working on a replacement plan. House Majority\u00a0Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), the third-ranking Republican in the House, responded Tuesday by dismissing the report on Twitter. CBO misses the point. Obamacare will be replaced with lower costs and more choices. \u2014 Rep. Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 17, 2017 The CBO report assumes no Obamacare replacement. In reality, we will provide people with coverage that they want and can actually use. \u2014 Rep. Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 17, 2017 Congress took its first step toward repealing Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul\u00a0Friday when the House voted along party lines to pass a budget measure that paves the way for a repeal vote in the coming months.\u00a0Committees in the House and Senate are set to begin writing legislation that will roll back major elements of the law, including\u00a0penalties for those who don\u2019t get insurance and credits that help people buy insurance on the private market. Republicans are now facing the far more difficult task of assembling a viable replacement for a law that has expanded health insurance coverage to about 20 million Americans and eliminated unpopular insurance-industry practices, such as lifetime coverage caps and widespread refusal to cover already-sick individuals. The Senate is set to begin confirmation hearings Wednesday for Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.). If confirmed, Price is poised to be one of the key architects of Republican health policy in the Trump era. Price is among the only lawmakers to have crafted an alternative to the Affordable Care Act. The former House Budget Committee chairman proposed making deep cuts to Medicaid and creating a voucherlike system for older Americans who use\u00a0Medicare as their primary insurance. His plan would also end\u00a0subsidies for people to buy private insurance, in favor of tax breaks to encourage investments in private health savings accounts. Many voters like the benefits of the ACA, but the public is split over whether the health-care law was a good idea overall. A Washington Post-ABC poll conducted from Jan. 12 to 15 found that 46 percent of respondents supported repealing the ACA, while 47 percent opposed repeal. Voters are less excited about repealing the law without a replacement. Thirteen percent supported repeal and said it\u00a0should be done before a replacement is created \u2014 compared with\u00a031 percent who said the law should be repealed simultaneously with a replacement. Mike DeBonis and Laurie McGinley contributed to this report.\u00a0 Correction: A previous version of this story referred to Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) as Minority Whip. He is House Majority Whip.\u00a0 powerpost ",

    "text": "Trump's Education Secretary Pick Betsy DeVos Grilled on Public Education By Jordyn Phelps Jan 17, 2017, 6:18 PM ET 0 Shares Star Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos arrives before testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Jan. 17, 2017, at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump 's pick for Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, was grilled by Democratic senators in a Tuesday evening hearing on her views on public education and her background as a wealthy Republican donor. Ranking Democrat Sen. Patty Murray asked DeVos if she would commit to not allowing funding that's designated for public schools to flow to private options -- one of the leading concerns of DeVos' critics -- and DeVos did not offer a direct assurance. DeVos instead responded by saying she would commit to addressing the needs of \"all parents and students\" and noted that \"not all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them.\" \"I take that is not being willing to commit to not privatize public schools?\" Murray followed up. \"I guess I would not characterize it in that way,\" DeVos said. DeVos has supported vouchers and charter schools over several decades of advocacy on education reform in her home state of Michigan. While DeVos' admirers revere her as an effective disrupter who has put her own money into supporting school choice policies, her critics tie her to the checkered track record of Michigan's charter schools and see her advocacy for vouchers as a threat to public education. Some of the greatest displays of tension in the hearing were not between DeVos and the senators asking the questions but rather among the committee members themselves. Democrats repeatedly complained about Chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander limiting each senator to 5-minutes of questioning, with Democrats accusing the chairman of rushing the confirmation hearing. Sen. Al Franken grew agitated in his line of questioning of DeVos, at one point interrupting her when she appeared to not fully understand his question asking about where she fell on the debate between whether proficiency or growth is a better measure of student achievement. \"It surprises me that you don't know this issue. And Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good reason for us to have more questions,\" Franken said. At another point, he asked her whether she believes in conversion therapy, citing cases in her family's history of supporting groups that have promoted the use of such therapy for gay or lesbian individuals. \"I have never believed in that,\" DeVos said. Asked again about the issue, DeVos said that she \"embrace[s] equality\" and suggested that the senators might be referring to donations other members of her family may have made in the distant past that do not represent her views. In her opening remarks, DeVos affirmed her belief in increasing school choice in the nation's educational systems while pledging to be \"a strong advocate for great public schools.\" \"If confirmed, I will be a strong advocate for great public schools. But, if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child \u2013 perhaps they have a special need that is going unmet -- we should support a parent\u2019s right to enroll their child in a high quality alternative,\" DeVos said. Democrats had sought to delay today's hearing until the Office of Government Ethics completes its full ethics review of the wealthy nominee, a sentiment that ranking Democrat Sen. Patty Murray made known in her opening remarks. \"I am extremely disappointed that we are moving forward with this hearing before receiving the proper paperwork from the Office of Government Ethics,\" Murray said. \"When President Obama entered the White House, Republicans insisted on having an ethics letter in hand before moving to a hearing. In fact, Leader McConnell wrote a letter to Leader Reid making that explicit demand\u2014an ethics letter in hand, with time to review\u2014and an FBI background check\u2014before a hearing was held. So I am extremely concerned. And I can only hope that cutting corners and rushing nominees through will not be the new norm.\" The chairman of the committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander , sought to assure the committee that senators will have several days to review the OGE review of DeVos prior to a vote on her confirmation. DeVos also told the committee that she is committed to making sure \"an ethics agreement resolved and reached\" in the process of her confirmation and resolve any conflicts of interest that her financial holdings as a private citizen pose. She also said she plans to limit her government salary to 1 dollar \"to be official\" but that she doesn't \"want to take a salary.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "<p>U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke (R-MT), a former Navy SEAL commander, testifies before a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination to be Interior Secretary at Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 17, 2017.&nbsp;</p> Close REUTERS/Carlos Barria TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTSVYZY WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump\u2019s choice to head the Interior Department on Tuesday rejected the president-elect\u2019s past claim that climate change is a hoax , saying it is indisputable that environmental changes are affecting the world\u2019s temperature and human activity is a major reason. On The Trail: Melting glaciers \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d Rep. Ryan Zinke told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at his confirmation hearing. \u201cThe climate is changing; man is an influence,\u201d the Montana Republican said. \u201cI think where there\u2019s debate is what that influence is and what can we do about it.\u201d Mr. Trump has suggested in recent weeks he\u2019s keeping an open mind on the issue and may reconsider a campaign pledge to back away from a 2015 Paris agreement that calls for global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In contradicting the president-elect, Zinke cited Glacier National Park in his home state as a prime example of the effects of climate change, noting that glaciers there have receded in his lifetime and even from one visit to the next. Still, he told Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that there is debate about how much humans have influenced the climate. Zinke is not the first of the\u00a0Cabinet nominees to contradict the president-elect, a fact that does not seem to bother Mr. Trump. He told reporters gathered at Trump Tower Friday that he had instructed his appointees to \u201cbe yourselves and say what you want to say.\u201d\u00a0 Likely to win Senate confirmation, Zinke, 55, sketched out a variety of purposes for the nation\u2019s vast federal lands, from hiking, hunting, fishing and camping to harvesting timber and mining for coal and other energy sources. The Interior Department and other U.S. agencies control almost a third of land in the West and even more of the underground \u201cmineral estate\u201d that holds vast amounts of coal, oil and natural gas. An admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt, Zinke said management of federal lands should be done under a \u201cmultiple-use\u201d model set forth by Gifford Pinchot, a longtime Roosevelt associate and the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service. Zinke also pledged to tackle an estimated $12 billion backlog in maintenance and repair at national parks, saying parks and other public lands should be a key part of Trump\u2019s infrastructure improvement plan. But the former Navy SEAL said his most important task at Interior will be to \u201crestore trust\u201d between the agency and the states and Indian tribes it serves. \u201cOne of the reasons why people want to sell or transfer public land is there\u2019s no trust, because they feel like they don\u2019t have a voice,\u201d Zinke said, referring to elected officials and residents of many Western states. \u201cThey feel like they don\u2019t matter. Well, they should matter.\u201d Zinke has said he would never sell, give away or transfer public lands - a crucial stance in his home state of Montana and the rest of the West where access to hunting and fishing is considered sacrosanct. Zinke feels so strongly that he resigned as a delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer because of the GOP\u2019s position in favor of land transfers to state or private groups. Even so, Zinke\u2019s position on public lands came under fire this month after he voted in favor of a measure from House Republicans that would allow federal land transfers to be considered cost-free and budget-neutral, making it easier for drilling and development. The Interior nominee \u201csays he\u2019s against transfer of federal lands, but there\u2019s a big gap between what he says and what he does in that regard,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation\u2019s oldest and largest environmental group. Zinke told senators Tuesday that he flatly opposes all sales or transfer of federal lands. Indeed, his support for public lands was a crucial reason why Zinke was chosen by President-elect Trump. The president-elect and son Donald Trump Jr. both oppose sale of federal lands. The younger Trump, an avid hunter, has taken a keen interest in Interior Department issues and played a key role in Zinke\u2019s selection. Zinke also reiterated his support for coal production on federal lands as part of an all-of-the above energy strategy Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy panel, asked Zinke about modernizing the federal coal program, saying it was important \u201cto make sure American taxpayers aren\u2019t short-changed for the benefit of corporate interests.\u201d Zinke promised to review the coal program and said he thinks taxpayers \u201cshould always get fair value,\u201d whether it\u2019s coal, wind power or other energy sources. Zinke also pledged to work with members of Congress on proposed national monuments such as the Bears Ears monument recently designated in Utah. The state\u2019s Republican delegation fiercely opposes the monument created by President Obama. \u201cI think a monument, when it falls in a state, I think the state should have a say on it,\u201d Zinke said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Chilling Facebook video of suspected Orlando cop-killer includes murder talk Before the Jan. 9 shooting, authorities had been looking for Loyd for questioning in the death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend last month. Loyd appeared in an ominous Facebook Live video before the shootings -- as his then-girlfriend joked about killing police and herself, The Orlando Sentinel reported . The Nov. 4 video showed Markeith Loyd in a car at a traffic stop with his pregnant girlfriend, Sade Dixon. \"Go ahead and kill him, babe, so we can get home faster,\" she was heard saying, referring to the officer. Later, as Loyd sped down the road, she shouted, \"You not about to kill me and the baby.\" Just over a month later, police said Loyd did indeed kill the girlfriend, reportedly after she broke up with him. Last week, cops arrested three people accused of helping Loyd, 41, after the manhunt began, Fox 35 reported . Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, was arrested Wednesday on an accessory charge Wednesday. Later the same day, police arrested an ex-girlfriend of Loyd's: Jameis Slaughter, who also faces a charge of accessory, according to online jail records. And a day earlier, Zarghee Mayan, the fugitive's supervisor at a fried chicken restaurant, was arrested on the same charge. Right after Loyd's ex-girlfriend was killed in mid-December, Mayan said Loyd came into the restaurant with a gun, pointed it at Mayan and said, \"'Drive me or I will kill you. I just did something real bad,\"' court documents revealed Mayan said he drove Loyd to several places, including the home of Loyd's estranged wife, where Loyd told him to knock on the door. Mayan said he walked to the door without knocking because he was afraid Lloyd would shoot her, according to the arrest affidavit, which noted that Mayan told conflicting stories about his encounters with Loyd. Mayan claimed his most recent encounter with Loyd was last Saturday, two days before the Walmart shooting. Mayan said he noticed that Loyd was armed and wearing body armor when they hugged, according to his arrest affidavit. Hundreds of officers and deputies have been searching for Loyd, and a $100,000 reward was being offered for information that leads to his arrest. The U.S. Marshals Service had added Loyd to its list of most wanted fugitives Tuesday and added $25,000 to the reward offer. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

Chelsea Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick. In this undated file photo provided by the U.S. Army, Pfc. Chelsea Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick. (AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter President Barack\u00a0 Obama \u00a0commuted the prison sentence of Chelsea\u00a0 Manning \u00a0on Tuesday, allowing the Army intelligence officer who leaked scores of classified documents to go free nearly three decades early. Manning, who will leave prison in May, was one of 209 inmates whose sentences\u00a0Obama\u00a0was shortening, a list that includes Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez-Rivera.\u00a0Obama\u00a0also pardoned 64 people, including retired Gen. James Cartwright , who was charged with making false statements during a probe into disclosure of classified information. \"These 273 individuals learned that our nation is a forgiving nation,\" said White House counsel Neil Eggleston, \"where hard work and a commitment to rehabilitation can lead to a second chance, and where wrongs from the past will not deprive an individual of the opportunity to move forward.\" The actions are permanent, and can't be undone by President-elect Donald Trump. White House officials said\u00a0Obama\u00a0would grant clemency to more individuals on Thursday \u2014 his final day in office \u2014 but that batch was not expected to include prominent individuals like\u00a0Manning. A former Army intelligence analyst,\u00a0Manning\u00a0has been serving a 35-year sentence for leaking more than 700,000 classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks, along with some battlefield video. She was convicted in military court in 2013 of six violations of the Espionage Act and 14 other offenses and has spent more than six years behind bars. She asked\u00a0Obama\u00a0last November to commute her sentence to time served. Known as Bradley\u00a0Manning\u00a0at the time of her 2010 arrest,\u00a0Manning\u00a0came out as transgender after being sentenced, and LGBT rights groups took up her cause and lobbied the president to grant her clemency. She was held at a men's prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and filed a transgender prisoner rights lawsuit, although the military did approve gender-reassignment hormone therapy. President Barack Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was serving 70 years in prison for his role in an organization that plotted bombings, prison escapes and armed robberies in an effort to secure independence for Puerto Rico. Lopez Rivera, a leader of FALN, Spanish... President Barack Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was serving 70 years in prison for his role in an organization that plotted bombings, prison escapes and armed robberies in an effort to secure independence for Puerto Rico. Lopez Rivera, a leader of FALN, Spanish... (Gregory Pratt) She attempted suicide twice last year, according to her lawyers, citing her treatment in prison.\u00a0Manning\u00a0has acknowledged leaking the documents, but has she did it to raise public awareness about the effects of war on civilians. White House officials said the president was inclined to grant clemency to\u00a0Manning\u00a0because she had expressed remorse for her crimes and had served several years of her sentence. The officials briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity. \"We are all better off knowing that Chelsea\u00a0Manning\u00a0will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many,\" said Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing\u00a0Manning, adding that\u00a0Obama's\u00a0action could \"quite literally save Chelsea's life.\" But\u00a0Obama's\u00a0move was panned by\u00a0Manning's\u00a0critics, including several prominent Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the move \"just outrageous.\" \"Chelsea\u00a0Manning's\u00a0treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets,\" said Ryan, R-Wis. \"President\u00a0Obama\u00a0now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won't be held accountable for their crimes.\" The U.S. Army and the Pentagon both declined to comment on\u00a0Obama's\u00a0decision. Manning's\u00a0commutation came as\u00a0Obama, days before leaving office, wielded his clemency powers with newfound vigor. Though most of the beneficiaries were low-level drug offenders or little-known financial criminals, a few prominent names made the list, too. Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who received a pardon, had pleaded guilty in October to making false statements during an investigation into a leak of classified information about a covert cyberattack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Prosecutors said Cartwright falsely told investigators that he did not provide information contained in a news article and in a book by New York Times journalist David Sanger, and said he also misled prosecutors about classified information shared with another journalist, Daniel Klaidman. The Justice Department sought a sentence of two years, saying employees of the U.S. government are entrusted each day with sensitive classified information. Puerto Ricans had long demanded the release of Lopez, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison for his role in a violent struggle for independence for the U.S. island territory. Lopez had belonged to the ultranationalist Armed Forces of National Liberation, which has claimed responsibility for more than 100 bombings at public and commercial buildings in U.S. cities during the 1970s and 1980s. Lopez's term will now expire in May. Commutations reduce sentences being served but don't erase convictions. Pardons generally restore civil rights, such as voting, often after a sentence has been served. It wasn't immediately clear what\u00a0Obama's\u00a0commutation for\u00a0Manning\u00a0would mean for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who had earlier pledged that he would agree to U.S. extradition if\u00a0Obama\u00a0granted clemency to\u00a0Manning. Holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, Assange had expressed concern that if he left he would be extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges. But the Justice Department has never publicly announced any indictment against Assange, who is also being investigated by Sweden for a possible sex crime. White House officials didn't say Tuesday whether there were sealed charges against Assange, but insisted his pledge to surrender to the U.S. didn't play into\u00a0Obama's\u00a0decision to commute\u00a0Manning's\u00a0sentence. Melinda Taylor, who serves on Assange's legal team, said he would not go back on his word, though she didn't elaborate about possible extradition. Associated Press ",

Got it (Reuters) By Emma Brown , Moriah Balingit and Ed O'Keefe By Emma Brown , Moriah Balingit and Ed O'Keefe January 17 at 7:45 PM Follow @emmersbrown Follow @ByMoriah Follow @edatpost The Senate education committee was deeply divided over \u00adPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary at her confirmation hearing Tuesday evening, with Democrats attacking Betsy DeVos as unfit for the job and Republicans defending her as a bold reformer. DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, repeatedly told skeptical senators that she looked forward to working with them to improve the nation\u2019s schools. But she sidestepped several issues important to Democrats and their allies: She declined to commit that she would not work to privatize the nation\u2019s public schools, called Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s ideas about free college tuition \u201cinteresting,\u201d and said she could not promise to uphold the Obama administration\u2019s guidance to K-12 schools and colleges on handling allegations of campus sexual violence. \u201cIt would be premature\u201d to make such a commitment, DeVos said in response to a question from Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.). The Obama administration\u2019s guidance on sexual assault, issued in 2011, was a turning point in the national conversation about such violence and pushed campus officials to more aggressively investigate incidents and protect survivors\u2019 rights. But the guidance, which directed schools to use a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in sexual assault investigations, has drawn backlash from some colleges and politicians who argue that it violates the rights of those accused of assault. Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet View Graphic Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet \u201cAssault in any form is never okay, I just want to be very clear on that,\u201d DeVos said Tuesday. \u201cIf confirmed, I look forward to understanding the past actions and current situation better, and to ensuring that the intent of the law is actually carried out in a way that recognizes both the victim . . . as well as those who are accused.\u201d DeVos is an unusually polarizing nominee to helm the Education Department. She has lobbied for decades to expand charter schools and taxpayer-funded vouchers for private and religious schools, but she has no professional experience in public schools and has not held public office. In his introduction of DeVos at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, argued that her status as an outsider is an asset. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t come from within the education establishment. But honestly, I believe that today that\u2019s one of the most important qualifications you could have for this job,\u201d the former senator from Connecticut said. \u201cWe need a change agent.\u201d GOP senators cheered DeVos\u2019s nomination, saying they hoped that she would champion alternatives to the nation\u2019s public schools and scale back the federal footprint in K-12 education. [ Teachers unions mount campaign against Betsy DeVos ] \u201cBetsy DeVos, in my opinion, is on our children\u2019s side,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, said in his opening remarks Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s devoted her life to helping mainly low-income children have access to better schools.\u201d (Reuters) Alexander dismissed DeVos\u2019s critics as out of step with public opinion, arguing that charter schools have been embraced by Democrats, including President Obama, and that vouchers are patterned on \u201cthe most successful social policy this Congress has ever enacted \u2014 the GI Bill,\u201d which provides tuition assistance for veterans to attend the college of their choice. \u201cWhy is such a great idea for colleges deemed to be such a dangerous idea for K-12 schools?\u201d Alexander said. He said he would restrict senators to one five-minute round of questions for DeVos, which dismayed Democrats, who said they needed more time to examine DeVos\u2019s record. \u201cI think we\u2019re selling our kids short by not being able to ask follow up questions,\u201d said Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). The hearing went forward Tuesday evening over the objections of Democrats, who are concerned that the Office of Government Ethics \u2014 which is responsible for vetting presidential nominees for potential conflicts of interest \u2014 has not finished its review of DeVos\u2019s vast wealth and financial investments. [ Trump could reverse Obama\u2019s actions on sexual assault, transgender rights ] Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the HELP committee, said she is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d that Republicans insisted on having the hearing before the ethics review was done. She said she wants DeVos to explain how she\u2019ll handle potential conflicts of interest given her \u201cextensive financial entanglements.\u201d Murray told DeVos that she has \u201cmajor concerns about how you spent your career and your fortune fighting to privatize public education,\u201d and is concerned about DeVos\u2019s contributions to groups that \u201cwant to impose anti-LGBT or anti-women\u2019s health beliefs on public schools and the students in them.\u201d [ Dems raise concerns about possible links between DeVos and student debt collection agency ] DeVos promised to resolve any conflicts of interest identified by the ethics office. \u201cI will not be conflicted, period,\u201d she said. \u201cI commit that to you all.\u201d She said that if confirmed, she will be a \u201cstrong advocate for great public schools.\u201d But when public schools are \u201ctroubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child,\u201d she said, parents should have a \u201cright to enroll their child in a high quality alternative.\u201d \u201cI share President-elect Trump\u2019s view that it\u2019s time to shift the debate from what the system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve,\u201d she said. The strong feelings about DeVos\u2019s nomination were evident in the line of more than 100 people waiting to enter the Capitol Hill hearing room Tuesday evening. There were supporters, including students in plaid uniforms and bright yellow scarves embroidered with \u201cNational School Choice Week,\u201d and critics, including a large contingent of parents and teens from Detroit, who came by bus to oppose Devos\u2019s nomination. But many Democrats and their allies, including teachers unions and civil rights groups, argue that her support for a free-market approach to education has undermined public schools, which they see as a critical civic institution. They also point to the fact that she has no record on higher education or protecting children\u2019s civil rights, two areas critical to the work of the department she aims to lead. [ Betsy DeVos and her family members are major donors to the senators who will vote on her confirmation ] \u201cBetsy DeVos is wholly unqualified to do this work,\u201d said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. He urged senators to reject DeVos, the first time the group has opposed an education secretary nominee. Asked about her relatives\u2019 contributions to anti-LGBT groups, DeVos said she believes in equality: \u201cI believe in the innate value of every single human being and that all students, no matter their age, should be able to attend a school and feel safe and be free of discrimination,\u201d she said. The strong opposition is unusual for nominees to lead the Education Department: Obama\u2019s first nominee to the education job, Arne Duncan, was warmly welcomed by senators from both parties and was confirmed via voice vote. Nominees under presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also sailed through. DeVos\u2019s confirmation hearing came on the same day as a hearing for Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), Trump\u2019s choice for interior secretary, who is expected to sail to an easy confirmation. [ Betsy DeVos omitted $125,000 anti-union political donation from Senate disclosure form ] On the campaign trail, Trump proposed a new $20 billion grant program to encourage states to expand such efforts, but he offered few details about how that might work, and there is a tension between the incoming administration\u2019s interest in expanding vouchers and charter schools and conservatives\u2019 interest in leaving decisions about education to states and school districts. DeVos said repeatedly Tuesday that she would not coerce states to expand vouchers or charters. The HELP Committee is scheduled to vote on DeVos\u2019s confirmation on Jan. 24.

Cartwright pleaded guilty to lying to the... Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, received a pardon, the White House said. He pleaded guilty in October to making false statements during an investigation into a leak of classified information about a covert cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\u00a0 Prosecutors said Cartwright falsely told investigators that he did not provide information contained in a news article and in a book by New York Times journalist David Sanger, and said he also misled prosecutors about classified information shared with another journalist, Daniel Klaidman.\u00a0 The Justice Department sought a sentence of two years, saying employees of the U.S. government are entrusted each day with sensitive classified information.\u00a0 General Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA, says the Stuxnet computer virus was the right way to intervene in Iran's nuclear weapons prog... \u201cThey must understand that disclosing such information to persons not authorized to receive it has severe consequences,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed this month.

She asked Obama last November to commute her sentence to time served.\u00a0 President Obama is commuting the bulk of Chelsea Manning's prison sentence. Manning was a U.S. Army soldier convicted in July 2013 for violation ... Manning has spent more than six years behind bars. She was convicted in military court in 2013 of six violations of the Espionage Act and 14 other offenses for leaking more than 700,000 documents and some battlefield video to WikiLeaks. She was known as Bradley Manning at the time of her 2010 arrest and is being held at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Manning was an intelligence analyst in Iraq and has acknowledged leaking the documents, but has said it was done to raise public awareness about the effects of war on civilians. She attempted suicide twice last year, according to her lawyers, citing her treatment at Leavenworth. Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Manning, said the president\u2019s action \u201cquite literally save Chelsea\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cWe are all better off knowing that Chelsea Manning will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many,\u201d Stangio said in a statement.

    "text": "advertisement (Inside Science) \u2014 Early in the 1960s, a group of enthusiasts advanced the concept of freezing humans as soon as they die, in hopes of reviving them after the arrival of medical advances able to cure the conditions that killed them. The idea went into practice for the first time 50 years ago. On Jan. 12, 1967, James Bedford, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of California, became the first person to be \"cyropreserved.\" A small team of doctors and other enthusiasts froze him a few hours after he died from liver cancer that had spread to his lungs. A few days later the team placed the body into an insulated container packed with dry ice. Later still, Bedford was immersed in liquid nitrogen in a large Dewar container. Fifteen years on, after a series of moves from one cryopreservation facility to another, his body found a home at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona, where it still resides. Linda Chamberlain, the co-founder of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz., poses with cryogenic tanks in 1999. Irwin R. Daugherty / AP file By current standards of cryonics, the procedure was remarkably untidy and disorganized. Nevertheless, a visual evaluation of Bedford's condition in 1991 found that his body had remained frozen and suffered no obvious deterioration. \"There's no date set for another examination,\" said R. Michael Perry, care services manager at Alcor. Related: Life-Saving Drones Promise Revolution in Emergency Care But as promoters of cryopreservation celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bedford's death and freezing \u2014 known to some as \"Bedford Day\" \u2014 they emphasize improvements to the freezing and preservation procedures that Bedford's experiences advanced. The community is also undergoing a significant change in its expectations for reviving frozen patients. Rather than planning for a Lazarus-like resuscitation of the entire body, some proponents of the technology focus more on saving individuals' stored memories, and perhaps incorporating them into robots. Aura of Suspicion Beyond the cryopreservation community, however, an aura of scientific suspicion that surrounded Bedford's freezing remains. \"Reanimation or simulation is an abjectly false hope that is beyond the promise of technology and is certainly impossible with the frozen, dead tissue offered by the 'cryonics' industry,\" neuroscientist Michael Hendricks of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, wrote in Technology Review . Scientists aren't the industry's only critics. Families of individuals designated for freezing \u2014 including Bedford's own family \u2014 have gone to court to protest or defend loved ones' decisions to undergo freezing. Related: This App is Revolutionizing Diagnoses of Rare Diseases In a more recent case, in 2011, a Colorado probate judge upheld a contract that Mary Robbins had signed with Alcor over objections from Robbins' children. And last year the High Court of England upheld a mother's right to seek cryonic treatment of her terminally ill 14-year-old daughter after her death, despite the father's wishes. Public reaction to the technology reached its nadir in New England in 2002, when court documents revealed that Boston Red Sox baseball icon Ted Williams was frozen in the Alcor facility, with his head severed from his body. Williams' son John Henry, who arranged the process, was himself frozen after he died of leukemia. Daniel Edward's sculpture of Boston Red Sox great Ted William head is exhibited at the First Street Gallery in New York in 2005. Edwards said the inspiration for the sculpture came to him when it was revealed that the Hall of Famer's head was removed and cryogenically frozen following his death in July 2002. Adam Rountree / AP file Politics has also impacted the technology's progress. In 2004, for example, Michigan's state government voted to license a facility called the Cryonics Institute, located in Clinton, as a cemetery. That move, reversed eight years later, prevented the institute from preparing bodies for cryopreservation on its own, because applying such procedures to a dead body required the services of a licensed funeral director. The cryonics industry flatly disagrees with its critics. Alcor asserts on its website that \"[t]here are no known credible technical arguments that lead one to conclude that cryonics, carried out under good conditions today, would not work.\" The company adds: \"Cryonics is a belief that no one is really dead until the information content of the brain is lost, and that low temperatures can prevent this loss.\" Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future Certainly the controversies have not discouraged candidates for cryopreservation. Worldwide, more than 250 individuals are now housed in cryonic facilities, at a minimum per-person cost of about $28,000 in the U.S. Russia's KrioRus company offers a cut-rate level starting at $12,000, with the condition that it stores several human bodies and assorted pets and other animals in communal Dewar containers. Individual contracts can specify the length of storage. At present, the U.S. and Russia are the only countries with facilities that offer human cryopreservation. Difficult Beginning The first attempt at cryopreservation did not go particularly smoothly. Bedford died before all preparations for his cryopreservation were complete. So instead of draining his blood and replacing it with a customized antifreeze solution to protect the body's tissues from freezing damage, the team simply injected the antifreeze into Bedford's arteries without removing the blood. The team then surrounded the body in dry ice, and started it on a series of transfers from one container to another that ended up in a Dewar container in Alcor's facility. Because of those difficulties, cryonics experts feared that the body had suffered serious damage. But the examination in 1991 quelled those concerns. \"We were really relieved that he was not discolored,\" Perry recalled. \"And corners of the ice cubes [around him] were still sharp; he had stayed frozen all the time.\" Related: The Hunt For Alien Megastructures Is On In recent years, cryonics promoters have borrowed from medical advances in such fields as cryobiology and nanobiology. To prevent ice crystals from damaging cell walls in the frozen state, cryopreservationists replace the body's blood supply with mixtures of antifreeze compounds and organ preservatives \u2014 a technique developed to preserve frozen eggs for fertility treatments. Another emerging approach accounts for the separation of Ted Williams' head and body. Based on studies of roundworms, promoters of cryonics argue that freezing can preserve the contents of individuals' brains even if their bodies can't be revived. That opens the possibility of downloading cryopreserved personalities into a robotic future body. Hendricks disagrees. \"While it may be possible to preserve these features in dead tissue, that is certainly not happening now,\" he pointed out in Technology Review. A Distant Dream Scientists such as Barry Fuller, a professor of surgical science and low temperature medicine at England's University College, London, emphasize that even preserving body parts in such a way that they remain viable on thawing remains a distant dream. \"There is ongoing research into these scientific challenges, and a potential future demonstration of the ability to cryopreserve human organs for transplantation would be a major first step into proving the concept,\" he told The Guardian . \"But at the moment we cannot achieve that.\" Nevertheless, Perry expresses optimism about a timeline for the revival of frozen humans. \"We think in terms of decades,\" he said. \"Sometimes we say fifty to a hundred years.\" David Gorski, a surgeon at Wayne State University Medical Center in Michigan, takes a darker view. \"Fifty years from now,\" he said, \"it's likely that all that will remain of my existence will be some scientific papers and a faint memory held by my nieces and nephews and maybe, if I'm lucky, a few of my youngest readers.\" Reprinted with permission from Inside Science , an editorially independent news product of the American Institute of Physics, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing, promoting and serving the physical sciences.

People rally at San Francisco City Hall on Sunday to retain the Affordable Care Act. (Josh Edelson / For the Los Angeles Times) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter Repealing Obamacare without a replacement would result in higher costs for consumers and fewer people with insurance coverage, according to a report Tuesday from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . In the first year, insurance premiums would jump\u00a0by 20% to 25% for individual policies purchased directly or through the Obamacare marketplace, according to the report.\u00a0The number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million. Those numbers would only increase in subsequent years. Premium prices would continue to climb\u00a0by 50% the next year, with the uninsured swelling to 27 million, as full repeal took effect, the report said. Americans may be beginning to worry about such costs. For the first time, more Americans view the Affordable Care Act as a \u201cgood idea,\u201d rather than a bad one, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll also released Tuesday. The one-two punch at efforts to dismantle Obamacare comes as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to replace the healthcare law with a new plan that he has not yet detailed. The researchers estimated that there were 926,200 abortions in 2014, or 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women of reproductive age. That was down 14% from three years earlier. ... ... (Nina Agrawal) Demonstrators\u00a0rallied across the country over the weekend to save the law that now benefits 20 million Americans. \u201c Republicans need to wake up to the brutal impact that repealing the ACA will have on the lives of their constituents,\u201d said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the minority leader.\u00a0\u201cWhile President-elect Trump promises \u2018insurance for everybody,\u2019 Republicans are moving to destroy the health coverage of tens of millions of Americans and drive up costs for millions more. The GOP plan isn\u2019t repeal and delay, or repeal and replace \u2014 it\u2019s cut and run.\u201d Republicans argued Tuesday that the Congressional Budget Office\u00a0report was based only on their initial plans to repeal Obamacare, but not on their ideas for replacing it, which have yet to be formally proposed . \u201cToday\u2019s report shows only part of the equation \u2014\u00a0a repeal of Obamacare without any transitional policies or reforms to address costs and empower patients,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the chairman of the Finance Committee.\u00a0\u201cRepublicans support repealing Obamacare and implementing step-by-step reforms so that Americans have access to affordable healthcare.\u201d But Americans are increasingly skeptical that Republicans will be able to put forward legislation to improve Obamacare. News on the Obamacare-replacement front was dominated this past weekend by Donald Trump and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who both touted their Obamacare replacement plans. To be absolutely precise, they touted the claim that they had Obamacare replacement plans. They didn\u2019t go into any great detail... News on the Obamacare-replacement front was dominated this past weekend by Donald Trump and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who both touted their Obamacare replacement plans. To be absolutely precise, they touted the claim that they had Obamacare replacement plans. They didn\u2019t go into any great detail... (Michael Hiltzik) About 50% of those polled said they had \u201cvery little confidence\u201d or \u201cno confidence at all\u201d that Republicans would have a bill, according to the Wall Street Journal. Even though the Republican-led Congress approved a process last week to begin repealing Obamacare, they have yet to propose a replacement. At the same time, 45% now think the healthcare law is a \u201cgood idea,\u201d a high-water mark since pollsters\u00a0started asking about it in 2009, when\u00a041% said it was a \u201cbad idea,\u201d the survey said. Tuesday\u2019s report from the Congressional Budget Office\u00a0and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation was based on a 2015 Republican repeal bill that is the framework for this year\u2019s effort. Under that plan, Republicans would end mandates that most Americans purchase insurance. Later\u00a0it would eliminate the federal subsidies that help people buy insurance and roll back funding for Medicaid , which was expanded in many states under Obamacare to cover more low-income people. Republicans have argued that no one should be forced to buy healthcare.\u00a0But as younger, healthier people drop out, those opting to keep their coverage would likely be sicker, sending prices higher, experts say. As federal funding for subsidies and Medicaid is\u00a0cut, fewer people will likely be able to purchase insurance or access state healthcare programs.\u00a0 The\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimates current\u00a0premiums could double by 2026\u00a0and that\u00a0the number of uninsured people would increase to 32 million in\u00a02026. The insurance markets are already facing challenges under Obamacare, including rising premiums and fewer enrollments than first\u00a0hoped for, leaving insurers to pull out of some states. At the same time, more Americans now have health insurance than ever before as\u00a0people buy policies on the marketplaces or enroll in expanded Medicaid offerings in some states. Trump and Republicans in Congress are now working on alternatives\u00a0and hope to retain some of Obamacare\u2019s popular provisions \u2014\u00a0including allowing young adults to remain on their family\u2019s\u00a0policies\u00a0and prohibiting insurers from denying coverage for preexisting conditions. But they have had trouble coalescing around a plan. Trump has said he expects Congress to swiftly repeal and replace Obamacare, and promises to unveil a plan as soon as Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, is confirmed and takes office.

The 2018 Mustang features new LED lights, a lower nose and a new 10-speed automatic transmission, marketing manager Mark Schaller said. The changes are intended to keep the current model of the Mustang, which debuted as a 2015 model, fresh. The model could use a kick in the fender when it comes to sales. Ford sold 105,932 Mustangs last year, down 13.4%. Its archrivals, Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger, saw their sales fall 6.2% and 2.9% respectively, Autodata reports. The Mustang\u2019s sheet metal is new from the windshield forward, including new fenders and a lower hood with new vents. The front and rear bumpers are new. The tri-bar taillights are reshaped slightly to resemble the chevron front signature lights. The Mustang GT\u2019s 5-liter V-8 gets more power thanks to the addition of port fuel injection to complement the direct injection it already had. The 2.3-liter turbo four-cylinder will see a torque increase thanks to the same technology. Ford expects the new injection system and 10-speed automatic transmission to increase the Mustang\u2019s fuel economy. \u201cFast, fun and affordable is in the Mustang\u2019s DNA,\u201d Schaller said, promising the 10-speed will also deliver faster shifts and quicker zero to 60 mile-per-hour\u00a0and quarter-mile times. \u201cThis is one of the biggest midcycle changes ever for the Mustang.\u201d A midcycle change or update is the auto industry\u2019s term for changes to a vehicle made midway between its introduction and the arrival of an all new model. Mustangs with the V-8 engine will get a new active exhaust system that changes the exhaust note depending on driving style and other conditions. The advanced adaptive Magneride shock absorbers previously available only on the high-performance Shelby GT350 Mustang will be offered across the model line. It improves ride and handling markedly. The Mustang\u2019s six-speed manual transmission also gets upgrades from the GT350 for easier shifts and less vibration. Interior updates include vinyl wrapping on the center console, a new customizable display for gauges, a metal start button and an optional heated steering wheel, The 2018 Mustang goes on sale in the fall. Prices and fuel economy features will be available then. 4636 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k1fhTw NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

USA TODAY NETWORK Betsy DeVos, nominee for Secretary of Education, speaks during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2013 Betsy DeVos, a Michigan advocate for school choice and vouchers and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, vowed Tuesday to protect any schools \u2013 public, private or otherwise \u2013 as long as they are working for students and parents and serving their needs. Facing Democrats who questioned DeVos\u2019 support of school choice and what it may mean for public schools, DeVos said she supports \u201cany great school\u201d \u2013 including public schools and those beyond what \u201cthe (public school) system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve.\u201d \u201cNot all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them. I\u2019m hoping we can work together to find common ground,\u201d DeVos said, rebuffing a request by U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that she vow not to propose funding cuts for any public schools. DeVos, 59, stepped before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for a rare nighttime confirmation hearing, facing a broad spectrum of questions that ranged from early childhood education, free college and the Obama administration\u2019s crackdown on college sexual assaults to her own personal beliefs about sexual orientation and any support she gave for controversial \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d which she denied. \u201cI believe in equality and I firmly believe in the intrinsic value of each individual, and that every student should have the assurance of a safe and discrimination-free place to become educated,\u201d said DeVos, telling U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that as regards the alleged support, she might \u201cbe confusing some other family members in some of those contributions, and also looking at contributions from 18 or 20 years ago.\u201d \u201cAs a mom I just can\u2019t imagine having a child that would feel discriminated against for any reason, and I would want my child in a safe environment,\u201d she said. She acknowledged, however, that her family may have given as much as $200 million to Republican candidates and causes over the years. In response to questions, she also promised that neither she nor her husband, former Amway head and heir Dick DeVos, would be politically active while she serves, if she is confirmed. She also said that given her family\u2019s complex financial arrangements, she will resolve any conflicts of interest. \u201cI will not be conflicted,\u201d she said. She also defended her support of charter schools and school choice in Detroit, saying there is \u201ca lot that has gone right in Detroit\u201d given the poverty there and rebuking reports that charter schools haven\u2019t delivered as big a change in education in the city as promised. While Democrats went on the attack, Republicans on the committee lined up to defend her: The chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., opened the hearing with a strong endorsement, saying, \u201cBetsy DeVos in my opinion is on our children\u2019s side \u2026 I believe she\u2019s in the mainstream of public opinion and her critics are not.\u201d He went onto say she has fought to help low-income parents have choice in education options and that 73% of Americans support school choice Posted!

Bill Cassidy, R-La., said, \u201cMan that\u2019s amazing, you would think some would have us think you do not.\u201d DeVos came into the confirmation hearing a week after it had initially been scheduled and three days before Trump\u2019s inauguration at the U.S. Capitol. Democrats, teachers\u2019 unions and others have loudly denounced DeVos\u2019 nomination, arguing that her vocal support of vouchers and school choice programs could undermine public schools. \u201cBetsy DeVos is a billionaire who has spent her career & fortune rigging the system to privatize and defund public ed,\u201d Randi Weingarten, head of the 1.6-million-member American Federation of Teachers union in a tweet earlier today. Alexander said the committee could vote on DeVos\u2019 nomination as early as next Tuesday, after which it would be sent to the floor of the U.S. Senate for final confirmation. Murray, the top Democrat on the panel, complained that the hearing should have been delayed until the Office of Government Ethics sent a letter on DeVos and any agreements she will make to ensure there are no conflicts of interest. Democrats, who have little chance of blocking DeVos\u2019 nomination, still put up strong resistance at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tried to pin DeVos on a commitment to enforce employment rules at for-profit institutions; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., urged DeVos to embrace free tuition at all public colleges and universities, which she called \u201ca really interesting idea\u201d but said policy makers have to \u201cconsider that in life nothing is truly free, somebody will pay for it.\u201d In a particularly sharp exchange, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, asked DeVos if she or any family members had ever taken out a loan or been awarded a grant from the federal government to pay for college. DeVos said she hadn\u2019t. Warren then noted that Trump last year paid a $25 million settlement to students of Trump University who complained that they didn\u2019t get what they paid for. Asked if DeVos would enforce rules that require career colleges to offer saleable skills to students, DeVos said instead that she would \u201creview\u201d the rule. \u201cI don\u2019t understand about \u2018reviewing\u2019 it. We talked about this in my office,\u201d said Warren. \u201cThere are already rules in place to stop waste, fraud and abuse and I don\u2019t understand how you cannot be sure about enforcing them. \u2026 If you can\u2019t commit to use the tools that are already available to you in the Department of Education, then I don\u2019t see how you can be the secretary.\u201d She also declined to vow to keep in place Obama administration rules requiring colleges and universities to be more responsible for cracking down on sexual assaults, saying she needs to look at them. \u201cSexual assault anywhere and any place is a problem,\u201d she said. Pushed by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., to say whether guns belong in schools, DeVos said it\u2019s an issue \u201cbest left to locales and states to decide.\u201d She added that for a school in a place like rural Idaho, educators might need \u201ca gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.\u201d Protesters, many of them from Michigan, attended the hearing, filling up a hallway outside the packed committee room. Among them was 17-year-old Dannah Wilson, who had ridden one of two buses from Detroit the night before with about 120 other people. Wilson, a senior at Cornerstone Leadership and Business High School, a Detroit private school, said she\u2019d come \u201crepresenting students across Detroit. I just honestly want to know how she feels and responds to these questions.\u201d Wilson said her mother pays $11,000 for her and each of her two younger sisters to attend the school. Wilson\u2019s mother, Dawn Wilson-Clark, said her five children have attended some 22 Detroit schools in all. \u201cChoice is not the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue is quality. We have a lot of choices, but they\u2019re not quality and the charter schools are not held to the same accountability that the public schools are.\u201d At one point last year, Wilson-Clark said, she was driving 200 miles a week to four different schools \u201ctrying to get my children a quality education.\u201d Shoniqua Kemp, another Detroit parent with the 482 Forward education organizing network, said \u201cquality is a problem\u201d in Detroit schools, even with a wide array of choices. \u201cSchool choices can be a good thing \u2013 however, give me quality. My choice shouldn\u2019t be \u2018Rancid tomato\u2019 or \u2018Pick one from the garbage.\u2019 That\u2019s not fair.\u201d DeVos came into the hearing with many supporters. Writing in the Detroit News today, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder praised her selection, saying she \u201chas a big heart and she believes strongly that parental control of education through school choice is integral to improving the performance of our K-12 system.\u201d \u201cContrary to the misleading picture the teachers unions are trying to paint, she shares her support for school choice with several fair-minded and prominent Democrats, including Barack Obama\u2019s two education secretaries, John King and Arne Duncan,\u201d Snyder wrote. Several school reformers, including political rivals of Trump\u2019s, have praised DeVos. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called her \"an outstanding pick,\u201d saying her allegiance \u201cis to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next.\" \u201cAll in all, she\u2019s a pretty conventional choice,\u201d said Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning Washington think tank. Hess noted last month that President Obama\u2019s 2015 nomination of King, then New York\u2019s education commissioner, \u201cwas greeted courteously and approved rapidly\u201d by the Republican-controlled Senate, despite King\u2019s \u201ctroubled tenure in New York, one that featured a disastrous rollout of the Common Core.\u201d But while school choice advocates say DeVos\u2019s efforts have largely succeeded, others say her work in Michigan has brought disappointing, sometimes chaotic results. The DeVoses have long sought to bring more private competition to the public school system. In 2000, the couple led a failed petition drive to institute a voucher system in Michigan that would allow parents to use public money to send their children to private schools. The state constitution prohibits such use of public funds. http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/23/betsy-devos-education-secretary-trump/94373904/ Voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal. But a similar plan is the centerpiece of Trump's education plan. He wants to spend $20 billion in federal funding now being spent on other things \u2014 and expects states to kick in even more \u2014 to provide to pay $12,000 in private school tuition for every high-poverty child in the country. The couple also played a role in getting Michigan\u2019s charter school law passed in 1993, and ever since have worked to protect charters from additional regulation. When Michigan lawmakers in 2016 were considering a measure that would have added oversight for charter schools in Detroit, members of the DeVos family poured $1.45 million into legislators\u2019 campaign coffers?\u2014?an average of $25,000 a day for seven weeks. Oversight was not included in the final legislation. As a result, Michigan\u2019s charter sector is among the least regulated in the country. About 80% of charters in Michigan are run by private companies, far more than in any other state. The National Association of Charter School Authorizers has said Michigan is well below average in the number of underperforming charter schools that close, and Douglas Harris, a professor of economics at Tulane University, last November called DeVos\u2019 appointment a \u201ctriumph of ideology over evidence,\u201d saying that as one of the architects of Detroit\u2019s charter school system, she holds partial responsibility for what even charter school backers acknowledge is \u201cthe biggest school reform disaster in the country.\u201d http://educationnext.org/devos-and-the-evidence-from-michigan/ Michigan's charter-friendly policies have allowed nearly 100 schools to open, run mostly by for-profit charter-school-management organizations. That has given families wider choice over their children's schools, but it has also created an expensive oversupply of about 30,000 seats in city classrooms. Current U.S. Education Secretary John King, who cut his teeth teaching in and founding charter schools in Massachusetts, last week noted that Michigan\u2019s weak charter school law has brought \u201ca proliferation of\u201d low-performing schools. \u201cIn Michigan, I do think the lack of strong accountability in their charter law, and in their charter sector, has harmed public education generally, and has harmed, ultimately, students,\u201d he said.

Continued detention \"does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States,\" the announcement said. The releases pare down the Gitmo prison population to 45 as Obama prepares to leave office on Friday ahead of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he plans to keep the facility open and even add to it. When Obama took office, there 242 prisoners at Gitmo, but most have been moved out for repatriation, resettlement or prosecution, Earnest said. The releases appear to be somewhat defiant of Trump's wishes. Trump, who during the 2016 campaign pledged to put some \"bad dudes\" at Guantanamo Bay, tweeted this month: \"There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.\" Read more: ",

    "text": "Maine Governor Offers John Lewis an Erroneous History Lesson By marina villeneuve, associated press AUGUSTA, Maine \u0097 Jan 17, 2017, 5:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump's War of Words with Civil Rights Icon Rep. John Lewis 0 Shares Email Republican Gov. Paul LePage on Tuesday offered an erroneous history lesson about racial segregation to a black Georgia congressman who risked his life to fight for civil rights, and he called on the NAACP to apologize to white people. Democratic U.S. Rep. John Lewis , who was beaten while marching in Selma, Alabama, with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., should be grateful to Republican presidents and shouldn't question the legitimacy of GOP President-elect Donald Trump's victory, LePage said. \"You know, I will just say this: John Lewis ought to look at history,\" LePage, who's white, said on WVOM-FM. \"You It was Abraham Lincoln that freed the slaves. It was Rutherford B. Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant that fought against Jim Crow laws. A simple thank you would suffice.\" Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and pushed for the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery. But historians say LePage is wrong about Jim Crow laws, which legalized racial segregation. Jim Crow laws didn't exist during the Grant administration and an electoral deal that put Hayes in office led to the end of Reconstruction and the removal of federal troops, setting the stage for the creation of Jim Crow laws that followed, said Colby professor Dan Shea. \"Paul LePage is going to give John Lewis a tutorial on the history of black oppression in the United States? That's rich,\" Shea said. LePage's criticism of Lewis comes on the heels of Lewis' comments last week that he would not attend Trump's inauguration. \"You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said in an interview with NBC's \" Meet the Press \" that aired Sunday. Lewis' spokeswoman said Tuesday that the facts of history refute LePage's statements about the Jim Crow laws. Later in the afternoon, the governor tried to clarify his remarks to the Portland Press Herald by saying he felt all white people were being lumped together. He said that the \"NAACP should apologize to the white people, to the people from the North for fighting their battle.\" The governor also said that \"the blacks, the NAACP\" paint white people with one brush and added that \"to say every white America is a racist is an insult.\" The governor has said a racist \"is the absolute worst, most vile thing you can call a person\" and last summer left an expletive-laced voicemail for a Democratic legislator that he thought called him a racist. LePage said he knows many Maine families who had ancestors who fought in the Civil War. Maine, the nation's whitest state, is 95 percent white, according to 2015 census estimates. The head of the Portland branch of the NAACP says it's unfortunate that LePage tried to revise history and disparage a civil rights leader a day after Martin Luther King Jr. Day. LePage on Tuesday also had harsh words for a Maine congresswoman who is among more than 40 House Democrats so far to say they are skipping Trump's inauguration. He said Rep. Chellie Pingree should resign if she doesn't attend. \"They're trying to bully us out of believing our Constitution,\" LePage said of Democrats. Pingree said Monday that \"President-elect Trump's actions go beyond any kind of reasonable debate\u2014they threaten the constitutional values our country is based on.\" Pingree's office on Tuesday called LePage's remarks about Lewis divisive and inaccurate. 0 Shares ",

By Aaron Blake By Aaron Blake January 17 at 11:34 AM Follow @aaronblake FBI Director James B. Comey, left, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and CIA Director John O. Brennan\u00a0 testify before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on Jan. 10. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) President-elect Donald Trump has long flirted with an adversarial relationship with our country's intelligence community. And now he apparently has gone too far for at least one of its leaders. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday night , CIA Director John O. Brennan had finally had it. Brennan said Trump crossed \u201cthe line\u201d by invoking Nazi Germany while talking about the intelligence community having, in Trump's words, \u201callowed\u201d a dossier full of unconfirmed and salacious allegations about him to leak into the public domain. Here's Trump's tweet: Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Brennan didn't hold back, saying Trump has a right to challenge the intelligence community\u00a0\u2014 but not in this manner. \u201cIt\u2019s when there are allegations made about leaking or about dishonesty or a lack of integrity, that\u2019s where I think the line is crossed,\u201d Brennan said. He added: \u201cTell the families of those 117 CIA officers who are forever memorialized\u00a0on our wall of honor that their loved\u00a0ones who gave their lives were akin to Nazis. Tell the CIA officers who are serving in harm\u2019s way right now and their families who are worried\u00a0about them that they are akin to Nazi Germany. I found\u00a0that to be very repugnant, and\u00a0I will forever stand\u00a0up for the integrity and\u00a0patriotism of my officers who have done much\u00a0over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens.\u201d That's pretty\u00a0strong. Brennan will not continue on as CIA director in the soon-to-be-installed Trump administration \u2014 that's Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) -- so his decision to lash out at Trump isn't all that significant going forward. But it's worth acknowledging just how stern a rebuke the CIA director delivered to Trump just days before he takes the oath of office. Speaking Jan. 11, Donald Trump slammed the release of an unsubstantiated intelligence report as \"something that Nazi Germany would have done\" and called Buzzfeed, the news organization that published it, a \"failing pile of garbage.\" (The Washington Post) And were this not Trump \u2014 and had there not been a kind of slow boil of the president-elect's controversial statements about the intelligence community \u2014 this is the kind of thing that would register as major news. In a way, we've become desensitized to it. A few examples of how we got to this point: It took Trump until last week to acknowledge that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta \u2014 a long-held conclusion of the intelligence community. Trump had previously suggested that it might have been the Democrats themselves , China, \u201c somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds \u201d or \u201c some guy in his home in New Jersey .\u201d Trump still hasn't acknowledged the intelligence community's conclusion that the effort was intended to benefit his candidacy. In July, he said he hoped Russian hackers\u00a0had Clinton's emails and urged them to find them if they didn't . In one tweet this month, he claimed that an intelligence briefing he was to receive on Russia's hacking had been delayed, even as the intel community said it had not , and . . . . . . in the same tweet, he questioned whether the intelligence community needed to buy time to \u201c build a case .\u201d He also has called efforts to look into Russian hacking a \u201c political witch hunt .\u201d He has regularly put the word \u201cintelligence\u201d in quotation marks in his tweets . He has suggested at multiple points that the intelligence community may have directly leaked the dossier, even as it is not an intelligence document and was seen by many journalists and lawmakers in Washington before BuzzFeed published it. He said last week that it was leaked by \u201c maybe the intelligence agencies , which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.\u201d Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. pushed back, clarifying that \u201cthis document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the [intelligence community].\u201d Trump and his team have\u00a0 mischaracterized the intelligence committee's report when it comes to\u00a0whether Russia actually had an effect on the 2016 election. Although the intelligence community has said clearly that it can't and won't make that determination, Trump's team has said it determined there was no impact . He has favorably cited the comments of\u00a0Julian Assange and Vladimir Putin \u2014 who are decidedly not allies of U.S. intelligence \u2014 while being much more skeptical about U.S. intelligence. Trump has tempered these comments by occasionally inserting some praise of the intelligence community, and he has left enough wiggle room in the things he has said so that it doesn't seem as though he's directly accusing them of working against him \u2014 only suggesting as much. But the totality of it is clear. And Brennan had enough \u2014 as others who haven't spoken out certainly have as well. It'll be fascinating to see what happens once Trump's own people are running the intelligence community and leakers say something Trump doesn't like. politics ",

    "text": "Jason Meisner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune An Italian art distributor was ordered held without bail Tuesday nearly a decade after he was charged in Chicago with allegedly selling fake \"limited edition\" prints of legendary painters such as Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso as part of an international fraud ring. Dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit, Elio Bonfiglioli, 61, listened through an Italian interpreter as his court-appointed lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. When U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Mason asked the lanky, gray-haired defendant if he understood the proceedings, he replied, \"I understand, sir,\" in thickly accented English. Bonfiglioli had been a fugitive since 2009 after failing to turn himself in to authorities in Spain, where he was living at the time, for extradition to the U.S. to face 10 counts of mail and wire fraud, prosecutors said Tuesday. Two years earlier, he had been charged as part of a scheme that made headlines after federal authorities raided the well-known Kass/Meridian Gallery on Chicago's Magnificent Mile and confiscated sales records and prints. Mason ordered Bonfiglioli held without bond after prosecutors argued he was a risk to flee because of his international ties. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. According to the charges, Bonfiglioli and several other European art distributors conspired to create bogus prints of sought-after 20th century artists, including Marc Chagall, Andy Warhol and Joan Miro, in addition to Dali and Picasso. In many cases, the prints \"bore false numerical or other markings\" to make them appear to be part of a limited-edition release, according to the indictment. The artists' signatures were also forged, and the prints often included fictitious certificates of authenticity, the indictment said. Elio Bonfiglioli indictment Read the story Bonfiglioli then sold the fake prints to art dealers, including Michael Zabrin of Northbrook, who \"knowingly sold the counterfeit work to various wholesale and retail customers,\" the indictment alleged. In September 2005, for example, Bonfiglioli shipped a tube labeled \"posters\" to Zabrin that contained counterfeit limited editions of Roy Lichtenstein's masterpiece \"Huh,\" the charges alleged. Two days later, Zabrin sold one of the fake prints to a buyer in London. The amount of the alleged transaction was not included in the indictment. Zabrin, who had already been convicted of a similar scheme in the early 1990s, began cooperating with the investigation after authorities approached him in 2006, records show. The probe eventually ensnared a dozen defendants, including Alan Kass, whose tony gallery in the 300 block of West Huron Street was raided by federal agents in 2008. Kass pleaded guilty in 2013 to selling phony artwork to hundreds of unsuspecting buyers and was sentenced to six months in prison. Zabrin, meanwhile, pleaded guilty in 2011 to scamming at least 250 people out of more than $1 million in counterfeit prints and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Two other alleged co-conspirators named in the indictment with Bonfiglioli \u2014 art dealers Patrizia Soliani, of Milan, and Oswaldo Aulestia-Bach, of Barcelona, Spain \u2014 remain fugitives, court records show.

    "text": "18 Million Could Lose Insurance in a Year Under 'Obamacare' Repeal, Congressional Budget Office Says By BENJAMIN SIEGEL Jan 17, 2017, 12:30 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Congress Moves Against Obamacare 0 Shares Email Repealing \" Obamacare \" without a replacement could leave 18 million Americans without health insurance within a year and 32 million by 2026, according to a new estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . The estimate, prepared at the request of Senate Democrats, is based on the partial repeal bill Republicans sent to President Obama's desk in 2015. Obama vetoed the measure, and Congress was not able to override it. Congress Prepares to Battle Over 'Obamacare' The office also estimated that individual health insurance premiums would increase by 20 to 25 percent in the first year of a repeal and would hit 50 percent after the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. Democrats seized on the new figures Tuesday, after rallies around the country opposing GOP plans to repeal and replace \"Obamacare.\" \"The CBO's nonpartisan report shows that Republicans' plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act will be nothing less than a nightmare for the American people,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan 's office pushed back against the CBO analysis, which focused on a partial repeal bill without a replacement or any administration actions, both of which Republicans say they plan to implement. \u201cThis projection is meaningless, as it takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by 'Obamacare,'\" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. Republicans agree on repealing and replacing \"Obamacare\" \u2014 in conjunction with executive actions and administrative rules to ease any transition \u2014 but are still divided on the timeline and details of any replacement effort. Ryan and Vice President\u2013elect Mike Pence have said \"Obamacare\" will be replaced within the first 100 days of the administration. Republicans also hope to hold a repeal vote as early as next month. Trump told The Washington Post his plan is \"very much formulated down to the final strokes\" and will be put forward after his pick for health and human services secretary, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., is confirmed. Aides to Republican leaders in the House and Senate have yet to see any details of Trump's plan. Republicans in the House and Senate adopted a budget measure last week to begin the \"Obamacare\" repeal process, directing the committees of jurisdiction to start crafting repeal language. Trump also told the Post, \"We're going to have insurance for everybody,\" closer to \"universal coverage\" than the \"universal access\" Hill Republicans say their plan will offer. Still, Republicans are downplaying any tension in their plans for health care. \"We are on the same page,\" Ryan said Monday in an interview with Wisconsin news station WISC-TV. \"We are all working on this together, working hand in glove with the new administration.\" ABC News' Jonathan Karl contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Photographs widely published in the Turkish media showed a bruised, black-haired man in a gray, bloodied shirt being held by his neck. NTV television said the gunman had resisted arrest.\u00a0 Hundreds of people were gathered at the swanky Reina nightclub to celebrate the end of a tumultuous 2016 only to become the first victims of 2017. The gunman shot a police officer and a civilian outside the club, before storming the premises. \u00a0\u00a0 Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim announced on Tuesday that \u201cthe vile terrorist\u201d who attacked the nightclub had been captured. Speaking to reporters in Ankara, he said the \u201cforces behind (the attack) would be revealed in time.\u201d Moments later, in separate remarks, Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin, gave a full portrait of the suspected killer and the efforts that went into securing his capture. Sahin named Masharipov, an Uzbek national who was born in 1983 and also operated under the alias Ebu Muhammed Horasani. Turkish media have reported the suspect\u2019s first name as Abdulgadir. Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency said Masharipov traveled to Afghanistan from his home country six years ago and claimed he was on a wanted list in Uzbekistan for membership in a terror group. The suspect, according to the governor of Istanbul, had trained in Afghanistan and was believed to have entered Turkey in January 2016. He described him as a highly educated terrorist who speaks four languages and had clearly carried out the attack in the name of ISIS. Masharipov, who was taken into custody late Monday, confessed to carrying out the massacre and his fingerprints matched those of the attacker, Gov. Sahin said. He can be held for up to 30 days under Turkey\u2019s state of emergency, which was introduced after a failed coup attempt in July, before he is charged and formally arrested. It could take prosecutors several months to prepare for a trial. The police operation to apprehend Masharipov drew on a review of 7,200 hours of security camera footage and about 2,200 tipoffs from the public. Police searched 152 addresses and 50 people were taken into custody. Authorities seized nearly $200,000, two guns and two drones during the suspect\u2019s arrest.\u00a0 ",

MSF hide caption toggle caption MSF A Nigerian military strike on a camp for internally displaced persons in northeast Nigeria has killed dozens of people, according to Doctors Without Borders. Teams from the organization, also known as M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, said in a statement that they've counted 52 dead and 120 wounded as a result of the strike on the camp in Rann. They're treating the injured and preparing to evacuate patients from the camp. The bombing was accidental and happened during an air force mission targeting Boko Haram insurgents in restive Borno State, according to tweets from Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari . I received with regret news that the Air Force,working to mop up BH insurgents, accidentally bombed a civilian community in Rann,Borno State \u2014 Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) January 17, 2017 \"This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,\" Dr. Jean-Cl\u00e9ment Cabrol, MSF director of operations, said in a statement. \"The safety of civilians must be respected.

As NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton has reported , up to 2.5 million people have been displaced from the fighting. \"This is the first time during Nigeria's three-year campaign against Boko Haram that the military has acknowledged a large number of civilians killed in a mistaken bombardment,\" according to The Washington Post . \"It remains unclear how the military could have mistaken a camp with 25,000 displaced people for a terrorist enclave.\" Buhari pledged the federal government's support \"in dealing with the situation and attending the victims.\" ",

(Photo: Eric Risberg, AP) One day after the Chicago Cubs jokingly \u201cpardoned\u201d President Obama for his White Sox fandom, the outgoing president issued a real pardon to baseball Hall of Famer Willie McCovey. McCovey was among the 273 commutations and pardons announced by Obama on Tuesday, as the president forgave \u00a0the San Francisco Giants legend\u2019s 1995 conviction on tax evasion charges. McCovey, along with Dodgers slugger Duke Snider, admitted to knowingly failing to report $70,000 \u00a0earned by signing autographs and participating in memorabilia shows between 1988 and 1990. He was sentenced in 1996 to two years of probation and fined $5,000. Obama greets champion Cubs: Sports bring us together McCovey, who marked his 79th birthday on Jan. 10, slugged 521 home runs over a 22-year career that began in 1959, the Giants\u2019 second year in San Francisco. He spent 18 of those seasons with the Giants, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986. He has had a series of health issues in recent years related to orthopedic procedures, and was hospitalized in 2014 to treat a serious infection.

    "text": "Jan. 17, 2017, 1:57 p.m. President Obama commutes sentence of Chelsea Manning Del Quentin Wilber Chelsea Manning. (Associated Press) President Obama has sharply reduced the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the U.S. Army private convicted of leaking thousands of classified reports to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. The president also pardoned a retired Marine Corps general, James E. Cartwright, who pleaded guilty in October\u00a0to lying to FBI agents about his discussions with reporters concerning secret U.S. efforts to damage Iran's nuclear program . In all, Obama commuted sentences for 209 individuals and issued 64 pardons. The most notable omission on the list was Edward Snowden, who sought refuge in Russia after leaking a vast trove of documents about U.S. surveillance systems at home and abroad. He has been charged with espionage, but has not been tried or convicted, and is considered a fugitive. Manning,\u00a0formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in August 2013 after she was convicted in military court of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and diplomatic records, cables and videos to WikiLeaks in 2010. She will now be released from military custody on May 17 to give her time to prepare for release and to make arrangements for a place to live, according to senior administration officials. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said each application for clement was received by the Department of Justice, reviewed by the White House counsel's office and approved by President Obama. \u201cThe deep concerns the intelligence community has expressed about WikiLeaks did not have any bearing on the president\u2019s decision to grant a commutation for Chelsea Manning,\u201d one official said. \u201cChelsea Manning accepted responsibility for crimes she committed, expressed remorse for committing these crimes,\u201d the official said. Also, the official said, Manning\u2019s sentence was longer than those given to individuals convicted of \u201ccomparable\u201d crimes. \u201cThe President continues to believe her actions were criminal and... harmed our national security,\u201d the official said. But she has served six years in prison and Obama \u201cbelieves that is sufficient and has decided to commute her sentence,\u201d the official said. Since has commuted prison sentences for 1,385 people, more than any other president and more commutations than the last 12 presidents combined. \u201cI\u2019m relieved and thankful that the president is doing the right thing and commuting Chelsea Manning\u2019s sentence,\u201d Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s LGBT Project representing Manning, said in a statement. \"Since she was first taken into custody, Chelsea has been subjected to long stretches of solitary confinement \u2014 including for attempting suicide \u2014 and has been denied access to medically necessary healthcare. This move could quite literally save Chelsea\u2019s life, and we are all better off knowing that Chelsea Manning will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many,\" he said.

Summer Zervos, a former contestant on the \"The Apprentice,\" said in a press conference with attorney Gloria Allred in Los Angeles on Tuesday that she filed the lawsuit over allegedly false statements Trump made in response to her accusation. Summer Zervos listens as her attorney Gloria Allred speaks during a news conference announcing the filing of a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump in Los Angeles, Calif., on Jan. 17, 2017. Mike Blake / Reuters The suit, filed Tuesday morning, claims Trump knew his statements about Zervos and his other accusers would subject them to \"threats of violence, economic harm and reputational damage.\" Allred said Zervos would be willing to dismiss the lawsuit without any monetary damages if Trump agreed to retract his comments about her and admit that the accusations against him were in fact true. \"Ms. Zervos is willing to dismiss her lawsuit if he will retract his false statements about her and acknowledge that what Summer said about Mr. Trump and his alleged conduct is and was the truth,\" she said. Related: The Allegations Women Have Made Against Donald Trump Zervos claimed in an October press conference that Trump sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions during a 2007 business meeting at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She said Trump made unwanted sexual advances toward her on multiple occasions during the meeting, kissing her on the lips, pressing himself against her and groping her breast and body without her consent. Trump has vehemently denied the claims. In response to Tuesday's press conference, Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks provided the following statement to NBC News: \"More of the same from Gloria Allred. There is no truth to this absurd story.\" On the campaign trail, Trump said Zervos and his other accusers were liars, according to the lawsuit, and that she and the other women were motivated to come forward by the promise of \"ten minutes of fame.\" \"In doing so, he used his national and international bully pulpit to make false factual statements to denigrate and verbally attack Ms. Zervos and the other women who publicly reported his sexual assaults in October 2016,\" the lawsuit said.

While some of the 54 made their decision in previous weeks, many more have come forward in recent days, citing the president-elect's perceived insult of Rep. John Lewis as the final straw. Trump lashed out at the civil rights icon Saturday morning after Lewis said in a Friday interview he didn't view Trump as \"a legitimate president.\" Lewis, a Georgia Democrat from an Atlanta-area district who protested alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also said he would not attend the inauguration. \" Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,\" Trump tweeted Saturday morning. \"All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!\" Trump's comments have drawn outrage and messages of support for Lewis from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Yvette Clark, D-N.Y., said in a tweet Saturday that she would not attend the inauguration because of the comments, saying, \"When you insult @repjohnlewis, you insult America.\" I will NOT attend the inauguration of @realDonaldTrump . When you insult @repjohnlewis , you insult America. \u2014 Yvette D. Clarke (@RepYvetteClarke) January 14, 2017 Democratic Reps. Mark Takano and Judy Chu, both of California, also tweeted Saturday they would be absent as a show of solidarity with Lewis, making them part of the more than one-quarter of House Democrats who plan to skip the ceremony. (SEE FULL LIST BELOW) \"All talk, no action.\" \u2014 Mark Takano (@RepMarkTakano) January 14, 2017 After much thought, I have decided to #StandWithJohnLewis and not attend the inauguration. \u2014 Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) January 15, 2017 Also, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., wrote in a statement released Saturday that \"while [he does] not dispute that Trump won the Electoral College , [he] cannot normalize his behavior or the disparaging and un-American statements he has made.\" \"Trump \u2014 who lost the popular vote \u2014 has made a series of racist, sexist and bigoted statements,\" Lieu continued. \"In addition, he has attacked Gold Star parents, veterans such as John McCain and now civil rights icon John Lewis.\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin reflected such sentiments in a statement released Sunday morning. \"I was planning on attending the inauguration on Friday out of respect for the office of president, while still making it back home on Saturday to attend the Women's March in Madison,\" he said. \"However, after long consideration based on reading the classified document on Russian hacking and the Trump candidacy on Thursday, the handling of his conflicts of interest and this weekend's offensive tweets about a national hero Rep. John Lewis, I am no longer attending the event.\" Several more representatives announced their absence at the inauguration on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and referred to Lewis. \"President-elect Trump, you have the undeniable right to take issue and disagree with John Lewis' opinion about the legitimacy of the election results,\" Rep. Anthony Brown, a Democrat from Maryland, wrote on Facebook Monday. \"But Mr. Trump, you need to think carefully about disparaging a civil rights icon such as John Lewis, let alone anyone exercising their freedom of expression that many of us fought for.\" Reps. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., and John Conyers, D-Mich., did not explicitly mention Lewis in their announcements Saturday but did go public with their decisions on the day of Trump's tweets. Among those who decided earlier this month not to attend the inauguration, the most common reason was an aversion to normalizing what they see as Trump's divisive rhetoric and agenda. \"When the new president denigrates Latinos or Mexicans or immigrants as drug dealers and criminals, I want to be able to say I did not condone or allow that type of speech to go mainstream. That was not normalized on my watch,\" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said in a speech on the House floor Jan. 10. \"Because the future president said the American-born children of immigrants were not capable of being American judges, I cannot sit there at his inauguration as if that is OK and I forgive him.\" Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said on Twitter on Jan. 5 she didn't believe she could \"contribute to the normalization of the president-elect's divisive rhetoric by participating in the inauguration.\" My statement on the upcoming inauguration: pic.twitter.com/dQXE0ztvTf \u2014 Katherine Clark (@RepKClark) January 5, 2017 Several of the Congress members plan to attend the Women's March on Washington; others said they will participate in community organizing in their home districts.

The nonpartisan federal agency also found that health insurance premiums would spike another 20 to 25 percent, according to the new report. Within 10 years, 32 million more people would be without health insurance, the CBO projects. Julian Gomez (R) explains Obamacare to people at a health insurance enrolment event in Commerce, California March 31, 2014. Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Without a replacement, health care costs overall would continue to rise every year, as would the number of people going without health insurance. Premiums would continue to go up, as well. The report's projections are based on the repeal law passed in the House of Representatives last year. That bill would use the same process that Congress is working on now to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act \u2014 a budget-based process called reconciliation. Related: On Brink of Repeal, Obamacare has Never Been More Popular It assumes some of the more popular provisions of Obamacare would stay in place, such as the measures that stop health insurance companies from capping coverage, for instance, and the rule that allows adult children to stay on their parents' policies until age 26. \u201cPremiums in the non-group market would be roughly 20 percent to 25 percent higher than under current law.\u201d It looks at what would happen with repeal of the mandate \u2014 the rule that everyone get health insurance somewhere \u2014 along with a repeal of the federal support for expanding Medicaid to more people. While the mandate is unpopular, insurance companies insisted that it be part of the ACA. They argue, and health policy experts agree, that without some kind of requirement, many people would wait until they were sick to buy health insurance. Related: Five Things You May Not Know About Obamacare With no mandate, many insurance companies would just stop offering policies to individuals, the CBO projects. \"As a consequence, roughly 10 percent of the population would be living in an area that had no insurer participating in the non-group market,\" the CBO said. And the rest would raise premiums. \"Premiums in the non-group market would be roughly 20 percent to 25 percent higher than under current law,\" the CBO reported. Related: Obamacare Repeal Would Raise Deficit, CBO Finds Most Americans get health insurance through an employer and the report doesn't address them, although a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act would have some effect on that insurance. The main focus of the Affordable Care Act was to get health insurance to the millions of Americans who didn't have it by creating a new non-group market and by expanding Medicaid. Because health insurance is regulated by states, each state had to have its own individual mix of insurance companies and policies on offer. \u201cThe number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new plan year following enactment of the bill.\u201d To make the policies more affordable, the law offered generous federal subsidies to help people pay their premiums. Repeal would take away those subsidies and cause the market to collapse, the report says. Related: Tough Choices to Make With Obamacare Repeal And the federal government pays most of the cost of expanding Medicaid, which is a joint state-federal health insurance plan for people with low incomes and the disabled. Repeal would take away those federal dollars. \"The number of people who are uninsured would increase by 18 million in the first new plan year following enactment of the bill,\" the report said. \"Later, after the elimination of the ACA's expansion of Medicaid eligibility and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, that number would increase to 27 million, and then to 32 million in 2026,\" the CBO continued. More than 20 million people who were uninsured received health insurance through the ACA's provisions. While premiums on the Obamacare exchanges did go up by an average of 22 percent this year, a recent report found that was an expected adjustment because the premiums were artificially low the year before. It's not entirely clear how repeal will proceed . Neither President-elect Trump nor the GOP leaders in Congress have released details about how they plan to move forward, or what might replace the 2010 law. Maggie Fox ",

Trump Nation says 'Democrats, heal thyself' Rick Hampson , USA TODAY Published 4:07 p.m. ET Jan. 17, 2017 | Updated 1 hour ago Supporters cheer as President-elect Donald Trump arrives to speak in Mobile, Ala., on Dec. 17, 2016. (Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images) \u201cIn Defeat: Defiance. In Victory: Magnanimity.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Winston S. Churchill \u201cHappy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Donald J. Trump At inauguration time, magnanimity usually prevails. Winners reach out to losers and a brief honeymoon ensues. But\u00a0many Trump supporters say there\u2019s little this president-elect can, should, or probably will do to mollify Hillary Clinton supporters. Erwin Jackson, a Tallahassee, Fla., landlord, says political healing is overrated anyway: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about people who are disappointed. I\u2019m excited. The Democrats are in denial. Healing is something they\u2019re gonna have to work out on their own.\u2019\u2019 Pat Acciavatti, a retired excavating company owner in St. Clair Township, Mich., agrees: \u201cWhen Obama won, and when Bill Clinton won, I just shut up, hung my head and took my medicine. I wasn\u2019t protesting in the street.\u2019\u2019 Both are members of Trump Nation, an array of Trump voters in all 50 states who\u2019ve spoken with the USA TODAY Network . Although Trump inherits a more divided country than any recent predecessor, he seems less interested than any in making nice. And that\u2019s OK with Trump Nation, which generally believes there are only two remedies to the post-election divide. One is time. \u201cIt heals all wounds,\u2019\u2019 says Barry Fixler, a Bardonia, N.Y., jewelry store owner who opened his own local Trump headquarters last year. But, he predicts, \u201cit\u2019ll take the Democrats years to come around.\u2019\u2019 The other is for Trump to do what he said he\u2019ll do \u2014 like bring back jobs, secure the Southern border and generally make America great again. \u201cThat\u2019s going to promote more positive interactions between the two camps,\u2019\u2019 says Rachel Quade, a real estate agent and Republican activist who lives outside Indianapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay angry when there\u2019s good news.\u2019\u2019 Read more: Meet the key players in the Trump White House Gene Dunn of Medford, N.Y., so ardent a Trump admirer that he took his son out of school last year to go see Trump announce his candidacy, says the new president also can unite the nation by \u201cfinding common ground on issues that\u00a0transcend ideological lines.\u2019\u2019 One example: Move the Super Bowl to Saturday or to Sunday of Presidents Day weekend, so revelers won\u2019t have work the next day. Presidents always come into office with an agenda and a mandate. As Barack Obama famously told Republican congressional leaders eight years ago, \u201cElections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won.\u2019\u2019 But winning candidates usually make at least a show of bipartisanship. In 2000, after Al Gore conceded the presidency, George W. Bush made a nationally televised speech from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives. \u201cHere, in a place where Democrats have the majority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe spirit of cooperation I have seen in this hall is what\u2019s needed in Washington.\u2019\u2019 In 2009, Obama attended a dinner honoring John McCain, the GOP nominee, on the night before the inauguration, and he spoke warmly of McCain at a luncheon after the inauguration. Read more: Since Trump has the lowest approval rating of any recent incoming president , it would seem logical for him to try to mend fences. At times he has. He spoke graciously of Clinton after she conceded defeat and said \u201cit's time for America to bind the wounds of division.\u2019\u2019 In a Today show interview last month, he promised, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a country that\u2019s very well-healed.\u2019\u2019 But for the most part \u2014 especially on Twitter, and unlike any recent president-elect \u2014 he\u2019s stayed in campaign mode. He\u2019s lashed out at Bill Clinton, the cast of Hamilton, Alec Baldwin and Saturday Night Live, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. He\u2019s called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who expressed a willingness to work with him, a \u201cclown.\u201d Since praising Hillary Clinton, he\u2019s regularly dismissed her as weak and clueless. Some Trump supporters say their leader is really no less bipartisan than any other victorious presidential candidate \u2014 especially Obama. Upon taking office, Jackson says, \u201che went off so far, so fast to the left. He passed Obamacare with no Republican support.\u2019\u2019 Others would just as soon Trump hit Democrats with an olive branch as offer them one. His nine-state, post-election victory tour was marked by cries, familiar from the campaign against Clinton, of \u201cLock her up!\u2019\u2019 When Trump supporters encounter these political divisions in their own lives, however, they tend to deal with them more sensitively. Fixler says he gets along with his Clinton-voter daughter by not talking politics. Jackson keeps the peace with his mother-in-law by agreeing to disagree. Lora Hubbel of Vermillion, S.D., jokingly told her daughter she didn\u2019t want to know how she voted, because if she knew she\u2019d voted for Clinton, she\u2019d have to rewrite her will. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump take part in the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2016, in Hempstead, N.Y. \u00a0(Photo: Timothy A. Clary, AFP/Getty Images) But sometimes silence, diplomacy or ignorance aren\u2019t enough. Trump voter Jeff Lau says the election almost cost him a friend. On Nov. 9 the two were at the brewpub Lau owns in York, Pa., for their usual Wednesday night cornhole game. Lau was ribbing his buddy, who\u2019d voted for Clinton. But the guy was distraught, and said he was worried about Trump starting a war. Lau told him he was \u201cacting kooky.\u2019\u2019 The next thing he knew, the pal had walked out. Lau had to call him the next day: \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry if I embarrassed you. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 But Trump supporters say making up isn\u2019t their man\u2019s style, and wouldn\u2019t work anyway. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking on the whole Democratic Party and an entrenched bureaucracy, saying \u2018Please,\u2019 probably won\u2019t change things,\u2019\u2019 says Jackson. And he'd better think twice before making concessions.\u00a0\u201cThat would anger the hell out of me!\u2019\u2019 says Hubbel, who describes herself as a born-again Christian. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignored, put down and railroaded, and he\u2019s slapping us in the face if he does that. Backing off is disrespectful to the people who elected you!\u2019\u2019 So campaign passions remain hot. Although Gene Dunn calls for finding common ground, he also thinks that Trump, immediately after taking office, should sit at a table on the Capitol podium and revoke the Affordable Care Act and some executive orders. His rationale: \u201cObama openly mocked Trump and his candidacy. What better way for Trump to exact political revenge than to unexpectedly humiliate him in front of the world with billions watching on TV?\u2019\u2019 Healing may be a long time coming.

Markeith Loyd is accused of shooting his pregnant ex-girlfriend and an Orlando police officer. (Orlando Police Department) Caitlin Doornbos Contact Reporter A suspect in the killing of an Orlando, Fla., police officer has been captured after a nine-day manhunt. Markeith Loyd, 41, was taken into custody Tuesday shortly after his name was added to the U.S. Marshals Service's most-wanted fugitives list, said\u00a0Orlando Police Chief John Mina. \"We've got him! Markeith Loyd in OPD custody,\" the Orlando Police Department tweeted. \"Details to come.\" Loyd has been wanted since Dec. 13, when investigators say he fatally shot his pregnant former girlfriend, Sade Dixon, 24, and injured her brother when he rushed to help her. Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton was in pursuit of a suspect when she was slain on Jan. 9. Mina said Loyd was in custody and wearing Clayton's handcuffs. Video showed Loyd, in red pants, a gray shirt and his hands cuffed behind his back, being pulled from an Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office vehicle. He was then pushed into law enforcement headquarters by more than half a dozen law enforcement officers, some of them deputies in green uniforms, others in plain clothes with masks over their faces. Loyd exclaimed, \"They beat me up! They beat me up!\" to nearby cameras as law enforcement took him into\u00a0the\u00a0building for questioning Tuesday night. His bloodied face appeared badly beaten with two swollen eyes. Mina flashed a wide smile to journalists. \"This is a man who gunned down a pregnant woman and a police officer who was doing her job to protect our community,\" Mina said. Sheriff's Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis \u00a0was killed in a traffic accident Jan. 9 during the search. There was a $125,000 reward for information leading to Loyd's arrest. The Marshals Service added another $25,000 Tuesday. The Orange County Sheriff's Office thanked citizens on Twitter \"for their care and concern.\" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer thanked law enforcement on Twitter for capturing the accused killer.\u00a0 Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs also expressed pride and excitement. \"Manhunt has ended! Continued prayers for the families of Lt Debra Clayton and DFC Norm Lewis,\" Jacobs tweeted. \"Great work by our heroes in law enforcement!\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss What the Chinese zodiac says about inauguration day ; Trump's popularity has dropped ; site of Aliso Canyon gas leak \u00a0can reopen; researchers are using lasers to hijack the brains of mice .

    "text": "<p>A man walks past Ebenezer Baptist Church, early Monday, Jan. 16, 2017, in Atlanta, before the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday commemorative service.&nbsp;</p> Close AP Photo/Branden Camp ATLANTA - Scott Shepherd didn\u2019t fire the shot that killed Martin Luther King Jr., but the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon says he has always felt remorse toward the family of the slain civil rights leader and all who honor his legacy. He reached for atonement Monday evening, sitting on a dais next to Bernice King, who was 5 years old when James Earl Ray assassinated her father in 1968. \u201cI want to extend an apology to the King family and everyone out there,\u201d Shepherd said, opening a discussion of race relations at the Atlanta center that bears the elder King\u2019s name. \u201cI, in my past, did a lot of terrible things. I said a lot of terrible things about Dr. King. I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d What can we learn about Trump from his feud with John Lewis? Bernice King, who acknowledged \u201chating white people\u201d as a young woman, accepted Shepherd\u2019s apology. It was the pinnacle of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day that laid bare intense social tensions as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office Friday, yet also offered potential avenues to achieve King\u2019s vision of a just society. Trump did not publicly participate in any King observances. The holiday came amid the fallout from a public tiff between Trump and civil rights icon John Lewis , an exchange that incensed many African-Americans already leery of Trump after a racially charged campaign. In New York, King Day observers cast establishment leaders as Klan successors. \u201cWhen men no better than Klansmen dressed in suits are being sworn into office, we cannot be silent,\u201d Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi said at a Brooklyn gathering. Father Michael Plfeger, the man Bernice King invited to serve as keynote speaker at the Monday morning service at her father\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, sounded similar themes. He delivered a 45-minute indictment of the nation\u2019s social and economic structure and warned it would get worse under Trump. \u201cPlantations still exist,\u201d Pfleger said. \u201cAnd too often, white hoods have been replaced by three-piece suits in this country.\u201d For her part, Bernice King warned of a nation \u201cdangerously polarized\u201d along the lines of race and class. \u201cWe are headed to race riots if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep this divisiveness going.\u201d She expressed concerns about Trump, who had met earlier in the day with her brother, Martin Luther King III. After that private session at Trump Tower in New York, King III said Trump pledged to be an inclusive president even as he stands firm in his spat with Lewis. The Georgia congressman initially called Trump \u201cillegitimate,\u201d prompting the president-elect to declare on Twitter that Lewis, who was beaten during the civil rights movement, was \u201call talk\u201d and \u201cno action.\u201d How far have we come on the arc of justice? Bernice King said Trump has demonstrated \u201cwhat kind of man he is\u201d and said any transformation is up to God. Changing the nation, she said, rests with people like Shepherd and Daryl Davis, a black musician and author who has made a second career out of befriending Klansmen and leading them to renounce their racist views. \u201cWhen two enemies are talking, they aren\u2019t fighting,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s when the talking ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence.\u201d Minutes earlier, he had unfurled a robe and held aloft the hood of a man he said was once an Imperial Wizard of the Klan, supervising multiple states until he met Davis and eventually abandoned his racist views. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination that Trump won , told the same crowd it\u2019s not productive to focus on national leaders like Trump. \u201cThe problems we have in society today are right here in our own neighborhoods,\u201d he said. Kasich\u2019s approach highlights some differences among those who tout King\u2019s legacy. Pfleger, a self-described radical priest from Chicago, said the United States must dismantle systems of oppression through collective political action. Another failed presidential candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, noted that King, beyond being a racial justice advocate, was an economic radical who angered the political establishment. If there is a shared conclusion among activists, it is perhaps that realizing King\u2019s vision involves both personal conversion and collective action, in neighborhoods and in the halls of power. Kasich noted that national politicians, even with their limitations, control resources and react to grassroots leaders like King. Activist Chris Crass, who is white, explained that he reaches out not to avowed white supremacists, but to whites who don\u2019t see themselves as part of the problem. The idea, he said, isn\u2019t to make them feel guilty, but to convince them that U.S. power brokers for generations have divided working-class whites against poor blacks as a means to maintain power. Understanding those \u201ceconomic and political realities\u201d would enable a new, powerful social and political coalition, he said. As to whether that can occur under Trump, Davis, the man who befriends and converts Klansman, said he\u2019s optimistic. Trump, he said, \u201chas brought all this out,\u201d regardless of whether he intended to do so.\u00a0 Davis said many Americans assumed - or convinced themselves - that bigotry was over with Barack Obama\u2019s election as the first black president. \u201cWe have been in denial about racism in this country,\u201d Davis said, \u201cand you cannot address what you cannot see.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Attorney Gloria Allred, left, accompanies her client Summer Zervos at a news conference announcing Zervos' lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump. (Valerie Macon / AFP/Getty Images) Hailey Branson-Potts Contact Reporter A former contestant on TV's \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on Tuesday filed a defamation lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump , whom she has accused of making unwanted sexual advances toward her. Summer Zervos announced the lawsuit at a downtown Los Angeles news conference with her attorney, Gloria Allred, three days before Trump's inauguration. Zervos, who appeared on the fifth season of the reality show, said Trump had tried to seduce her at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007, kissing her on the mouth without her consent and pressing himself against her. In October, she tearfully described darting around a hotel room to avoid physical contact with Trump, even as she sought employment from him. Zervos said she felt compelled\u00a0to go public with the accusations after seeing recordings on the set of \"Access Hollywood\" that had been released days earlier, in which Trump made crude comments about grabbing women by the genitals.\u00a0 \"For the first time, Summer Zervos saw Mr. Trump's behavior towards her for what it was: a sexual predator who had preyed on her and other women,\" the suit says. On Tuesday, Allred said her client had voluntarily taken a lie detector test regarding the allegations and had passed. The suit was filed in\u00a0New York. \u201cMore of the same from Gloria Allred,\u201d Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said of the lawsuit\u00a0in an email to The Times. \u201cThere is no truth to this absurd story.\u201d In October, Trump denied\u00a0Zervos\u2019 allegations and said he \u201cvaguely\u201d recalled her from the reality-television show he hosted for more than a decade. \"To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life,\u201d Trump said in a statement . Days later, Trump threatened to sue women who had accused him of sexual assault. \"Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\" Trump said during a speech. \"Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\"\u00a0 Zervos\u2019 lawsuit says Trump \u201cused his national and international bully pulpit\u201d to disparage Zervos and other accusers and that he \u201cknew that his false, disparaging statements would be heard and read by people around the world, and that these women \u2026\u00a0would be subjected to threats of violence, economic harm, and reputational damage.\u201d In a November news conference after Trump won the election, Zervos called on Trump to retract his statements about her. She said Tuesday that she would dismiss the lawsuit if Trump did so.\u00a0 \"I would still be willing to dismiss my case against him immediately for no monetary compensation if he will simply retract his false and defamatory statements about me and acknowledge that I told the truth about him,\" Zervos said. Allred said the suit opens the possibility that Trump will be forced to testify under oath and that recordings and video from \"The Apprentice\" could be subpoenaed.\u00a0 Zervos gave Trump two months to retract his statements about her, Allred said, and the timing of the suit the week of the inauguration came simply because his \"time is up.\" \"This was in Mr. Trump's hands,\" Allred said. \"This lawsuit did not need to be filed.\" The suit says Zervos suffered emotionally and financially from Trump\u2019s statements about her after she made her accusations public. \u201cBeing branded a liar who came forward only for fame or at the manipulation of the [Hillary] Clinton campaign has been painful and demoralizing,\u201d the lawsuit states.\u00a0 Allred said she and Zervos, and possibly other Trump accusers, will be in Washington, D.C., for the Women's March on Washington.

The study projected that the spending-revenue imbalance will put \u201cthe federal government on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path.\u201d Without any changes to spending patterns, debt could expand to three times gross domestic product by 2090, according to the GAO, the government watchdog agency.\u00a0 Government Accountability Office After six years of shrinking deficits, the GAO said, the red ink increased to $587 billion in fiscal year 2016 (ending last Sept. 30), with U.S. debt held by the public at about $14.2 trillion. \u201cThese figures are only expected to grow,\u201d the report said. The primary causes are growing spending on entitlements -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, largely due to the population\u2019s aging -- and ever-higher interest on the national debt, the GAO said. Among the economic effects of expanding the nation\u2019s balance sheet is higher debt. That would put pressure on the rest of the federal budget, restricting lawmakers\u2019 ability to respond to unforseen events and increasing the likelihood of another financial crisis. ",

Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times In transitions past, Washington has filled with talk of Georgetown parties and the first lady\u2019s ball gown, and how the city\u2019s culture might change. When President Carter left, the capital traded a Georgia peanut farmer and Navy-trained nuclear engineer for an actor turned politician from California, Ronald Reagan. Bill Clinton brought a touch of Arkansas. George W. Bush ushered in Texas swagger and cowboy boots, and made McLean, where General Hayden lives, the hot neighborhood for that era\u2019s Republican elite . The Obamas honored Stevie Wonder at the White House, and brought in African-American art and culture. They made the city, where blacks now account for 49 percent of the population \u2014 down from 60 percent in 2000, a decline that reflects gentrification \u2014 their own. In black neighborhoods, Michelle Obama will be missed, perhaps more than her husband. (They are not going far. They have rented a lavish home in Kalorama , an exclusive section of the city where Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, will also live .) Advertisement Continue reading the main story But with his wife, Melania, and son Barron keeping their primary residence at Trump Tower in New York at least until the school year is out, Mr. Trump may not be spending much time here. That is fine with Mark Salter, a former aide to (and book co-author with) Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s nemesis on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe less he\u2019s here the better, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Mr. Salter said. Movement conservatives, though, are ecstatic. After eight years in the policy wilderness, scholars at the Heritage Foundation, a policy organization, are helping guide the new Trump administration on ideas and personnel. \u201cFolks were pretty happy,\u201d said Wesley Denton, the Heritage spokesman, when Mr. Trump gave them a shout-out during his recent news conference. But in Democratic policy circles there is little lightness this time around. Neera Tanden, a former adviser and strong ally of Mrs. Clinton, has little patience for questions about the city\u2019s mood. She now leads the Center for American Progress, a leading progressive think tank, a job that makes her a de facto leader of the Democratic resistance. \u201cHe\u2019s going to deport undocumented people,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cHow Washington responds is low on the totem pole of problems with this administration.\u201d The unease also runs especially deep among those General Hayden calls \u201cRepublican internationalists,\u2019\u2019 who advocate engagement with other nations but possess a hawkish suspicion of Russian and Chinese intentions. Having described Mr. Trump as Russia\u2019s \u201cuseful fool,\u201d the general, 71, would never be offered a job. But with Mr. Trump openly questioning the \u201chigh confidence judgment\u201d by the C.I.A. about Russian hacking, he has been entertaining a steady stream of visitors wary of joining the new administration. \u201cI say, \u2018Yeah, by all means, if the president-elect asks you to serve, consider it seriously,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t think of it as a lifetime commitment; you remain a free agent.\u2019\u2019 If there is a historical parallel to this moment, it may be to President Reagan, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former Reagan chief of staff. He recalled how liberal Reagan critics sniffed, \u201cHow do you trust this actor with his finger on the nuclear trigger?\u201d conveniently forgetting he had been a two-term governor of California. (Mr. Trump, by contrast, has never held public office.) And if the denizens of the swamp appear to be in some kind of defensive crouch, Mr. Duberstein says, there is perhaps good reason for that: \u201cDonald is saying there\u2019s a new sheriff in town.\u201d Twitter: @SherylNYT ",

Gregory Pratt Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Holding Puerto Rican flags and \"Free Oscar Lopez-Rivera\" signs, dozens of community members and former revolutionaries on Tuesday filled a small Humboldt Park community theater. The impromptu celebration came just hours after President Barack Obama commuted Lopez' prison sentence for his role in an organization that in the 1970s and early '80s plotted bombings, prison escapes and armed robberies in an effort to secure independence for Puerto Rico. \"Obama finally listened and let Oscar out of prison,\" sang the crowd, which alternated between the joyous chant and \"Que bonita bandera,\" Spanish for \"what a beautiful flag.\" In addition to community members and political organizers, two of Lopez' siblings turned out to celebrate, as did former FALN members who had spent time in prison. Lopez' brother, Jose E. Lopez, said the commutation has \"historical significance.\" commuted the sentence of Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera and said he would play Alexander Hamilton at a Chicago performance for Lopez Rivera. \"I wish I was with every Puerto... \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda said he was \"sobbing with gratitude\" about the news that President Obama\u00a0 commuted the sentence of Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera and said he would play Alexander Hamilton at a Chicago performance for Lopez Rivera. \"I wish I was with every Puerto... (Tracy Swartz) With Obama's commutation, Lopez, 74, will leave prison by May 17. In recent years, his cause had been taken up by pop culture figures, religious leaders and political luminaries. Former President Jimmy Carter, Pope Francis and U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois' 4th district supported his release, as did South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Reaction to Tuesday's action by Obama, one of more than 200 commutations granted by the president on Tuesday, went well beyond Chicago. \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda in a tweet from London said he was \"sobbing with gratitude\" after learning that Obama had commuted Lopez's sentence. Miranda said he would reprise his role as Alexander Hamilton at a Chicago performance for Lopez. \"I wish I was with every Puerto Rican in Chicago right now,\" Miranda tweeted Tuesday. Lopez was a leader of FALN, an acronym for the Spanish translation of the Armed Forces of National Liberation. He was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Chicago in 1981 of weapons, explosives and seditious conspiracy charges, and sentenced to 55 years in prison. He received an additional 15 years in 1988 after he was convicted of plotting to escape from federal prison. FALN's goal was a free and socialist Puerto Rico. The group was primarily active in New York and Chicago and claimed responsibility for more than 140 bombings since 1974. Authorities connected five deaths to the bomb blasts. Another 100 people were maimed as a result of the bombings, authorities said. The group's most notorious bombing occurred at New York's landmark Fraunces Tavern in 1975. Four people were killed and more than 60 injured. Lopez was not convicted of any role in that attack, but some still hold him responsible because of his ties to the ultranationalist group. \"I'm willing to forgive, but he never once said he was sorry, showed no remorse at all,\" said Mary Connor Tully, whose husband, Frank Connor, was killed in the bombing. \"He's an old man and he'll get to live his life free, and hopefully he can live with the sins he committed, and that he'll answer one day to a higher power than us for what he did.\" FALN members and their supporters said those put behind bars by the U.S. government were prisoners of war and questioned the country's jurisdiction to prosecute them. Lopez had been a federal fugitive for five years when he was caught by police in north suburban Glenview on a routine traffic violation. Federal authorities had charged him in 1977 in connection with 16 Chicago area bombings. At Lopez' sentencing in 1981, a federal judge called him an \"unrehabilitated revolutionary.\" Lopez declined to be present at his sentencing or many previous court sessions. Lopez was the last remaining FALN member still in prison. Lopez in 1999 rejected President Bill Clinton 's conditional offer for a reduced sentence. Edwin Cortes, 61, who spent more than a decade in prison before Clinton commuted his sentence in 1999, was at Tuesday's celebration in Humboldt Park and called Lopez' release a \"great victory for our movement.\" Lopez' lawyer, Jan Susler, said Tuesday she was \"elated\" by the president's decision. \"I think all of Oscar's co-defendants have been involved in his campaign for release, and they all felt less than whole without him,\" Susler said. \"This now completes the cycle and it's really marvelous.\" ",

USA TODAY NETWORK General Motors' truck plant in Wentzville Assembly plant in Missouri (Photo: Melissa Vaeth for General Motors) What started as a trickle of companies boasting about their plans to boost their U.S. employees has become a cascade -- all appearing to be aimed at currying favor with President-elect Donald Trump. General Motors and Walmart were the latest to join up Tuesday, each announcing plans to add thousands of jobs in the U.S., retain plants or cancel plans to move jobs to Mexico. They join a bevy of others, from air-conditioning maker Carrier and wireless service provider Sprint\u00a0to online retailing giant Amazon. But while such declarations seem to work magic when it comes to attracting supportive tweets from Trump, they call into question whether companies are actually changing direction away from expanding in other countries and are now focusing their job-creation efforts on the U.S. Economists and others paying close attention as corporations have portrayed themselves as showing\u00a0a renewed interest in the U.S.\u00a0since the presidential election see a mixed picture. \"There is some substance that is colored by smoke and mirrors,\" says Harley Shaiken, a University of California, Berkeley professor who follows labor issues and globalization. \"It's really both going on.\" GM to invest $1 billion in U.S. after pressure from Trump Many of the announcements about job creation in the U.S. cover plans that were already in the works, for instance, in late December, Sprint announced that it was creating or bringing back to the U.S. 5,000 new jobs, part of a commitment that Sprint owner SoftBank had previously made. And while the numbers of positions\u00a0being created sound great, they pale in comparison to the jobs lost over the years. GM announced it will add 7,000 information technology and manufacturing jobs in the U.S., which is a lot by any measure, but compares to a current hourly workforce of 56,000. In 1979, the Associated Press reports, GM's U.S. workforce peaked above 618,000.\u00a0GM's manufacturing\u00a0jobs, as represented by the United Auto Workers union, start at $27.79 an hour under the latest contract. Walmart said it will create 10,000 new retail jobs in the U.S. this year, but that's a\u00a0fraction of the company's U.S. workforce of roughly1.5 million. Walmart's starting wage is about $9 an hour. They join other companies that stepped up as well, often with similar, bittersweet news. For instance, while Amazon has said it would create 100,000 jobs in the United States in 2017, most are\u00a0low-paying warehouse jobs that offer little job security. Amazon on average pays its warehouse employees 15% less than the average wage of other warehouse workers in the same region, according to Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit advocacy group that works on sustainable community development. Most of the jobs\u00a0had already been\u00a0announced in the local markets where the warehouses are located. Walmart to boost U.S. job count by 10,000 \u201cGiven that there\u2019s no real news here, one certainly has to wonder if Amazon's announcement is mainly aimed at currying favor with President-elect Trump,\" Mitchell says. Corporations are making their announcements largely out of fear, wanting to avoid being scolded\u00a0in Trump's tweets the way that Ford Motor was singled out for expanding in Mexico during the presidential campaign. (Sure enough, Ford found itself back in Trump's good graces\u00a0on Twitter this month by canceling plans for a $1.6-billion plant in Mexico). \"No company wants to be in the Trump crosshairs,\" says author and researcher Alan Tonelsen,\u00a0founder of the RealityChek blog who has written extensively on labor issues. \"Big multinational companies hate bad publicity.\" The spin may be creating the reality, he says, rather than vice versa.\u00a0As the announcements pile up, it is creating a climate where companies realize they move jobs offshore at their own peril. In the case of automobiles, the mere threat of imposing 35% tariffs has been enough to entice\u00a0companies\u00a0to wave the\u00a0flag. The question becomes whether the Trump factor will continue to be enough to compel companies to keep up the \"Made in the USA\" patter.  Some are already lining up to say they've seen enough. \"I do not believe it will be feasible or represent good policy for the president to strong-arm individual companies into making business decisions that are not in their best economic interests,\" says Michael Farr, CEO of Farr, Miller & Washington, a money-management firm. No matter what side you're on, what we've seen so far is likely just the beginning. \"This is the opening salvo,\" says Josh Bivens, research director for the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank. \"We will be seeing much more coming out of the Trump administration.\" Contributing: Adam Shell, Elizabeth Weise, Ed Baig, Brent Snavely 9 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k2iB0O NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Betsy DeVos, nominee for education secretary, poses for a photo before a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Dec. 1, 2016, in Washington, D.C. (Tom Williams / Congressional Quarterly / Newscom / TNS) Danielle Douglas-GabrielThe Washington Post Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos and her husband have extensive financial holdings through their private investment and management firm, RDV Corporation. The firm, where DeVos once served as director, has financed real estate acquisitions, telecom companies and online charter schools, among other things. But one particular deal is creating concern on Capitol Hill. RDV is affiliated with LMF WF Portfolio, a limited liability corporation listed in regulatory filings as one of several firms involved in a $147 million loan to Performant Financial Corp., a debt collection agency in business with the Education Department. Twenty-three percent of Performant's revenue is directly tied to its dealings with the Education Department, which awarded the company 14 contracts worth more than $20 million in 2016, according to regulatory filings and government documents. The company lost out on a recent contract bid with the department and is now protesting the decision with the Government Accountability Office, which can dismiss the dispute if the department reverses course. More national politics coverage Open link If confirmed as secretary, DeVos would be in a position to influence the award of debt collection, servicing and recovery contracts, in addition to the oversight and monitoring of the contracts. She would also have the authority to revise payments and fees to contractors for rehabilitating past-due debt -- all of which has Senate Democrats concerned. An investment fund formed by the DeVos corporation, Ottawa Avenue Private Capital, is listed as the resident agent for LMF WF, which shares the same address as companies run by the DeVos family. A resident agent handles much of the official business of a fund, such as receiving official documents for a business, and may even have a stake in the fund. RDV senior executives, some of whom head up Ottawa Avenue, did not respond to requests for comment. A senior Democratic aide who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak publicly said Performant is one example of a company with possible connections to DeVos that could lead to conflicts of interest should she be confirmed. Senate Democrats have been urging full financial disclosures and the completion of an Office of Government Ethics review before DeVos is confirmed. Here are the people who have been nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. Democrats have pressed top Republicans on the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee to postpone DeVos's confirmation hearing until the ethics office wraps up its vetting. DeVos, a billionaire Republican with no professional experience in schools, has vast wealth and tremendous financial holdings. Though her hearing was pushed back by a week, to Tuesday, the ethics office said the review is still underway. \"Senators will have the opportunity Tuesday to get Betsy's views on the department's decision pertaining to Performant Financial Corp.,\" said Ed Patru, spokesman for Friends of Betsy DeVos. \"The purpose of independent reviews is to identify, among other things, potential conflicts of interest with respect to investments and holdings, and we have full confidence OGE will perform its function relative to Betsy DeVos and her family, just as it has done with scores of other nominees over the years.\" Performant, which declined to discuss the lenders in its credit syndicate, was rattled by the Education Department's rejection of its bid in December, and shares of the public company tumbled 50 percent on news of the decision. Months before the announcement, Performant said in a regulatory filing that the contract provided \"an opportunity to grow\" its student debt collection business. Caption Sen.

Education Department officials have grown wary of some of the private collection agencies the department uses to recoup past-due student loans, after years of public criticism about the aggressive practices some of them employ. The department has canceled its contract with five companies and refused to renew agreements with others, including Performant. Though the company was not caught up in the 2015 review that led the department to cut ties with the five companies, Performant has had its share of regulatory headaches. The company disclosed in 2013 that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had requested documents and other information related to its debt collection practices and procedures. The bureau, which has received hundreds of consumer complaints against Performant, did not take any formal enforcement action against the company, but identified problems with the department's debt collectors.

OK, it's a very\u00a0fancy steak and ice cream, along with Maine lobster, chocolate souffl\u00e9, and several upscale California wines that will be featured at the inaugural luncheon, set to take place inside the Capitol right after Trump takes the oath and delivers his first presidential address . By tradition, the luncheon is hosted by lawmakers on the congressional inaugural committee, which is charged with planning Friday\u2019s pomp and circumstance. Organizers said they expect about 200 guests to join the new president in Statuary Hall for the feast, including members of the Supreme Court and Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. \u201cThe inaugural luncheon provides an opportunity for members of both parties to come together and, in the same spirit of all our Inaugural events, show the world how uniquely American we are in our peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., chairman of the congressional inaugural committee, said in a statement Tuesday. The meal will begin with Maine lobster and gulf shrimp, served with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, according to the committee. The entr\u00e9e is Angus beef \u2014 not Trump steaks \u2014 with a dark chocolate and juniper jus. For dessert, guests will dig into chocolate souffl\u00e9 and cherry vanilla ice cream. Despite Trump\u2019s abstinence from alcohol, other guests will get to sip two California wines and end the meal with a champagne made in California. \u201cThe wines were made by several of the Golden State\u2019s prominent winemakers, and complement the flavors in each of the luncheon dishes,\u201d according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies statement. After the lunch, the committee will give Trump and incoming Vice President Mike Pence a gift: hand-cut, etched crystal bowls made by Lenox for the 2017 inauguration. The bowl for Trump will feature an illustration of the White House on one side and the Jefferson Memorial on the other. Pence\u2019s gift will be adorned with an illustration of the U.S. Capitol on one side and the Lincoln Memorial on the other. Read more: Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Chicago Tribune file photos) Katherine Skiba , Kim Janssen and Kim Geiger Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A growing number of Democratic lawmakers from Illinois \u2014 as well as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner \u2014 are skipping President-elect Donald Trump 's inauguration Friday. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will not attend the swearing-in. Democratic Reps. Mike Quigley of Chicago and Dan Lipinski of Western Springs also will not attend, their spokespeople said Tuesday. Another Chicago Democrat, Rep. Luis Gutierrez , said earlier this month that he would miss the inauguration but planned to attend the Women's March on Washington on Saturday. Rauner said Tuesday that he's skipping the festivities in Washington because he's \"100 percent focused in Illinois.\" Rauner is presiding over a historic state budget stalemate and has been consumed by a political power struggle with Democrats who control the General Assembly and who, during the last campaign, went to great lengths to link the governor to Trump. Other Democratic members of Congress from Illinois still are deciding whether to attend the festivities, particularly after Trump's criticism of Rep. John Lewis , D-Ga., a hero of the civil rights movement, after Lewis questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election. Bruce Rauner will not attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in Washington, D.C.

(Kim Geiger) As of Tuesday morning, about 40 members of Congress nationally had said they will not attend the inauguration. Asked about that Tuesday, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said \"we'd love for every member of Congress to attend, but if they don't, that's some great seats that other folks can hopefully partake in.\" \"I think that when you wake up on Friday and see the enormous crowds that are there, you're going to recognize that it is going to be an inauguration for all Americans,\" Spicer said. \"I think you're going to see an enormous outpouring of support and interest in coming to this. We've been overwhelmed by the number of people that want to attend this inauguration and be part of it in any numerous ways. \"So, you know, obviously it's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power, but it's within their right, and I think that that frees up some great seats for the millions of people who are excited to see this president come to Washington and bring real change.\" The state's two Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, will attend the inauguration, their spokesmen said.

The House is on recess this week. Lipinski, who won't attend, said in a statement he preferred to work in his district and spend time with his wife rather than watch the ceremony in D.C. and attend parties there. Some Democratic lawmakers from Illinois continue to weigh their options. Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Evanston is hearing from people urging that she sit out the swearing-in, her spokesman, Jeronimo Anaya-Ortiz, said Tuesday. \"We've had a big response on social media asking the congresswoman not to attend, and to stand with John Lewis on boycotting the inauguration,\" he said.

It's a history that made her a natural fit for Trump's cabinet, but her record is likely to come under fire when confronted by Democratic heavy-hitters during her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. \"When Betsy DeVos appears before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I will have some important questions for her and for the members of our committee who will vote on her nomination,\" said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut in a statement shortly after Trump's nomination of DeVos. \"I want to know how Congress would put someone who has spent her life trying to strip funding from public schools in charge of those very schools.\" As education secretary, DeVos would lead the agency responsible for policies affecting public schools. She would also be in charge of executing Trump's campaign promise to use $20 billion in federal funds to create school choice programs much like the ones she has championed in her home state of Michigan. \"We know that millions of children, mostly low-income and minority children, remain trapped in K-12 schools that are not meeting their needs,\" DeVos said in September shortly after Trump released his education plan. \"We applaud the Trump campaign's focus on school choice and laying out common-sense proposals to help all children access a quality education.\" Elisabeth DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for education secretary. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA But since Trump announced her nomination in November, Democrats and educational groups have voiced strong opposition to the billionaire businesswoman and longtime Republican donor \u2014 not just for her vast financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest , but for having little experience in the field. DeVos previously referred to public education as a \"dead end.\" \"There is no precedent for an Education Department Secretary nominee with your lack of experience in public education,\" said Dem. Sen Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in a letter to DeVos earlier this month. Warren, a member of the committee that will conduct DeVos' confirmation hearing on Tuesday, added that the prospective education secretary had \"virtually no experience\" overseeing student loans, developing regulations to assure school accountability or improving education outcomes. \"[Y]our testimony before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will be critical to assessing your readiness for the position,\" said Warren. Under Trump and DeVos, the education system could look very different \u2014 though the programs they've championed have long been favored by conservatives . Here's what to know ahead of DeVos' hearing. What 'School Choice' Means DeVos has long supported school choice programs through her nonprofit, American Federation for Children, and Trump has backed both school choice and voucher programs on the campaign trail. Both ideas would require the government to pay for students to attend private schools and charter schools, which are public schools run by private organizations. Supporters say such programs would force schools to be competitive, fostering an environment that would create educational innovation as well as offer parents more choices when it comes to their children's education. \"The answer isn't bigger government. The answer is local control. It's listening to parents, and it's giving more choices,\" she said at a Trump rally in December, the only public statement she has made about her potential role in his administration. Detractors don't buy that argument, however, saying that the programs would only pull resources from struggling public schools, keep costs the same \u2014 if not increase them \u2014 and stifle diversity. Related: Obama and His Movement Prepare to Challenge President Trump DeVos is expected to champion new voucher and school choice programs as education secretary, but may also seek to reduce government oversight of the schools they apply to. That, at least, appears to have been the case in Michigan, where DeVos and her husband helped get the state's charter school law passed in 1993. When lawmakers there were considering a measure that would have added oversight for charter schools in Detroit last year, members of the DeVos family reportedly poured $1.45 million into legislators' campaign coffers, according to Chalkbeat , a nonprofit education news outlet. The final version of the bill no longer included oversight. Many Republicans have praised Trump's nominee, as well as the programs she advocates. \"I have known her for many years; she is smart, dynamic, no nonsense and committed,\" wrote Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, in an op-ed endorsing DeVos. \"That's why the education establishment is so animated to stop her.\" Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush posted a statement on Facebook not long after Trump announced his pick, saying he looked forward to her \"bold leadership.\" DeVos and Bush pushed for school choice policies in his state , and DeVos' family foundation contributed to Bush's 2016 presidential campaign. \"She has a long and distinguished history championing the right of all parents to choose schools that best ensure their children's success,\" Bush said.

Tuesday's hearing also delved into Santiago's mental health history, including a week-long stay in November at the Alaska Psychiatric Institute in Anchorage following an encounter with FBI agents in that city. Santiago, according to federal officials, told agents that the CIA was forcing him to watch ISIS videos, and complained of hearing voices. At the hospital, he was given anti-anxiety medication and melatonin, but not any psychotropic medications, Del Toro said.

Veuer's Nick Cardona has that story. Buzz60 In 2013, Pvt. Chelsea Manning was still known as Bradley Manning. (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 Convicted national-security secret leaker Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning became the most visible face of the military\u2019s tiny transgender population, one that came from the shadows to the forefront when the Pentagon rescinded its ban on their open service last summer. Manning\u2019s journey from low-level Army intelligence analyst to notoriety for disclosing national security secrets to high-profile crusader for transgender rights paralleled the growing social acceptance of the small population of Americans who don\u2019t identify with their gender at birth. Previously known as Bradley, Manning, 29, has more than 100,000 followers on her Twitter account. Manning, who divulged massive amounts of information to WikiLeaks, had her sentence commuted Tuesday by President Obama. She has been serving a 35-year sentence at the Army\u2019s prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and had been eligible for parole in about six years. Read more: More than 100 troops seeking transgender care It was nearly two years ago that the Army, in a memo obtained by USA TODAY, agreed to provide Manning with hormone treatment to allow her to transition to a woman. The commandant of the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks concluded that providing the hormones was necessary for Manning\u2019s health. Allowing her to grow her hair out was not. Only by virtue of being an Army prisoner was Manning,\u00a0still a soldier while incarcerated, able to acknowledge publicly her transition to a woman and to receive treatment. Any other member of the military would have been discharged from service. In another disconnect, the Veterans Affairs Department had been approving treatment for transgender veterans for years. The Pentagon changed that inconsistency in its policy last summer when Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced repeal of the ban, and plans to allow troops to receive treatment, including reassignment surgery. By the end of 2016, more than 100 troops had informed their superiors that they wanted to transition to the opposite sex, be recognized in their new gender or were seeking counseling or treatment. A RAND Corp. study estimated that there may be about 6,600 transgender troops among the active-duty force of 1.3 million members. Treating transgender troops could cost as much as $8 million per year, and up to $50,000 per case. Manning, by September, had received assurances that she was a candidate for reassignment surgery, according to her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union.\u00a0She had been on a hunger strike, protesting the Army\u2019s delay in providing the treatment, which had been prescribed by her doctors. Manning had also attempted to commit suicide twice last year. President-elect Donald Trump has not made known whether he agrees with the Pentagon's new policy on transgender troops. It can be reversed. Read more: ",

Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60 A former contestant from The Apprentice filed a defamation lawsuit Tuesday against President-elect Donald Trump in a New York court. Summer Zervos came forward in October to accuse Trump of kissing and groping her in 2007 at a Beverly Hills hotel room. When Trump denied the accusations, Zervos\u2019s attorney Gloria Allred demanded a retraction. Since no retraction has been issued, \u201ctime\u2019s up,\u201d Allred said at a press conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Zervos publicly accused Trump on Oct. 14 along with several other women alleging sexual misconduct by Trump in the wake of the release of a tape from the show Access Hollywood on\u00a0Oct. 7, in which Trump talked about groping women, and his statements to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper during the Oct. 9 presidential debate. \u201cI would like the president-elect to decide he\u2019s going to do the right thing in reference to Ms. Zervos,\u201d Allred said. \u201cIf he\u2019ll simply retract his statements and acknowledge his conduct with Ms. Zervos, she will dismiss the case.\u201d Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks issued a statement Tuesday denying the claim. \"More of the same from Gloria Allred. There is no truth to this absurd story,\" Hicks said. In October, Trump tweeted several times about the sexual misconduct accusations, calling them\u201c100% fabricated and made-up charges,\u201d \u201ctotally false\u201d and \u201ctotally made up nonsense.\u201d Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2016 Zervos\u2019s attorney was asked if the case could lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment with echoes of the Paula Jones case and President Bill Clinton. She responded that a GOP-led Congress would have some tough choices and have to \u201cput partisanship aside, and apply the same standards to President Trump.\u201d Allred said they would seek to depose Trump about the incident and lawsuit where he would have to testify under oath. Allred also said they would seek \u201couttakes of Trump\u2019s recorded words\u201d from The Apprentice. When asked about the timing of the filings the week of Trump\u2019s inauguration, Allred responded: \u201cWhy now? My response is why not now? \u2026 It takes a great deal of courage to sue the most powerful man on the planet.\u201d Last week, Trump beat another defamation suit filed by a GOP political consultant, also in New York court. Zervos\u2019s legal filing claims the alleged defamation was \u201cdetrimental to Ms. Zervos\u2019s reputation, honor and dignity,\u201d but doesn\u2019t put a monetary figure on compensatory or punitive damages.

All three were found living under assumed identities in the Houston area, police said Tuesday, after officials received an anonymous tip. The sisters were said to be in good health.

Jerome Delay/AP hide caption toggle caption Jerome Delay/AP Gambian President Yahya Jammeh sits during his final pre-election rally in November in Banjul, Gambia. He lost that vote to rival Adama Barrow but has refused to step down. Jerome Delay/AP Two days before Gambian President Yahya Jammeh is supposed to cede power, he has declared a state of emergency in the country. He has refused to step down to make way for Adama Barrow, who won last month's election. It wasn't immediately clear what the state of emergency entailed, but the move appeared to make a handover of power even more unlikely. Barrow, a businessman, is scheduled to take office Thursday. But Jammeh has defiantly said he won't allow that to happen. In a televised speech on Sunday, he said he has filed an injunction to prevent Barrow from being sworn in until a Supreme Court ruling. \"Until then, the status quo remains,\" Jammeh said, calling on Gambians to carry on with their everyday activities. Any court decision could take months, The Associated Press reports. The chief justice has \"recused himself and said he could not rule on Jammeh's request for an injunction blocking Barrow's inauguration.\" Article continues after sponsorship PHOTOS: Gambia Holds Presidential Election Amid Internet Blackout International and regional demands have grown for Jammeh to cede power. \"West African leaders have not ruled out using force if Jammeh refuses to go,\" NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports. Barrow is currently in neighboring Senegal for his own protection. And the president-in-waiting experienced a family tragedy on Sunday \u2013 his 8-year-old son died in Gambia after sustaining a dog bite, Ofeibea reports. \"Our lives are so full of responsibility that we sometimes forget to spend time with those who love us the most,\" Barrow wrote in a statement on Twitter . \"Family is the most precious and sacred gift of all \u2014 never leave your family behind.\" Family is the most sacred and precious gift \u2014 we must be grateful of those who surround us. #Gambia pic.twitter.com/qXbOMZKcnI \u2014 Adama Barrow (@adama_barrow) January 16, 2017 Jammeh initially conceded defeat to Barrow after the election in early December, and it appeared that Gambia was poised to complete its first-ever peaceful transfer of power since independence. But Jammeh dramatically changed his tune a week later, when he claimed that the election result was void because of \"irregularities.\" Troops loyal to him then moved into the electoral commission headquarters after the commission head maintained that Barrow was the winner. Several members of Jammeh's cabinet have also resigned, according to the AP. The BBC reports that thousands of Gambians fearing violence have fled to Senegal. ",

    "text": "Twitter The abortion rate in the United States fell to its lowest level since the historic Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalized abortion nationwide, a new report finds. The report by the Guttmacher Institute , a research group that supports legalized abortion, puts the rate at 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age (ages 15-44) in 2014. That's the lowest recorded rate since the Roe decision in 1973. The abortion rate has been declining for decades \u2014 down from a peak of 29.3 in 1980 and 1981. The report also finds that in 2013, the total number of abortions nationwide fell below 1 million for the first time since the mid-1970s. In 2014 \u2014 the most recent year with data available \u2014 the number fell a bit more, to 926,200. The overall number had peaked at more than 1.6 million abortions in 1990, according to Guttmacher. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the longstanding controversy around abortion policy, the meaning of the report is somewhat in dispute. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said efforts to help women get better access to contraception are paying off. She points in particular to recent improvements in the rate of unintended pregnancies , and a historically low teen pregnancy rate. \"It shows that we're finally doing a better job of helping women get access to birth control that's affordable and that's high-quality,\" Richards said. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, Richards is gearing up for a fight over federal funding for women's health services provided by Planned Parenthood. Republican leaders in Congress have vowed to work with Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which requires contraceptive coverage for many women. Article continues after sponsorship \"We shouldn't go backwards on access to birth control,\" Richards said. Some anti-abortion groups, meanwhile, argue the Guttmacher report shows new state restrictions on abortion are working. Kristi Hamrick , a spokeswoman for Americans United for Life , said she has her doubts about the Guttmacher report \u2014 since the data come from surveys of abortion providers \u2014 but accepts the overall conclusion. She emphasized the impact of new regulations on clinics and laws requiring women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound , which she said are having a \"real, measurable impact on abortion.\" \"These have been game-changers, and we see the abortion rate dropping in response,\" Hamrick said. Hamrick said she believes abortion numbers are also falling in part because public sentiment is turning against abortion \u2014 although surveys by the Pew Research Center show opinions on abortion have been largely stable over the past two decades. The Gallup polling firm has found Americans largely divided on abortion in recent decades, with a majority labeling themselves \"pro-choice\" in a 2015 survey . The Guttmacher report says abortion restrictions do appear to be a factor in the declining numbers in some states. But principal research scientist Rachel Jones , lead author of the report, said that's not the whole story. She noted that abortion declined in almost every state, and \"having fewer clinics didn't always translate into having fewer abortions.\" A more important driver of the declining abortion rate, Jones said, appears to be improved access to contraception, particularly long-acting birth control options like IUDs. She noted that women in the United States have been using the highly effective devices in growing numbers for more than a decade, and said the declining birthrate suggests more women are preventing unwanted pregnancies. \"Abortion is going down, and births aren't going up,\" Jones said. Chuck Donovan, president of the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute , called the drop in the abortion rate \"good news,\" regardless of one's political point of view. He said there are likely a number of factors behind the decline. \"By and large, this is encouraging for a country that obviously remains deeply divided and discomfited about the benefits of abortion to the public,\" Donovan said. But when it comes to abortion, common ground is hard to find. The Guttmacher Institute's Jones said the data may signal that some women who want abortions can't get access. \"If there are women in these highly restrictive states who want abortions but can't get them because there aren't any clinics that they can get to, and that's why abortion's going down, that's not a good thing,\" Jones said. \"But we think the story that's going on in a lot of situations, in a lot of states, is that fewer women are having unintended pregnancies and in turn fewer abortions, and that is actually a good story.\" ",

Officials confirmed that the letter arrived at the White House to CBS News, but are declining to provide further details. Mohammed is awaiting his death-penalty trial at Guantanamo Bay, accused of planning and orchestrating the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. The Miami Herald , which first reported on the letter, says it was written in 2014, and was only delivered after a judge ordered reluctant Guantanamo Bay prison officials to put it in the mail. The Herald reports that because it was delivered before Donald Trump takes office on Friday, Mr. Obama should be able to take it with him into private life. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed The Herald reports Mohammed \u201cwrote to Obama in 2014 about \u2018Muslim oppression at the hands of the West in general and the United States in particular,\u2019 his lawyer David Nevin said then. He also shares his views on what happened in Iraq during the period of U.S. sanctions and \u2018events in Palestine and Gaza over the years.\u2019\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s chief war crimes prosecutor, Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, reportedly did not want the letter delivered, saying it amounted to propaganda. Mohammed has been described previously by observers as something of an attention junkie . He has asked to wear military camouflage in court , saved berries from his meals to dye his beard orange , and flipped through magazines while being spoken to by a judge . Before being taken to Guantanamo Bay following his 2003 capture in his pajamas in a suburban Pakistan home, Mohammed was subjected to the most brutal of the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogation methods, and he reportedly confessed to a host of atrocities . \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Got it (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) By Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horwitz By Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horwitz January 17 at 5:35 PM Follow @nakashimae Follow @sarihorwitz President Obama commuted the 35-year prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, an Army private convicted of taking troves of secret diplomatic and military documents and disclosing them to WikiLeaks, after deciding that Manning had served enough time. Obama also granted a full and complete pardon to retired Marine General James E. Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation of a leak of classified information about a covert U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The president\u2019s dramatic, last-minute clemency actions for Cartwright and Manning were surprising for an administration that has brought more leak prosecutions than all previous ones combined. Obama took office pledging to bring a new era of transparency to government, but during his eight years, his administration has presided over at least nine leak cases. But officials said the president thought that in Manning\u2019s case, seven years behind bars was enough punishment and that she had been given an excessive sentence \u2014 the longest ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction. The administration has contrasted her case with that of Edward Snowden , the National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified documents in 2013 and then fled the country, pointing out that Manning did not try to avoid facing the U.S. justice system for her crimes. \u201cChelsea Manning is somebody who accepted responsibility for the crimes she committed,\u201d a senior White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. \u201cShe expressed remorse for committing those crimes. She began serving the sentence that was handed down. The president\u2019s concern was rooted in the fact that the sentence handed down is longer than sentences given to other individuals who committed comparable crimes.\u201d Republicans immediately blasted the White House\u2019s decision, saying the commutation would encourage others to leak sensitive documents. \u201cThis is just outrageous,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said. \u201cChelsea Manning\u2019s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets. President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won\u2019t be held accountable for their crimes.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s team did not respond to requests for comment on the case.\u201d Also on Tuesday, Obama granted clemency to more than 200 low-level drug offenders who were sentenced under harsh laws and would have received lighter sentences if convicted today. In all, the president commuted the sentences of 209 individuals and pardoned an additional 64. He is expected to grant more commutations before he leaves office. Since 2014, Obama has commuted 1,385 sentences, more than the previous 12 presidents combined. Of those, 540 low-level drug offenders had been serving life sentences. This \u201cfinal set of actions\u201d as Obama leaves office \u201cis a signal to the system that prosecutors have gone too far,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, a national security and transparency expert at the Federation of American Scientists. Manning, 29, will be set free in four months, on May 17, instead of in 2045, under the terms of Obama\u2019s commutation. The Pentagon did not make the recommendation to the White House to commute Manning\u2019s sentence, and senior Defense Department leaders opposed the move, said defense officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. White House officials said the president\u2019s decision had nothing to do with a recent pledge by Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, that he would agree to be extradited to the United States if Manning\u2019s sentence was commuted. Members of Assange\u2019s legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comments. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s decision was both compassionate and amply justified,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cManning\u2019s sentence was orders of magnitude greater than any sentence previously imposed for leaking classified information to the media.\u201d Manning was arrested in Iraq in May 2010 after she transmitted documents to WikiLeaks that came to be known as the Iraq and Afghanistan \u201cWar Logs.\u201d She also shared a video that showed a U.S. Apache helicopter in Baghdad opening fire on a group of people that the crew believed to be insurgents. Among the dead were Iraqi children and two journalists. She also leaked documents pertaining to Guantanamo Bay prisoners as well as 250,000 State Department cables . In an impassioned statement last year accompanying her petition for clemency, she accepted \u201cfull and complete responsibility\u201d for disclosing the material. She said she pleaded guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement because she believed that the military justice system would understand her motivation for the leak and sentence her fairly. \u201cI was wrong,\u201d wrote Manning, who is imprisoned at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. She said the 35-year penalty was \u201cfar more\u201d than she imagined possible \u2014 \u201cunreasonable, outrageous and out of line with what I had done.\u201d Manning, who formerly went by the name Bradley Manning, came out as transgender after her conviction. She said in her statement that the three years since she had been sentenced had enabled her to reflect on her actions and her struggle to adjust to the military. \u201cI am not Bradley Manning,\u201d she said. \u201cI really never was. I am Chelsea Manning, a proud woman who is transgender and who, through this application, is respectfully requesting a first chance at life.\u201d Her reason for passing the documents to WikiLeaks was to raise public awareness about issues she found troubling, including the effect of war on innocent civilians, her attorney, Vincent J. Ward, said in a letter accompanying Manning\u2019s petition. Ward said Manning\u2019s sentence exceeds even international legal norms. Manning was kept in solitary confinement for almost a year before formal charges were brought, an experience she has called \u201chumiliating and degrading.\u201d The United Nations special rapporteur on torture called her treatment \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading.\u201d She has tried to kill herself twice while at Fort Leavenworth \u2014 the first time in July 2016 and again in November. After the July attempt, she was placed in solitary confinement as punishment. \u201cThe family is delighted to hear the news, and we are looking forward to seeing Chelsea in May, and we want to thank President Obama for granting her request. We\u2019re all very, very happy about it,\u201d said Debbie, an aunt of Manning\u2019s in Maryland, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy. Cartwright, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, served as the nation\u2019s second-ranking military officer and was facing his sentencing in two weeks after pleading guilty in October to a felony count of lying to the FBI in a classified leak investigation. He admitted to falsely telling investigators that he did not confirm classified information to reporters writing about a covert U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The senior White House official said Cartwright\u2019s long history of distinguished service to the nation factored into Obama\u2019s decision. The official said a journalist involved in the case testified that Cartwright did not tell the journalist anything that the reporter did not already know. The conversation was \u201cfocused on preventing the publication of information that could be damaging to our national security,\u201d the official said. When the president is making clemency decisions, \u201cmotive matters,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear in this case that based on what the journalist has said . . . that General Cartwright\u2019s motive was different than most of the people who are accused of leaking classified information to a journalist.\u201d In a statement Tuesday, Cartwright thanked Obama. \u201cWith the greatest pride, I have served my country as a member of the military for more than forty years. This action allows me to continue that work as a private citizen,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cI love this country and believe it to be the greatest nation on earth. I have never lost faith in that belief.\u201d Julie Tate, David Nakamura, Spencer Hsu, John Wagner and Missy Ryan contributed to this report. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "WATCH Coretta Scott King Speaks Out in Posthumous Memoir: 'This Family Was Chosen' 0 Shares Email Scott Shepherd didn't fire the shot that killed Martin Luther King Jr., but the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon says he has always felt remorse toward the family of the slain civil rights leader and all who honor his legacy. He reached for atonement Monday evening, sitting on a dais next to Bernice King , who was 5 years old when James Earl Ray assassinated her father in 1968. \"I want to extend an apology to the King family and everyone out there,\" Shepherd said, opening a discussion of race relations at the Atlanta center that bears the elder King's name. \"I, in my past, did a lot of terrible things. I said a lot of terrible things about Dr. King. I didn't know what I was talking about.\" Bernice King, who acknowledged \"hating white people\" as a young woman, accepted Shepherd's apology. It was the pinnacle of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day that laid bare intense social tensions as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office Friday, yet also offered potential avenues to achieve King's vision of a just society. Trump did not publicly participate in any King observances. The holiday came amid the fallout from a public tiff between Trump and civil rights icon John Lewis, an exchange that incensed many African-Americans already leery of Trump after a racially charged campaign. In New York, King Day observers cast establishment leaders as Klan successors. \"When men no better than Klansmen dressed in suits are being sworn into office, we cannot be silent,\" Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi said at a Brooklyn gathering. Father Michael Plfeger, the man Bernice King invited to serve as keynote speaker at the Monday morning service at her father's Ebenezer Baptist Church, sounded similar themes. He delivered a 45-minute indictment of the nation's social and economic structure and warned it would get worse under Trump. \"Plantations still exist,\" Pfleger said. \"And too often, white hoods have been replaced by three-piece suits in this country.\" For her part, Bernice King warned of a nation \"dangerously polarized\" along the lines of race and class. \"We are headed to race riots if we're not careful,\" she said. \"We can't just keep this divisiveness going.\" She expressed concerns about Trump, who had met earlier in the day with her brother, Martin Luther King III. After that private session at Trump Tower in New York, King III said Trump pledged to be an inclusive president even as he stands firm in his spat with Lewis. The Georgia congressman initially called Trump \"illegitimate,\" prompting the president-elect to declare on Twitter that Lewis, who was beaten during the civil rights movement, was \"all talk\" and \"no action.\" Bernice King said Trump has demonstrated \"what kind of man he is\" and said any transformation is up to God. Changing the nation, she said, rests with people like Shepherd and Daryl Davis, a black musician and author who has made a second career out of befriending Klansmen and leading them to renounce their racist views. \"When two enemies are talking, they aren't fighting,\" Davis said. \"It's when the talking ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence.\" Minutes earlier, he had unfurled a robe and held aloft the hood of a man he said was once an Imperial Wizard of the Klan, supervising multiple states until he met Davis and eventually abandoned his racist views. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination that Trump won, told the same crowd it's not productive to focus on national leaders like Trump. \"The problems we have in society today are right here in our own neighborhoods,\" he said. Kasich's approach highlights some differences among those who tout King's legacy. Pfleger, a self-described radical priest from Chicago, said the United States must dismantle systems of oppression through collective political action. Another failed presidential candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, noted that King, beyond being a racial justice advocate, was an economic radical who angered the political establishment. If there is a shared conclusion among activists, it is perhaps that realizing King's vision involves both personal conversion and collective action, in neighborhoods and in the halls of power. Kasich noted that national politicians, even with their limitations, control resources and react to grassroots leaders like King. Activist Chris Crass, who is white, explained that he reaches out not to avowed white supremacists, but to whites who don't see themselves as part of the problem. The idea, he said, isn't to make them feel guilty, but to convince them that U.S. power brokers for generations have divided working-class whites against poor blacks as a means to maintain power. Understanding those \"economic and political realities\" would enable a new, powerful social and political coalition, he said. As to whether that can occur under Trump, Davis, the man who befriends and converts Klansman, said he's optimistic. Trump, he said, \"has brought all this out,\" regardless of whether he intended to do so. Davis said many Americans assumed \u2014 or convinced themselves \u2014 that bigotry was over with Barack Obama's election as the first black president. \"We have been in denial about racism in this country,\" Davis said, \"and you cannot address what you cannot see.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP 0 Shares ",

When Manning was sentenced, she was also dishonorably discharged from the Army, and reduced to the grade of \u201cprivate E-1,\u201d the lowest rank possible for an enlisted member of the Army. She admitted to leaking the documents, saying it was intended to raise awareness about the toll the war had taken on innocent civilians. As part of Manning\u2019s application for commutation, retired Air Force Col. Morris D. Davis, who was chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay for two years, said much of the information Manning leaked had little value and could be found through open sources on the internet. In September 2016, after a lengthy lawsuit, Manning became the first transgender military inmate to be granted a request for gender transition surgery.\u00a0 Manning attempted suicide multiple times citing the treatment she\u2019s received in prison. House Speaker Paul Ryan was not pleased about the decision Tuesday, tweeting, \u201cChelsea Manning\u2019s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets.\u201d Chelsea Manning's treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets.

Holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, Assange had expressed concern that if he left he would be extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges.

    "text": "Obama commutes Chelsea Manning's sentence for leaking Army documents Published               January 17, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 President Obama commuted the vast majority of former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning's 35-year prison sentence for leaking classified documents, the White House announced Tuesday. The White House said that Manning is one of 209 inmates whose sentences Obama is shortening. Obama is also pardoning 64 people, including retired Gen. James Cartwright, who was charged with making false statements during a probe into disclosure of classified information. Manning is more than six years into a 35-year sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas\u00a0for leaking classified government and military documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Her sentence is now set to expire May 17. Manning was known as Bradley Manning at the time of her 2010 arrest, but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman.\u00a0 Manning accepted responsibility for leaking the material to WikiLeaks to raise public awareness about the effects of war on civilians, and has said she was confronting gender dysphoria at the time of the leaks while deployed in Iraq. She attempted suicide twice last year, according to her lawyers, citing her treatment at Leavenworth. Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Manning, said the president's action \"quite literally save Chelsea's life.\" \"We are all better off knowing that Chelsea Manning will walk out of prison a free woman, dedicated to making the world a better place and fighting for justice for so many,\" Stangio said in a statement. CHELSEA MANNING'S REDUCED SENTENCE COULD STRENGTHEN ASSANGE'S CASE, FORMER PROSECUTOR SAYS \"Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency,\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a message posted to Twitter. \"Your courage & determination made the impossible possible.\" Assange: \"Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency. Your courage & determination made the impossible possible.\" \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 17, 2017 In a conference call with White House reporters, an official said the decision to grant a commutation to Manning was not influence anyway by Assange or WikiLeaks. A separate White House official said that more commutations should be expected before Obama leaves office. The U.S. Army declined to comment on the announcement when asked by The Associated Press.\u00a0 In a blog post , White House Legal Counsel Neil Eggleston wrote \"with today\u2019s 209 grants of commutation, the President has now commuted the sentences of 1,385 individuals \u2013 the most grants of commutation issued by any president in this nation\u2019s history.\u201d \"We must remember that clemency is an extraordinary remedy, granted only after the president has concluded that a particular individual has demonstrated a readiness to make use of his or her second chance,\" Eggleston added. \"Only Congress can achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure over the long run that our criminal justice system operates more fairly and effectively in the service of public safety.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., called Obama's decision \"outrageous.\"\u00a0 \"Chelsea Manning\u2019s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets,\" he said in a statement. \"President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won\u2019t be held accountable for their crimes.\u201d \u00a0 The decision is expected to have a ripple effect on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the organization. Two former intelligence officers have told Fox News that a CIA WikiLeaks taskforce was set up to assess damage from the Manning leaks. \"I think it would strengthen his (Assange\u2019s) position considerably,\" Tom Dupree, former Deputy Attorney General, told Fox News in a previous interview. \"If the United States government said we are going to pardon Manning for those offenses,\u00a0 I think it makes it that much tougher to then say we\u2019re going to drop the hammer on the person that published that information.\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Fox News that while pardons are a Constitutional tool in the president's repertoire, Obama is \"undermining our ability on criminal justice reform by granting clemency at an alarming rate.\" Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, received a pardon, the White House said. He pleaded guilty in October to making false statements during an investigation into a leak of classified information about a covert cyberattack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Prosecutors said Cartwright falsely told investigators that he did not provide information contained in a news article and in a book by New York Times journalist David Sanger, and said he also misled prosecutors about classified information shared with another journalist, Daniel Klaidman. The Justice Department sought a sentence of two years, saying employees of the U.S. government are entrusted each day with sensitive classified information. \"They must understand that disclosing such information to persons not authorized to receive it has severe consequences,\" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed this month. On Tuesday, Obama also commuted the prison sentence of Puerto Rican independence activist Oscar Lopez-Rivera. The 74-year-old Puerto Rican independence leader was sentenced in 1981 to 55 years in prison for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government. He was sentenced to another 15 years in prison in 1988 for an attempted escape. Commutations reduce sentences being served but don't erase convictions. Pardons generally restore civil rights, such as voting, often after a sentence has been served. Most of the other people receiving commutations were serving sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. Jessica Jackson Sloan, National Director of #cut50, which looks to reduce the incarcerated population by 50 percent over the next 10 years, called Tuesday's announcement another action to address \"our broken criminal justice system.\" \"For far too long, efforts to fight crime have missed their mark, breaking up families and harming the human potential in our most vulnerable communities,\" Sloan said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Obama\u2019s clemency initiative, more than one thousand people who were given overly harsh sentences during the War on Drugs now have a second chance at freedom.\" One other notable name to receive a pardon was 79-year-old former baseball star Willie McCovey, who received two years' probation and was fined $5,000 in 1996 on charges related to tax evasion.

After dozens of similar fires, Ford South Africa has recalled 4,556 Kugas. South African Warren Krog was lucky to escape incineration when his 2013 Ford Kuga burst into flames in Johannesburg this month. After dozens of similar fires, Ford South Africa has recalled 4,556 Kugas. (Warren Krog) Robyn Dixon Contact Reporter On a December night in a town on South Africa\u2019s south coast,\u00a0Reshall Jimmy\u2019s car burst into flames. The 33-year-old was on vacation. A video of the incident that aired in South African media showed fire shooting out of the front of the car on the driver\u2019s side\u00a0as passers-by stopped their cars, frightened\u00a0to approach. Within a minute, the front of the car was engulfed in fire.\u00a0The observers desperately tried to call\u00a0police and emergency services. \u201cIs there anyone in the car?\u201d one man asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d another shouted, his voice thick\u00a0with worry. When Reshall\u2019s body was pulled from the car, he was unrecognizable. Only the soles of his feet remained unburned. After more than a year and\u00a0nearly 50 fires involving Ford Kuga SUVs, Ford South Africa on Monday announced that it was recalling 4,556 1.6-liter Kugas manufactured in Spain. Jimmy\u2019s family announced Tuesday that it plans to file a class-action lawsuit against Ford over its failure to get the faulty vehicles off the road more swiftly. The model is equivalent to the\u00a0Escape in the U.S., which has been subject to several recalls in recent years, including one in 2012 for an engine fire problem.\u00a0 The Kuga is also sold throughout Europe. Ford has blamed the problem in part on the hotter weather in South Africa, but also said that cars are configured differently for different countries. Ford\u2019s action came after a\u00a0campaign by South Africans on Twitter and in\u00a0an online petition \u00a0demanding a recall, and reports in South African media last year that insurance companies had alerted Ford to the problem. A police report blamed an electrical problem behind the dashboard for the fire that killed Jimmy. Ford South Africa has claimed the fire began in the back of the car. A Johannesburg businessman, Warren Krog, said he plans to join\u00a0the class\u00a0action against Ford. He was driving to work\u00a0Thursday when he saw wisps of white smoke coming from his engine, stopped and opened the hood. Warren Krog's engine was engulfed by flames in about 15 minutes in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week.

Warren Krog's engine was engulfed by flames in about 15 minutes in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week. (Warren Krog) \u201cUnder the [windshield] area, I could see fire. I got a tremendous fright,\u201d he said in a phone interview Tuesday. \u201cI ran around the car getting things out. I got my laptop, my house keys, anything I could think of. I was panicking.\u201d Flames had engulfed the front of the car before a fire brigade arrived 15 minutes later\u00a0and doused them. \u201cAfter the fire was put out, one of the firemen told me I was extremely lucky I got out of the car so quickly.

It messes up your electrics and you can\u2019t open your windows or doors,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think my guardian angels were with me. I was supposed to take my daughter and her friend to school that day. It makes me shudder to think that we all could have been trapped in a burning vehicle.\u201d Scores of fires have been reported since January 2016, including 11 so far this\u00a0January. In one incident, a Pretoria woman, Zane Verhoef, was trapped in a burning Kuga in\u00a0January 2016 when her feet were caught,\u00a0according to South African media. Her 11-year-old daughter flagged down a driver, who managed to drag Verhoef out of the burning car. As fires continued to break out in January, pressure on Ford mounted on Twitter. Asked at a press conference Tuesday what he wanted from Ford, Reshall Jimmy\u2019s brother,\u00a0Kaveen\u00a0said, \u201cFor a start, to stop making a mockery of my brother\u2019s death.\u201d He called on Ford to accept responsibility for the death and to apologize to their mother. \u201cI can account for every minute from the 4th of December that we\u2019ve lost him and everything we\u2019ve done for the last year and that\u2019s what Ford\u2019s forced us to do. They\u2019ve forced us to relive this loss every day, and it gets heavier and heavier for us to deal with,\u201d he said. Ford sent text messages to drivers in December calling on them to bring cars in for an urgent maintenance check, but Jimmy\u2019s sister, Renisha, said cars continued to catch fire after being checked. \u201cFor me, they should have taken these cars off the road,\u201d she said Tuesday. Krog said he emailed the address given in the text message and also tried to call the number supplied but there was no\u00a0response. He contacted a Ford dealer in early January, and was given an appointment on Jan. 18. \u201cI said, \u2018Is it safe for me to drive my car until the 18th?\u2019 The gentleman said, \u2018Just check the coolant and if there\u2019s liquid in it, it\u2019s fine.\u2019 That\u2019s absolute negligence.\u201d Company chief executive Jeff Nemeth said in a radio interview Monday that the fires were believed to be caused by overheating due to lack of\u00a0coolant circulation, leading to a crack in the cylinder head, causing oil to leak onto the hot engine and ignite. The recall involves cars being checked by Ford dealer staff and having certain components replaced. Nemeth said a Ford forensic investigator from Detroit examined Reshall Jimmy\u2019s car in December 2016 and concluded that the car didn\u2019t burn\u00a0due to an engine fire. \u201cWe\u00a0believe that that incident is a separate incident, unrelated to the causes of these Kugas that were recalled today,\u201d he said. He added that he only knew of 39 fires that Ford owners had reported to the company. Asked why Ford took so long to recall the vehicles, Nemeth said the company was trying to understand what was going on with the vehicles. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is we look at a body of data, right? And so we\u2019re constantly trying to understand what\u2019s happened to these vehicles and, as you can imagine, as a fire occurs, just the physical act of the fire consumes the evidence of why it happened. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been investigating. We shipped 15 engines back to the U.S. and Europe in the course of 2016 so our engineers could start understanding what was going on.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss L.A.'s 2024 Olympics bid ; the wife of the Orlando nightclub gunman \u00a0was arrested in Oakland; American Apparel begins massive layoffs ; Trump's plan to repeal Affordable Care Act \u00a0would likely cost California billions in federal funds.

No details of the arrest were immediately provided. Markeith Loyd in a computer-altered photograph showing how police believe he looked after having altered his appearance to evade capture. Orlando Police Department \"They beat me up. They beat me up,\" Loyd yelled to reporters as he was hustled into a back entrance to police headquarters, shackled in the handcuffs belonging to the cop he is accused of killing. Loyd's name was added to U.S. Marshals' 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list earlier Tuesday as local, state and federal authorities scoured the area for him. Police released a computer-generated photo showing how they believed Loyd may have altered his appearance to evade capture. Loyd, 41, had been sought in connection with the shooting deaths on Dec. 13 of Sade Dixon, 24, a mother of two who was three months pregnant, and of Orlando police Master Sgt. Debra Clayton during a confrontation on Jan. 9. Investigators have said they believe several people helped Loyd escape, and at least three \u2014 including his niece \u2014 have been arrested. Police said Loyd is believed to have been wearing a bulletproof vest as he stood over Clayton and shot her to death. Orange County sheriff's Deputy Norman Lewis, an 11-year veteran, was killed in a crash as authorities gave pursuit. Orlando Police Chief John Mina tweeted that Clayton's handcuffs were used to secure Loyd after he was captured. Captured and wearing Lt.

    "text": "Trump education pick DeVos promotes school choice at confirmation hearing Published               January 17, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos voiced strong support for public school alternatives at her confirmation hearing Tuesday, telling senators that \"parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning fits the needs of every child.\" DeVos told the Senate Health, Education and Pensions Committe that she would be \"a strong advocate for great public schools\" if confirmed, but added that \"if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child ... we should support a parent's right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.\" \u00a0 DeVos, 59, also said she will seek to address rising higher education costs and massive student debt, but also advance trade and vocational schools as well as community colleges because \"craftsmanship is not a fallback \u2014 but a noble pursuit.\" President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of DeVos to lead the Department of Education was harshly criticized by teacher's unions, who have claimed that DeVos wants to undermine the public education system, which provides instruction to more than 90 percent of the country's students. In his opening statement, committee chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., himself a former secretary of education, said DeVos is \"on our children's side.\" \"I believe she is in the mainstream of public opinion, and her critics are not,\" said Alexander, who praised DeVos for\u00a0devoting her life to helping mainly low-income kids have better choice in their education. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the committee's ranking member, expressed concern that lawmakers had not received an ethics review for the nominee.\u00a0 \"I am extremely disappointed that we are moving forward with this hearing withour receiving the proper paperwork from the Office of Goverment Ethics,\" Murray said. DeVos, whose husband is the heir to the Amway marketing fortune, has for decades used the family\u2019s influence and wealth in home-state Michigan to advocate for charter schools and promote conservative religious values. Critics of DeVos have expressed concerns about her financial contributions and possible conflicts of interest. Murray, in her opening statement, also told DeVos that federal policy should be focused on strengthening public schools, \"and certainly not toward diverting taxpayer dollars to fund vouchers that don't work for unaccountable private schools.\" DeVos is expected to get enough votes in the committee and before the full Senate to be confirmed, considering she needs only a simple majority, with Republicans having 52 senators and Democrats having 48.\u00a0 In a letter addressed to the committee, 38 prominent education groups and teachers' organizations expressed concern that DeVos' track record bodes ill for public education. \"Over the course of her career as a major campaign contributor, soft-money donor and lobbyist, DeVos has used her considerable wealth to influence legislation and the outcomes of elections to advance policies that have undermined public education and proved harmful to many of our most vulnerable students,\" the letter said. LGBT groups also have protested Trump's choice of DeVos, saying she has funded conservative religious groups that promote what they consider to be traditional family values, including one organization that supports conversion therapy -- counseling of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people with the aim of changing their sexual orientation. In an apparent response to that criticism, DeVos said in her statement, \"Every child in America deserves to be in a safe environment that is free from discrimination.\" DeVos supporters, meanwhile, applauded her nomination. Eva Moskowitz, CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools, said that American public education \"is in deep crisis,\" with 35 countries outranking American schools in math and 20 in reading. \"I believe Betsy DeVos has the talent, commitment and leadership capacity to revitalize our public schools and deliver the promise of opportunity that excellent education provides, and I support her nomination as U.S. secretary of education,\" Moskowitz said in a statement. Murray has also garnered strong backing from two dozen state governors, as well as another former education secretary, William Bennett. It\u2019s time we take a major turn in American education,\u201d Bennett told Fox New Channel\u2019s \u201cHappening Now\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cBetsy DeVos represents a change. She is experienced in the field with children from all over the country. \u2026 She understands what the problems with education are.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Farage called Trump's campaign a \"revolution.\" Then-candidate Donald Trump, right, welcomed British politician and Brexit architect Nigel Farage at a campaign rally in Jackson, Miss., last summer. Farage called Trump's campaign a \"revolution.\" (Associated Press) Tracy Wilkinson Contact Reporter Even before he enters the White House on Friday, President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that his foreign policy could include a diminished Europe and an unfettered Russia, creating deep unease in many of America\u2019s traditional allies. In recent days, he has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d and said he couldn\u2019t \u201ccare less\u201d whether the European Union , the 28-nation political and economic bloc that is America\u2019s largest trading partner, held together. He has rattled nerves in European capitals by criticizing German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who heads the continent\u2019s largest economy, and suggesting he might ease sanctions imposed on Russia after its military seized the Crimean peninsula and backed separatists in Ukraine in 2014. Trump predicted other countries would follow England\u2019s so-called Brexit by leaving the European Union. And his aides telephoned several European institutions, inquiring which country was probably the next to go, said the outgoing U.S. ambassador to the union, Anthony L. Gardner. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Gardner said it would be \u201csheer folly\u201d and \u201clunacy\u201d for Trump to encourage a further breakup of the European Union given the strategic importance of the European single market to the U.S. economy. Trump seemed far less concerned in an interview with Michael Gove, a pro-Brexit member of the British Parliament, that was published in London\u2019s Sunday Times. Vladimir Putin took a parting shot at the Obama administration Tuesday, accusing it of trying to undermine Donald Trump 's legitimacy with fake allegations and \"binding the president-elect hand and foot to prevent him from fulfilling his election promises.\" In his first public... Russian President Vladimir Putin took a parting shot at the Obama administration Tuesday, accusing it of trying to undermine Donald Trump 's legitimacy with fake allegations and \"binding the president-elect hand and foot to prevent him from fulfilling his election promises.\" In his first public... (Associated Press) \u201cIf refugees keep pouring into different parts of Europe,\u00a0I think it\u2019s gonna be very hard to keep it together cause people are angry about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think it matters much for the United States. I never thought it mattered.\u2026 I don\u2019t really care whether it\u2019s separate or together. To me, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Trump went on to equate Merkel, who was one of President Obama\u2019s closest allies, with Russian President Vladimir Putin , who ordered Russian intelligence agencies to interfere in the U.S. presidential race, in terms of their trustworthiness. \u201cWell, I start off trusting both, but let\u2019s see how long that lasts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not last long at all.\u201d Trump said that he liked the German leader but that she made a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d by allowing \u201call those illegals\u201d to enter Germany, referring to her decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Syria, Iraq and other war zones. Merkel shot back Monday, indicating she would no longer count on a strong U.S. role in Europe under a Trump administration. \u201cWe Europeans have our fate in our own hands,\u201d she said in Berlin. All of this has left many Europeans, and their U.S. supporters, nervous about the incoming president\u2019s intentions toward Europe. Trump\u2019s repeated praise for Putin and his promise to improve relations with Russia will leave \u201cEurope twisting in the wind,\u201d said Josef Joffe, a visiting\u00a0fellow at the Hoover Institution, a national security think tank at Stanford University. Trump appears indifferent to \u201cthe great pillars of Western world order for the last 70 years: Europe and NATO,\u201d Joffe, who is editor of the German weekly Die Zeit, wrote Tuesday in the Guardian newspaper. \u201cHere are the bare bones of Trumpist policy, all of them hard to swallow for Europe and the rest.\u201d For Trump, a strong European Union \u201cis a counter-balance that he sees as disadvantageous to American power,\u201d said Jacob Parakilas, assistant head of the Americas\u00a0program at the London think tank Chatham House. \u201cTrump\u2019s natural allies are those far-right Euroskeptics\u201d who have emerged in recent years in reaction to massive immigration and other change, he said. They include Brexit architect Nigel\u00a0Farage, who met with Trump during the presidential campaign, and ultra-right-wing nationalist Marie Le Pen of France, who was spotted last week at Trump Tower in New York. Transition officials said she was not there to meet Trump.

Donald Trump taps Betsy DeVos for education secretary Responding to fierce criticism from teachers unions that the Republican donor and school choice activist is working against public education, DeVos told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that she will be \u201ca strong advocate for great public schools.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cif a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child - perhaps they have a special need that is going unmet - we should support a parent\u2019s right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative.\u201d Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a former education secretary, expressed confidence that DeVos is an \u201cexcellent\u201d choice for the job. \u201cShe is on the side of our children,\u201d he said. Betsy DeVos: Guns should be allowed in schools in case of grizzly bears But Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the committee, said she was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d that DeVos has not yet finalized her financial and ethics disclosures ahead of the hearing. DeVos, 59, also said she will seek to address rising higher education costs and massive student debt, but also advance trade and vocational schools as well as community colleges because \u201ccraftsmanship is not a fallback - but a noble pursuit.\u201d DeVos, the wife of Dick DeVos, the heir to the Amway marketing fortune, has spent more than two decades advocating for charter schools in her home state of Michigan, as well as promoting conservative religious values. Labor unions, Democrats and civil rights groups have opposed her appointment. She and her family have donated millions of dollars to Republican politicians and groups over the years, including campaign contributions to several committee members. Murray, in a statement, said she wants DeVos to answer questions about her \u201cextensive financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest\u201d and also to provide additional information about her finances, calling her disclosures incomplete. The senator lamented that DeVos has spent her career and wealth \u201cfighting to privatize public education and gut investments in public schools.\u201d Unions slam Trump's pick for Secretary of Education DeVos says she will take a salary of only $1 if confirmed to head the Education Department, because she says does not want to take a government salary as Mr. Trump\u2019s new education secretary. DeVos has used her vast wealth to promote charter schools, vouchers and traditional family values. Yet she is trying to assure Democrats that she will also divest in financial investments that are deemed a conflict. She pledges that she \u201cwill not be conflicted. Period.\u201d LGBT groups also have protested Trump\u2019s choice of DeVos, saying she has funded conservative religious groups that promote what they consider to be traditional family values, including one organization that supports conversion therapy - counseling of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people with the aim of changing their sexual orientation. In an apparent response to that criticism, DeVos said in her statement, \u201cEvery child in America deserves to be in a safe environment that is free from discrimination.\u201d DeVos disavowed any support for conversion therapy - the controversial counseling of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people with the aim of changing their sexual orientation. She told the Senate panel she has \u201cnever believed in that.\u201d DeVos said she \u201cbelieves in the innate value of every single human being,\u201d and she says all children have a right to attend a safe school. Also, DeVos vowed to work on weakening \u201cburdensome\u201d federal regulations and giving local communities greater control over education policies. \u201cPresident-elect Trump and I know it won\u2019t be Washington, D.C., that unlocks our nation\u2019s potential, nor a bigger bureaucracy, tougher mandates or a federal agency,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cThe answer is local control and listening to parents, students and teachers.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

James Cartwright, who was accused of lying to the FBI during another leak investigation. Related: Some Big Names Got a Measure of Mercy From President Obama The Manning commutation, which will undoubtedly be controversial, was not a complete surprise. NBC News reported last week that she was on the president's short list. And at a briefing last week, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that Manning's actions were not as \"dangerous\" as those of fugitive leaker Edward Snowden. Earnest also noted that Manning had answered for her actions in court, and admitted wrongdoing. More than 117,000 people signed a petition asking the White House to consider the commutation. Snowden, whose supporters had petitioned for clemency, tweeted that if Obama could only free one person, it should be Manning. Mr. President, if you grant only one act of clemency as you exit the White House, please: free Chelsea Manning. You alone can save her life. \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) January 11, 2017 WikiLeaks tweeted last week that founder Julian Assange would agree to be extradited to the U.S. if Obama granted clemency to Manning, but the status of that offer was unclear. White House officials said Wikileaks' statement played no role in the decision. They noted that Manning had accepted responsibility, expressed remorse and served time. Evan Greer of Fight for the Future, the organization that sponsored the petition, said she was \"overjoyed\" at the news. \"I think her freedom and this news today is a testament to the power of grassroots organizing,\" Greer said. \"I think Chelsea showed incredible courage herself and that inspired her supporters to persevere even when it seemed like freedom was completely impossible.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan called the commutation \"outrageous\" and said it set \"a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won't be held accountable for their crimes.\" Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, leaves a military court facility in 2013. SAUL LOEB / AFP - Getty Images Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., blasted the decision. \"When I was leading soldiers in Afghanistan, Private Manning was undermining us by leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks,\" he said. \"I don't understand why the president would feel special compassion for someone who endangered the lives of our troops, diplomats, intelligence officers, and allies. We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr.\" Manning \u2014 then known as Bradley \u2014 was locked up in 2010 after swiping 700,000 military files and diplomatic cables and giving them to WikiLeaks. No document was classified higher than secret and her defenders say no one was endangered by the leaks. At trial, prosecutors said she was a dangerous traitor, while her lawyers portrayed her as a naive whistleblower. The day after her sentencing, she announced she was a transgender woman. Play ",

Among others, Obama pardoned James \"Hoss\" Cartwright, who was facing a long prison sentence for talking to New York Times reporter David Sanger about the top secret Stuxnet program that infected Iran's nuclear program with a computer virus. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright prepares to testify before the House Armed Services Committee about missile defense October 1, 2009 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Sanger and other journalists pleaded for leniency for Cartwright, a retired four star Marine general who was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011, arguing that he was trying to talk the Times out of publishing the report \u2014 not leaking sensitive information. Cartwright later plead guilty to making false statements during a federal investigation. In all, Obama granted 209 commutations and 64 pardons on Tuesday. Also receiving a pardon was baseball of Hall of Famer Willie McCovey , who in 1996 was fined and given two years' probation for failing to pay taxes on income he earned from 1988 to 1990, from selling sports memorabilia and signing autographs.

Eric Risberg / AP Ian Schrager, the nightclub impresario whose Studio 54 was the place to be in 1970's Manhattan, also got a presidential pardon. He and co-founder Steve Rubell did time for tax evasion. Ian Schrager attends the Haute Living New York City Real Estate Summit on Nov. 14, 2013 in New York City. Craig Barritt / Getty Images for Haute Living Dwight Loving, one of the few members of the U.S. military on Death Row, had his sentence commuted to life without parole. He had been convicted of killing two taxicab drivers in 1988 while he was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. He has been on death row for more than 27 years. Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez , who was serving 55 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the U.S. government and an additional 15 years for conspiring to escape from Leavenworth federal prison, had his sentence commuted. The 74-year-old former leader of the FALN movement will be released by May 17. People march to demand the release of Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera near the White House in Washington, DC, on January 11, 2017. NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP - Getty Images Not on Obama's list of people receiving pardons was David Petreaus, a four star general and former CIA director who in 2015 was sentenced to two years probation and a $100,000 fine for giving classified information to his mistress.

Gallery: The Legacy of First Lady Michelle Obama Obama's fashion choices \"changed the game\", style experts say. \"It's like my music,\" Obama said at a White House roundtable in 2011. \"Everything in my closet is something that I love, so that I can make choices based on what makes sense, knowing that I'm going to love whatever it is. I think that tends to be my philosophy.\" She's a first lady who felt equally comfortable donning sleeveless dresses with floral prints or wearing a Wes Gordon metallic houndstooth jacket and high waist skinny jeans. First lady Michelle Obama smiles on stage at Nickelodeon's 25th annual Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 31, 2012. Mario Anzuoni / Reuters Obama has a conservative style that appeals to the office, but also a trendy side that appeals to the masses, said Joiee Thorpe, fashion editor for Essence Magazine. As one of the first women in the White House with a statuesque figure, Obama knows and is confident about what works for her physique, Thorpe added.

She wears a dress and it sells out immediately.\" At President Obama's final state of the union address, the first lady wore a sleeveless, marigold midi dress by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez. The dress originally priced at $2,095.00 and on sale for $628 at Neiman Marcus, was sold out before the president finished his speech and set social media abuzz.

The shoes retail at $245 and are so popular they are hard to keep in stock to this day. She has raised the fashion bar for other first ladies to follow, making room for them to play with their own style. \"First ladies will be comfortable making choices if they're the type of person who likes fashion. They will no longer be afraid to make decisions that aren't ultra conservative. They won't be afraid to expose their shoulders or wear a pencil skirt or wear prints and patterns.\" First lady Michelle Obama poses in the White House Green Room in Washington in 2013. Ben Baker / Redux She is not only a trendsetter with her wardrobe, she also set trends by changing up her hairstyle. In August 2013, she rocked honey blonde highlights at a Washington D.C. movie premiere and wore the same highlight in layers in March 2014. But whether it's long tresses with a bang or a bob cut with a deep middle part, her hair was always flawless for the occasion at hand, Thorpe said adding \"how hair goes with an outfit makes a big difference.\" RELATED: The First Lady Joins Snapchat as 'MichelleObama' \"First and foremost, I wear what I love,\" she said in an interview in 2009 with Vogue. \"That's what women have to focus on: what makes them happy and what makes them feel comfortable and beautiful.

Putin suggested the outgoing Obama administration was trying to undermine Trump by spreading \"fake\" rumors despite Trump's \"convincing\" victory. \"First of all, it seems like he got his copy of the talking points,\" Earnest told ABC News' chief White House correspondent, Jonathan Karl. \"From who?\" Karl asked. \"Well, I don't know,\" Earnest said. \"It certainly sounds a lot like what the incoming administration's team is saying.\" Trump's CIA Rebukes Create 'Unprecedented' Feud With Intelligence Agencies The response from Trump and his team to a leaked dossier with unsubstantiated allegations that Russia holds compromising information on him has been swift, dismissing the claims as \"fake news\" and \"nonsense.\" Trump, who has been at odds with the intelligence community, even suggested that intelligence agencies \"allowed\" the dossier to be leaked, despite Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's saying in a statement that the dossier circulated for months before the intelligence community became aware of it. Clapper also said in the statement, \"This document is not a U.S. intelligence community product, and ... I do not believe the leaks came from within the [intelligence community].\" The spat became a war of words between Trump and outgoing CIA Director John Brennan , who Trump suggested Sunday evening could be behind the dossier's leak. much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2017 Earnest said Trump's \"deeply misguided\" comments lined up with Putin's accusations. \"Particularly to call into question the integrity of somebody like John Brennan, somebody who has served at the CIA for three decades, somebody who has served the country in dangerous locations around the world to try to keep us safe \u2014 I'm offended by it,\" Earnest said. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. 0 Shares ",

Helderman January 17 at 6:12 PM Follow @PostRoz A former contestant on the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d filed a defamation lawsuit Tuesday against President-elect Donald Trump over his response to her allegations that he groped her during a job interview in 2007. Summer Zervos, a California restaurant owner who appeared on the show in 2006, accused Trump of aggressively kissing and grabbing her when she went to his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization a year later. In her suit, Zervos alleges that Trump defamed her when he denied her account of their interactions in the hotel room, accusing her and other women who made similar accusations of lying and fabricating their accounts. Zervos said she would drop her lawsuit, which was filed in New York, without seeking monetary damages if Trump would retract his claim that she lied and acknowledge his actions. Zervos appeared at a Los Angeles news conference alongside her lawyer, Gloria Allred, who said Zervos took and passed a lie-detector test before filing her suit. (Reuters) \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Allred said. \u201cTruth matters. Women matter, those who allege they were victims of sexual misconduct or sexual assault by Mr. Trump matter.\u201d Allred said that as the lawsuit proceeds, she would seek to depose Trump under oath and could also seek to subpoena recordings Trump made during tapings of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded in a statement: \u201cMore of the same from Gloria Allred. There is no truth to this absurd story.\u201d Eleven women spoke publicly before the election, accusing Trump of inappropriately touching or kissing them. They stepped forward after Trump denied ever touching a woman without her consent during a presidential debate in October. \u201cHave you ever done those things?\u201d Trump was asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, regarding comments Trump made during a taping of \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d in 2005, when he bragged about groping and kissing women without their permission. \u201cI will tell you: No, I have not,\u201d Trump responded. During the campaign, Trump asserted that each of his accusers was lying and vowed to sue the women for making the claims. \u201cTotal fabrication,\u201d he said during a campaign rally in Gettysburg, Pa., in October. \u201cThe events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\u201d Summer Zervos listens as her attorney Gloria Allred speaks during a news conference announcing the filing of a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday in Los Angeles. (Mike Blake/Reuters) Without evidence, he said the women were coordinating with the campaign of his rival, Hillary Clinton. He also mocked some of the women, suggesting they were not attractive enough for him to sexually harass. [ Here are the women who accused Donald Trump of inappropriate touching ] \u201cWhen you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said, \u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 \u201d Trump said at a rally about one of his accusers, a People Magazine reporter who said Trump shoved her against a wall and forcibly kissed her while she was at his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on assignment in 2005. Trump has not yet filed suit against any of the women. The Supreme Court has ruled that presidents can be sued while in office over their private conduct or activities before their election. The ruling came after President Bill Clinton sought to have a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Arkansas state worker Paula Jones delayed until after he left office. The Clinton case shows the potential peril of such suits for a sitting president. Clinton ultimately settled with Jones, but allegations that he had lied under oath during a deposition in the matter about his relations with intern Monica Lewinsky led to his impeachment. Trump has already settled other lawsuits to ensure they do not linger into his presidency. In November, he agreed to pay $25\u00a0million to settle lawsuits accusing his defunct real estate seminar program Trump University of fraud. He did not admit fault. In her suit, Zervos asserted that she had gone to the Los Angeles hotel to discuss a possible job with Trump after he had been complimentary of her performance on the television show. In the room, she alleged that Trump kissed her aggressively and groped her breast. As she attempted to reject his advances, she said Trump steered her toward the bedroom, saying, \u201clet\u2019s lay down and watch some telly telly.\u201d \u201cCome on man, get real,\u201d she replied, according to the suit. Trump then \u201crepeated her words back to her lasciviously, drawing out the second word and saying, \u2018get reeeeal,\u2019 as he began to press his genitals against her, trying to kiss her again,\u201d the suit alleges. Immediately after leaving Trump, Zervos told her father about the encounter, according to the suit. Zervos said she excused Trump\u2019s behavior for years, particularly because she was ultimately offered a job at the Trump Organization, but she had been compelled to step forward after hearing the presidential candidate brag to \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush about behaving similarly with other women. According to the suit, the tape convinced Zervos that Trump was \u201ca sexual predator who had preyed on her and other women.\u201d She claimed his dismissal of her as a \u201cphony\u201d and her account as a \u201choax\u201d had resulted in lost business for her restaurant and emotional distress. Zervos is one of four of Trump\u2019s accusers represented by Allred, who also represents more than two dozen women who have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault. In the suit, Zervos alleges that Trump knew his statements were defamatory, not just because he knew the truth of their interactions but also because he knew \u201che engaged regularly in this kind of unwanted sexual touching for years, and that was, in fact, how he treated women routinely and how he lived his life.\u201d If the case is allowed to proceed, the claim could allow Allred to explore other allegations made by women against Trump. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Jesse Jackson Jr. and wife Sandi Jackson arrive for their sentencing hearing Aug. 14, 2013, in Washington, D.C. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Kim Janssen Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Former Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy has been subpoenaed by lawyers handling former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. 's divorce from former Ald. Sandi Jackson. Court papers filed late Tuesday demand that McCarthy turn over any emails, text messages, phone records or social media exchanges he had with Sandi Jackson, as well as details of any financial relationship they might have had. Two other men \u2014 Chicago cop James Love and McCarthy business partner Richard Simon \u2014 are also targeted in identical subpoenas. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s lawyer, Brendan Hammer, last month alleged that Sandi Jackson committed \"acts\" in Illinois that led her husband to file for divorce but declined to say what those acts were, mysteriously commenting only that the acts \"could be from the benign, to the sublime, to the malign.\" Neither McCarthy nor  Love nor Sandi Jackson's attorney immediately responded to requests for comment, while Simon said in an emailed statement that he was \"shocked that I am included in this fishing expedition.\" But the development is likely to raise eyebrows and increase attention on a case that was already high-profile. The increasingly bitter divorce comes after the Jacksons' dramatic fall from power. Both served prison time after they were convicted of a scheme in which Jackson Jr. violated federal campaign law by using campaign funds to make personal purchases, including a fedora that once belonged to Michael Jackson and cashmere capes. Full text: Garry McCarthy subpoena Read the story Jackson Jr. filed for divorce in Chicago last year while his wife  was still in prison. She later filed her own divorce case in Washington, D.C., where she is living with the couple's two children. Whether the case is fought in Chicago or the nation's capital may turn on whether Hammer can prove Sandi Jackson committed acts in Illinois that led to the divorce. Tuesday's subpoenas demand that McCarthy and the other men turn over any gifts that they have given Sandi Jackson, or that she has given them, as well as any \"cards, letters, notes etc.\" The subpoenas also demand the men hand over copies of any \"films, videos ... photos ... that you received from Sandi, that you sent to Sandi, and/or that reflect you and Sandi together,\" as well as records related to any trips or outings they took together. It further demands copies of checks \"given, sold, exchanged, traded or bartered to Sandi or for her benefit\" as well as details about whether any of the men paid for her attorney fees, groceries, rent, mortgage, repairs to her home or her clothing.

Scott Applewhite/AP House Speaker Paul Ryan, joined by (from left) Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Diane Black, discuss their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Jan. 10. J. Scott Applewhite/AP A partial repeal of Obamacare could leave 18 million people who have insurance today with no coverage one year later, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . The report estimates that 32 million people would lose their insurance over 10 years. The CBO based its estimates on a bill passed by Republicans and vetoed by President Obama in 2015. That bill amounted to a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, eliminating the penalty for people who didn't have health insurance. It also cut out the government subsidies that currently help people pay their premiums. The CBO estimated that getting rid of the penalty for people who do not purchase insurance would lead to 18 million fewer insured people within a year and that the number would eventually grow to 32 million after subsidies and a Medicaid expansion were also eliminated. As NPR's Alison Kodjak reported, \"congressional Republicans haven't introduced legislation to repeal Obamacare yet [this year], but they've suggested they'll follow the model of the previous [2015] bill.\" So far, lawmakers pushing for the repeal have no plan for encouraging people to have insurance without the mandate and subsidies.

We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.\" Trump will be administered the oath by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. When Vice President-elect Mike Pence takes his oath, he'll be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, using the Bible that President Reagan used for both of his inaugurals as well as when he was sworn in as governor of California. Thomas will be the first African-American person to administer the oath to a vice president or president. NPR thanks our sponsors ",

Laura Delmond, 53, was spotted last Tuesday sitting upright in the back of a San Francisco Muni bus, according to David Robson, Laura\u2019s brother. The driver of that bus said Laura was already dead when she was found. Reportedly, the Laura recently had shoulder surgery in Marin County only a few miles from a SoulCycle gym where 48-year-old Sevin Philips, who died of meningitis on Jan. 7 , worked out. David Robson told KPIX that his sister was not a member of that gym but that she was sick in the days before she was found dead. He believes pain medication she was taking may have masked some of the symptoms of meningitis. \u201cShe did have a severe headache and a slight fever. She said that her feet were cold but she didn\u2019t complain about neck pain,\u201d Robson said. \u201cShe was taking painkillers because she\u2019d had surgery recently on her shoulder.\u201d Robson says he\u2019s mystified and mourning a beloved sister with a bright smile and big heart. \u201cShe was a very outgoing, sweet person with a lot of friends,\u201d Robson said. A complete autopsy by the San Mateo County Coroner\u2019s Office has yet to be completed. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "GM to Add or Keep 7,000 US Jobs, Make $1B Factory Investment By tom krisher, ap auto writer DETROIT \u0097 Jan 17, 2017, 11:43 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Ford Cancels Plans for Factory in Mexico 0 Shares Email General Motors plans to invest $1 billion in U.S. factories and add thousands of new white-collar jobs, measures that have been in the works for years but were announced Tuesday after criticism from President-elect Donald Trump. In all, the Detroit automaker said it will create or keep 7,000 jobs in the next few years, including about 2,000 at factories. Another 5,000 new positions will be created at its auto financing arm and to develop advanced technology, electric and autonomous vehicles and information technology. Trump has demanded the auto industry build more cars in the U.S. GM said these latest actions have been in the works since well before the election, although spokesman Patrick Morrissey acknowledged it's a good time to announce new jobs in the U.S. Trump will be sworn in as the nation's 45th president Friday. \"There's no question there is an emphasis on job creation in the U.S. right now,\" he said. \"This is good timing for us to share what we are doing.\" Morrissey said most of the new positions would be in Michigan, with exact locations to be revealed at a later date. The long-planned new white-collar jobs will come in the next two or three years. GM said the factory investment will create or keep around 1,500 jobs at unspecified factories. In addition, 450 new pickup truck axle-making jobs that will be moved to Michigan from Mexico. GM also said an unidentified company that will make parts for the next-generation pickups will move 100 jobs from Mexico to Michigan. Trump has attacked GM and other automakers for building vehicles in Mexico and shipping them to the U.S. He has threatened to impose a 35 percent border tax on automotive imports from Mexico. Ford Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. LLC have also recently announced large investments in their U.S. operations and the creation of new jobs. It's a pattern of auto companies making routine jobs announcements to head off criticism from Trump, who made keeping U.S. factory jobs a key element of his campaign. \"General Motors' announcement today is mostly theater to play in the news cycle created by President-elect Trump's tweets,\" said Michelle Krebs, an auto industry analyst for Kelley Blue Book . \"These investments and hiring plans have long been in the works.\" Still, Trump claimed credit for bringing auto jobs on Twitter Tuesday morning. \"With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country ... I believe the people are seeing 'big stuff,'\" he wrote. His tweet was only partially true. No automaker has announced plans to build a new U.S. factory in recent years, but jobs have been added at existing plants. On the eve of the Detroit auto show last week, GM CEO Mary Barra said the company has no plans to change where it produces small cars in light of Trump's threats. Trump threatened GM with a tax for importing some Chevrolet Cruze hatchback compact cars from Mexico. Most Cruzes sold in the U.S. are sedans built in Ohio. GM said it has invested more than $21 billion in the U.S. and created 25,000 jobs, including 19,000 white-collar and 6,000 blue-collar positions since it left bankruptcy protection in 2009. Earlier Tuesday, Hyundai said it will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. while Trump is president and is considering building a new U.S. factory. It didn't provide further details and denied that political pressure was behind the company's announcement of a $3.1 billion U.S. investment plan by 2021. Earlier this month, Ford announced it had scrapped plans to build a new $1.6 billion small-car factory in Mexico while Fiat Chrysler announced a $1 billion investment plan in its two U.S. factories. Although Ford announced plans for 700 new jobs in Michigan, it still plans to build the compact Ford Focus in Mexico, but at an existing factory. Jobs at the plant that now builds the Focus in suburban Detroit will remain because the plant will build a new SUV and small pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler's job announcements were part of a plan announced last year to get out of the small and midsize car business and shift production to trucks and SUVs, including a new Jeep pickup. Nearly all automakers build small cars in Mexico to take advantage of its lower wages to offset lower prices and profit margins on the cars. 0 Shares ",

His only checked baggage was a gun, according to Ferlazzo. After retrieving his bag, Santiago allegedly loaded the weapon in the bathroom and re-entered the baggage claim area, aiming at people's heads and bodies and walking while shooting. Joe Raedle/Getty Images First responders secure the area outside the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport after a shooting took place near the baggage claim, on Jan. 6, 2017, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Authorities interviewed Santiago after his capture. According to the FBI, Santiago said he carried out the attack because the government was \"controlling his mind.\" Later, at the FBI office in Miami, authorities say Santiago mentioned ISIS and admitted to participating in Jihadi chat rooms and communicating with like-minded individuals who were planning attacks. He is facing federal charges of performing an act of violence against a person at an airport that caused serious bodily injury; causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm; and using and carrying a firearm in a crime of violence, according to Ferlazzo. He has not entered a plea. His next court date was set for Jan. 30. 0 Shares ",
