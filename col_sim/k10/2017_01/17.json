NASA hide caption toggle caption NASA Gene Cernan prepares for his 1969 Apollo 10 flight, adjusting his headset outside a lunar module simulator. NASA The last person to leave footprints on the moon has died. NASA reported that Gene Cernan died Monday at the age of 82, surrounded by his family. Gene Cernan flew in space three times, including twice to the moon. Cernan was big, brash and gregarious. And if he hadn't been lucky, he could have missed his chance to walk on the moon. Cernan challenged himself his whole life. When he entered the military, he chose to be a naval aviator. Landing on an aircraft carrier is perhaps the hardest thing to do in aviation. Cernan did it because it wasn't easy. He said he was constantly pushing himself to do better and be better. Astronaut Gene Cernan salutes the U.S. flag during his moonwalk in 1972. No one else has been there since Apollo 17 left. NASA hide caption toggle caption NASA Astronaut Gene Cernan salutes the U.S. flag during his moonwalk in 1972. No one else has been there since Apollo 17 left. NASA \"My dad always used to say, 'Just go out and do your best. You're not going to be better than everyone at everything.' And he was right,\" Cernan said, \"I wasn't. But he was also right one other time when he said, 'Someday you're going to surprise yourself. Just do your best and someday you're going to surprise yourself.' \" Article continues after sponsorship Cernan's final trip in space was also the final time NASA sent people to the moon, the Apollo 17 mission , which took off on Dec. 7, 1972. 'Hidden Figures' No More: Meet The Black Women Who Helped Send America To Space Four days later, Cernan landed the lunar module on the moon with astronaut Harrison 'Jack' Schmitt. Cernan couldn't hide his enthusiasm as he exited the spacecraft, saying, \"We'd like to dedicate the first steps of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible. Oh my golly! Unbelievable!\" Decades later, Cernan reflected on that moment in a 2015 NPR interview, no less thrilled to be the last, rather than the first, to go there. \"The first steps had been made by others long before I got there. But those were my first steps.\" Gene Cernan in the Apollo 17 lunar module after one of three moonwalks. NASA hide caption toggle caption Gene Cernan in the Apollo 17 lunar module after one of three moonwalks. NASA Cernan is one of only three people to travel to the moon twice (Jim Lovell and John Young were the others). Before Apollo 17, he flew on Apollo 10, which was the mission just before the first lunar landing. On Gemini 9 in 1966, he conducted the second American spacewalk (which almost ended in disaster). Cernan had trouble controlling his body in the weightlessness of space. He became exhausted. His visor fogged up and he barely had the strength to get back into the capsule and close the hatch. \"Fate played another trick because I might not have come home from that flight. We didn't know much about what we're doing [yet].\" Dreaming big and working hard were two things Cernan always did. He grew up in Chicago. Neither of his parents went to college, but he earned several degrees in engineering.

Matt Sayles/Invision/AP Despite Cernan's technical background, his time on the moon and in space forever altered his life. Cernan said he gained a new perspective, because \"when you leave the Earth, it's not only technologically different \u2014 it's philosophically different and it's spiritually different.\" Many astronauts had difficulty describing what it was actually like to be in space \u2014 not in the technical sense, but in finding the words to share that remarkable experience. He chronicled some of them in his 2016 documentary , Last Man on the Moon. \"Many of the astronauts didn't really know how to describe that because that's not what they were going there for,\" said Francis French of the San Diego Air and Space Museum, who has written many books on the space program. \"Gene Cernan in the decades after his mission really reflected on that and he [very well described] what that's like.\" There's something else about Cernan: He had the opportunity to land on the moon during an earlier mission, Apollo 16, as the pilot. But he turned it down, because he wanted to be commander, in charge of the mission. \"I sort of felt like I'd been an underdog most of my life,\" he recalled. \"[Achieving the command of Apollo 17], I proved to myself that I was good enough. That I could get the job done. That was a big point in my life.\" Cernan spent his post-NASA life trying to inspire young people. He once said, \"Dream the impossible \u2014 and go out and make it happen. I walked on the moon. What can't you do?\" ",

Authorities said the gunman fired 180 rounds of 7.62-mm bullets, which are commonly used in AK-47 assault rifles. The attacker also used flares to illuminate the inside of the nightclub during the attack, according to police. Police said they don't believe the weapon used in the attack came from inside Turkey. The serial number on the weapon had been defaced. Between 400 and 500 people were in attendance at the Reina nightclub to ring in the new year. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, which was in response to Turkey's military operations against the group, ISIS propaganda channels said in a statement. ",

    "text": "Gene Cernan, Last Astronaut to Walk on the Moon, Dies at 82 By michael graczyk and seth borenstein, associated press HOUSTON \u0097 Jan 16, 2017, 5:16 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Gene Cernan, Last Astronaut on the Moon, Dies 0 Shares Email Former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last person to walk on the moon who returned to Earth with a message of \"peace and hope for all mankind,\" died on Monday in Texas following ongoing heath issues, his family said. He was 82. Cernan was with his relatives when he died at a Houston hospital, family spokeswoman Melissa Wren told The Associated Press. His family said his devotion to lunar exploration never waned. \"Even at the age of 82, Gene was passionate about sharing his desire to see the continued human exploration of space and encouraged our nation's leaders and young people to not let him remain the last man to walk on the Moon,\" his family said in a statement released by NASA. Cernan was commander of NASA's Apollo 17 mission and on his third space flight when he set foot on the lunar surface in December 1972. He became the last of only a dozen men to walk on the moon on Dec. 14, 1972 \u2014 tracing his only child's initials in the dust before climbing the ladder of the lunar module the last time. It was a moment that forever defined him in both the public eye and his own. \"Those steps up that ladder, they were tough to make,\" Cernan recalled in a 2007 oral history. \"I didn't want to go up. I wanted to stay a while.\" Cernan called it \"perhaps the brightest moment of my life. ... It's like you would want to freeze that moment and take it home with you. But you can't.\" Decades later, Cernan tried to ensure he wasn't the last person to walk on the moon, testifying before Congress to push for a return. But as the years went by he realized he wouldn't live to witness someone follow in his footsteps \u2014 still visible on the moon more than 40 years later. \"Neil (Armstrong, who died in 2012) and I aren't going to see those next young Americans who walk on the moon. And God help us if they're not Americans,\" Cernan testified before Congress in 2011. \"When I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That's my big goal.\" Cernan died less than six weeks after another American space hero, John Glenn , the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Their flights weren't the first or last of the Mercury and Apollo eras. Yet to the public they were the bookends of America's space age glory, starting with Godspeed John Glenn and ending with Cernan's footprints on the moon. On Dec. 11, 1972, Cernan guided the lander, named Challenger, into a lunar valley called Taurus-Littrow, with Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt at his side. He recalled the silence after the lunar lander's engine shut down. \"That's where you experience the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime,\" Cernan said in 2007. \"There's no vibration. There's no noise. The ground quit talking. Your partner is mesmerized. He can't say anything. \"The dust is gone. It's a realization, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there (somewhere in the) universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by human beings \u2014 human eyes \u2014 for the first time.\" Three days earlier, Cernan, Schmitt and Ronald Evans had blasted off atop a Saturn rocket in the first manned nighttime launch from Kennedy Space Center . Evans remained behind as pilot of the command module that orbited the moon while the other two landed on the moon's surface. Cernan and Schmitt, a geologist, spent more than three days on the moon, including more than 22 hours outside the lander, and collected 249 pounds of lunar samples. \"In that whole three days, I don't think there's anything that became routine,\" Cernan recalled. \"But if I had to focus on one thing ... it was just to look back at the overwhelming and overpowering beauty of this Earth.\" \"To go a quarter of a million miles away into space and have to take time out to sleep and rest ... I wished I could have stayed awake for 75 hours straight. I knew when I left I'd never have a chance to come back.\" Completing their third moon walk on Dec. 14, Schmitt returned to the lunar module and was followed by Cernan. \"We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind,\" Cernan said. He later acknowledged that he had grasped for words to leave behind, knowing how the world remembered Neil Armstrong's \"giant leap for mankind\" on stepping on the moon in 1969. Before heading home, Cernan said he drew the letters \"TDC\" \u2014 the initials of his then 9-year-old daughter, Teresa Dawn \u2014 with his finger on the dusty gray lunar surface. He said he imagined someone in the distant future would find \"our lunar rover and our footprints and those initials and say, 'I wonder who was here? Some ancient civilization was here back in the 20th century, and look at the funny marks they made.'\" Eugene A. Cernan was born in 1934 in Chicago and graduated from Indiana's Purdue University in 1956 with a degree in electrical engineering. (Armstrong also was a Purdue grad.) He had been a Navy attack pilot and earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering when NASA selected him in October 1963 as one of 14 members of its third astronaut class. Cernan had the looks of an astronaut from central casting. \"He's your classic sort of handsome debonair flyboy,\" said space historian Roger Launius, associate director of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. In 1966, he was pilot of Gemini 9, a three-day flight with command pilot Tom Stafford where they used different techniques to rendezvous with a docking adapter that was previously launched. On the flight, Cernan became the second American to walk in space, spending more than two hours outside the Gemini spacecraft. Cernan would later call the mission, \"that spacewalk from hell.\" \"It was very serious,\" said Launius, the historian. \"He lost all kinds of water, his equipment did not work effectively. He overheated. His visor glossed over with water, he could barely see. He barely got back in the spacecraft.\" Cernan's sweat so much he lost 13 pounds. The space agency was forced to go back to the drawing board. \"That was a really important learning experience,\" Launius said. \"The difficult thing about that is they put an astronaut's life at great risk there. They learned the lesson.\" With the Apollo program under way, Cernan flew on Apollo 10 in May 1969. It was a dress rehearsal for the lunar landing on the next flight and took Cernan and Stafford, aboard the lunar module Snoopy, to within 9? miles of the moon's surface. The mission was marked by a glitch when the wrong guidance system was turned on and the lunar module went out of control before Stafford righted it by taking manual control. Cernan often joked that his job was to paint a white line to the moon that Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 crew could follow. Yet Cernan was one of only three people to voyage twice to the moon \u2014 either to its surface or in moon orbit. James Lovell and John Young are the others. In 1973, Cernan became special assistant to the program manager of the Apollo program at Johnson Space Center in Houston, assisting in planning and development of the U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz mission. He was senior U.S. negotiator with the Soviets on the test project. He retired from NASA three years later. He worked for a Houston energy firm, Coral Petroleum, then in 1981 began his own aerospace consulting company. He eventually became chairman of an engineering firm that worked on NASA projects. He also worked as a network television analyst during shuttle flights in the 1980s. A documentary about his life, \"The Last Man on the Moon\" was released in 2016. Teresa was Cernan's only child with his wife Barbara. The couple married in 1961 and divorced 20 years later. In 1987, he married again, to Jan Nanna, and they lived in Houston. In all, Cernan logged 566 hours and 15 minutes in space, more than 73 hours of them on the moon's surface. \"I can always walk on Main Street again, but I can never return to my Valley of Taurus-Littrow, and that cold fact has left me with a yearning restlessness,\" he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, also entitled \"The Last Man on the Moon.\" \"It was perhaps the brightest moment of my life, and I can't go back,\" he said. \"Enriched by a singular event that is larger than life, I no longer have the luxury of being ordinary.\" Cernan is survived by his wife, Jan Nanna Cernan, his daughter and son-in-law, Tracy Cernan Woolie and Marion Woolie, step-daughters Kelly Nanna Taff and husband, Michael, and Danielle Nanna Ellis and nine grandchildren. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Borenstein reported from Washington.

The Miami Herald reports that hundreds of people had gathered in the park after the annual MLK Day parade. (Photo: Carl Juste, Miami Herald via AP) Eight people were shot Monday afternoon at a Miami park, disrupting an otherwise peaceful afternoon commemorating Martin Luther King Jr., police said. Five minors and three adults were shot around 3:40 p.m. at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park, Miami-Dade police said in a statement. Several more were injured as a shooting sparked a stampede out of the park, which had wrapped up celebrations for Martin Luther King Jr. Day a couple of hours before,\u00a0 The Miami Herald reported. Most of the shooting victims, ranging from ages 11 to 30, are in stable condition or were released for minor injuries, but one victim, a 20-year-old man, is listed in critical condition, police said. The park was evacuated when police arrived to investigate. They\u00a0detained two people for questioning and seized two firearms, but police don't know if there are other suspects at large. \"Our primary concern is the safety of the community,\" Miami-Dade detective Daniel Ferrin said. \"Therefore residents are encouraged to remain indoors until the investigation has concluded.\" Th annual Martin Luther King Jr. parade, one of several across the country honoring the civil rights leader, finished a few hours earlier. It was followed by the Pan-African & Caribbean Family Festival at the park, though it is unclear whether the shooting had any connection to the festival.

    "text": "By Steven Overly January 16 at 11:50 AM Follow @stevenoverly Attendees stand near BMW signage during the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Jan. 10. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) President-elect Donald Trump threatened German automakers with a hefty import tax if they plan to sell cars in the United States that were built in other countries, repeating a claim that has shaken the global automotive industry and its biggest players at home and abroad . The latest promise to impose tariffs on imported cars was made to\u00a0the\u00a0German newspaper Bild. In a translated interview, the newspaper quoted Trump as saying:\u00a0\u201cIf you want to build cars in the world, then I wish you all the best. You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax.\u201d \u201cI would tell BMW that if you are building a factory in Mexico and plan to sell cars to the USA, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that,\u201d Trump said. Reuters translated and reported on the remarks . Trump\u00a0has issued similar warnings, via Twitter, to Ford, GM and Toyota. But Reuters reports that the\u00a0proposition of a tariff has already stoked tensions in Germany, the largest U.S. trading partner in Europe and a key political ally throughout the Obama administration. German automakers sold approximately 1.3 million vehicles in the United States last year, WardsAuto data show, making up 7.6 percent of all new vehicle sales.\u00a0The most prominent brands in the United States include BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche. German manufacturers and suppliers increased their production of cars in the United States from 214,000 to 850,000 between 2009 and 2016, according to Matthias Wissmann, head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry. Speaking at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit last week, Wissmann said that 41 percent of those cars are sold in the United States and the rest are exported to other countries. German automakers employ 33,000 people in the United States and German suppliers count another 77,000, Wissmann said. The German Association of the Automotive Industry reiterated those figures Monday after Trump\u2019s comments were published. Wissmann said in a statement that it was unclear whether Trump\u2019s tariff threat would turn into actual policy, and whether such a policy would have the political support to\u00a0pass through Congress. Like most car manufacturers, German automakers have also expanded production in Mexico, where labor and global trade are cheaper than in the United States. BMW plans to construct a new plant in Mexico, which is expected to cost $1 billion and employ 1,500 workers. Reuters reports that BMW executive Peter Schwarzenbauer said that project would proceed unchanged. A spokesman for BMW in North America said the company\u2019s plant in Spartanburg, S.C. is its largest in the world, employing 8,800 people and manufacturing 411,000 vehicles in 2016. The company plans to invest another $1 billion there as it begins production of\u00a0the BMW X7 sport utility vehicle in 2018. \u201cThe issue is about commitment and BMW made a significant commitment to the U.S. when it began manufacturing vehicles in America more than 22 years ago,\u201d said spokesman Kenn Sparks.

Noor Zahi Salman, the wife of gunman Omar Mateen, was taken into custody Monday. (Chris O'Meara / Associated Press) Matt Pearce Contact Reporter The wife of a gunman in an attack at an Orlando, Fla., nightclub last summer that left 49 patrons\u00a0dead was arrested outside Oakland on Monday morning on suspicion of obstructing investigators, according to jail records. Noor Zahi Salman, the wife of gunman Omar Mateen , will face federal charges filed in central Florida after making an initial court appearance in Oakland scheduled for\u00a0Tuesday morning, federal prosecutors said in a brief message on Twitter, not giving further information. Documents laying out the government\u2019s case against Salman were not immediately available. But\u00a0Salman\u00a0faces a federal charge that is usually used against suspects who either tamper\u00a0with evidence or interfere\u00a0with an investigation, according to Alameda County jail records, which said\u00a0Salman was arrested at 8:13 a.m. in the East Bay suburb of Dublin. Read more stories Salman had previously denied any involvement in Mateen\u2019s attack on the\u00a0Pulse nightclub\u00a0on June\u00a012, 2016, during\u00a0which he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State extremist group.\u00a0Mateen was killed in a shootout with police during the attack. Salman had previously told the New York Times in an interview that Mateen was volatile and had often beat\u00a0her, and she had moved multiple times since the shooting to avoid public scrutiny. \u201cI was unaware of everything,\u201d Salman told the newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t condone what he has done.

Trump, left, shakes hands with Martin Luther King III as they exit the elevators in the lobby of the Trump Tower Monday, Jan. 16, 2017 in New York.\u00a0 President-Elect Donald J. Trump, left, shakes hands with Martin Luther King III as they exit the elevators in the lobby of the Trump Tower Monday, Jan. 16, 2017 in New York.\u00a0 (Anthony Behar / TNS) Shannon Pettypiece, Kathleen MillerThe Washington Post Donald Trump met Monday with Martin Luther King III, who said he used his time with the president-elect to discuss strategies to fix the U.S.'s \"broken voting system.\" The oldest son of the civil rights leader trekked to Trump Tower amid renewed tensions between the incoming president and African Americans over Trump's weekend twitter attack on another civil rights icon, Georgia Congressman John Lewis . King told reporters his conversation with Trump focused on boosting voting rights for those who feel their freedoms are under threat. \"We did have a very constructive meeting,\" said King, who arrived at Trump Tower on the U.S. holiday honoring his father. Trump has said that he is going to represent all Americans and \"I believe that is his intent,\" King added. Trump didn't take questions from reporters following the meeting. King III has advocated for the government to issue free photo-identification cards that citizens could use to vote if they lack a driver's license or another form of official ID. He said he would like Trump to direct the Social Security Administration to put a photo on the Social Security card of anyone who seeks such identification, or to direct the State Department to waive the $55 passport card fee for low-income Americans. \"Either approach is within the president's authority and would impose minimal costs to secure the most fundamental right for all Americans -- a right that most people consider priceless,\" King wrote in a Washington Post commentary. Martin Luther King Jr. , civil rights leaders and activists are trying to reconcile the transition from the nation's first black president to a president-elect still struggling to connect with most non-white voters. In more than one venue Monday, speakers and... As Americans celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. , civil rights leaders and activists are trying to reconcile the transition from the nation's first black president to a president-elect still struggling to connect with most non-white voters. In more than one venue Monday, speakers and... (Tribune news services) King wrote that minority vote totals had fallen from previous elections in battleground states that were key to Trump's victory, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The declines may be attributable to legislative efforts intended to make it harder to vote, King wrote. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said on Twitter Monday morning that the meeting with King III was intended to discuss his late father's legacy. Trump was initially planning to travel to Washington Monday to visit the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture, but canceled because of scheduling issues, ABC News reported, citing transition sources. A growing number of Democratic lawmakers have said they won't attend Trump's inauguration later this week following his criticism of Lewis, whose district includes much of Atlanta. The incoming president posted on Twitter Saturday that Lewis \"should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk -- no action or results. Sad!\" Marchers rallied in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day march that was at times also a rally against president-elect Donald Trump. The tweets came after Lewis, 76, said he didn't consider Trump a \"legitimate president\" because Russians helped him get elected. Lewis, who worked closely with Martin Luther King during the 1960s and suffered a cracked skull protesting for voting rights, made the comments in an interview with NBC News. \"In the heat of emotion, a lot of things get said on both sides,\" King III said in response to reporters' questions about the spat between Trump and Lewis. Trump has repeatedly rejected suggestions that hacking by Russia or other actors helped him win. He did concede last week that the Russian government was behind the hacking of Democratic Party computers and the leaking of internal e-mails, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded. --With assistance from Toluse Olorunnipa ",

John Lewis , a hero of the civil rights struggle. King, the oldest surviving child of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,\u00a0described the meeting at Trump Tower as constructive and said it had centered on efforts to improve the voting system. Asked by reporters about Trump\u2019s characterization Saturday of\u00a0Lewis\u00a0as \u201call talk \u2026 no action,\u201d King said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d disagreed. \u201cI would say John Lewis has demonstrated that he is action,\u201d\u00a0King said. But, he added, \u201cThings get said on both sides in the heat of emotion. And at some point in this nation, we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d The conflict between the president-elect and Lewis began Friday when NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d released video of Lewis saying he did not consider Trump a legitimate president. On Saturday, Trump responded via Twitter,\u00a0criticizing Lewis and referring to his Atlanta-area congressional district as downtrodden and crime-ridden. Actually, it includes many of the city's high-end areas. King said that Trump told him that he intended to represent all Americans. \u201cI believe that\u2019s his intent,\u201d King said. \u201cI believe we have to consistently engage with pressure, public pressure.\u201d In his reference to voting, King appeared to be referring to difficulties faced by African American voters, many of them due to restrictive laws put into effect by Republican legislators. Trump, during his campaign, suggested that voters in overwhelmingly African American cities like Philadelphia could be\u00a0planning to steal the election via voter fraud. After the meeting, Trump accompanied King down the elevator and shook his hand before returning upstairs. He did not speak to reporters. Latest updates ",

The rampage occurred inside the Blue Parrot nighclub in Playa del Carmen at about 2:30 a.m. local time, according to a statement by the attorney general of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Playa del Carmen is a popular tourist destination not far from Cancun. Among the dead are four men and a woman, including two people who were part of a security team, authorities said. The woman died from a fall in the incident. The state's attorney general, Miguel Angel Pech Cen, announced in a press conference that four of those who died are from other countries -- two from Canada, one from Italy and one who is \"apparently\" from Colombia. Among the wounded are two Americans, one from New York and the other from Texas. Both are among the eight discharged from treatment so far. Roo said the shooting is not being viewed as a terrorist attack. Festival organizers had earlier reported four fatalities. \"It is with great sadness to share that police have confirmed reports of a lone shooter outside the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa Del Carmen earlier today, which resulted in four fatalities and twelve injured,\" a statement early Monday by the BPM festival said . The BPM Festival is an annual 10-day electronic music festival started in 2008. This year, it was scheduled to last from Jan. 6 to Jan. 15. The shooting occurred on the last night of festivities. \"The violence began on 12th street in front of the club and three members of the BPM security team were among those whose lives were lost while trying to protect patrons inside the venue,\" the statement said.

He became the last man to walk on its surface so far. (Photo: NASA via THINKFilm) The\u00a0 last man to walk on the moon \u00a0died Monday at age 82 in Houston. Eugene \"Gene\" Cernan, then a Navy fighter pilot, was one of 14 astronauts that NASA chose in October 1963, its third astronaut class. His family said he had ongoing health issues, but his cause of death was not immediately known. He piloted the Gemini 9\u00a0mission\u00a0alongside command pilot Tom Stafford\u00a0and was the second American to walk in space. \u201cEven at the age of 82, Gene was passionate about sharing his desire to see the continued human exploration of space and encouraged our nation\u2019s leaders and young people to not let him remain the last man to walk on the moon,\u201d his family said in a statement that NASA released. Thanks, NASA! We made a virtual reality moon walk with your awesome pics Cernan\u00a0was one of only\u00a0two astronauts\u00a0to fly to the moon on two occasions, the second time as\u00a0commander of Apollo 17, the last\u00a0mission to the moon. In total, Cernan spent more than 73 hours on the satellite's surface. Apollo's moon-landing mission was on the surface for three days.\u00a0Cernan and crewmate Harrison H. \"Jack\" Schmitt complete excursions to nearby craters and the Taurus-Littrow mountains.

I wanted to stay a while.\u201d Two years earlier, NASA had announced that Apollo 17 would be the final mission of the Apollo program. Apollo 18, 19\u00a0and 20 had been canceled in favor of the Skylab space station, which launched May 14, 1973, but crashed to earth July 11, 1979, after its orbit began decaying. Decades later, Cernan testified before Congress to push for a return moon landing.\u00a0But as the years went by, he realized he wouldn\u2019t live to witness someone follow in his footsteps \u2014 still visible on the moon more than 40 years later. \u201cNeil (Armstrong, who died in 2012) and I aren\u2019t going to see those next young Americans who walk on the moon. And God help us if they\u2019re not Americans,\u201d Cernan testified before Congress in 2011. \u201cWhen I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That\u2019s my big goal.\u201d Fellow astronaut John Glenn, who in 1962 became the first American to orbit the earth, died five weeks before Cernan. Godspeed, John Glenn: People say goodbye to space-age hero Born in Chicago,\u00a0Cernan logged more than 5,000 flight hours before becoming an astronaut. After retiring from the space program in 1976, Cernan worked as an executive vice president of\u00a0Coral Petroleum\u00a0Inc. in Houston and later founded\u00a0Cernan Corp., which provided management and consulting services in the aerospace and energy industries.

Chaudary LAHORE, Pakistan - A prosecutor says a court has sentenced a woman to death for burning her daughter alive for marrying a man of her choice in eastern Pakistan. Abdur Rauf said judge Chaudhry Ilyas in eastern Lahore on Monday convicted Parveen Bibi of burning to death Zeenat Rafiq a week after her marriage to Hassan Khan last June. Rauf said the court sentenced Anees Rafique to life in prison for helping his mother kill his 18-year-old sister. Defense lawyer Shahid Iqbal said the son had no role in the killing and was wrongly convicted. Authorities say Bibi brought Rafiq back home with a promise of celebrating the wedding but burned her alive instead. Neighbors in the congested, working-class neighborhood in the sprawling eastern Pakistani city came running when they heard the screams, but family members kept them from entering the house, said Nighat Bibi, who lives nearby. The police eventually arrived and found the charred body near a staircase. They arrested the mother soon thereafter. info Hassan Khan shows the picture of his wife Zeenat Bibi, who was burnt alive by her mother, on his cellphone at his residence in Lahore on June 8, 2016.  A Pakistani mother burnt her 16-year-old daughter alive for marrying a man of her own choice, before running out into the street to tell neighbours she killed the teenager for dishonouring the family. / AFP / STR        (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images) Close STR/AFP/Getty Images The victim\u2019s husband, Hassan Khan, told reporters the two had been \u201cin love since our school days\u201d but the family had rejected several marriage proposals, forcing them to elope last month. He showed an affidavit of consent signed by his wife before a magistrate. He also showed cellphone photos of a smiling Zeenat wearing a red dress. Khan told Pakistani media that his wife had only returned to her own family for a visit after being assured it would be a celebration of her marriage, and she would not be harmed. He said he agreed reluctantly to let her return Akhtar, the a local police official, said Parveen confessed to killing her daughter with the help of her son Ahmar. He quoted the woman as saying \u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d Another police officer, Ibadat Nisar, said the body showed signs of beating and strangulation. For generations now in Pakistan, they\u2019ve called it\u00a0 \u201chonor\u201d killing , carried out in the name of a family\u2019s reputation. The killers routinely invoke Islam, but rarely can they cite anything other than their belief that Islam doesn\u2019t allow the mixing of sexes. Even Pakistan\u2019s hard-line Islamic Ideology Council, which is hardly known for speaking out to protect women, says the practice defies Islamic tenets. It doesn\u2019t matter: in slums and far-off villages, away from the cosmopolitan city centers, people live in a world where religion is inextricably tied to culture and tradition, where tribal councils can order women publicly punished, and a family can decide to kill one of its own, even to avenge a wrongdoing committed by someone else. In the vast majority of cases, the \u201chonor\u201d killer is a man and the victim is a woman. She is a sister who falls in love with a man not of her family\u2019s choosing. She is a daughter who refuses to agree to an arranged marriage, sometimes to a man old enough to be her father. She is a wife who can no longer stay in an abusive marriage and divorces her husband. He is a brother who cannot bear the taunts of other men brought up as he was, believing that women are subservient and must be kept in the shadows, their worth often measured by the number of sons they can produce. He is a neighbor who doesn\u2019t think his friend did anything wrong in taking his sister\u2019s life. He is a father who is angry about her killing not because she is dead, but because her death will reveal her \u201cshame\u201d to other members of the family and beyond. As modernity pushes against tradition , Pakistan has seen an increase in the number of women and girls killed in the name of honor: in 2015, 1,184 people died, only 88 of them men. The year before, the figure was 1005, and in 2013 it was 869, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. The true numbers are believed to be higher, because many cases go unreported. The killings have fueled a growing public outrage at the practice, and a chorus of voices saying that there is no honor in killing - only dishonor. They are working to close the legal loophole that lets killers go free. A proliferation of television channels and newspapers has brought the horrors of girls strangled, burned alive or shot in the head out of the secrecy of the home and into the public. But for many who have been fighting this kind of killing, it is the mindset of the boy who could kill his sister, or the parent who could kill a daughter, that has to be understood and changed. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "The woman's extremely rare infection has focused attention on the increasing problems surrounding these drug-resistant infections and the lack of antibiotics available to treat them. Fewer New Antibiotics Being Developed No matter how effective an antibiotic is at killing bacteria, new drugs will be needed as the bacteria mutate and grow more resistant to the existing drugs. \"Antibiotic resistance occurs as part of a natural evolution process, it can be significantly slowed but not stopped,\" the CDC notes on its website. \"New antibiotics will always be needed to keep up with resistant bacteria as well as new diagnostic tests to track the development of resistance.\" However, the number of drug applications for novel antibiotics being developed by pharmaceutical companies have been dropping steadily over the last three decades, according to the CDC. From 1980 to 1984, there were nearly 20 FDA drug applications approved for new antibiotics, but from 2005 to 2009, there were fewer than five applications approved, according to the CDC. In 2013, the CDC said developing new antibiotics and new diagnostic tests was one of its four core actions to stop antibiotic-resistant infections from increasing. CRE Infections Are an 'Urgent Threat' In 2013, CDC characterized CRE infections as an \"urgent\" threat, meaning the bacteria is an \"immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action.\" The bacteria cause 9,000 drug-resistant infections per year and 600 related deaths, according to the CDC. While most drug-resistant CRE bacteria are still susceptible to one or more antibiotic, in the infection of the woman in her 70's reported by the CDC, the bacteria was resistant to all FDA-approved antibiotics, an extremely rare event. CRE include common bacteria such as E.coli and Klebsiella bacteria. Doctors Can Attempt to Treat Even Drug-Resistant Infections When a patient has a drug-resistant bacteria, doctors will sometimes have to use harsher antibiotics or high dosages in order to try and fight the infection. If a patient has a drug-resistant infection, doctors will work with a lab to test different doses of various antibiotics in an effort to overwhelm and kill the bacteria, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. However, antibiotics can be taxing on the patient, especially if they are older and with underlying medical conditions. \"This is the kind of calculation you do with every patient,\" Schaffner said. \"Patients with underlying illnesses present a certain kind of challenge.\" The CDC authors reported that an intravenous version of an antibiotic called fosfomycin is available in other countries but not for use in the U.S. It's unclear if the patient's doctors attempted to get an FDA exemption to use the drug and treat the patient. Long Exposure to Antibiotics and Long Hospital Stays Can Be Dangerous While this recently reported case is frightening, it is also unusual. The patient had been in and out of hospitals in India for two years after fracturing the large femur bone in her leg and developing a bone infection. Long hospitals stays, especially in India, and exposure to different antibiotics can increase the likelihood of eventually developing a drug-resistant bacterial infection. As travel around the globe is becoming easier, it's increasingly important for doctors to find out where their patients may have acquired an infection, Schaffner said. \"India has a notorious reputation for this [type of bacteria,]\" he noted. \"Travel-related questions are becoming much more important ... and just reinforce that we are a very small world.\" 0 Shares ",

American Apparel began laying off 2,400 Southern California workers on Monday. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Shan Li American Apparel began to lay off 2,400 workers in Southern California on Monday \u2014 kicking off its final chapter as the country\u2019s largest garment maker. Layoffs will continue through the rest of the week and affect workers on the manufacturing and production side, American Apparel said. The company has about 3,500 factory workers in the Southland. Canadian clothing maker Gildan Activewear won an auction in bankruptcy court last week to buy the American Apparel brand and some manufacturing equipment for $88 million. The company will not assume American Apparel\u2019s leases on its factories. Until the sale closes in February, some workers are being kept on to operate the factories in downtown Los Angeles and in Garden Grove, as well as the distribution center in La Mirada. Some will also continue working in human resources and other departments to keep the company running. American Apparel\u2019s 110 stores and its website will remain open, until at least April, under a 100-day license with Gildan. On Monday, workers at the company\u2019s headquarters in downtown Los Angeles said they were shocked even though they had been warned in\u00a0December there might be mass layoffs.\u00a0Many said they had hoped Gildan or another company would come in and save jobs. Francesca Cortes, a seamstress who works on the overnight shift, said she was told to come into work on Monday for a possible shift change. Instead of a new schedule, she got her final paycheck and a termination letter. \u201cEverything is over,\u201d said Cortes, 48, who has worked seven years at American Apparel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get severance, like the workers who were laid off before got.\u201d Everything is over. We didn\u2019t even get severance, like the workers who were laid off before got. \u2014 Francesca Cortes, seamstress Still, Cortes said she hopes she can land another job soon. Her husband, a seamster for another local garment maker, is still employed \u2014 so the family is alright financially for now, she said. Some workers, such as Amada Cervantes, are not so lucky. The 66-year-old, who has worked sewing in downtown L.A. for a decade, lives by herself and has no family to lean on. In the last few years, her pay has dropped to about $350 a week from $500 as workers\u2019\u00a0 hours have been cut. \u201cThis is big for me,\u201d Cervantes said. \u201cI\u2019m worried because I am on my own. I\u2019m hoping unemployment will help until I find another job.\u201d American Apparel did find a buyer for its Garden Grove knitting and dyeing facility. Broncs Inc., a Compton textile manufacturer, said it would take over the lease starting March for between $200,000 to $250,000. American Apparel said Monday that the sale could save more than 300 jobs. However, Broncs owner Joel Chun told The Times that he plans to hire about 200 employees. The earliest they could start work is in March, when new machines are delivered, he said. For its part, Gildan said it has yet to decide where to make American Apparel goods. The company makes the bulk of its products in manufacturing hubs in Central America and the Caribbean. Although it has some production sites in the U.S., the only finished goods made here are socks. Gildan spokesman Garry Bell said Monday that the layoffs are a result of the American Apparel bankruptcy. \u201cOur agreement with them was always for assets, including the brand and some manufacturing equipment,\u201d Bell wrote in an email. \u201cIt was never to purchase an ongoing concern.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

    "text": "By John Wagner and Karen Tumulty January 16 at 5:48 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @ktumulty President Obama\u2019s first inaugural festivities stretched over five days. Donald Trump is spending barely three on his. Bill Clinton hit 14 official balls on the day he was sworn in. Trump plans appearances at three. And while other presidents have staged parades that lasted more than four hours, Trump\u2019s trip down Pennsylvania Avenue is expected to clock in at 90 minutes \u2014 making it among the shortest on record. In a word, the 45th president\u2019s inaugural activities will be \u201cworkmanlike,\u201d said Boris Epshteyn, communications director for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, a pop-up staff of about 350 people scrambling to put together the proceedings from the second floor of a nondescript government building just south of the Mall. The notion of a relatively low-key inaugural bereft of many \u00adA-list entertainers may come as a surprise, given the president-elect\u2019s flair for showmanship and his credentials as a reality TV star. Epshteyn said that Trump settled on a less flashy approach, however, including keeping the ticket prices for the inaugural balls at $50 apiece so that \u00adworking-class Americans who helped fuel Trump\u2019s victory can take part. A souvenir T-shirt bears the image of President-elect Donald Trump. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) Organizers are also expecting an unusually high number of protesters, given how divisive Trump\u2019s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was. And as of Monday afternoon, nearly three dozen Democratic lawmakers had said they plan to skip the festivities, after revelations of Russia\u2019s alleged inference in the election and Trump\u2019s \u00adrebuke of Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, on Saturday. \u201cThese inaugurations tend to reflect the character, personality and aspirations of the person preparing to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University. \u201cIt would be un-Trumpian for there not to be some spectacle.\u201d Early on, there was talk of something much flashier. Trump reportedly huddled with Mark Burnett, producer of his former hit show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d about parading down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where Trump Tower is located, then traveling by helicopter to Washington with the nation glued to TV screens. \u00adOthers suggested other flourishes, such as a grand unfurling of ceremonial flags as Trump passes by his hotel on Pennsylvania \u00adAvenue NW during the parade. Past presidents have sought to set a tone for their presidency with their inaugurations. John F. Kennedy\u2019s was a high point of style and elegance, a declaration that glamour had returned after the plain-Jane years of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Jimmy Carter, on the other hand, pressed the notion of a \u201cpeople\u2019s inauguration,\u201d noting at one point that the new first lady had opted to wear the same blue satin gown she had at his gubernatorial inauguration in Georgia six years earlier. Ronald Reagan, a Hollywood actor, amped up the glamour and pizazz. Bill Clinton embraced his baby boomer status, throwing a free concert that included an array of stars and a reformed Fleetwood Mac to perform its hit \u201cDon\u2019t Stop,\u201d which had become his campaign anthem. Building on his campaign theme of \u201chope and change,\u201d Obama\u2019s first inauguration set a record for attendance, as officials used the full length of Mall for the swearing-in ceremony. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) At his news conference last week, Trump promised an inauguration that would be \u201cvery, very special, very beautiful,\u201d and predicted \u201cmassive crowds.\u201d The signals are mixed. Many of the unofficial parties being thrown by state delegations and other entities sold out weeks ago. Hotel bookings appear to be on pace with Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration (but shy of 2009), according to Robin McClain, vice president of Destination DC. Meanwhile, city officials have indicated that far more charter buses have sought parking permits in the city\u2019s biggest lot on Saturday, when a protest Women\u2019s March on Washington is scheduled, than for the inauguration the day before. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., an international financier who is leading Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, told reporters last week that the president-elect is seeking to avoid a \u201ccircuslike atmosphere\u201d with his festivities. The participants haven\u2019t been entirely of his choosing. For weeks, Trump has been dogged by headlines about A-list entertainers turning down offers to join the celebration. Until Friday, the only acts that had been announced were the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes \u2014 both veterans of previous inaugurals \u2014 and Jackie Evancho, a classical singer who was runner-up on NBC\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d in 2010. On Friday, Trump announced a handful of entertainers who are to participate in a \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\u201d on Thursday night. They include country stars Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood and rockers 3 Doors Down. Another artist announced Friday \u2014 Broadway performer Jennifer Holliday \u2014 dropped out Saturday, saying she had heard concerns from the gay community about the message her participation would send. Holliday joined a long list of celebrities who have said publicly that they turned down invitations, including Elton John, Celine Dion and the rock band Kiss. Epshteyn played down reports of such rejections, offering an analogy: \u201cFor some of them, that\u2019s like me saying, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be playing point guard for the Washington Wizards.\u2019 Well, I was never asked.\u201d One thing the Trump inaugural committee has done particularly well is raise money. The committee says it has brought in more than $90\u00a0million in private money for the festivities, far more than the $53\u00a0million that Obama raised in 2009 for his first inauguration. Contributions were solicited through personal outreach to corporations and wealthy donors, who were asked to give between $25,000 and $1\u00a0million, with tailored rewards for each level. Roy Bailey, a Texas financier who is co-chairing the fundraising efforts, said a substantial number gave at the highest tier, shelling out $1\u00a0million or more. At that level, donors will get special perks during the inauguration weekend, including eight tickets to a \u201ccandlelight dinner\u201d that will feature \u201cspecial appearances\u201d by Trump and his wife, Melania, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, according to donor brochure obtained by The Washington Post. Still, it\u2019s unclear how the inaugural committee will spend all that it has taken in. \u201cWith a pared-down inaugural, I don\u2019t know what they could possibly use $90 million on,\u201d said Steve Kerrigan, chief executive officer of Obama\u2019s inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff of the committee in 2009. A significant share of the cost of festivities \u2014 including the swearing-in ceremony and parade \u2014 are covered by Congress and the military. Balls and other extras have traditionally been underwritten by private funds. The extras include the likes of hundreds of thermal blankets emblazoned with the presidential seal and the date of Trump\u2019s inauguration, ordered for distribution to ambassadors and those on the dais at the swearing-in ceremony. It\u2019s unclear how much use the blankets will get: A high in the 50s is predicted for Friday. Trump aides have said little about what he will say in his remarks after he is sworn in. It\u2019s a speech that could largely set the tone for a president who is entering office with historically low approval ratings. Late last month, Trump told several visitors to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that he is looking to both Reagan and Kennedy for inspiration. Nearly 250,000 tickets are being distributed for the swearing-in ceremony by members of Congress, while the Mall can accommodate hundreds of thousands more spectators. After a luncheon at the Capitol, Trump is scheduled to take part in a traditional inaugural parade \u2014 albeit a shorter one than usual. The participants announced so far include an array of high school and college marching bands and bands from all branches of the military. But the short scheduled time of 90 minutes and lack of more hoopla has surprised some observers, including Charlie Brotman, who has served as the announcer at every inaugural parade since Eisenhower\u2019s second one in 1957. Brotman, 89, has been relieved of his announcer duties this year despite continued interest in serving. \u201cThe parade is actually an \u00adextension of the president\u2019s personality,\u201d Brotman said, saying he thought Trump might have \u00ad\u201csuper-duper bands and marching units.\u201d \u201cI thought it would be a spectacular, like a Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade,\u201d he said.

Kansas , Nebraska , Iowa and Michigan are expected to see a mix of rain and freezing rain Monday, with the precipitation pushing into southern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin during the evening. While the weekend's storm caused travel issues in parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, some meteorologists acknowledged it fell short of dire forecasts. Strong storms moved through Houston on Monday morning, following a night of storms in Texas. There was at least one tornado touchdown confirmed, and severe weather kept some fans and NFL players inside Dallas' AT&T; Stadium for more than hour after the divisional playoff game Sunday night. Also, a United Express plane slid off the runway early Monday in Amarillo, Texas, which saw light snow. The airline says no one was injured. 0 Shares ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Observations like these have prompted a New York psychotherapist to ask, \u201cWhat really matters?\u201d in life. In her enlightening new book, \u201c The Power of Off ,\u201d Nancy Colier observes that \u201cwe are spending far too much of our time doing things that don\u2019t really matter to us.\u201d Both in and outside her practice, she has encountered many people who have become \u201cdisconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings.\u201d The near-universal access to digital technology, starting at ever younger ages, is transforming modern society in ways that can have negative effects on physical and mental health, neurological development and personal relationships, not to mention safety on our roads and sidewalks. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m no Luddite. I love technology. I love the convenience and assistance afforded by the myriad apps on my cellphone, a pocket-size information bank. I remember being amazed, as a Times reporter back in the early 1980s, when I started using word processing and realized how much faster I could write an article. Now computers save tons of time and effort and avert countless embarrassing errors because I can look up facts, figures, spelling, definitions and scholarly publications without leaving my ergonomic chair. But I also love putting my computer in sleep mode and going for a walk with my dog, meeting and chatting with friends, acquaintances and strangers, some of whom have become friends. As with so much else in life, moderation in our digital world should be the hallmark of a healthy relationship with technology. Too many of us have become slaves to the devices that were supposed to free us, giving us more time to experience life and the people we love. Instead, we\u2019re constantly bombarded by bells, buzzes and chimes that alert us to messages we feel compelled to view and respond to immediately. \u201cMost people now check their smartphones 150 times per day , or every six minutes,\u201d Ms. Colier wrote. \u201cAnd young adults are now sending an average of 110 texts per day .\u201d Furthermore, she added, \u201c46 percent of smartphone users now say that their devices are something they \u2018 couldn\u2019t live without .\u2019\u201d In \u201cThe World Unplugged Project,\u201d investigators at the University of Maryland reported that \u201ca clear majority\u201d of students in the 10 countries studied experienced distress when they tried to go without their devices for 24 hours. One in three people admitted they\u2019d rather give up sex than their smartphones. I fear we are turning into digital robots. Will future generations know how to converse with one another face to face? Will they notice the birds, trees, sunrise and the people with whom they share the planet? Advertisement Continue reading the main story Instead of visiting art galleries, attending concerts or walking on picturesque wooded paths, one woman I know who came to Woodstock, N.Y., last summer spent the weekend on her iPad communing with her many \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook. All I could think was \u201cWhat a waste!\u201d Why, you may ask, is it so important to limit our digital lives? \u201cWithout open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down \u2014 it\u2019s in constant fight-or-flight mode,\u201d Ms. Colier said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt\u2019s connections to other human beings \u2014 real-life connections, not digital ones \u2014 that nourish us and make us feel like we count. Our presence, our full attention is the most important thing we can give each other. Digital communications don\u2019t result in deeper connections, in feeling loved and supported.\u201d How often is your real work interrupted by signals from your smartphone that you find impossible to ignore? Have you ever avoided intimacy with your partner because you\u2019re in the midst of iPhone Scrabble? Is endlessly snapping selfies and posting your every action and thought on social media creating an unhealthy self-centeredness? As for physical well-being, every hour spent on a device is likely to be an indoor, sedentary one. Screens are stealing time that children and adolescents should be spending on physical activity and sports, reading, or creating and engaging directly with other children, all of which are critical to healthy physical and social development. \u201cChildren who overuse online media are at risk of problematic internet use, and heavy users of video games are at risk of internet gaming disorder\u201d (translation: addiction), the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in its latest policy statement on media use . Ms. Colier, a licensed clinical social worker, said, \u201cThe only difference between digital addiction and other addictions is that this is a socially condoned behavior.\u201d While her book contains a 30-day digital detox program, in our interview she offered three steps to help curb one\u2019s digital dependence. 1. Start by recognizing how much digital use is really needed, say, for work or navigation or letting family members know you\u2019re O.K., and what is merely a habit of responding, posting and self-distraction. 2. Make little changes. Refrain from using your device while eating or spending time with friends, and add one thing a day that\u2019s done without the phone.

He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have appeared in Moscow over and over in search of joint ventures, meeting with developers and government officials. Advertisement Continue reading the main story During a trip in 2006, Mr. Sater and two of Mr. Trump\u2019s children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, stayed at the historic Hotel National Moscow across from the Kremlin, connecting with potential partners over the course of several days. As recently as 2013, Mr. Trump himself was in Moscow. He had sold Russian real estate developers the right to host his Miss Universe pageant that year, and he used the visit as a chance to discuss development deals, writing on Twitter at the time: \u201cTRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Hopes for Moscow Deals Fail to Break Ground Donald J. Trump has made repeated efforts over 30 years to build or invest in hotels and luxury housing in Moscow. It never quite happened. July 1987 Mr. Trump travels to Moscow with his wife, Ivana. They stay in the Lenin Suite at the National Hotel and tour potential construction sites. Dec. 1988 Mr. Trump says that the Moscow hotel project fizzled because \u201cin the Soviet Union, you don't own anything. It's hard to conjure up spending hundreds of millions of dollars on something and not own it.\u201d July 1991 Boris N. Yeltsin takes office as the first president of the Russian Federation. Nov. 1996 At a news conference, Mr. Trump announces plans to invest $250 million in Russia and to put his name on two luxury residential buildings, a Trump International and a Trump Tower, in Moscow. Neither building was constructed. Feb. 1998 The Moscow Times quotes Norma Foerderer, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal assistant, about his Moscow plans: \u201cThat\u2019s way on the back, back, back burner. We haven\u2019t thought about Moscow for some time.\u201d Feb. 1998 The Russian news media reports that further negotiations never occurred with Mr. Trump about the Moscow hotel. A German company ends up winning the contract. May 2000 Vladimir V. Putin takes office as president of Russia. Mid-2000s A New York development company working with Mr. Trump explores the possibility of constructing a Moscow Trump Tower on the Moscow River, but the project fails to move forward. 2007 Mr. Trump speaks highly of real estate prospects in Russia in a deposition, saying, \"We will be in Moscow at some point.\" Mr. Trump acknowledges meeting with Russian investors at Trump Tower to explore a Moscow development deal, and says his son Donald Trump Jr. is working to get a separate deal there off the ground. May 2008 Dmitry A. Medvedev takes office as the president of Russia. June 2008 At a \u201cReal Estate in Russia\u201d conference, Donald Trump Jr. says that the Trump Organization wants to build luxury housing and hotels in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi. May 2012 Vladimir V. Putin begins his second nonconsecutive term as the president of Russia. Sept. 2013 During a visit to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, which he co-owned, Mr. Trump said, \"I have plans for the establishment of business in Russia. Now, I am in talks with several Russian companies to establish this skyscraper.\" As the Russian market opened up in the post-Soviet Union era, Mr. Trump and his partners pursued Russians who were newly flush with cash to buy apartments in Trump Towers in New York and Florida, sales that he boasted about in a 2014 interview. \u201cI know the Russians better than anybody,\u201d Mr. Trump told Michael D\u2019Antonio, a Trump biographer who shared unpublished interview transcripts with The New York Times. Seeking deals in Russia became part of a broader strategy to expand the Trump brand worldwide. By the mid-2000s, Mr. Trump was transitioning to mostly licensing his name to hotel, condominium and commercial towers rather than building or investing in real estate himself. He discovered that his name was especially attractive in developing countries where the rising rich aspired to the type of ritzy glamour he personified. While he nailed down ventures in the Philippines, India and elsewhere, closing deals in Russia proved challenging. In 2008, Donald Trump Jr. praised the opportunities in Russia, but also called it a \u201cscary place\u201d to do business because of corruption and legal complications. Mr. Sater said that American hotel chains that had moved into Russia did so with straightforward agreements to manage hotels that other partners owned. Mr. Trump, by contrast, was pursing developments that included residential or commercial offerings in which he would take a cut of sales, terms that Russians were reluctant to embrace. Even so, Mr. Trump said his efforts put him in contact with powerful people there. \u201cI called it my weekend in Moscow,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his 2013 trip to Moscow during a September 2015 interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d He added: \u201cI was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people. I can\u2019t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.\u201d When asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he had \u201cstayed away\u201d from Russia, Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said it was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities ever materialized. Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in Russia, he said, was no different from his attraction to other emerging markets in which he investigated possible ventures. Mr. Garten did not respond to questions about whom Mr. Trump met with in Moscow in 2013 and what was discussed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Stalking Deals in Moscow Ted Liebman, an architect based in New York, got the call in 1996. Mr. Trump and Liggett-Ducat, an American tobacco company that owned property in Moscow, wanted to build a high-end residential development near an old Russian Olympic stadium. As they prepared to meet with officials in Moscow, they needed sketches of the Trump tower they envisioned. The architect scrambled to meet the request, handing over plans to Mr. Trump at his Manhattan office. \u201cI hope we can do this,\u201d Mr. Liebman recalled Mr. Trump telling him. Soon after, Mr. Trump was in Russia, promoting the proposal and singing the praises of the Russian market. \u201cI\u2019ve seen cities all over the world. Some I\u2019ve liked, some I haven\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference in Moscow in 1996, according to The Moscow Times. But he added that he didn\u2019t think he had ever been \u201cas impressed with the potential of a city as I have been with Moscow.\u201d Mr. Trump had been eyeing the potential for nearly a decade, expressing interest to government officials ranging from the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev (they first met in Washington in 1987) to the military figure Alexander Lebed. Photo The 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Mr. Trump sold Russian real estate developers the right to host his Miss Universe pageant that year. Credit Maxim Shemetov/Reuters The 1996 project never materialized, but by then Mr. Trump was already well known in Russia. Moscow was in the midst of a construction boom, which transformed the capital from a drab, post-Soviet expanse into a sparkly modern city. Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow\u2019s mayor at the time, said in an interview that he had met with Mr. Trump and showed him plans for a massive underground shopping mall just outside the Kremlin gates. Mr. Trump suggested connecting it to the Metro, \u201ca very important observation,\u201d Mr. Luzhkov said. Today, visitors to the Okhotny Ryad shopping center can go straight from the Metro to the Calvin Klein store without venturing into the cold. In the following years, Mr. Trump\u2019s pursuit of Russia was strengthened by a growing circle of partners and associates in Canada and the United States who had roots in the region. Among them were Tevfik Arif, a former Soviet-era commerce official originally from Kazakhstan who founded a development company called the Bayrock Group, and Mr. Sater, a partner in the firm, who had moved to New York from Russia as a child. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bayrock was in Trump Tower, two floors below the Trump Organization. While working to take Trump-branded towers to Arizona, Florida and New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood, Bayrock also began scouting for deals in Russia and other countries. \u201cWe looked at some very, very large properties in Russia,\u201d Mr. Sater said. \u201cThink of a large Vegas high-rise.\u201d When Mr. Sater traveled to Moscow with Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. to meet with developers in 2006, he said their attitude could be summarized as \u201cnice, big city, great. Let\u2019s do a deal here.\u201d Mr. Trump continued to work with Mr. Sater even after his role in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed; Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and served as a government informant. Photo Mr. Trump with Tevfik Arif, center, and Felix Sater at the Trump SoHo launch party in 2007. Mr. Trump discussed deals in Russia with their development company, the Bayrock Group, but they never materialized. Credit Mark Von Holden/WireImage In 2007, Mr. Trump discussed a deal for a Trump International Hotel and Tower in Moscow that Bayrock had lined up with Russian investors. \u201cIt would be a nonexclusive deal, so it would not have precluded me from doing other deals in Moscow, which was very important to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a deposition in an unsuccessful libel suit he brought against Tim O\u2019Brien, a journalist. He claimed the development had fallen apart after Mr. O\u2019Brien wrote a book saying that Mr. Trump was worth far less than he claimed. But Mr. Trump said he was close to striking another real estate deal in Moscow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do one fairly soon,\u201d he said. Moscow, he insisted \u201cwill be one of the cities where we will be.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Vodka, Yes; Development, No The Trump brand did appear in Russia, but not quite as the grand edifice the real estate mogul had envisioned. Trump Super Premium Vodka, with the shine of bottles glazed with 24-karat gold, was presented at the Millionaire\u2019s Fair in Moscow in 2007, and large orders for the spirits followed. The vodka was sold in Russia as late as 2009, but eventually fizzled out. In a news release, Mr. Trump heralded it as a \u201ctremendous achievement.\u201d He tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to start a reality show in St. Petersburg in 2008 starring a Russian mixed martial arts fighter. But real estate developments remained a constant goal. From 2006 to 2008, his company applied for several trademarks in Russia, including Trump, Trump Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, according to a record search by Sojuzpatent, a Russian intellectual property firm.

Credit Yuri Kadobnov/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Donald Trump Jr. became a regular presence in Russia. Speaking at a 2008 Manhattan real estate conference, he confessed to fears of doing business in Russia, saying there is \u201can issue of \u2018Will I ever see my money back out of that deal or can I actually trust the person I am doing the deal with?\u2019\u201d according to coverage of his remarks in eTurboNews. But he told the Manhattan audience that \u201cI really prefer Moscow over all cities in the world\u201d and that he had visited Russia a half-dozen times in 18 months. In 2011, he was still at it. \u201cHeading to the airport to go to Moscow for business,\u201d he tweeted that year.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By David Weigel January 16 at 11:33 AM Follow daveweigel Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), left, and President-elect Donald Trump. (Mandel Ngan\u00a0and Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images) The last Martin Luther King Jr. Day before America\u2019s first black president handed power over to Donald Trump was always going to be awkward. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) determined just how awkward it would be when he told Chuck Todd of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d \u00a0that he did not see Trump as a \u201clegitimate president.\u201d No one needs a refresher on how Donald Trump responded, with an insult to the city of Atlanta, but some might have missed the pushback in mainstream and conservative media. Byron York, the Washington Examiner\u2019s chief political correspondent, saw a \u201cdilemma\u201d emerging for Democrats who could not agree with Lewis, with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) calling the \u201cnot legitimate\u201d charge \u201cnonproductive,\u201d White House chief of staff Denis McDonough calling Trump \u201cfreely elected\u201d and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calling the insult \u201cjust words.\u201d York\u2019s analysis: For some Democrats, the illegitimacy charge would move them a bit too close to a kind of birtherism that they spent years denouncing. (Remember that Republican leaders stayed away from birtherism, although some GOP members of Congress embraced, or at least flirted, with it.) So it\u2019s possible, perhaps likely, that the Trump illegitimacy charge will remain confined to the leftmost reaches of the Democratic Party, just as birtherism was confined to the rightmost reaches of the GOP. Did you notice something in that parenthetical? I\u2019ll repeat it: \u201cRepublican leaders stayed away from birtherism, although some GOP members of Congress embraced, or at least flirted, with it.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump's team and senators of both parties on Jan. 15 reacted to Trump's feud with Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.). (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) As an avid reader of the news and subscriber to The Washington Post ( click here ), you can probably name a very prominent Republican who did embrace the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and thus ineligible to be president. He will be taking the oath of office this Friday, and then President Obama will hand him the White House keys. It\u2019s true that few Democrats will embrace Lewis\u2019s insult of Trump. It\u2019s just as true that media gatekeepers will define it as out of line, and fringy, to say that Trump is not a legitimate president. But Lewis\u2019s line is exactly the sort of thing that distracted and enraged Democrats, and the same media gatekeepers, when it was directed against Obama. I\u2019m not making an equivalence between the racist birther conspiracy and the \u201clegitimate\u201d jab \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that many Democrats, Lewis included, appeared to learn from 2016 that explosive rhetoric that drives the other party to distraction is its own reward. [ As Trump attacks John Lewis, here\u2019s how freedom riders broke the chains of segregation ] After reporting last week on the Democrats who wanted to ditch the \u201chigh ground\u201d and take on Trump , I\u2019ve taken to calling this the New Rudeness. It's an inevitable byproduct of Trump\u2019s victory, and of the failed campaign Hillary Clinton ran against him. But it\u2019s also a product of Republican opposition to Obama. In 2009, as a reporter at the late and lamented Washington Independent, I closely covered\u00a0the Democrats and outside groups who were rumbled by the angry opposition of the tea party. In early 2009, after Rush Limbaugh told listeners that he hoped Obama \u201cfailed\u201d \u2014 at the bottom of the Great Recession \u2014 Democrats and reporters for outlets like ThinkProgress called out Republicans who would not denounce Limbaugh. The effect: Some bruised feelings for Republicans, but much more mainstreaming of Limbaugh\u2019s point. Months later, the tea party had perhaps its biggest legislative victory when it disrupted the normally staid town hall meetings that members of Congress held over the long August recess. Democrats, at first, thought that the story of these raucous events could become their noisiness \u2014 that swing voters would not want to identify with the sorts of people who accused congressmen of trying to kill them with rationing. Then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called the protests \u201castroturf,\u201d hoping that the organizing role played by well-funded tea party groups would discredit them. They were wrong, and it was especially ironic that the San Francisco-based Pelosi was so wrong. Conservatives in 2009 were using tactics that they believed had been perfected by the left. They cited Saul Alinsky\u2019s rules \u2014 find a target, freeze it and polarize it, as well as drown it with ridicule. What does this have to do with Lewis\u2019s remarks? It has more to do with their \u201ccontroversial\u201d nature. From 2009 through the Trump campaign, it was easy to find \u201cserious\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d conservatives who would denounce the voter anger they saw on the right. Clinton\u2019s campaign practically turned the practice into dogma. It made a long bet that voters would be repulsed by Trump, and built an ad strategy and an outreach strategy around that theory. The campaign had a point, or thought it did. In focus groups, voters were repulsed by Trump's insults of nonwhite voters and women. Black voters were repulsed by his birtherism \u2014 and indeed, Trump eventually walked it back, though without apologizing to Obama. The Clinton campaign piled onto the airwaves in swing states with ads that showed women glumly listening to Trump talking about their bodies and children becoming pie-eyed as Trump cursed. More importantly, plenty of Republicans seemed to agree with the strategy. Glenn Beck himself, the icon of the early tea party movement, spent the weeks before the election on an apology tour and hinted to Vice News that he might vote for Clinton. None of this mattered. It turned out that Trump could beat Clinton even with voters who disliked both of them, because voters came to see the attacks on his rhetoric as a distraction. Democrats had been baited \u2014 every day they spent asking why Republicans would not denounce the latest Trump insult was a day they did not spend talking about their policies or record. In other words, Trump\u2019s rudeness, like the tea party\u2019s disruptions, was effective because both were outside political norms and couldn\u2019t be defended. It did not matter whether individual Republicans went on TV or held Capitol Hill hallway conversations to criticize them. Voters could not have cared less about the norms. It didn\u2019t matter how many \u201cRepublicans divided\u201d stories they read. Anyone who walked past merchandise tables with \u201cTrump That B---h\u201d and \u201cHillary Sucks, but Not Like Monica\u201d shirts knew this. Democrats were wasting money on polling and focus groups when they could have just noticed how people talked about politics, and politicians, on Facebook. Will rudeness hold the same benefits for Democrats as it did for Republicans? In electoral terms, maybe\u00a0not. Although Trump is the least popular president-elect in popular memory, the seats Democrats need to win in 2018 are in more Trump-friendly turf than the country at large. You\u2019ll see Democrats in purple or red districts refuse to\u00a0agree that Trump is \u201cillegitimate,\u201d or refuse to make a \u201cgolden showers\u201d joke. Plenty of Trump-mockery can be dismissed as empty choir-preaching, like how John Oliver\u2019s \u201ceviscerations\u201d of Trump go viral only with people who hate Trump already. But this is how we live now. Trump, who will soon be etched in history books alongside George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, has not given up his habit of Twitter-fighting with people who are mean to him. Democrats have figured out that a #ThisIsNotNormal hashtag is not the way to respond. Their antidote is the New Rudeness. politics ",

Oman said Monday that it had accepted 10 prisoners being released from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. That reduces the number of detainees remaining at Guantanamo to 45. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP The U.S. has released 10 prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to the Arab nation of Oman, reducing the detainee population to 45 in the waning days of the Obama administration. The freed prisoners were not identified by name or nationality, though the Oman News Agency , citing the country's Foreign Ministry, reported that the 10 had arrived in the country on Monday for \"temporary residence.\" Prior to Monday's announcement, Oman had taken in 20 Guantanamo detainees over the past two years, and all of them were from Oman's neighbor, Yemen. At its peak, Guantanamo had close to 700 prisoners. When President Obama entered office in January 2009, he immediately pledged to close the prison in Cuba, which was down to 242 detainees at the time. Many have been released to their home countries or to other nations over the past eight years. However, most of those still in Guantanamo are considered by U.S. authorities to be too dangerous to be released, and Congress has barred them from being brought to the United States. President-elect Donald Trump recently called on the Obama administration to stop releasing Guantanamo prisoners. On Jan 3, Trump tweeted: \"There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.\" Article continues after sponsorship The Obama administration promptly rejected Trump's call. Trump said during the presidential campaign he would like to see additional terror suspects sent to the prison. \"We're gonna load it up with some bad dudes, believe me, we're gonna load it up,\" Trump said last February.

USA TODAY NETWORK Louisiana Secretary of Health Dr. Rebekah Gee, center, is shown with Louisiana State University President King Alexander and Dr. Nicole Lurie, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness with the U.S. Public Health Service, during the flooding in that state last summer. (Photo: Andrew Tuozzolo, Louisiana Department of Health) The funding for many state public health and prevention programs is in jeopardy along with insurance for 20 million people\u00a0as Congress moves to repeal\u00a0the Affordable Care Act . While the ACA requires insurers to cover mammograms, colonoscopies and other preventive care, a less prominent provision authorized a federal fund to prevent the soaring incidence of chronic diseases including diabetes and heart disease. It also funds education targeting college suicides, smoking and low-income new mothers.\u00a0The ACA\u2019s Prevention and Public Health Fund has survived about 60 votes in Congress, and it was tapped to help pay for the\u00a0recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act, which funds pharmaceutical research and development and opioid treatment. Supporters worry an ACA repeal could eliminate the fund at a time when it is needed to reduce the $3.2 trillion spent to treat illness and disease with medical services and drugs. On Friday, the House passed legislation that would allow Republicans to repeal all or parts of the law without support from Democrats. House Speaker Paul Ryan said the law would be replaced in a \"thoughtful, step-by-step process.\" Advocates say it is programs like those covered by the fund that are most needed to prevent and treat increasingly costly diseases. Diabetes affects\u00a0nearly 10% of the population or about 29 million people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, more than 8 million people are undiagnosed. The prices for some brands of insulin to treat diabetes, for example, have increased by as much as 60%. More than 300 public health and patient\u00a0groups including the American Heart Association signed a letter to congressional leaders last week \u00a0that warned of the \"dire consequences\" of repealing the fund without including the\u00a0nearly $1 billion\u00a0in other appropriations.\u00a0\"Funding prevention not only saves lives but it saves money,\" said the letter, citing research by Trust for America's Health that shows every public health dollar\u00a0leads to a savings of $5.60. In Louisiana, for example, $9 million from the prevention\u00a0fund pays for programs including home visits for low income new mothers\u00a0that reduces costly premature births, lead testing for children under age 5 and education and surveillance for tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, says physician Rebekah Gee,\u00a0the state's secretary of health. Richard Hamburg is the deputy director of the Trust for America's Health. \u00a0(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) As public health funding has been cut in recent years, Southern states have seen increases in syphilis, Gee said.\u00a0Public health workers make sure people get follow-up treatment when they learn of an active case, she said. \"One of the reasons for the fund was\u00a0to make up for years of chronic underfunding of public health,\" said Richard Hamburg, deputy director of the non profit Trust for America's Health. Community programs like those supported by the fund tend to\u00a0be favored by conservatives who say decisions about the best approaches to health care should be made farther from Washington. But the prevention fund has also been criticized for acting as a \"slush fund\" for public health, economist Robert Graboyes said \"Emotionally, I tend to like decisions made at state and local level, but states have been as problematic as the federal government,\" says\u00a0Graboyes, senior research fellow at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Besides, Graboyes says, \"There's a big difference between saying, 'public health funding is important' and saying, 'this fund is a great idea.' \" \u00a0He says it is also too much to expect public health to \"undo some of the damage\" he believes was done by overly prescriptive laws including the ACA.

    "text": "Move to Arrest Samsung Leader Threatens a Carefully Crafted Narrative By PAUL MOZUR Continue reading the main story Photo Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman of Samsung who is also known as Jay Y. Lee, in Seoul, South Korea, last week Credit Pool photo by Chun Sung-Jun HONG KONG \u2014 Suave and mellow, Samsung\u2019s heir apparent has often been portrayed as the right leader for a big but stodgy business empire looking to make its way in the age of innovation. The leader, Lee Jae-yong \u2014 who goes by Jay Y. Lee in the West \u2014 is part of the third generation of the Lee family to lead the conglomerate, which makes products as varied as microchips and ships. While his father was widely seen as old-fashioned, Mr. Lee has been painted by Samsung as equally comfortable in Silicon Valley and in the boardroom, as a leader who could open up the clannish business even as he helped its flagship electronics arm take on Apple in innovation. That image took a hit on Monday, when prosecutors called for Mr. Lee\u2019s arrest as part of the sprawling investigation into a corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye of South Korea. Prosecutors contend that he bribed the president and one of her confidants in exchange for help transferring control of Samsung to him. In a statement on Monday, Samsung denied any bribery or making \u201cimproper requests related to the merger of Samsung affiliates or the leadership transition.\u201d But the move by prosecutors casts Mr. Lee in a different light, as a leader similar to his father \u2014 who was convicted of white-collar crimes but pardoned twice \u2014 and it could raise questions about Mr. Lee\u2019s pledge to improve Samsung\u2019s transparency and make it more responsive to shareholders. Continue reading the main story \u201cBeyond the arrest itself, this is going to be a big blow to the narrative they\u2019ve been building,\u201d said Geoffrey Cain, the author of a forthcoming book on Samsung. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince shareholders and partners they are a hip Silicon Valley-style company when these charges show them to be a company run like a feudal dynasty.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lee\u2019s legal troubles are unlikely to have an immediate impact on Samsung\u2019s day-to-day business, as operations are run mainly by professional managers in autonomous teams, analysts said. And his role at Samsung is not necessarily over. South Korea has a long history of pardoning the leaders of its largest family-run companies, known as chaebols. With Samsung accounting for 20 percent of the country\u2019s exports, past efforts to penalize the company or its executives have been met with worries about the impact on South Korea\u2019s economy. But Mr. Lee\u2019s problems could influence the company\u2019s strategic decisions at a time of major challenges, such as how to bounce back from the debacle over its Galaxy Note 7, a smartphone intended to challenge Apple\u2019s position as the world\u2019s most innovative phone maker. A spate of fires last year forced Samsung to recall and then cease production of the phone, tarnishing the company\u2019s name and making it the object of airline safety announcements and jokes on American late-night talk shows. Now, with Mr. Lee\u2019s legal problems, a major customer might need a large quantity of a new component, but a decision on the matter could be delayed, said Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Company. \u201cIf Jay Lee is there, he can answer in 24 hours,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cBut otherwise, it could take a couple of weeks. I think that\u2019s the thing you need to worry about: big decisions.\u201d Analysts highlighted two executives who run large parts of the company\u2019s operations and who could take on more responsibility. One is Kwon Oh-hyun , who helped Samsung become a leader in memory and semiconductor operations. The other, Choi Gee-sung, was crucial in building the company\u2019s television unit, which eclipsed Sony\u2019s a decade ago. Mr. Lee, 48, is vice chairman of Samsung, but he has been widely considered the company\u2019s de facto leader since his father, Lee Kun-hee , had a heart attack in 2014. The elder Mr. Lee led Samsung from its roots as a components supplier to a maker of consumer products, establishing a global brand and shedding a reputation for cheap goods. In one example of his drive, two decades ago he gathered 150,000 Samsung phones that failed quality tests and set them on fire. Under the younger Mr. Lee, Samsung has focused again on components, a sector that has benefited from companies wanting to add features to their phones. And late last year, the company struck an $8 billion deal to buy Harman International to make smart components for cars. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Lee has also pledged to put in place changes to ensure that Samsung\u2019s corporate governance meets international standards. As a family controlled group with dense links among its units, the corporation has a structure that has drawn criticism from some investors. Samsung has also pressed for cultural changes that would foster innovation and a start-up-style environment at the company, and Mr. Lee has been portrayed as a part of that shift. At Samsung, he is credited with negotiating a key deal with Steve Jobs to help make the Apple iPod. \u201cStart-up Samsung,\u201d an initiative announced last year, sought to relax what many described as a strict corporate culture. Announced with a coordinated pledge by top executives, the push was derided by some in the technology news media as evidence of Samsung\u2019s top-down structure. Despite such efforts, Samsung has been unable to follow up with a next act in the wake of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and high-profile projects like creating an operating system have largely been considered failures. Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea. ",

Chris O'Meara/AP hide caption toggle caption Chris O'Meara/AP Law enforcement officials work at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June following the mass shooting. Chris O'Meara/AP Noor Salman, the wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, has been arrested on federal charges. Salman is charged with \"Aiding and Abetting by providing material support to a terrorist and Obstruction of Justice,\" Orlando Police Chief John Mina said in a statement . On June 12, 2016, 49 people died when Mateen opened fire at Pulse in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. He was killed in a firefight with police. Salman is due to make her initial court appearance at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday in Oakland, Calif., according to a tweet from the U.S. attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida. \"This is an example of the fact that investigations do continue long after they're publicly discussed,\" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said during an interview with MSNBC . \"It was always our goal, and we said from the beginning, we were going to look at every aspect of this case, every aspect of this shooter's life, to determine not just why did he take these actions, but who else knew about them, was anyone else involved, is there any other accountability that needs to be had here in this case.\" Article continues after sponsorship Mateen and Salman married in 2011 in Contra Costa County, Calif., as The Two-Way has reported . She moved to the San Francisco area after her husband's death, according to The Associated Press. \"I was unaware of everything,\" Salman told The New York Times in a November interview . \"I don't condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people.\" In a statement to NPR, Salman's attorney Linda Moreno reiterated that her client was not aware of Mateen's plans: \"Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night. Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.\" As NPR's Dina Temple-Raston has reported , Salman has cooperated with authorities but there are inconsistencies in her story: \"For example, she said she didn't know that the attack was coming, but she also told authorities that she tried to talk him out of the attack. She was with him when he bought ammunition last week. She actually joined him at the Pulse nightclub before the attack, although it's possible she didn't know that he was there to case the place. So a grand jury is looking at all of this. It's not clear if they'll bring charges, but they're certainly considering that.\" ",

    "text": "WATCH Trump Under Fire for Taking on Civil Rights Icon 0 Shares Email Americans divide evenly on whether the incoming Trump administration is complying with ethics laws. And while a bare majority in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll accepts President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s business ownership plan, three-quarters say he should release his tax returns. Contrary to his comment that the American public doesn\u2019t care about the issue, four in 10 of those polled say they care \u201ca lot\u201d about Trump releasing his tax records. See PDF with full results and charts here. This report is a first look at results of an extensive ABC/Post pre-inaugural poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates . Results on Trump\u2019s handling of the transition, views on his policy proposals and expectations for his presidency will be released Tuesday morning, with results Wednesday morning on President Barack Obama\u2019s final ratings as president. In terms of ethics, the poll finds Americans are split on whether or not Trump, his family and his advisers are complying with federal ethics laws: Forty-three percent think so, while 44 percent think not. Partisan and ideological gaps are wide: Seventy-nine percent of Republicans say Trump is complying with ethics laws, dropping to 44 percent among independents and just 16 percent of Democrats. Similarly, it\u2019s 72 percent among strong conservatives, slipping to 56 percent among \u201csomewhat\u201d conservative Americans, then plummeting to 37 percent of moderates and 25 percent of liberals. These divisions also are evident in another measure: Among Americans who say they wanted Trump to win the presidency -- 36 percent of the public -- a broad 85 percent think he\u2019s in compliance ethically. That drops to just 11 percent of those who wanted Hillary Clinton to win (39 percent of all adults) and a third of those who preferred other candidates, or none of them. Despite criticism by some ethics officials, 52 percent overall say Trump\u2019s plan to continue owning his businesses while placing them in a trust managed by his sons is sufficient. Forty-two percent instead say he should sell his businesses, peaking at 71 percent of Clinton supporters, vs. just 10 percent of those who favored Trump for the office. Views on tax returns shift decidedly away from Trump\u2019s position. Seventy-four present overall say he should release his tax returns; that includes 49 percent of his own supporters, as well as nearly all of Clinton\u2019s (94 percent) and 83 percent of those who had another preference, or none. The number who favor release of the documents is higher than it was in two related questions in ABC/Post polls during the election campaign. In May, 64 percent said he should release the returns, and in September, 63 percent said he was not justified in withholding them. In one key support group for Trump, noncollege-educated white men, 58 percent say he should release the tax returns; that rises to 81 percent of college-educated white women and 88 percent of nonwhites. By another measure, 69 percent in the red states -- those Trump won -- say he should release these records, as do 81 percent in Clinton\u2019s blue states. Forty-one percent, overall, say they \u201ccare a lot\u201d about Trump releasing the records -- 47 percent in the blue states, 36 percent in the states Trump won. At a news conference last week, Trump said: \u201cThe only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters.\u201d As far as other Americans, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they care at all.\u201d Methodology This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Jan. 12-15, 2017, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 31-23-37 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y.

President-elect Donald Trump announced Crowley as senior director of Strategic Communications for the National Security Council.&nbsp;</p> Close Evan Vucci, AP Monica Crowley, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0 pick to run communications for the National Security Council , will not be joining the Trump administration, following accusations of plagiarism. The conservative media commentator\u2019s decision comes after CNN reported that several passages in a 2012 book written by Crowley were plagiarized. Publisher HarperCollins then pulled the book. And according to a report last week by Politico Magazine, Crowley also plagiarized a number of passages in her 2000 Columbia University PhD dissertation. \u00a0 Before being selected to become senior director for strategic communications for the National Security Council, Crowley was a prominent conservative pundit and researcher for former President Richard Nixon. She was first accused of plagiarism in 1999, when an article she wrote about Nixon for The Wall Street Journal was amended with an editor\u2019s note saying it contained \u201cstriking similarities\u201d to an article written by historian Paul Johnson in 1988. \u00a0 Crowley\u2019s withdrawal from her position was first reported by the Washington Times. The transition official confirmed the decision on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports) BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - The telephone won\u2019t stop ringing at his offices in Chicago and Alabama. The emails and messages keep pouring in. It may have been 23 years since Bo Jackson put on a uniform, but his comments last week to USA TODAY Sports clearly struck a nerve. Jackson's statement that he \"would have never played football\" had he been aware of CTE and other health risks\u00a0reverberated throughout the sports world, and he was floored by the subsequent attention. Jackson was lauded for his candor, but also bombarded by calls and letters from irate football fans, amateur coaches, and even parents, telling him to keep his mouth shut. He was accused of being unqualified to speak out about one of football\u2019s most controversial topics, with others calling him hypocritical. Bo Jackson's startling hindsight: 'I would have never played football' \u201cThey wanted know why I would try to deface football when I have football training at my facility (Bo Jackson\u2019s Elite Sports in Lockport, Ill.)?\u2019\u2019 Jackson told USA TODAY Sports after he was honored by the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s different. We teach proper techniques to all sports, not just football, by people who have played the game at its highest level. We teach kids the proper technique to play the game. Tackling is an art form. It\u2019s not about running into each other as hard as you can. \u201cI\u2019m also getting people saying I know nothing about concussions and head injuries. Let me tell you this, I speak on concussions because I\u2019ve had a couple. I speak on CTE because I have a tendency to forget little things like where I put my keys five minutes ago. Or I forget what items I came to the grocery store for. I had my bell rung a couple of times while I was with the Raiders. One time I got up off the field, came to the other sideline, and actually sat on the wrong bench. \u201cSo people shouldn\u2019t make comments about somebody unless you have walked in their shoes, or you have competed on the same level that they have. Period. All of the comments are probably coming from selfish people only looking to make a profit off the sport.\" Jackson says he has not and won't join any legal actions taken against the NFL by former players. \u201cI think it\u2019s best for me to stay out of lawsuits,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cso the guys who really needs those funds can have them.\u2019\u2019 Jackson, the former Heisman Trophy winner, Pro Bowl running back from the Los Angeles Raiders and All-Star outfielder with the Kansas City Royals, will be forever indebted to football and baseball, making him one of sports\u2019 biggest icons. And even if he knew about the risk of head injuries growing up, Jackson says, he still would have played football at least through high school. \u201cBut the higher you go up that ladder,\u2019\u2019 Jackson says, \u201cthe more risks\u00a0that you are taking because you are dealing with bigger, stronger, faster caliber athletes, and everybody is trying to impress. \u201cThe person I love in the NFL like my own son is Cam Newton (also a Heisman winner from Auburn). I cuss him out like my own son. But every time he takes a hit to his head, that scares me, it scares the hell out of me. \u201cI witnessed him getting hit hard twice, and both times go to the locker room. I know he can take care of himself, but it still scares me.\u00a0 I care about all of those players playing, I don\u2019t want to see anybody getting hurt. \u201cIt bothers me when ex-NFL players are walking around homeless, don\u2019t have medical insurance, and are walking around in chronic pain. It bothers me, even though I haven\u2019t played game in 25 years. When I see something that\u2019s not right it will always bother me.\u2019\u2019 GALLERY: Two-sport stars ",

(Photo: Cliff Owen, AP) NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Two of John Lewis' books have sold out on Amazon after the Democratic congressman claimed the top spots on the retailer's best-seller list. Sales of the civil rights leader's graphic novel March\u00a0and his 2015 memoir Walking With the Wind\u00a0skyrocketed following his feud with President-elect Donald Trump over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. After Lewis questioned the legitimacy of Trump's victory, Trump tweeted that the 16-term Georgia representative \"should spend more time on fixing and helping his district.\" Support for Lewis among Democrats sent sales of his most popular books soaring late Saturday and early Sunday. A collection of his March\u00a0trilogy\u00a0ranked no. 1 on Amazon, and its individual volumes also charted high. Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement\u00a0ranked number two.

    "text": "President-elect Trump pushes back at civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis However, the tweet and meeting comes amid lingering tensions between the president-elect and Congressman John Lewis. Lewis is the civil rights icon who said Trump is not a \u201clegitimate president\u201d and therefore he will not attend the inauguration. Trump responded in a Twitter rant , saying that Lewis -- one of the leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee that was crucial to the success of the Civil Rights movement -- was \u201call talk\u201d and that he should focus on the \u201cburning and crime infested inner-cities.\u201d That exchange has added fuel to the criticism that the incoming presidential administration could undo many of the gains made by President Obama in the name of King\u2019s and the Civil Rights movement\u2019s legacies. Many Democratic congressman have cited the Trump-Lewis feud as the reason they will avoid the inauguration . Amid the backdrop of uncertainty and tension, civil rights leaders and activists are gathering across the country to publicly pay tribute to Dr. King. In addition to\u00a0 all of the country\u2019s National Parks having free admission , cities and communities across the nation are marking the occasion with events, concerts, speeches and marches. Below is a small sampling of some of the events across the nation today. ATLANTA The birthplace of King will be hosting several events in honor of his holiday.\u00a0 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a frequent Trump critic, is scheduled to speak, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached, along with King\u2019s youngest child, Bernice King, and several other speakers. CBS Atlanta affiliate WGCL reports there will be several other events around the city, including free admission and special screenings at the\u00a0 Atlanta History Center , and a special performance at the\u00a0 Center for Civil and Human Rights . CHARLOTTE The Charlotte area is hosting several public events and speeches, as well as offering free admission to various museums and centers that celebrate the King legacy, CBS Charlotte affiliate WBTV reports. The city also boast a large parade in honor of the holiday. DALLAS The Dallas-Forth Worth area boasts one of the nation\u2019s largest MLK Day parades, reports CBS Dallas .\u00a0 After three decades, the event at Fair Park continues to grow. This year\u2019s theme is \u2018Breaking the Chains of Injustice.\u2019 Some of King\u2019s famous words are written on the parade floats that will be rolling through the streets.\u00a0 DENVER The city will also be hosting a large parade through downtown, followed by an event commemorating the holiday. CBS Denver reports the city has already hosted interfaith celebration of King\u2019s legacy, and claims the Denver parade is also among the nation\u2019s largest. NEW YORK There will be dozens of events, concerts, and speeches throughout the city to celebrate the holiday, reports CBS New York . Additionally, the city has put out its annual call to volunteer in honor of King\u2019s legacy. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Related: Istanbul Nightclub Attack Involved Intelligence Organization: Turkey The suspect was arrested during a police operation, security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on talking to the media told Anadolu news agency. The private Dogan news agency and other media said the suspect was caught in Istanbul's district of Esenyurt in a police operation late on Monday, according to the Associated Press. A video capture shows the gunman entering the Reina nightclub in Istanbul early on Jan. 1, 2017. DHA via DEPO PHOTOS/EPA The suspect had escaped following the deadly shooting at Reina nightclub , one of the city's most exclusive, after opening fire in a crowd gathered to celebrate the new year. The man allegedly killed a police officer and civilian outside the club before firing on revelers around 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Eve (5:30 p.m. ET Saturday). Twenty-eight of the victims were foreigners, Turkish Health Ministry officials said after the attack. Canadian, Iraqi, Saudi, Indian, Lebanese, Tunisian, Kuwaiti and Syrian citizens were among the dead. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the shooting, identifying the attacker as \"a heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The terrorist group said the attack was carried out in response to a call from ISIS' leader, but it did not say whether it had directed or simply inspired the assailant. Earlier this month, Turkish authorities said they had identified the main suspect in the shooting, but were not revealing his identity as he remained at large. \"The identity of the person carrying out the attack in Ortakoy has been determined,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview with the state-run Anadolu news agency on Jan. 4. Turkish authorities did not make the suspect's identity public. Daniella Silva ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in Trump Tower, Manhattan, New York, U.S., Jan. 11, 2017. (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton) President-elect Donald Trump may have turned his Twitter account into a powerful political weapon, but experts warn that hackers could potentially use the same account to wreak havoc from the White House. Trump will continue using his @realDonaldTrump account when he takes office, he told The Times of London in an interview published Monday. Trump, who has 20.1 million Twitter followers, said that he won\u2019t personally be taking over the @POTUS government account used by President Obama. Attackers are likely already eyeing the @realDonaldTrump account, according to experts. \u201cI think there will be people that will do their best to try to hack his account,\u201d social media expert and President of JRM Comm Jason Mollica, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt would not surprise me in the least to see people try to hack him - his team at the White House will have to be very vigilant to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen on their watch.\u201d \u201cHackers could cause major scandals or major international issues if they simply posted a message,\u201d added Evan Blair, co-founder and chief business officer of social media cybersecurity company ZeroFOX. \u201cIf the account were ever to be compromised, we could have military tensions flare up, we could have civil unrest.\u201d PHONE HACKING COMPANY FALLS VICTIM TO HACKERS Blair told FoxNews.com that something as simple as Trump clicking on a link in a Twitter feed via his Android phone could potentially open the door to hackers. \u201cAll you need is one click,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he clicks on a malicious link, it could put malware on his phone.\u201d Trump\u2019s Twitter account has already been hacked , albeit briefly, in 2013, when an unknown attacker tweeted out an offensive lyric by rapper Lil\u2019 Wayne. \"My Twitter has been seriously hacked---and we are looking for the perpetrators,\" tweeted Trump, in response to the incident. My Twitter has been seriously hacked--- and we are looking for the perpetrators. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2013 Other high-profile figures whose Twitter accounts have been hacked include singer Katy Perry , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter chief Jack Dorsey . Companies Sony and Netflix have also seen their Twitter accounts hacked recently. Even the U.S. military has fallen victim to social media hackers. In 2015 the U.S. Central Command\u2019s Twitter and YouTube accounts were briefly taken over , prompting the military to tighten its social media password security. FLASHING THE PEACE SIGN CAN GET YOUR IDENTITY STOLEN Trump\u2019s transition team has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from FoxNews.com, so it is not clear how exactly they plan to protect the 45th President from hackers. ZeroFOX\u2019s Blair thinks Trump\u2019s team could use specialist management software to keep his Twitter account locked down, ensuring that only tweets from a specific device are allowed. The software could also harness multi-factor authentication and even use location-based security controls, according to Blair. Multi-factor authentication uses a combination of passwords, personal information, and device verification. Additionally, Blair says that a \u201cpeer review\u201d component could be built into the software, enabling the President-elect\u2019s team to ensure that the tweet has been posted by Trump himself. WIKILEAKS PROPOSES DATABASE OF VERIFIED USERS' INFO, SPARKS UPROAR \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a matter of his team using the right platform,\u201d added Mollica, noting that constant monitoring of emerging hacking threats will also be key. \u201cIt\u2019s a twenty-four/seven, three-hundred-and-sixty-five [day] proposition -- if the administration doesn\u2019t take it seriously, we\u2019re going to see hackers get in there and do some damage,\u201d he said. The White House announced its digital transition plan before last year\u2019s Presidential election. The @POTUS account will become available to the 45th President on Jan. 20, with a tweet-free timeline. The account will retain all its followers, according to a White House blog post . President Obama began tweeting from @POTUS in June 2015 and the account has racked up 13.5 million followers. The outgoing President also has the @BarackObama account, which is run by staff at his Organizing for Action campaign group, and has 80.6 million followers.

Instead, authorities said, the party became a bloodbath as a shootout left at least five\u00a0people dead, 15 injured and temporarily transformed a portion\u00a0of the tourist destination of Playa del Carmen on Mexico\u2019s \u201cMayan Riviera\u201d into a scene of chaos and panic. The shooting\u2014precipitated early Monday by a lone gunman at the entrance to a club called the Blue Parrot, according to Mexican authorities\u2014was also an unusual instance of Mexico\u2019s entrenched violence intersecting with the nation\u2019s tourist industry and its often-raucous bar scene. Playa del Carmen and other popular\u00a0tourist destinations have generally been spared the violence, often drug- and gang-related, that has ravaged some parts of Mexico. Police ruled out terrorism as a motive in Monday\u2019s shooting at the beach-side bar along Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast. The music event attracted large numbers of U.S. citizens and other foreigners. Among the dead were two Canadian nationals, an Italian and possibly a Colombian, authorities said.\u00a0Victims included both private security personnel at the scene and club patrons, authorities said. \u00a0At least one person, a woman,\u00a0was fatally injured in a \u201cstampede\u201d of people fleeing the club, according to Miguel Angel Pech, attorney general of Quintana Roo state, where Playa del Carmen is situated. She and other victims were\u00a0not publicly identified. Video posted on social media purported to show panicked patrons fleeing from the club as the shooting\u00a0occurred shortly before 2:30 a.m. \u2014 a time when, \u00a0police said, the dance venue was \u201csaturated\u201d \u00a0with revelers. The injured included at least two U.S. residents and one Canadian,\u00a0Pech, the security official, told reporters. The\u00a0violence apparently began when a\u00a0man with a gun became involved in an altercation with security personnel, who also appeared to have been armed, Pech said. It was unclear how many people opened fire. The precise motive for\u00a0the attack remained unclear. Three people arrested nearby were in custody, the state official said, but it was not confirmed if the alleged instigator was among them. He was not among the dead, said Pech, who added that he appeared to have fled the scene. Police found at least 20 bullet shells at the venue from at least three different weapons, the state official said. In a statement, organizers of the well-publicized event said the violence erupted in front of the club and confirmed that the fatalities included \u00a0three members of the event\u2019s security team. Organizers blamed a \u201clone shooter\u201d and condemned \u201cthis senseless act of violence\u201d at the event, which was billed as an annual, post New Year\u2019s electronic music festival held at various venues in Playa del Carmen and attracting thousands of revelers. \u00a0 Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

The suspect was to undergo medical checks before being taken to a police headquarters for questioning, the paper said in its online edition.\u00a0 Dogan news agency published what it said was the first image of the attacker. It showed a bruised, black-haired man in a grey, bloodied shirt being held by his neck.

The gunman left 39 dead and nearly 70 injured in his wake, many of them tourists. Police say he left the club in another taxi, heading to an apartment near the airport only to walk casually away.

Ethics commissioner Mary Dawson said Trudeau may have violated the federal ethics code during his holiday with the Aga Khan, a family friend, philanthropist and hereditary spiritual leader to the world's approximately 15 million Ismaili Muslims . It's the first time the ethics commissioner has opted to investigate the actions of a sitting prime minister. In a letter to opposition Conservative lawmaker Blaine Calkins, who was among those who filed formal complaints, Dawson said she is looking into both Trudeau's stay at the island and his use of the Aga Khan's private helicopter to get there. The vacation included Trudeau, his family, Liberal lawmaker Seamus O'Regan and Liberal party president Anna Gainey, all of whom took part in the chopper flight from Nassau to get to the secluded island. Both the Conflict of Interest Act and Trudeau's own ethics guidelines bar the use of sponsored travel in private aircraft, allowing it only for exceptional circumstances. The guidelines also prohibit a minister or any member of their family from accepting gifts or \"advantages\" that could reasonably be seen as influencing government decisions. The only exception is if the person providing the gift is a friend. Trudeau has repeatedly called the Aga Khan a longtime family friend who was a pallbearer at his father's funeral. Late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the Aga Khan were friends. Trudeau has said he is ready to meet with Dawson about the trip. \"As the prime minister said last week, we are happy to engage with the commissioner and answer any questions she may have,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

Here's how Trump's plan could cost the state Rally at Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times State Sen. Ed Hernandez speaks at a rally at Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center about protecting access to healthcare under President-elect Donald Trump. State Sen. Ed Hernandez speaks at a rally at Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center about protecting access to healthcare under President-elect Donald Trump. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Soumya Karlamangla Contact Reporter Along with his vow to repeal Obamacare , President-elect Donald Trump has promised to restructure Medicaid , the nation\u2019s low-income health program\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a move that could be acutely felt in California, where 1 in 3 residents receive health coverage through the state version, experts say. Medi-Cal enrollment surged by 5 million over the last three years to a total of 13.5 million under President Obama \u2019s Affordable Care Act. Some of those Californians could lose portions of their benefits or possibly be dropped from coverage altogether if Trump carries out his plan, which\u00a0would likely cost the state billions. Even residents who relied on the program long before the current expansion could be affected. \u201cThe cuts in federal funding could be quite significant, and California would have to make a lot of hard choices,\u201d said UC Berkeley Labor Center healthcare program manager Laurel Lucia. \u201cThere\u2019s no way California could maintain the program it currently has.\u201d Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government offered states money to let more\u00a0people into their Medicaid programs, which are jointly funded by state and federal governments. California is one of 31 states that took the deal, prompting the Medi-Cal enrollment surge over the last three years. Now anyone in California can sign up if their annual income is low enough: $16,395 or less for a single person or $22,108 or less for a couple. Medi-Cal is free for participants. Jason Rector, 32, was able to join Medi-Cal because of the expansion. He\u2019s\u00a0an actor who juggles part-time jobs so he can still make time for auditions. Jason Rector, 32, is an actor who was able to qualify for Medi-Cal because of its expansion under the Affordable Care Act.

Jason Rector, 32, is an actor who was able to qualify for Medi-Cal because of its expansion under the Affordable Care Act. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) \u201cMedi-Cal has been a huge lifesaver for so many of us, because we can pursue what we\u2019re pursuing and not have to have a panic attack if we start to come down with a cold,\u201d said Rector, who lives in Culver City. \u201cIt\u2019s just the unknown\u00a0of what comes next that worries me.\u201d Experts say that an immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act is unlikely and that Congress will probably slowly dismantle the law while devising replacement plans. California would lose $15.3 billion in federal funding if the Medicaid expansion is fully undone, according to the state\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. The Medicaid program in general, which now covers 73 million Americans, has been criticized for being\u00a0unsustainable and inefficient, with an annual price tag of more than $500 billion and growing. Medi-Cal alone\u00a0is a $90-billion program, with roughly 65% of that cost shouldered by the federal government. Under the current funding model for Medicaid,\u00a0the\u00a0federal government reimburses states for their programs\u2019 expenses regardless of how big they are.\u00a0President Johnson created the program in 1965 with this flexible funding model so it could serve as a safety net that could accommodate periods of greater need, such as  during economic downturns. Trump and his pick for secretary of Health and Human Services , Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), have said they want to limit spending by giving states a fixed amount of money each year. States will then have an incentive to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse, according to Trump\u2019s website . But the federal government contribution will probably be less than what states are currently receiving and won\u2019t increase enough over time to keep pace with rising costs,\u00a0forcing states to either reallocate funds to fill the gap or make cuts, according to a recent Commonwealth Fund report. \u201cSuch a change would effectively reverse a 50-year trend of expanding Medicaid in order to protect the most vulnerable Americans,\u201d the report said.\u00a0 Dylan Roby,\u00a0assistant professor of health services administration at the University of Maryland School of Public Health , said California would probably be faced with a multibillion-dollar shortfall too large to fill with state funds. He said state officials could consider\u00a0limiting who can join the program and what benefits they receive, areas where California has historically been generous.\u00a0They could also reevaluate payment rates for doctors, which already took a hit during the recession and are now among the lowest in the nation.\u00a0 \u201cIt just creates more fights around resources at the state level than we currently have,\u201d Roby said.\u00a0 Roby said Congress could pass changes to Medicaid funding\u00a0in the first few months of 2017 in a process\u00a0known as reconciliation, which  requires only a simple majority in the Senate. However, the restructuring likely wouldn\u2019t take effect for a few years, he said.\u00a0 Officials in California say they will fight to keep Medi-Cal as it is, but it\u2019s too early to know what they\u2019ll be faced with.\u00a0 \u201cThere are lots of open questions,\u201d said\u00a0state Sen.\u00a0 Ed Hernandez \u00a0(D-West Covina), who chairs that chamber\u2019s health committee . \u201cAs long as I\u2019m in the Legislature I will do everything I can to ensure that residents in the state of California have access to healthcare.\u2026 It\u2019s inhumane if we put people in the streets without health insurance.\u201d Some Californians could lose benefits if Trump carries out plan to restructure Medicaid Pam Gross, 54,\u00a0has relied on Medi-Cal for decades to afford treatment for lupus and fibromyalgia.

She\u2019s worried any changes to Medi-Cal will disrupt her healthcare regimen, which includes several doctors\u2019 appointments each week and treatment from 10 specialists. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) See more videos Pam Gross, 54,\u00a0has relied on Medi-Cal for decades to afford treatment for lupus and fibromyalgia. She\u2019s worried any changes to Medi-Cal will disrupt her healthcare regimen, which includes several doctors\u2019 appointments each week and treatment from 10 specialists. \u201cI actually talked to my doctors about the whole thing, and I said, \u2018OK \u2026\u00a0what can I go without?\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018Nothing,\u2019 \u201d said Gross, who lives in Carpinteria.\u00a0 The structural changes to Medicaid would likely also give states more autonomy over their programs, a welcome change for state officials who\u00a0want to trim benefits or restrict eligibility.\u00a0 Strict federal laws currently prohibit states from limiting Medicaid enrollment.\u00a0The state of Montana, for example, wasn\u2019t allowed to make job training classes mandatory for people who signed up for Medicaid.\u00a0 In a sign of support for loosening these restrictions,\u00a0Trump chose\u00a0 Seema Verma to head\u00a0the\u00a0Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Verma is the architect of an\u00a0 unusual Medicaid expansion model in Indiana \u2014\u00a0where Vice President-elect Mike Pence was governor at the time \u2014 that requires enrollees to pay a small fee to join. \u201cThis idea of fiscal responsibility, but also allowing states to make decisions from a policy perspective about their Medicaid population, that currently isn\u2019t allowed in federal statute,\u201d Roby said. California, however, has long been committed to providing coverage to as many people as possible without restrictions. The rollout of the Affordable Care Act in California is generally considered a success, with the state cutting its uninsured population by half.\u00a0 A group of legislators has launched a campaign to extend coverage even further \u2014\u00a0to immigrants in the country illegally who aren\u2019t allowed to sign up under the law.\u00a0In one of the movement\u2019s first successes, such immigrants under 19 were able to sign up for Medi-Cal starting in May.\u00a0\u00a0 UC Berkeley\u2019s Lucia said that such efforts\u00a0to further expand coverage could stop\u00a0if California has to begin considering ways to reduce Medi-Cal spending. \u201cWe have a lot of forward momentum in California, and this really threatens that,\u201d she said.

A police vehicle blocks the road leading to the scene of an attack in Istanbul, Turkey, last month. (Associated Press) Associated Press The man suspected of killing 39 people during an attack on a nightclub in Istanbul during New Year's celebrations has been caught in a police operation, Turkish media reported early Tuesday. The suspect was caught in a special operations police raid on a house in a housing complex in Istanbul's Esenyurt district, private NTV television said. The report said he had been staying in the house belonging to a Kyrgyz friend. Islamic State has claimed responsibility, saying the attack was in reprisal for Turkish military operations in northern Syria.\u00a0The suspect had been on the run since the attack. Hurriyet newspaper and other media have identified the suspected gunman as Abdulkadir Masharipov, an Uzbek national. He was to undergo medical checks before being taken to a police headquarters for questioning, the paper said in its online edition. Dogan news agency published what it said was the first image of the suspected attacker. It showed a bruised, black-haired man in a gray, bloodied\u00a0shirt being held by his neck. NTV television said the man had resisted arrest. The Istanbul nightclub shooting suspect after being caught by Turkish police in Istanbul, late Monday.

(Depo Photos via AP) NTV reported that the gunman's Kyrgyz friend and three other people also were detained. His 4-year-old child, who was with him at the home, was taken into protective custody. The television channel said police established the suspect's whereabouts four or five days ago, but delayed the raid so they could monitor his movements and contacts. The state-run Anadolu Agency also reported the arrest and identified the suspected gunman, only with a slightly different spelling of his first name, Abdulgadir. It said a Kyrgyz man and three women were detained with him Anadolu said the suspects were being taken to Istanbul's main police headquarters for questioning. Police were carrying out raids on other suspected Islamic State group cells, the news agency said without providing details. Earlier in the day, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said the Reina nightclub attack had been carried out professionally with the help of an intelligence organization, a claim he had made in the first days after the attack. He did not name the organization suspected of being involved. Hundreds of people were gathered at the swanky Reina nightclub to celebrate the end of a tumultuous 2016 only to become the first victims of 2017. The gunman shot a police officer and a civilian outside the club, then stormed the premises.

    "text": "Omarosa Manigault Set to Join Donald Trump's White House Staff He also said, \"You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street,\u201d which Trump echoed this weekend with references to Lewis\u2019 congressional district, which includes both affluent and impoverished areas, as being in \u201chorrible shape and falling apart.\u201d Many people took offense to the September campaign remark in particular, with President Obama out in front. \"You may have heard Hillary's opponent in the election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. He missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow,\" Obama said in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus in September after Trump's comment. Trump also triggered controversy when he mentioned black youth unemployment in his stump speeches, claiming multiple times that 58 percent are out of work. His campaign has told ABC News that he based the number on 2015 Bureau of Labor Statistics data and included not only 16- to 24-year-old black Americans who were unemployed, but also those whom the federal government didn\u2019t count in the labor force, which likely included a number of full-time students not seeking work. Public Outreach During the Campaign Trump made a handful of campaign stops directly aimed at African-American voters , including his first visit to a black church in Detroit in September alongside Carson where he delivered a message of unity that included a call to address economic challenges in the black community. He then later visited another black church in Flint, Michigan, but was scolded by the pastor when he started to condemn Hillary Clinton. Trump later called the female pastor \"a nervous mess.\" Carlo Allegri/Reuters Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Omarosa Manigault attend a church service, in Detroit, Michigan, Sept. 3, 2016. He declined several invitations to speak to groups such as the NAACP, the Urban League and a joint conference of the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists. When asked in August about Trump\u2019s decisions to skip those events, Manigault pointed out that the NAACP event was scheduled for the same day as the start of the RNC, so Trump \u201cmade the difficult decision\u201d to skip the conference in favor of being in Cleveland to hear his wife, Melania Trump, address the crowd. \u201cCertainly he should have an opportunity to address the bodies of those organizations, but it\u2019s not the only opportunity,\u201d Manigault said of the declined invitations.\u201d Trump also held meetings with groups of African-American pastors, most of whom became part of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. In the end, he did get 8 percent of the African-American vote in the presidential election. Pre-Campaign Clashes Even before entering the political fray, Trump had public run-ins with the African-American community. The first came in 1973, five years after he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. Trump was deeply involved in the family\u2019s New York City real estate business when the Justice Department filed a housing discrimination suit against Donald Trump, father Fred and their real estate management corporation. The civil suit claimed the Trump management corporation \u2013 of which Donald Trump was president \u2013 had been \u201cdiscriminating against black persons in the operation of their buildings,\u201d according to the DOJ's news release on the date of the filing, Oct. 15, 1973. The Trumps \u201cvigorously deny said allegations,\u201d the court document states. The agreement, which laid out the specific terms that the Trumps would have to abide by moving forward, noted that it was \u201cin no way an admission by it of a violation of the prohibition against discrimination.\u201d The complaint against Fred Trump and Donald Trump was \u201cdismissed against them in their personal capacity, with prejudice.\u201d Later, in 1989, Trump inserted himself in the controversial Central Park Five case , in which five minority teens were accused of brutally attacking a white woman. Trump paid for open letters to be published in four major New York-area papers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty in connection to the case and painting a stark picture of life in the city amid a diminished police force. All five of the accused -- four of whom are African American and one is Hispanic -- made various confessions, which later came under review, and were convicted on differing combinations of charges \u2014 including rape, robbery, attempted murder, assault and riot \u2014 and served time. In 2002, the five were exonerated after an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Another man confessed to the crime. The Central Park Five case came up during last year\u2019s campaign, when in October Trump reiterated his suggestion that he still believed the five were guilty . 0 Shares ",

Eisenstein advertisement Already taking aim at Mexico, President-elect Donald Trump is now warning he might enact a 35 percent \"border tax\" on Canadian and German automobile imports. \"You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax,\" Trump told the German newspaper Bild, in an interview published Monday. \"In the long term, the United States would be shooting itself in the foot by imposing tariffs or other trade barriers,\" said Matthias Wissmann, president of the German automotive industry association VDA. Play In Trump they trust: Voters speak out on why they chose Trump 4:44 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170117001335if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/855781955507\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Trump specifically focused on BMW, noting that it is building a plant in Mexico that would produce vehicles for the U.S. market. But BMW would not be alone among German automakers. Audi last year opened a Mexican plant that is now the sole global source for the newly redesigned Q5 sport-utility vehicle. And Mercedes-Benz is preparing to set up a joint venture with Nissan's Infiniti brand in the Mexican city of Aguascalientes, where it will produce some of its new entry-luxury models. Mexico has become one of the world's top five automotive manufacturing sites in recent years, in part due to low labor costs but also because it has negotiated more free trade agreements than any other country but Israel, auto industry experts note. Threatening Tweets The president-elect began threatening to impose automotive import taxes early in his campaign, initially focusing on Ford, which last April said it was going to move production of its small cars to a new factory south of the border. More recently, Trump tweeted threats aimed at General Motors and Toyota for also producing some of their vehicles in Mexico. Related: Ford Cancels Mexico Plant but Is Still Moving Small Car Production Earlier this month, Ford announced that it was scrapping plans for the $1.6 billion factory, triggering a congratulatory note from the incoming Commander-in-Chief. Ironically, Ford also said it would continue with plans to move its small Focus model to Mexico, instead producing it at another, underutilized Mexican factory. Several senior Ford executives have stressed to NBC that they do not intend to give up on Mexican production. Related: Trump Takes Credit for Keeping Ford Plant in the U.S. - But it Wasn't Leaving GM Chairman CEO Mary Barra, recently named to Trump's economic advisory council, sent the same message last week during a media gathering at the North American International Auto Show. Meanwhile, BMW CEO Peter Schwarzenbauer responded to Trump's threat by telling reporters the Bavarian automaker will not back down on plans to set up its $1 billion plant in Mexico, which is set to go into operation in 2019. But Dieter Zetsche, the CEO of Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG left a little wiggle room in comments made during the Detroit Auto Show. Zetsche said he considered the automaker's Mexican plans \"reasonable,\" and stressed it was too early to determine what the new Trump administration will actually do. But he also said that, \"Politics set the framework for the economy and companies have to adjust to the framework, if needed.\" Mercedes-Benzes are produced at Mercedes' U.S. plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 2014. Daimler AG BMW Is America's Biggest Car Exporter German auto industry officials are privately expressing frustration with the threats from Trump, noting that they have quadrupled their U.S. automotive production since the beginning of the decade. And about half of the 850,000 vehicles the Germans produced here last year were exported. The BMW plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for example, is the sole source for the globally popular X5 model. \"It is surprising that Trump singles out the carmaker that exports more vehicles from the United States than any other manufacturer,\" said a report from Evercore ISI. BMW exports about 65 percent of the production from Spartanburg. Related: Japan Reminds Trump It Has Invested More Than $21 Billion Japanese manufacturers have expressed similar frustration, noting they have invested tens of billions of dollars in the U.S., broadly expanding their American operations since the country emerged from recession. Honda, for example, produces more than 90 percent of the vehicles it sells in the States in U.S. plants, but it does import a small number of products from the U.S. and Mexico. Automakers emphasize that operations throughout North America are tightly integrated and are woven into their broader, global manufacturing networks. Shifting production of all models to the U.S. would be difficult to impossible, especially limited-volume products like the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback produced in Mexico. The sedan version of the Cruz, by far the high-volume offering, comes from a factory in Ohio. Related: Scrubbing NAFTA Could Cost the U.S. Auto Industry 30,000 Jobs If new trade barriers go up, analyst Dave Cole, director-emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research, or CAR, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, warns it would result in \"lower choice for consumers and higher prices.\" CAR last week issued a report noting that because the U.S. also ships cars and car parts to Mexico, the proposed restrictions would actually cost about 31,000 jobs. What About Canada? That report may soften support for rethinking the North American Free Trade Agreement by the United Auto Workers Union. Though the UAW supported Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, during the presidential election, it subsequently announced it would support efforts to change or abandon NAFTA. But the threat of losing, rather than gaining jobs, has not been lost on union officials in the U.S. or Canada. \"He's throwing grenades everywhere,\" Jerry Dias, the head of Unifor, the Canadian autoworkers union, said recently.

A deadly shooting occurred in the early morning hours outside the nightclub while it was hosting part of the BPM electronic music festival, according to police.\u00a0 Police guard the entrance of the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, on\u00a0Jan. 16, 2017. A deadly shooting occurred in the early morning hours outside the nightclub while it was hosting part of the BPM electronic music festival, according to police.\u00a0 (Associated Press) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Gunfire broke out in a crowded beachfront nightclub throbbing with electronic music before dawn Monday, causing five deaths and setting off a bloody stampede by screaming concertgoers at an international festival in this Caribbean resort. At least one person died in the crush to escape and some of the 15 people wounded or injured were hurt in the rush out, authorities said. Quintana Roo state Attorney General Miguel Angel Pech ruled out any terror attack, and the state's governor said it involved a personal dispute. Pech said the shooting erupted when security personnel tried to stop a man from entering the Blue Parrot club with a gun. Three of those killed were part of the security detail at the 10-day BPM electronic music festival, Pech said. State officials said the dead included two Canadians, an Italian and a Colombian. The gunman apparently fled. \"I was thinking it was the same thing that happened in Paris, some guy just walking in and shooting people at a restaurant, bang bang bang, a terrorist attack,\" said New Zealand tourist Tyler Klee, who was outside the club when shots rang out. \"Everyone ran, everyone was terrified, looking for their friends ... We were running away and then you hear more shots fired, like you don't know if you're going to be shot in the back or not.\" His friend Ben Forbes, from Australia, said: \"It happened pretty quickly as well ... You still didn't know where they were, how many there were.\" Mexico Shooting AP Police guard the exit of the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, on\u00a0Jan. 16, 2017. Police guard the exit of the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, on\u00a0Jan. 16, 2017. (AP) Pech, the state attorney general, said the 15 people with injuries included a Mexican woman who was seriously injured. He said eight of the injured, including two U.S. citizens, were treated at hospitals and released. Canada's Global Affairs office confirmed at least one Canadian died and said it was investigating the other reported fatality. It said at least two Canadians were injured. Italy's Foreign Ministry confirmed one of its citizens died. The shooting occurred near the largest exit, setting off chaos as concert goers had to scramble over a metal fence to escape to the beach. Jeffrey Castelein, 33, a fork lift operator from Belgium, said he heard 15 to 20 shots before he and his friends leapt the fence. \"At first we didn't realize, and then everybody fell down and you had to hide a little bit. And then we went out the back by the sea.\" His group got separated and had to wait for everyone to meet back at the apartment. \"It was the longest 20 minutes of my life,\" Castelein said. Pech said the shooter apparently tried to enter the nightclub about 2:30 a.m., but was denied access because he had a gun. He then began to exchange fire with another person, and festival security personnel who tried to stop the shooting came under fire, Pech said. He said 20 bullet casings from three different pistols were found at the scene, but it was unclear if the security detail was armed or fired any of the weapons. Pech said the gunman himself apparently escaped, though three people had been detained nearby. It was not known if they had been involved in the shooting. \"We know of another shooting incident that occurred near the nightclub, but we are investigating whether that is related\" to the deadly shooting, Pech said. Quintana Roo Gov. Carlos Joaquin attributed the shooting to \"the intolerance and conflict of interests between two people,\" and also referred to it as \"a personal conflict.\" But he did not specify what the conflict was. He said the two exchanged gunfire. Playa del Carmen has largely been spared the violence that has hit other parts of Mexico. The state tourism department said the shooting was an \"isolated act of violence\" and stressed that \"the situation in Playa del Carmen is under control and Mexican and foreign tourists can feel protected and safe.\" Without providing nationalities, the state government gave the names of three of those killed. They included Kirk Wilson, who the state identified as the BPM security supervisor at the Blue Parrot, and Daniel Pessina and Rafael Antonio Penaloza Vega. Associated Press ",

The Boeing 747 had been trying to land in intermittent dense fog, local officials told NBC News. The aircraft had five people on board. Tolgonai Stamaliyeva, a government spokesperson, said the plane destroyed more than 20 houses. Plumes of smoke rose above the crash site, with some buildings razed to the ground and others pierced by parts of the plane. A Turkish cargo plane crashed into a village near Kyrgyzstan's main airport on Monday. VYACHESLAV OSELEDKO / AFP - Getty Images The torn-off tail assembly, rotated upside down, towered above a one-story house. More than 1,000 rescue workers were at the scene by late morning. A dozen body bags were laid out on the ground in the yard of one of the homes. A car parked nearby was mangled, and a fridge lying open nearby. Reports of the death toll on Monday ranged from 37 people according to emergency officials in the Central Asian nation, to 31 reported by the presidential press office. Fifteen people \u2014 including six children \u2014 were hospitalized. Rescuers carry a body bag at the crash site near Bishkek on Monday. VYACHESLAV OSELEDKO / AFP - Getty Images Locals said they had initially thought the area was struck by an earthquake. \"I woke up because of a bright red light outside,\" Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local television. \"I couldn't understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. I was so scared but I managed to cover my son's face with my hands so that debris would not fall on him.\" Photos: Turkish Cargo Plane Crashes into Kyrgyz Village Authorities said the plane was supposed to make a stopover at Manas airport, near the capital city Bishkek, on its way from Hong Kong to Istanbul. It crashed when trying to land in poor visibility at 7:31 a.m. local time (8:31 pm ET). Kyrgyzstan's transport ministry initially identified the plane as a Turkish Airlines Boeing 747-400, but the company said it belonged to another Turkish firm, ACT Airlines. Officials work in the remains of the crashed Turkish Boeing 747 cargo plane on Monday. Vladimir Voronin / AP \"Our condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in the tragic incident involving an ACT Airlines aircraft in Kyrgyzstan,\" Turkish Airlines said on its Twitter account. One of the two flight recorders has been recovered at the scene, the office of the Kyrgyz prime minister said on Monday afternoon. Manas airport spokeswoman Alia Kurbanova denied that conditions were too poor to land safely. \"We've had 11 planes land that night. There was fog on and off, but planes were landing,\" Kurbanova said by phone. Alexey Eremenko ",

Crowley, who had been chosen for senior director of strategic communications for Trump's National Security Council, announced she was bowing out to \"pursue other opportunities.\" The moves comes after the conservative media commentator was hit with allegations of plagiarism, first in a Jan. 7 report by CNN that found she had plagiarized large sections of her 2012 book \"What The (Bleep) Just Happened\" and again two days later when Politco reported Crowley had lifted numerous passages in her Ph.D dissertation. Monica Crowley in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 15, 2016. Evan Vucci / AP, file Crowley said in a statement to the Washington Times that she would be remaining in New York to pursue other opportunities and not join the incoming administration. \"After much reflection I have decided to remain in New York to pursue other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming administration,\" she said in the statement. \"I greatly appreciate being asked to be part of President-elect Trump's team and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal.\" In December, Trump announced his selection of Crowley for the communications role, where she would have potentially worked alongside Trump's pick for national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn. \"The NSC will miss the opportunity to have Monica Crowley as part of our team. We wish her all the best in her future,\" Gen. Flynn said in a statement to the Washington Times. HarperCollins, the publisher of \"What the (Bleep) Just Happened?\" said last week it would be halting sales of Crowley's book after the allegations. \"The book, which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material,\" the publisher said in a statement.

He was 82. NASA announced that former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, died Jan. 16, 2017, surrounded by his family. He was 82. (NASA via AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Former astronaut Gene Cernan, who as the last person to walk on the moon returned to Earth with a message of \"peace and hope for all mankind,\" died on Monday, his family said. He was 82. Cernan was with his relatives when he died at a Houston hospital following ongoing heath issues, family spokeswoman Melissa Wren told The Associated Press. His family said his devotion to lunar exploration never waned. \"Even at the age of 82, Gene was passionate about sharing his desire to see the continued human exploration of space and encouraged our nation's leaders and young people to not let him remain the last man to walk on the Moon,\" his family said in a statement released by NASA . Cernan was commander of NASA's Apollo 17 mission and on his third space flight when he set foot on the lunar surface in December 1972. He became the last of only a dozen men to walk on the moon on Dec. 14, 1972 \u2014 tracing his only child's initials in the dust before climbing the ladder of the lunar module the last time. It was a moment that forever defined him in both the public eye and his own. \"Those steps up that ladder, they were tough to make,\" Cernan recalled in a 2007 oral history. \"I didn't want to go up. I wanted to stay a while.\" Cernan called it \"perhaps the brightest moment of my life. ... It's like you would want to freeze that moment and take it home with you. But you can't.\" Decades later, Cernan tried to ensure he wasn't the last person to walk on the moon, testifying before Congress to push for a return. But as the years went by he realized he wouldn't live to witness someone follow in his footsteps \u2014 still visible on the moon more than 40 years later. Gene Cernan Cliff Owen / AP Former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last astronaut on the moon, testifies before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing on NASA's proposed budget and the future of the manned space flight program on Capitol Hill in Washington. Former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last astronaut on the moon, testifies before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing on NASA's proposed budget and the future of the manned space flight program on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Cliff Owen / AP) \"Neil (Armstrong, who died in 2012) and I aren't going to see those next young Americans who walk on the moon. And God help us if they're not Americans,\" Cernan testified before Congress in 2011. \"When I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That's my big goal.\" Cernan died less than six weeks after another American space hero, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Their flights weren't the first or last of the Mercury and Apollo eras. Yet to the public they were the bookends of America's space age glory, starting with Godspeed John Glenn and ending with Cernan's footprints on the moon. On Dec. 11, 1972, Cernan guided the lander, named Challenger, into a lunar valley called Taurus-Littrow, with Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt at his side. He recalled the silence after the lunar lander's engine shut down. \"That's where you experience the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime,\" Cernan said in 2007. \"There's no vibration. There's no noise. The ground quit talking. Your partner is mesmerized. He can't say anything. \"The dust is gone. It's a realization, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there (somewhere in the) universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by human beings \u2014 human eyes \u2014 for the first time.\" Three days earlier, Cernan, Schmitt and Ronald Evans had blasted off atop a Saturn rocket in the first manned nighttime launch from Kennedy Space Center. Evans remained behind as pilot of the command module that orbited the moon while the other two landed on the moon's surface. Cernan and Schmitt, a geologist, spent more than three days on the moon, including more than 22 hours outside the lander, and collected 249 pounds of lunar samples. \"In that whole three days, I don't think there's anything that became routine,\" Cernan recalled. \"But if I had to focus on one thing ... it was just to look back at the overwhelming and overpowering beauty of this Earth.\" \"To go a quarter of a million miles away into space and have to take time out to sleep and rest ... I wished I could have stayed awake for 75 hours straight. I knew when I left I'd never have a chance to come back.\" Completing their third moon walk on Dec. 14, Schmitt returned to the lunar module and was followed by Cernan. \"We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind,\" Cernan said. Gene Cernan Gene Siskel Film Center / HANDOUT Eugene Cernan in \"The Last Man on the Moon.\"\u00a0 Eugene Cernan in \"The Last Man on the Moon.\"\u00a0 (Gene Siskel Film Center / HANDOUT) He later acknowledged that he had grasped for words to leave behind, knowing how the world remembered Neil Armstrong's \"giant leap for mankind\" on stepping on the moon in 1969. Before heading home, Cernan said he drew the letters \"TDC\" \u2014 the initials of his then 9-year-old daughter, Teresa Dawn \u2014 with his finger on the dusty gray lunar surface. He said he imagined someone in the distant future would find \"our lunar rover and our footprints and those initials and say, 'I wonder who was here? Some ancient civilization was here back in the 20th century, and look at the funny marks they made.'\" Eugene A. Cernan was born in 1934 in Chicago and graduated from Indiana's Purdue University in 1956 with a degree in electrical engineering. (Armstrong also was a Purdue grad.) He had been a Navy attack pilot and earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering when NASA selected him in October 1963 as one of 14 members of its third astronaut class. Cernan had the looks of an astronaut from central casting. \"He's your classic sort of handsome debonair flyboy,\" said space historian Roger Launius, associate director of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. In 1966, he was pilot of Gemini 9, a three-day flight with command pilot Tom Stafford where they used different techniques to rendezvous with a docking adapter that was previously launched. On the flight, Cernan became the second American to walk in space, spending more than two hours outside the Gemini spacecraft. Cernan would later call the mission, \"that spacewalk from hell.\" \"It was very serious,\" said Launius, the historian. \"He lost all kinds of water, his equipment did not work effectively. He overheated. His visor glossed over with water, he could barely see. He barely got back in the spacecraft.\" Cernan's sweat so much he lost 13 pounds. The space agency was forced to go back to the drawing board. \"That was a really important learning experience,\" Launius said. \"The difficult thing about that is they put an astronaut's life at great risk there. They learned the lesson.\" With the Apollo program under way, Cernan flew on Apollo 10 in May 1969. It was a dress rehearsal for the lunar landing on the next flight and took Cernan and Stafford, aboard the lunar module Snoopy, to within 9\u00bd miles of the moon's surface. The mission was marked by a glitch when the wrong guidance system was turned on and the lunar module went out of control before Stafford righted it by taking manual control. Cernan often joked that his job was to paint a white line to the moon that Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 crew could follow. Yet Cernan was one of only three people to voyage twice to the moon \u2014 either to its surface or in moon orbit. James Lovell and John Young are the others. In 1973, Cernan became special assistant to the program manager of the Apollo program at Johnson Space Center in Houston, assisting in planning and development of the U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz mission. He was senior U.S. negotiator with the Soviets on the test project. He retired from NASA three years later. He worked for a Houston energy firm, Coral Petroleum, then in 1981 began his own aerospace consulting company. He eventually became chairman of an engineering firm that worked on NASA projects. He also worked as a network television analyst during shuttle flights in the 1980s. A documentary about his life, \"The Last Man on the Moon\" was released in 2016. Teresa was Cernan's only child with his wife Barbara. The couple married in 1961 and divorced 20 years later. In 1987, he married again, to Jan Nanna, and they lived in Houston. In all, Cernan logged 566 hours and 15 minutes in space, more than 73 hours of them on the moon's surface. \"I can always walk on Main Street again, but I can never return to my Valley of Taurus-Littrow, and that cold fact has left me with a yearning restlessness,\" he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, also entitled \"The Last Man on the Moon.\" \"It was perhaps the brightest moment of my life, and I can't go back,\" he said. \"Enriched by a singular event that is larger than life, I no longer have the luxury of being ordinary.\" Cernan is survived by his wife, Jan Nanna Cernan, his daughter and son-in-law, Tracy Cernan Woolie and Marion Woolie, step-daughters Kelly Nanna Taff and husband, Michael, and Danielle Nanna Ellis and nine grandchildren.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 16, 2017 12:35 PM EST Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis spoke Monday about the legacy of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., telling students at a scholarship breakfast event in Miami to \u201cbe brave\u201d and \u201cnever, ever give up.\u201d \u201cMaybe one of you will be a mayor, a city councilperson, a great teacher, a member of the House, a member of the Senate, governor of this state, maybe president of the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cDream dreams and never, ever give up on your dreams.\u201d Lewis, who brought prepared remarks but said he was not going to use them, spoke for approximately 30 minutes about his experiences with King during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, saying King is responsible for the trajectory of his life. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Martin Luther King Jr. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be,\u201d he said, adding he might be \u201cstill down in rural Alabama, preaching to chickens.\u201d Pence calls Lewis' comment on Trump's legitimacy \"deeply disappointing\" What Lewis did not mention was his recent disagreement with President-elect Donald Trump. In an NBC interview last week, Lewis said he did not view Mr. Trump as a \u201clegitimate president,\u201d given the Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election . He also said he would not be attending Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday, the first time he\u2019ll miss the ceremony in three decades. Mr. Trump responded by lambasting Lewis on Twitter , calling him \u201call talk, talk talk - no action or results,\u201d and saying Lewis\u2019s Georgia district is \u201ccrime infested\u201d and \u201cfalling apart.\u201d Lewis talked about walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama on what became known as Bloody Sunday, saying that day when he was being beaten, \u201cI thought I saw death.\u201d The Georgia congressman encouraged unity among all people in the United States, saying the country needs to face its challenges together. \u201cOur foremothers and forefathers all came to this great land in different ships, but we\u2019re all in the same boat now,\u201d he said, adding that regardless of race \u201cwe are one people, we are one family, we all live in the same house the American house and we must look out for each other.\u201d He also cautioned people against violence, saying the \u201cmost powerful\u201d way to effect change is to cast a vote in a democratic election. \u201cThe vote is precious, it is almost sacred,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt is the most powerful nonviolent instrument or tool that we have in a democratic society and we must use it.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Ukraine's current stresses can be traced back to 2014. Protests and violent clashes broke out in the capital, Kiev, with security forces killing dozens of people in the streets. The demonstrators were angry at their Moscow-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych, ditching stronger integration with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, eventually being replaced by the current president, Petro Poroshenko, and his Western-backed government. The Kremlin refused to recognize this new administration, however, and its forces seized and then annexed Ukraine's southern peninsula of Crimea. Separatist rebels allegedly backed by Moscow also seized parts of eastern Ukraine, where much of the population traditionally identifies as ethnic Russia. Despite two internationally-brokered ceasefire agreements, the fighting continues The ensuing conflict has since seen some 10,000 people killed and 3.8 million in need of humanitarian aid. People pay their respects at the coffin of Volodymyr Andreshkiv, a serviceman with the volunteer \"Kievan Rus\" battalion, during his funeral on Dec. 22. He died in heavy fighting in Debaltseve in the Donetsk region. Sergei Supinsky / AFP - Getty Images The U.S. has provided the Ukrainian government with some $3 billion in assistance. But this being continued under Trump looks shaky at best. The president-elect and Putin have signaled they may be heading toward a rapprochement, an about-turn from the frosty relations with Moscow that characterized President Barack Obama's second term. Furthermore, some foreign policy experts have suggested that Trump could sacrifice America's influence in Ukraine as part of a \"grand bargain\" with Putin that involves a settlement of the Syria conflict. There are other links. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, ran the 2010 campaign of Yanukovich, Ukraine's ousted leader, and was plagued by questions regarding his involvement with the Moscow-backed regime. Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said during a confirmation hearing that Russia's annexation of Crimea was \"illegal.\" But Trump told The Times (of London) on Monday that he may drop the very sanctions that Obama slapped on Russia over Crimea in exchange for Moscow reducing its arsenal of nuclear weapons. After Trump's election, Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, called Ukraine the \"biggest loser in the world tonight.\" Biggest loser in the world tonight-- Ukraine. Your only hope is to get really serious about reform and keep Euros supportive. \u2014 Michael McFaul (@McFaul) November 9, 2016 Vice President Joe Biden also referenced Trump's likely withdrawal from Ukraine during his swansong visit to the country on Monday. Asked if the president-elect would give the same backing as the Obama administration had, Biden gave a tellingly vague answer, according to Reuters, telling reporters: \"Hope springs eternal.\" Putin's opponents in Russia are similarly concerned. \"It looks like difficult times are coming to Ukraine,\" opposition activist and politician Ilia Yashin told BBC radio on Monday. \"It looks like, for Putin, it's a good time to get back control of Ukraine and I believe that he will work so hard on this.\" In a December report titled: \"The Kremlin's Hybrid Aggression,\" Yashin said that Putin wants control over Ukraine for three reasons: To boost his own popularity at home, to control its industrial assets, and to \"put a question mark over the Cold War outcomes,\" a territorial loss many Russians are unhappy about. A map showing the location of Ukraine. Google Maps \"If Putin's unrelenting pressure proves fruitful, and Kiev returns into the domain of the Kremlin influence, then there is no doubt that the Russian president will attempt applying the same methods towards other countries of the former USSR,\" the report said. Russia's attempt to regain control of Ukraine would likely be more subtle than a full-blown invasion, according to analysts. Rather, it would likely attempt to install a leader who was at least sympathetic to Moscow's aims, perhaps using the same tactics it allegedly employed in the U.S. election. Last month, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the November 8 election. The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe \"with a high level of confidence\" that Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign. Ukraine's elections are not until 2019, but RUSI's Eyal said that Ukraine's weak economy and ongoing military conflict meant that he doubts \"we will get there without any surprises.\" Some experts believe Putin may choose to bide his time. \"There's a feeling in Moscow that time is working in their interests; the longer that the war continues the more they are likely to win,\" Eyal added. \"The reading in Moscow is that they have much more room for maneuver in Ukraine than ever before and they have more of a chance of sanctions collapsing than ever before.\" Members of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic forces walk behind armored personnel carriers in the village of Petrivske, Ukraine, on Oct. 3, 2016.

    "text": "European Leaders React to Donald Trump's Interviews on NATO, Russia, Brexit By Elizabeth McLaughlin Jan 16, 2017, 12:39 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Trump on Obamacare, Drug Companies and CIA Chief John Brennan 0 Shares Email European leaders reacted today to a wide-ranging interview with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that touched on a variety of European issues from NATO to Brexit . In the interview with German newspaper Bild and The Times of London, Trump again called NATO \u201cobsolete,\u201d said he\u2019d make a trade deal with Britain \u201cvery quickly,\u201d and predicted other nations would leave the European Union after Britain\u2019s historic Brexit vote last June. Here\u2019s how European leaders are reacting to Trump\u2019s latest comments. NATO Trump repeated a statement he made during the campaign that NATO is \"obsolete,\" raising doubts about whether the U.S., under his leadership, would jump to the defense of its NATO allies in Europe if Russia attacked them. \u201cI said a long time ago that NATO had problems. Number one, it was obsolete because it was designed many, many years ago. Number two, the countries aren\u2019t paying what they\u2019re supposed to pay,\" Trump told the Times. \"I took such heat, when I said NATO was obsolete. It\u2019s obsolete because it wasn\u2019t taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right.\" \u201cAnd the other thing is the countries aren\u2019t paying their fair share so we\u2019re supposed to protect countries,\" Trump added. \"But a lot of these countries aren\u2019t paying what they\u2019re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States.\" NATO's collective defense agreement requires all member countries to come to the aid of any member state that is attacked. At the same time, Trump said that NATO is still \"very important\" to him. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, speaking to reporters ahead of a European Union foreign ministers meeting, said Trump's view on NATO has \"caused astonishment\" and is contradictory to what his pick for defense secretary, General James Mattis , told senators during his confirmation hearing last week. \"This is in contradiction with what [Mattis] said in his hearing in Washington only some days ago and we have to see what will be the consequences for American policy,\" Steinmeier said. On Thursday, Mattis called NATO \u201cthe most successful military alliance probably in modern history, maybe ever.\u201d Mattis: 'No Plan' to Roll Back Women's Advancements in Military But Moscow echoed Trump\u2019s sentiment that NATO was \u201cobsolete.\u201d \"NATO is truly a remnant, and we agree with this,\u201d Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday. \u201cWe have long been expressing our opinion on the organization, whose systemic objective is confrontation.\u201d RUSSIA When asked if Trump supported sanctions by European countries against Russia, Trump responded that it could be possible to \u201cmake some good deals with Russia\u201d in the future if its nuclear arsenals were reduced. \"Well, I think that people need to get along and do what they need to do to be fair. OK? They have sanctions against Russia -- let's see if we can make some good deals with Russia,\u201d Trump told Bild, with almost identical comments to the Times. \u201cOn the one hand, I find that there should be significantly fewer nuclear weapons and they would have to be significantly reduced, that is one of them. But there are these sanctions, and Russia is currently suffering from it. But I think there could be many things that would benefit a lot of people.\" In Moscow, Peskov urged caution, instead saying that the Kremlin would \u201chave patience and wait for Mr. Trump to take office as president of the U.S. before evaluating specific initiatives.\u201d At the same time, Trump was critical of Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria, calling it a \u201cvery bad thing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad thing, [the U.S.] had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand and nothing happened. That was the only time. And now, it\u2019s sort of very late. It\u2019s too late. ... But Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town -- they can\u2019t even walk and they\u2019re shooting \u2019em -- it almost looks like they\u2019re shooting \u2019em for sport -- ah no, that\u2019s ... a terrible situation,\u201d Trump told the Times. \u201cAleppo is in such a terrible humanitarian situation,\" he also told Bild. In the past, Trump has faced bipartisan criticism for his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin , as well as his choice for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , the former CEO of ExxonMobil who has close business ties to Russia and was given the Order of Friendship from Putin in 2014. BREXIT In the wake of Britain voting to leave the European Union, Trump said he would do a \u201cfair\u201d trade deal with the country within weeks of taking office. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly. Good for both sides,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will be meeting with [U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May]. She\u2019s requesting a meeting and we\u2019ll have a meeting right after I get into the White House and it\u2019ll be, I think we\u2019re gonna get something done very quickly.\u201d The Times of London wrote that a potential trade deal \"would open further a huge market for British goods and services.\" I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain, a longtime U.S. ally, is very special! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 8, 2017 British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson , who helped lead the movement for Britain to leave the E.U., called Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cvery good news.\u201d Overall, Trump said Brexit would \u201cend up being a great thing\u201d and predicted other E.U. countries would leave. \u201cPeople, countries, want their own identity and the U.K. wanted its own identity,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cBut, I do believe this, if they hadn\u2019t been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it ... entails, I think that you wouldn\u2019t have a Brexit. This was the final straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. ... I believe others will leave.\u201d Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016 Trump called the E.U. \u201ca vehicle for Germany\u201d and said it was \u201csmart\u201d for the U.K. to leave. He also criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to accept Syrian refugees escaping years of a civil war that has left half a million people dead. \u201cI think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know, taking all of the people from wherever they come from,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cAnd nobody even knows where they come from. So I think she made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake.\u201d Merkel responded Monday at a news conference, saying about the E.U., \u201cI think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands.\u201d But she did not weigh in on his criticism of her migrant policy. \u201cI am personally waiting for the inauguration of the U.S. president. Then of course we will work with him on all levels,\u201d Merkel responded. Trump promised that within his first days in office he would issue a \u201cdecree\u201d that would \u201cturn around safeguarding [U.S.] borders.\u201d \u201cWe do not want people from Syria to come to us, of whom we do not know who they are. There is no way for us to check these people. I do not want to do it like Germany,\u201d Trump told Bild. \u201cI have great respect for Merkel, I must say. I have great respect for her. But I find it was very unhappy what happened.\u201d 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports) 186 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Could Chip Kelly be the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 new offensive coordinator? The team has yet to announce who will call the plays under new coach Doug Marrone, and Kelly \u2013 the former Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers coach \u2013 was at Jaguars headquarters on Monday, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting had not been announced. Kelly\u2019s visit to Jaguars headquarters was first reported by 1010XL in Jacksonville. ESPN reported over the weekend that Kelly quietly interviewed for the Jaguars\u2019 head coaching job before the team decided to promote Marrone, who finished the season as interim coach. Josh McDaniels removes name from consideration for 49ers' coaching job Installing Kelly\u2019s up-tempo scheme would be a bold move by the Jaguars, who have some talent on that side of the ball, starting with receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns, and hope quarterback Blake Bortles can rebound from an uneven third season. The 49ers fired Kelly, 53, on Jan. 1, hours after their season finale. They went 2-14 in his only season there after three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, who fired Kelly with a 6-9 record late in 2015. Follow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero .

The president-elect's defenders, including spokesman Sean Spicer and Vice President Mike Pence, have argued that he had a right to respond to someone who had insulted him. For many African-Americans, the tone and timing of Trump's response \u2014 over the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday weekend \u2014 showed a startling lack of respect and reverence for Lewis, a Presidential Medal of Freedom winner and a \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement who was brutally beaten and repeatedly imprisoned as a young man protesting for voting rights alongside King in 1965.

The spectacular obscenity of Trump's comment is incomparable and deeply repulsive.\" Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and associates lead a procession following the casket of Jimmy Lee Jackson during a funeral service in Marion, Alabama, March 1, 1965. In November 2010, former Alabama state trooper James Bonard Fowler pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in the 1965 shooting of Jimmie Lee Jackson during a civil rights demonstration in Marion. AP On Monday, Trump commemorated the holiday by meeting privately with the civil rights icon's eldest son Martin Luther King III at Trump Tower. His public schedule included no other events. But following a political career that began with a discredited crusade to question the first African-American president's citizenship, a presidential campaign where he broadly depicting black communities as imperiled and hopeless, and a presidential transition which has featured only one African-American cabinet nominee (Dr. Ben Carson), Trump may have a lot more work to do to find common ground with the black community.

By John Wagner January 16 at 1:04 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner President-elect Trump's national security spokeswoman is stepping back amid allegations of plagiarism. Here are four others who faced similar accusations. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Monica Crowley, recently appointed by President-elect Donald Trump to a key national security communications job, said Monday that she would relinquish the post amid multiple allegations of plagiarism. Crowley, who has been named senior director of strategic communications at the National Security Council, said in a statement that \u201cafter much reflection,\u201d she had decided to remain in New York and \u201cwill not be taking a position in the incoming administration.\u201d [ Trump aide Monica Crowley\u2019s book sales suspended amid plagiarism allegations ] \u201cI greatly appreciate being asked to be part of President-elect Trump\u2019s team and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal,\u201d Crowley said in the statement, in which she made no mention of the plagiarism charges. The publisher of a 2012 book by Crowley said last week that it will stop selling copies until she addresses allegations of plagiarism. Crowley, a conservative pundit, is also under fire for allegedly plagiarizing passages in her PhD dissertation at Columbia University. The plagiarism charges were originally reported by CNN and Politico. Crowley was to have worked for national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general. \u201cThe NSC will miss the opportunity to have Monica Crowley as part of our team,\u201d Flynn said in a statement. \u201cWe wish her all the best in her future.\u201d When the plagiarism charges first surfaced, the Trump transition team defended Crowley, putting out a statement praising her \u201cexceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this country around.\u201d \u201cAny attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country,\u201d the statement said. As a White House aide, Crowley would not have faced confirmation proceedings. In the aftermath of her appointment, CNN reported that Crowley's book, \u201cWhat the (Bleep) Just Happened?\u201d lifted work from columnists, news reports, articles and think tanks without proper attribution. \u201cThe book, which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material,\u201d publisher HarperCollins said in a statement last week. Politico reported that Crowley\u2019s 2000 dissertation contained more than a dozen sections of text that were lifted, with little to no changes, from scholarly works without proper attribution. The dissertation was titled \u201cClearer Than Truth: Determining and Preserving Grand Strategy: The Evolution of American Policy Toward the People\u2019s Republic of China Under Truman and Nixon.\u201d politics ",

Just before 4:30 a.m. local time, the plane, operated by ACT Airlines, missed the runway, slamming into a neighborhood in Dacha Su, destroying more than a dozen homes, ACT and local officials confirmed. Four crewmembers -- the captain, copilot, loadmaster, and flight technician -- were killed, as were dozens of residents, ACT said. Several injured, including at least three children, were transported to a local hospital, according to local officials. According to ACT, both the captain and copilot were ex-military members, with 10,821 and 5,910 flight hours respectively. Although the carrier says it has not confirmed the reason for the crash, authorities believe pilot error is to blame and ACT says preliminary information suggests the Boeing 747 was not brought down by \"technical\" problems. Dense fog near the airport may have complicated pilot's efforts to land the plane, authorities say. Zanoza/Marat Uraliev Debris from a Turkish cargo plane crashed near Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Jan. 16, 2017. According to Kyrgyzstan's Ministry of Emergency Situations, two black boxes have been recovered from the wreckage, and international aviation investigators will arrive on Tuesday to examine them. \"We want to express our deepest thoughts and condolences to the families of our crew members and the Kyrgyz people,\" ACT said in a statement. \"We sincerely share their grief.\" Boeing released a statement expressing condolences as well, saying, \"A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities.\" ABC News' Joshua Hoyos and Rex Sakamoto contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "With Blacks Alarmed by His Tone, Trump Meets With Martin Luther King III By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS Continue reading the main story Photo President-elect Donald J. Trump met with Martin Luther King III at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 With tensions escalating between President-elect Donald J. Trump and prominent black leaders, Mr. Trump met privately on Monday with the eldest son of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the holiday devoted to the civil rights hero. The hastily arranged meeting at Trump Tower occurred as Mr. Trump feuded publicly with Representative John Lewis , Democrat of Georgia, who fought for civil rights alongside Dr. King. It has highlighted the challenges Mr. Trump faces as he prepares to take office on Friday deeply distrusted by minorities across the country, many of whom have been offended by his false allegations that President Obama was born outside the United States, appalled that his candidacy drew backing from white supremacist organizations, and dismayed at policy proposals they consider antithetical to their interests. Mr. Trump on Monday did not address those issues, appearing in the lobby to allow news cameras to capture pictures of him shaking hands with Martin Luther King III, but ignoring questions shouted by reporters about their conversation or his statements about Mr. Lewis. Continue reading the main story Tentative plans for Mr. Trump to visit the Smithsonian Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington, as the nation paused to remember Dr. King, had been shelved in favor of the closed-door session, which lasted just under one hour. But Mr. Trump made sure that journalists had an opportunity to see him with Mr. King, a visual manifestation of his stated aspiration to unite a divided nation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. King said the session, which included a discussion about voting rights, had been \u201cconstructive,\u201d and described Mr. Trump as eager to present himself as inclusive. \u201cHe said that he is going to represent Americans \u2014 he\u2019s said that over and over again,\u201d Mr. King, the president of the Drum Major Institute, a progressive New York-based public policy organization, told reporters. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate that.\u201d On Monday, Mr. King sought to defuse the furor surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Mr. Lewis, saying, \u201cIn the heat of emotion, a lot of things get said on both sides.\u201d Mr. King has pressed for the creation of a free photographic government identification card to make it easier for Americans who do not have driver\u2019s licenses, including many black voters, to cast ballots, and he indicated on Monday that Mr. Trump had taken an interest in the plan. \u201cIt is very clear that the system is not working at its maximum,\u201d Mr. King told reporters. \u201cWe believe we provided a solution.\u201d But other leaders said Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with African-Americans \u2014 tense bordering on toxic after a strident campaign that instilled fear, and a transition that has done little to allay their concerns \u2014 would not improve unless the president-elect altered both his tone and his policy positions. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety, there\u2019s a lot of distrust, there are people who have expressed to me that they\u2019re scared of what his policies might entail,\u201d said Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League. Mr. Trump won election with 8 percent of the African-American vote, according to exit polls. A Pew Research Center poll in November found roughly three-quarters of African Americans believed race relations would worsen during his presidency.

Al Sharpton said nothing underscored Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge more vividly than his outburst in a pair of Twitter postings on Saturday that called Mr. Lewis, who was brutally beaten in the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d march in 1965 in Selma, Ala. , \u201call talk,\u201d and said that instead of \u201cfalsely complaining\u201d about the election results, he should focus on fixing his \u201cfalling apart\u201d and \u201ccrime infested\u201d Georgia district. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Lewis actually represents a district that includes part of the wealthy enclave of Buckhead; the world\u2019s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were a reaction to an interview on Friday in which Mr. Lewis said he would not attend the inauguration and did not see Mr. Trump as a legitimate president because of questions about whether Russian hacking had affected the American election. \u201cIf you can disrespect John Lewis on Martin Luther King Day, then what are you saying about the rest of us?\u201d Mr. Sharpton said, adding that no single meeting Mr. Trump could hold would alleviate the concerns felt in the African-American community. \u201cHe seems to have a one-dimensional, very negative view of what black America looks like, and that is frightening to many black Americans.\u201d Mr. Sharpton said he was concerned that Mr. Trump was more interested in public appearances than substantive meetings with African-American activists and lawmakers to address issues of voting rights, criminal justice and policing reform, health care and economic inequality. \u201cHe still thinks that we\u2019re playing television red carpet here, rather than dealing with the presidency of the United States, with something of real substance. This is not a photo-op,\u201d Rev. Sharpton said. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary and communications director, announced the meeting in New York between Mr. Trump and Mr. King in a morning posting on Twitter . In a series of television interviews on Monday, Mr. Spicer said Mr. Lewis had started the fight with his \u201cdisappointing\u201d assertion that Mr. Trump was not a legitimate president, and he defended the president-elect\u2019s decision to respond, telling CBS that the president-elect is \u201cnot going to sit back and just take attacks without responding.\u201d Still, Mr. Trump himself had seemed to temper his attack on Mr. Lewis subtly by Saturday night; he said that the congressman should help him focus on \u201cburning and crime infested inner-cities\u201d throughout the United States and added, \u201cI can use all the help I can get!\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Outside the African-American history museum in Washington on Monday, some visitors argued that the episode said more about the president-elect\u2019s thin skin than his views on race. \u201cSomebody said something bad and he\u2019s got to say something back,\u201d said Nancy Alston of Columbia, Md. \u201cHe said bad stuff about Meryl Streep, too.\u201d Ginelle Johnson, 35, of San Diego, said that she believed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were motivated by how he views minorities. But she also said that they appeared to show his proclivity to hit back at whoever criticizes him. \u201cPolitics has become entertainment and I think Trump is just a bully,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. Mr. Trump\u2019s brief sighting on Monday afternoon at Trump Tower was a striking contrast to President Obama, who spent part of Monday \u2014 his final observance of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday in office \u2014 making a stop at a homeless shelter in Washington. Earlier, his wife, Michelle Obama, had spoken out subtly in her own Twitter post, saying she was, \u201cThinking of Dr. King and great leaders like @repjohnlewis who carry on his legacy.\u201d \u201cMay their example be our call to action,\u201d she wrote.

By Michael Birnbaum January 16 at 1:44 PM Follow @michaelbirnbaum BRUSSELS \u2014 European leaders\u00a0grappled with the jolting reality of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s skepticism of the European Union on Monday, saying they might have to stand without the United States at their side during the Trump presidency. The possibility of an unprecedented breach in transatlantic relations came after Trump \u2014 who embraced anti-E.U. insurgents during his campaign and following his victory \u2014 said in weekend remarks that the 28-nation European Union was bound for a breakup and that he was indifferent to its fate. He also said NATO\u2019s current configuration is \u201cobsolete,\u201d even as he professed commitment to Europe\u2019s defense.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s attitudes have raised alarm bells across Europe, which is facing\u00a0 a wave of elections this year in which anti-immigrant, Euroskeptic leaders could gain power. Most mainstream leaders\u00a0 have committed to working with Trump after his inauguration Friday, even as they have expressed hope that he will moderate his views once he takes office. His continued hard line has created a painful realization in Europe that they may now have\u00a0to live without the full backing of their oldest, strongest partner. The European Union underpins much of the continent\u2019s post-World War II prosperity, but skeptics have attacked it in recent years as a dysfunctional bloc that undermines finances and security. \u201cWe will cooperate with him on all levels, of course,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin. But she said Europeans will need to take responsibility for themselves. \u201cWe Europeans have our destiny in our own hands,\u201d she said. The full ramifications of a\u00a0potential\u00a0breakdown in transatlantic ties are so extensive, they are difficult to total. U.S. guarantees form the backbone of European security. The United States and the 500-million-people-strong European Union are each other\u2019s most important trade partners. For decades, European nations and the United States have worked tightly together on issues of war, peace and wealth. Trump\u00a0appears skeptical that the European Union matters to American security or economic growth. \u201cPeople want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave,\u201d Trump said of the European Union\u00a0in\u00a0 a weekend interview with the Times of London and Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper. He said he did not care about the E.U.\u2019s future. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters much for the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at the European Union, and it\u2019s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany,\u201d Trump said, meaning Germany had used the free-trade bloc to sell its goods to the disadvantage of others. He added that Merkel had made a \u201cvery catastrophic mistake\u201d in opening Europe\u2019s doors to migrants and refugees. And he offered no special credit to European nations for being long-standing U.S. allies, saying he will trust Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin alike at the outset of his presidency. \u201cI start off trusting both,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.\u201d Trump offered mixed messages about the NATO defense alliance, which is dominated by the United States, calling it \u201cobsolete\u201d and saying it is \u201cvery unfair to the United States\u201d that most nations are not meeting their voluntary defense spending commitments. \u201cWith that being said, NATO is very important to me,\u201d Trump said. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The Kremlin embraced Trump\u2019s comments, with a spokesman agreeing that NATO is obsolete. British leaders also welcomed Trump\u2019s willingness to negotiate a trade deal in the wake of their nation\u2019s departure from the E.U. But among most U.S. allies, Trump\u2019s attitudes \u201ccaused astonishment and excitement, not just in Brussels,\u201d German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters Monday in Brussels, where he was meeting with other European foreign ministers at a previously scheduled gathering. Coming directly from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Steinmeier said NATO had listened to Trump\u2019s comments \u201cwith concern.\u201d The incoming U.S. president is the first American leader since World War II not to support European integration. The European Union\u00a0 has long been considered to be in the U.S. interest , since it created a unified market for U.S. businesses, provided a bulwark against communism during the Cold War and helped quell the bloody slaughter that cost U.S. lives, among others, in the first half of the 20th century. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the European Union expanded eastward into formerly communist nations, a development that leaders there say helped bring rule of law and stability as they modernized their economies. Steinmeier said Germany is trying to assess what U.S. foreign policy will actually be.\u00a0For example, James Mattis, the retired Marine general nominated to be Trump\u2019s defense secretary, offered straightforward support for NATO and skepticism of Russia at his confirmation hearing last week. Other leaders said Europe\u2019s future does not rise or fall based on attitudes in the White House. \u201cWhat we are looking for is a partnership based on common interests with the United States,\u201d E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters. \u201cWe always like to be in good company, but we determine our policies by ourselves.\u201d Some analysts noted that after Britain\u2019s vote last June to leave the European Union, support for the E.U. in other nations increased. They wondered whether Trump\u2019s frontal challenge to the bloc might have a similar effect. But one said that if global instability rises as a result of Trump\u2019s unpredictable policies, the stress could weigh on the already taxed European Union. \u201cOver the last decades, the United States has played a huge stabilizing role. And when this stabilizing role of the U.S. around the world falls away, because they\u2019re doing transactional deals, that will create lots and lots of messes which will implicate European interests,\u201d said Stefan Lehne, a former Austrian diplomat who now works at Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based think tank. One prominent U.S. advocate of European unity was concerned about Europe\u2019s ability to weather the Trump tsunami. As the European Union battles skeptical forces, \u201cU.S. cheerleading and support has been welcomed,\u201d outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Anthony Gardner\u00a0 said last week . \u201cIf there isn\u2019t someone like a [Secretary of State John F.] Kerry or an Obama . . . reminding people of the importance of the European Union, then there\u2019s a vacuum.\u201d\u00a0 French leaders, who face tough presidential elections in April, also appeared to be scrambling to handle the fallout. Trump allies have expressed support for the anti-E.U., anti-immigrant National Front party, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, is doing well in opinion polls. Le Pen lunched in the basement of Trump Tower last week in the company of a man who has served as an informal conduit for Trump\u2019s contacts with Euroskeptic European leaders, although the Trump transition team denied any formal meeting with the French politician. \u201cThe best response is European unity,\u201d said French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. \u201cAs with the case of Brexit, the best way to defend Europe is to remain united. This is a bit of an invitation that we are making to Mr. Trump. To remain a bloc. Not to forget that the force of Europeans is in their unity.\u201d But the most wishful approach to Trump\u2019s declarations may have come from Luxembourg, where the nation\u2019s top diplomat said he hoped Trump was still in campaign mode. \u201cOne must hope that the statements of candidate Trump starting Friday will go in a different direction,\u201d said Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn. \u201cIf the risks are summed up, it would be very destabilizing, which is not in the interest of America.\u201d Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.

    "text": "By David Nakamura January 16 at 5:35 PM Follow @davidnakamura They are some of the biggest names in the Republican national security firmament, veterans of past GOP administrations who say, if called upon by President-elect Donald Trump, they stand ready to serve their country again. But their phones aren\u2019t ringing. Their entreaties to Trump Tower in New York have mostly gone unanswered. In Trump world, these establishment all-stars say they are \u201cPNG\u201d \u2014 personae non gratae. Their transgression was signing one or both of two public \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters during the campaign, declaring they would not vote for Trump and calling his candidacy a danger to the nation. One letter, with 122 names, was published by War on the Rocks , a website devoted to national security commentary, during the primary season in March. The other, with 50 names, including some repeat signatories, was published by the New York Times during the general-election campaign in August. Now, just days before Trump is sworn in as the nation\u2019s 45th president, the letter signers fear they have been added to another document, this one private \u2014 a purported blacklist compiled by Trump\u2019s political advisers. Former Pennsylvania Gov. and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge. (Cheryl Senter/AP) \u201cBefore he won, the conversation was, \u2018We really would love for you to change your mind and join us,\u2019 \u201d Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser under President George W. Bush, said of informal talks with Trump aides. Feaver, who signed both letters, added that, \u201cSince he won . . . the conversation is, \u2018There likely will be a blacklist of people who signed the letters who won\u2019t themselves be eligible for a post.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Trump transition aides did not respond to a request for comment for this article. [ From March: Trump \u2018fundamentally dishonest,\u2019 say national security leaders ] The president-elect has virtually no experience in national security and foreign policy, and his transition team could presumably benefit from the broadest pool of applicants for the influential appointive positions in the State Department, Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security. But the purportedly blacklisted figures report to their jobs at Washington law firms and think tanks in a state of indefinite limbo as their colleagues, some working in the same offices, are flirting with potential administration jobs. Last week, the Trump transition held a private briefing for secretary-of-state nominee Rex Tillerson to prepare him for his Senate confirmation hearing. One former Bush national security official who works at a Washington think tank said that some of his younger staff assistants were invited to participate but that he was not. He assumes it was because he signed the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s hostile,\u201d said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of further retribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we\u2019re frozen out. . . . I was told they said there was an enemies list.\u201d (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Among those who signed at least one of the letters are Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, the first two secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security; two former U.S. trade ambassadors, Carla Hills and Robert Zoellick; two former heads of U.S. intelligence agencies, John Negroponte and retired Air Force Gen. Michael V. Hayden; a former ambassador to NATO; and several former deputy secretaries of various U.S. government agencies. Not everyone who signed the letters wants a job, and some remain vocal critics of Trump. But many stand ready to serve or offer guidance if asked. The letters were explicit in their denunciations of Trump\u2019s professed support for torture of terrorism suspects, his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico, his anti-Muslim rhetoric and his admiration for Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. The letters also attacked Trump\u2019s character and temperament, asserting that he \u201clacks self-control and acts impetuously,\u201d has demonstrated \u201cerratic behavior\u201d and is \u201cfundamentally dishonest.\u201d Former Bush administration lawyer John Bellinger\u00a0III, who organized the letter published in the Times, said that many have not given up and are trying to help from the outside. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing how it goes and trying to provide advice, counsel, support to our friends who go into the administration,\u201d said Bellinger, who has served as legal counsel at the State Department and the National Security Council. The scenario was set up by Trump\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox candidacy and then his upset victory. The threat the New York business mogul\u2019s populist campaign posed to the establishment of his party caused some of the Republicans\u2019 leading lights to oppose him, even after he had clinched the nomination. The question after Election Day was how quickly Trump loyalists and the onetime GOP resistance would reconcile. In some cases, the process has gone fairly smoothly. Congressional leaders who had been lukewarm toward Trump\u2019s campaign have made nice with the president-elect, and they have vowed to work together on a conservative policy agenda. In other cases, it has been painfully awkward, as with Trump\u2019s flirtation with Mitt Romney for secretary of state. Romney had called Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d last March, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee called to congratulate Trump on his election victory. After a courtship that included a dinner of frog legs and lamb chops in New York, Romney was passed over for Tillerson, the head of ExxonMobil. During a national security forum last week at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, K.T. McFarland, who was named Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, opened her remarks by referring to the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d \u201cMost of the people in this room didn\u2019t support Donald Trump \u2014 maybe not at first or maybe ever,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I suspect most of the people in this room didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win. But he has.\u201d Some of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters signers fear they are at the bottom of the pecking order, below those who expressed verbal opposition to Trump\u2019s campaign but did not sign either of the letters. The conflict was exacerbated shortly after the election when Eliot Cohen, a State Department counselor during the Bush administration who had helped organize the War on the Rocks letter, aired new criticism of the Trump transition. In an opinion column for The Washington Post in November, Cohen said that a friend on the transition team had asked him to provide names of potential job candidates \u2014 with the stipulation that he include no one who signed either of the letters. Cohen wrote that he became convinced there were \u201cpent-up resentments\u201d among members of the Trump team, and he warned young policy experts against working for the administration. Cohen has had no further communications with the transition team. \u201cBelieve me \u2014 my phone is not ringing,\u201d he said in a recent interview. Other letter signers said Cohen had misinterpreted emails from the transition official and overreacted, and some of them expressed a sense of regret. Mary Beth Long, who served as assistant secretary of defense in the Bush administration, signed the War on the Rocks letter. But, she said, her opinion of Trump improved as he began to moderate his rhetoric and selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Long attended a Pence rally in Charlotte in October, during which, she said, a local GOP official announced that a \u201cNever Trump\u201d letter signer in the audience had changed her mind and was now supporting Trump. The crowd cheered. But her about-face hasn\u2019t thawed the ice. Long said her inquiries to the Trump transition team to get clarity on some of his foreign policy positions have gone unanswered. She said that she has spoken with retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s designee for national security adviser, whom she knows from the Pentagon, but that she isn\u2019t expecting a job. \u201cIf I were asked to sign a letter like that again, I would be much more careful about the verbiage that related to the candidate himself,\u201d she said. Some letter signers said the Trump transition might be overwhelmed and could reach out more broadly in the coming weeks. Some hoped that Cabinet nominees, such as retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Pentagon, could potentially have the freedom to hire them. Many jobs below the Cabinet level remain unfilled. But others are resigned to waiting until some of Trump\u2019s initial appointees begin leaving his administration. Frances Townsend, a former Bush homeland security adviser who signed the War on the Rocks letter, is friendly with Flynn. A few weeks after the election, she received an email from the transition team inviting her to meet with the president-elect. Ahead of the meeting, she thought over how to explain her past actions if Trump raised the letter \u2014 but he did not, she said. \u201cI took that as a sign of maturity and graciousness,\u201d said Townsend, who has not taken a job with the administration and declined to say whether she was offered one. \u201cAs I was leaving, I said I was privileged and humbled to come in and speak to him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a veiled reference [to the letter]. Given the circumstances, I didn\u2019t expect to be there.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 13. Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump said he's finishing a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with a proposal that would provide \"insurance for everybody,\" according to a report by The Washington Post . He did not get into any specific details about his healthcare plan during a telephone interview with the newspaper. But he did say it would be \"much less expensive\" and would involve \"much lower deductibles.\" Trump added that he does not plan to cut benefits for Medicare and that he does not want a single-payer health care system. GOP's Go-Slow 'Rescue Mission' Plan To Replace Obamacare His plan will be revealed, Trump suggested, after the U.S. Senate confirms his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Georgia. The Senate Finance Committee has not announced the timing of Price's confirmation hearing yet. Still, Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to replace Obamacare quickly with his plan and is ready to put pressure on lawmakers, telling the Post: \"I think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what's happened in the House in recent weeks,\" Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. Trump's comments come as Republicans continue their debate over how exactly to repeal and replace Obamacare, while Democrats have been holding rallies around the country in support of the existing health care law. Last week, GOP lawmakers approved a budget resolution that sets up a framework for repealing the Affordable Care Act. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has said that lawmakers are not \"holding hard deadlines\" for replacing the federal health policy. NPR thanks our sponsors ",

    "text": "[ Read a transcript of the interview with Barack Obama ] The writings of Lincoln, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, Mr. Obama found, were \u201cparticularly helpful\u201d when \u201cwhat you wanted was a sense of solidarity,\u201d adding \u201cduring very difficult moments, this job can be very isolating.\u201d \u201cSo sometimes you have to sort of hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated, and that\u2019s been useful.\u201d There is a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address in the Lincoln Bedroom, and sometimes, in the evening, Mr. Obama says, he would wander over from his home office to read it. Photo President Obama in the Oval Office in 2012. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Like Lincoln, Mr. Obama taught himself how to write, and for him, too, words became a way to define himself, and to communicate his ideas and ideals to the world. In fact, there is a clear, shining line connecting Lincoln and King, and President Obama. In speeches like the ones delivered in Charleston and Selma , he has followed in their footsteps, putting his mastery of language in the service of a sweeping historical vision, which, like theirs, situates our current struggles with race and injustice in a historical continuum that traces how far we\u2019ve come and how far we have yet to go. It\u2019s a vision of America as an unfinished project \u2014 a continuing, more-than-two-century journey to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence real for everyone \u2014 rooted both in Scripture and the possibility of redemption, and a more existential belief that we can continually remake ourselves. And it\u2019s a vision shared by the civil rights movement, which overcame obstacle after obstacle, and persevered in the face of daunting odds. Mr. Obama\u2019s long view of history and the optimism (combined with a stirring reminder of the hard work required by democracy) that he articulated in his farewell speech last week are part of a hard-won faith, grounded in his reading, in his knowledge of history (and its unexpected zigs and zags), and his embrace of artists like Shakespeare who saw the human situation entire: its follies, cruelties and mad blunders, but also its resilience, decencies and acts of grace. The playwright\u2019s tragedies, he says, have been \u201cfoundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Context in Presidential Biographies Presidential biographies also provided context, countering the tendency to think \u201cthat whatever\u2019s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate through World War II.\u201d Even books initially picked up as escape reading like the Hugo Award-winning apocalyptic sci-fi epic \u201c The Three-Body Problem \u201d by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin, he said, could unexpectedly put things in perspective: \u201cThe scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty \u2014 not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade!\u201d In his searching 1995 book \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d Mr. Obama recalls how reading was a crucial tool in sorting out what he believed, dating back to his teenage years, when he immersed himself in works by Baldwin, Ellison, Hughes, Wright, DuBois and Malcolm X in an effort \u201cto raise myself to be a black man in America.\u201d Later, during his last two years in college, he spent a focused period of deep self-reflection and study, methodically reading philosophers from St. Augustine to Nietzsche, Emerson to Sartre to Niebuhr, to strip down and test his own beliefs. To this day, reading has remained an essential part of his daily life. He recently gave his daughter Malia a Kindle filled with books he wanted to share with her (including \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d \u201cThe Golden Notebook\u201d and \u201cThe Woman Warrior\u201d). And most every night in the White House, he would read for an hour or so late at night \u2014 reading that was deep and ecumenical, ranging from contemporary literary fiction (the last novel he read was Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201c The Underground Railroad \u201d) to classic novels to groundbreaking works of nonfiction like Daniel Kahneman\u2019s \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d and Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s \u201c The Sixth Extinction .\u201d Photo \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d by Colson Whitehead. Credit Patricia Wall/The New York Times Such books were a way for the president to shift mental gears from the briefs and policy papers he studied during the day, a way \u201cto get out of my own head,\u201d a way to escape the White House bubble. Some novels helped him to better \u201cimagine what\u2019s going on in the lives of people\u201d across the country \u2014 for instance, he found that Marilynne Robinson\u2019s novels connected him emotionally to the people he was meeting in Iowa during the 2008 campaign, and to his own grandparents, who were from the Midwest, and the small town values of hard work and honesty and humility. Other novels served as a kind of foil \u2014 something to argue with. V. S. Naipaul\u2019s novel \u201cA Bend in the River,\u201d Mr. Obama recalls, \u201cstarts with the line \u2018The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.\u2019 And I always think about that line and I think about his novels when I\u2019m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true.\u201d Writing was key to his thinking process, too: a tool for sorting through \u201ca lot of crosscurrents in my own life \u2014 race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole.\u201d A Writer of Short Stories Mr. Obama taught himself to write as a young man by keeping a journal and writing short stories when he was a community organizer in Chicago \u2014 working on them after he came home from work and drawing upon the stories of the people he met. Many of the tales were about older people, and were informed by a sense of disappointment and loss: \u201cThere is not a lot of Jack Kerouac open-road, young kid on the make discovering stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more melancholy and reflective.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story That experience underscored the power of empathy. An outsider himself \u2014 with a father from Kenya, who left when he was 2, and a mother from Kansas, who took him to live for a time in Indonesia \u2014 he could relate to many of the people he met in the churches and streets of Chicago, who felt dislocated by change and isolation, and he took to heart his boss\u2019s observation that \u201cthe thing that brings people together to share the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issues, it\u2019s that they have shared stories.\u201d This lesson would become a cornerstone of the president\u2019s vision of an America where shared concerns \u2014 simple dreams of a decent job, a secure future for one\u2019s children \u2014 might bridge differences and divisions. After all, many people saw their own stories in his \u2014 an American story, as he said in his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention possible \u201cin no other country on Earth.\u201d Photo President Obama reading \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d to children at the White House in 2014. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times In today\u2019s polarized environment, where the internet has let people increasingly retreat to their own silos (talking only to like-minded folks, who amplify their certainties and biases), the president sees novels and other art (like the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d) as providing a kind of bridge that might span usual divides and \u201ca reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day.\u201d He points out, for instance, that the fiction of Junot D\u00edaz and Jhumpa Lahiri speaks \u201cto a very particular contemporary immigration experience,\u201d but at the same time tell stories about \u201clonging for this better place but also feeling displaced\u201d \u2014 a theme central to much of American literature, and not unlike books by Philip Roth and Saul Bellow that are \u201csteeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what you\u2019re giving up.\u201d Mr. Obama entered office as a writer, and he will soon return to a private life as a writer, planning to work on his memoirs, which will draw on journals he\u2019s kept in the White House (\u201cbut not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for\u201d). He has a writer\u2019s sensibility \u2014 an ability to be in the moment while standing apart as an observer, a novelist\u2019s eye and ear for detail, and a precise but elastic voice capable of moving easily between the lyrical and the vernacular and the profound. He had lunch last week with five novelists he admires \u2014 Dave Eggers, Mr. Whitehead, Zadie Smith, Mr. D\u00edaz and Barbara Kingsolver. He not only talked with them about the political and media landscape, but also talked shop, asking how their book tours were going and remarking that he likes to write first drafts, long hand, on yellow legal pads. Mr. Obama says he is hoping to eventually use his presidential center website \u201cto widen the audience for good books\u201d \u2014 something he\u2019s already done with regular lists of book recommendations \u2014 and then encourage a public \u201cconversation about books.\u201d \u201cAt a time,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration, the role of stories to unify \u2014 as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize \u2014 is more important than ever.\u201d Correction: January 16, 2017 An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated when a photo of President Obama in the Oval Office was taken.

    "text": "Mr. Trump also said Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel , had made a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d in allowing refugees to pour into Europe. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The barrage of inflammatory comments in joint interviews published Sunday and Monday in Britain and Germany elicited alarm and outrage in Europe, even as Ms. Merkel dryly characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s positions as nothing new. \u201cThey have been known for a while \u2014 my positions are also known,\u201d Ms. Merkel said Monday in Berlin. \u201cI think we Europeans have control of our destiny.\u201d Her clipped response came as officials and analysts struggled with how to interpret Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, as well as how to react to them. Some argued that the president-elect\u2019s words should be regarded as tactical, intended merely to keep his options open. But nearly everyone agreed that Mr. Trump had made trouble, especially in criticizing Ms. Merkel, given her importance as a figure of stability in Europe and her campaign for re-election later this year. For good measure, Mr. Trump had also infuriated China by using an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal to again question China\u2019s longstanding One China policy. It holds that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the mainland. Photo Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Berlin on Monday. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about her and how the European Union is \u201cbasically a vehicle for Germany\u201d have damaged Ms. Merkel, who is running for re-election this year. Credit Oliver Weiken/European Pressphoto Agency On Monday, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said that anyone trying to use the status of Taiwan for negotiations would be \u201csmashing their feet by lifting a rock\u201d and would face broad and strong opposition from the Chinese government and people, as well as the international community. She added that \u201cnot everything in the world can be bargained or traded off.\u201d The English-language China Daily accused Mr. Trump on Monday of \u201cplaying with fire,\u201d saying that if Taiwan became up for negotiation, as Mr. Trump suggested to The Journal, \u201cBeijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s interviews in Europe have placed him right in the middle of the Continent\u2019s most contentious issues. His critique of German dominance over the European Union is hardly a novel thought; many Europeans share the same complaints. But what is startling is how an incoming American president would make such a statement about a key ally and, in doing so, give succor to populist parties seeking to shatter the European political establishment. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the interview published Monday in the German newspaper Bild and The Times of London, Mr. Trump also equated his trust of Ms. Merkel with his trust for Mr. Putin. \u201cI start off trusting both,\u201d he said during the joint interview, which was conducted inside his office in Trump Tower in New York, \u201cbut let\u2019s see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.\u201d Certainly, Mr. Trump knows how to give a provocative interview. He repeated past criticisms that NATO is \u201cobsolete\u201d for supposedly not confronting terrorism, only to quickly add that \u201cwith that being said, NATO is very important to me.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201care a direct assault on the liberal order we\u2019ve built since 1945 and a repudiation of the idea that the United States should lead the West,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official and ambassador to NATO, who also advised the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. \u201cTo say that NATO is obsolete, openly support the disintegration of the E.U. and then denigrate Merkel and put her on a par with Putin is a fundamental break with 70 years of American policy and strategic thought supported by Republicans from Eisenhower to now,\u201d said Mr. Burns, who has served presidents of both parties. \u201cNATO is the great power differential between the United States and Russia, as our Asian alliances are the power differential between us and China.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks almost certainly rankled Europe\u2019s two most powerful leaders, Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit \u2014 if welcomed by British officials, in general terms \u2014 has put considerably more pressure on Mrs. May. She is preparing to give a major speech on Tuesday about her Brexit plans, even as Mr. Trump promised to give Britain a quick and fair trade deal outside the European Union \u2014 a deal that cannot take place for at least two years until Britain leaves the bloc. Awkwardly for her, one of the interviewers was Michael Gove, who strongly supported Brexit and ran for the Conservative leadership against Mrs. May, who immediately fired him from the cabinet. Mr. Trump\u2019s first meeting with a British politician was with another May adversary, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP. Ms. Merkel, who is known for her sang-froid and pragmatism, shrugged off Mr. Trump\u2019s latest criticism, saying that what matters is what he does in office. \u201cI am waiting for the president to be sworn into office. That is the way it is done,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, of course, I will work with him together.\u201d Photo A newsstand in London.

Credit Facundo Arrizabalaga/European Pressphoto Agency The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was not so sanguine. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments had \u201ccaused astonishment and commotion, and I\u2019m sure not just in Brussels,\u201d where he spoke on Monday before a monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Steinmeier said that he had just seen the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and that there was continuing concern inside the military alliance. \u201cFirst, it goes against the statements of the nominated defense secretary a few days ago,\u201d Mr. Steinmeier said. \u201cWe have to see what it will yield in terms of U.S. foreign policy. The same goes for the statements on trade policy. We count on the U.S. to stick to its international obligations, including in the World Trade Organization.\u201d Others cautioned against taking Mr. Trump\u2019s words literally, at least for now. \u201cI take all of this with a pinch of salt,\u201d said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the London-based research institution. \u201cI think Trump is trying to keep his options open and not be cornered by simply standing up for existing policy positions.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team will try to begin to smooth over some of the tensions on Tuesday in Washington, where the group planning his inauguration will host a black-tie dinner for members of the foreign diplomatic corps to mingle with prospective cabinet members, leaders of Congress and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. President Obama\u2019s departing ambassador to Germany, John B. Emerson, has used a series of exit interviews and speeches in recent days to urge the Germans to stay calm, not to overinterpret Twitter posts or view them as finished foreign policy. Mr. Emerson underscored that, while more clarity was needed, there were signs that Mr. Trump did value NATO and the promise of United States protection for European allies. \u201cIt\u2019s a very crucial issue, not just for European security, but for American security,\u201d Mr. Emerson said. He noted that Mr. Trump \u201cauthorized President Obama when he came here on his trip shortly after the two of them met to reassure European partners of the full commitment to NATO. Now, we need to see what that means.\u201d Yet Europe is staring at a potentially transformative political year , with elections coming in the Netherlands, France and Germany, and possibly in Italy. Victories by populist parties could destabilize the European Union, and many European officials worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks are damaging. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Martin Sch\u00e4fer, a spokesman for Mr. Steinmeier and the German Foreign Ministry, flatly rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s comment in the interview that the European Union \u201cis basically a vehicle for Germany.\u201d \u201cPerhaps in times such as these, when order is crumbling, it is more important than ever that we want to, and must, stand together,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00e4fer said, underlining the post- World War II German stance that only through the country\u2019s role in a larger European alliance are peace and prosperity guaranteed. Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault of France said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were an invitation to the bloc to stand united. \u201cAs is the case with Brexit,\u201d he said, \u201cthe best way of defending Europe, and that is the invitation Mr. Trump has given to us, is to remain united as a bloc, not forgetting that the strength of Europeans lies in their unity.\u201d The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who supported Brexit, emphasized Mr. Trump\u2019s warm comments on the Anglo-American relationship. \u201cI think it\u2019s very good news that the U.S.A. wants to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly it will have to be a deal that\u2019s very much in the interests of both sides, but I have no doubt it will be.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Melissa Eddy from Berlin, James Kanter from Brussels, Alison Smale from Berlin, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 BROWNSVILLE, Texas \u2013 \u00a0Pamela Taylor thought she was living the American dream when she and her husband bought a two-acre plot of land near the Texas border in Brownsville seven decades ago. She would never have predicted her one-story brick home, surrounded by bright pink bougainvillea bushes and mesquite trees, would become a makeshift crash pad and hideout for border crossers, drug smugglers and human traffickers. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life now,\u201d Taylor told FoxNews.com. \u201cThey come every day.\u201d Taylor, whose property is on the front line of the border battle, says illegal immigrants have been using her land to sneak into the U.S. for years. One day, the 90-year-old grandmother recalled, she even walked into her living room to find a border crosser trying to evade capture. \u201cHe had come into my house and was just sitting in my rocking chair watching Border Patrol go by,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d Pamela Taylor's house in Brownsville, Texas. Another time, drug dealers stashed 30 pounds of marijuana under her bougainvillea bush. Taylor is not alone. On a recent tour of border towns in south Texas, FoxNews.com spoke with residents like Taylor as well as business owners and local law enforcement about the daily fears people face as they live and work in what amounts to disputed territory.\u00a0 Many describe a deteriorating situation where illegal immigration is on the rise but few can do anything about it for fear of retaliation by cartels, human traffickers and even some authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who to trust,\u201d Taylor said. She added that while she has a \u201cgood rapport\u201d with local law enforcement on the ground, \u201cIt\u2019s the ones who sit in the office \u2026 they don\u2019t care about us.\u201d Several residents FoxNews.com spoke to near the border say they feel forgotten. \u201cWe live here, we work here and raise our children here but every day we see [border crossers, drug smugglers] and nothing changes,\u201d said McAllen resident Milo, who asked FoxNews.com not to use his last name out of safety concerns. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [drug and human trafficking] scouts on our street with Border Patrol parked down the road. They don\u2019t do anything.\u201d He also said he's seen \"SUVs sitting in front of the house\" after reporting suspicious activity.\u00a0 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, vowing a ramp-up in border and immigration enforcement -- and the construction of a controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall -- the outgoing Obama administration has taken some steps to boost enforcement.\u00a0 U.S. Customs and Border Protection last year dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. But Taylor said her area still is used as a \"funnel\" for people illegally crossing the border.\u00a0 Some paddle across the river while others hide in the field waiting for their \u201ccoyote\u201d or smuggler to pick them up. Some stroll in through a gigantic gap in the border barrier near her house.\u00a0 Taylor says she always calls the authorities to report criminal activity on her property, including when she found the marijuana stash. But she also said she worries she could be putting herself and her family in danger.\u00a0 In south Texas, Mexican and South American cartels have been able to infiltrate law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Several former law enforcement officials from an anti-narcotics force in the Rio Grande Valley are currently serving lengthy prison sentences for drug crimes and corruption. \u00a0 In 2016, Border Patrol agent Joel Luna was charged with capital murder for the March 2015 beheading of an undocumented Honduran immigrant. Luna, a south Texas native and Army combat veteran, allegedly decapitated Palacio Paz and left his headless body floating in the bay. Prosecutors claim Luna was part of a cartel drug trafficking conspiracy with his brothers. Luna has pleaded not guilty. In November, Border Patrol agent Eduardo Bazen Jr., also was arrested after being accused of working with a drug trafficking organization. According to the criminal complaint, Bazen said he was paid $8,000 for falsifying a 2007 drug bust and admitted to lying about suspects being present at the scene. The drug trade \u2013 even more so than human trafficking \u2013 has skyrocketed in recent years along the border. In fiscal 2016, nearly 1.3 million pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines were seized along the southwest border, according to U.S. Border Patrol . Cameron County Sheriff\u2019s Office Lt. Robert Rodriguez told FoxNews.com the cartels are constantly reinventing ways to smuggle drugs into the U.S. \u201cThey change tactics all the time,\u201d he said, adding that drug runners are now using large makeshift rafts to float trucks, fully loaded with drugs, across the Rio Grande. \u201cThey always seem to be one step ahead.\u201d As for residents living along the border, some have sold their property and moved. For Taylor, that\u2019s not an option. Water coolers outside Pamela Taylor's house. (FoxNews.com/Barnini Chakraborty) \u201cWhy should I move? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\" she said.\u00a0 Instead, she locks her doors but leaves food and water out \u201cfor anyone who needs it.\u201d \u201cI always ask \u2018Are you hungry?\u201d she said. \u201cI will feed them but they know I will also be calling Border Patrol.\u201d Advertisement ",

Her attorney said she had no advance knowledge of what her husband was planning and should not have been charged. \"Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands,\" the lawyer, Linda Moreno, said in a statement. \"We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person.\" Noor Mateen and her husband Pulse gunman, Omar Mateen, from a Facebook profile photo. via Facebook Authorities said early on that they would file criminal charges against Salman \u2014 who was with her husband when he bought ammunition and exchanged texts with him in the middle of the attack \u2014 if it was shown that she knew what he was planning and did nothing. The 30-year-old was being held at the Santa Rita Jail ahead of an appearance in federal court on Tuesday. Prosecutors will then seek to bring her back to Orlando to face the charges. Play ",

    "text": "President Obama welcomes Cubs to the White House: 'It took you long enough' Photos from the Cubs' visit to the White House on Jan. 16, 2017. Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune After being honored at the White House on Monday afternoon, the Cubs revealed the real reason why they desperately wanted to make the trip before President Barack Obama left office. Touring the White House and being celebrated for their first championship since 1908 was certainly fun for the team, but it wasn't nearly as important as converting the die-hard White Sox fan into a Cubs fan, a task more difficult than turning Hillary Clinton supporters into Donald Trump backers. Cubs President Theo Epstein said they offered Obama a \"midnight pardon\" to switch to the Cubs. When Obama stopped laughing, Epstein turned up the heat. The Cubs presented Obama with several gifts that Epstein said would \"recognize this terrific conversion on this great day,\" including a No. 44 panel from Wrigley Field 's manual center-field scoreboard, recognizing his status as the 44th president, a lifetime pass to Wrigley, a No. 44 jersey, and a \"W\" flag signed by Cubs players that Epstein said should be flown at his presidential library in Chicago. Sitting alongside Billy Williams , Ryne Sandberg and Jose Cardenal, Cubs great Fergie Jenkins shouted out to Obama to put the jersey on. The president politely declined. \"It'd be hard for me, Fergie, to wear the jersey,\" he said. \"I do know that among Sox fans, I am the Cubs' No. 1 fan.\" Full video: President Obama welcomes the 2016 World Series champion Cubs to White House President Obama welcomes the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to the White House. (White House/YouTube) President Obama welcomes the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to the White House. (White House/YouTube) See more videos Obama said the gifts were the \"best swag I've got since I've been president.\" The ceremony began with Obama poking fun at the Cubs' storied drought, saying, \"They said this day would never come,\" and pointing out none of his predecessors \"ever got a chance to say welcome to the White House, the World Series champion Cubs. \u2026 I will say to the Cubs, it took you long enough. I've only got four days left.\" Obama then took a page out of his 2008 playbook, comparing the Cubs' journey to his own unlikely rise to president of the United States. \"I made a lot of promises in 2008,\" he said. \"But even I was not crazy enough to suggest that during these eight years we would see the Cubs win the World Series. But I did say that there's never been anything false about hope. The audacity of hope. Yes, we can.\" After Obama's remarks, Epstein then took over and began reminiscing about their World Series title, which he said \"even saw some White Sox fans smiling.\" Finally, Epstein got to the plan.

So, Mr. President, with only a few days remaining in your tremendous presidency, we've taken the liberty here today of offering you a midnight pardon. And so we welcome you with open arms today.\" Epstein later said he found out on the plane ride to Washington that he was supposed to make a speech. \"Obviously we had to address the fact he's a White Sox fan, give him all the respect he's due,\" he said. \"We figured we could pardon him since he's going to pardon so many in his final days.\" The Cubs-Sox byplay was one of manager Joe Maddon 's favorite parts of the afternoon. \"The slings and arrows at the White Sox are always entertaining,\" Maddon said. It capped a memorable day for the Cubs players, staff and their wives, who met with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama beforehand and toured the White House. Obama said Michelle had never attended any of the championship celebrations before but decided to attend this one to tell the team about her family's love for the Cubs \"and why it meant so much to her.\" \"I almost choked up listening to it,\" Obama said. \"And it spoke to how people feel about this organization, and it's been passed on from generation to generation. And it's more than just sports.\" Anthony Rizzo on Cubs' visit to the White House: 'Just icing on the cake' Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo reacts to the team's visit to the White House and meeting President Barack Obama on Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. (Paul Sullivan/Chicago Tribune) Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo reacts to the team's visit to the White House and meeting President Barack Obama on Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. (Paul Sullivan/Chicago Tribune) See more videos Obama mentioned several of the Cubs players' accomplishments, including David Ross, Kris Bryant , Anthony Rizzo and Addison Russell. He even referred to Maddon's \"shaggin' wagon,\" the old Dodge van he drove onto the field in spring training . Obama said not many managers are \"as cool as this guy,\" pointing to Maddon's casual attire, which included no tie. \"That's pretty cool that the president calls you cool,\" Maddon said. \"I knew that I had a pretty good chance, being the only one that didn't wear a tie today. ... It's a humbling experience to be here in the first place, and under the set of circumstances we're here, to be able to have the president recognize you like that is pretty awesome.\" Obama also poked fun at his own party, pointing to Epstein's success with two drought-stricken organizations, the Red Sox and Cubs. He said the teams were \"wandering in the wilderness\" before Epstein took them to \"the promised land,\" making him a perfect candidate for chairman of the DNC. Epstein politely declined Obama's offer. \"Good thing I signed a contract with (Chairman) Tom Ricketts, who was kicking me, saying I can't leave,\" Epstein said. \"It was a kind offer, though.\" Several Cubs players who've left the team this winter flew in, including Dexter Fowler, Aroldis Chapman, Trevor Cahill and Chris Coghlan , while some of the current Cubs missed the trip, including Jon Lester, John Lackey and Jake Arrieta, who had family issues. The Cubs celebration was the last public White House event of Obama's presidency. The audience in the East Room was filled with politicians like Sen. Dick Durbin, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Attorney General Lisa Madigan, along with former Obama adviser David Axelrod and singer Jimmy Buffett, a longtime Cubs fan. All in all, it was a fitting final chapter for the Cubs, and a nice last hurrah for Obama as well. \"What an amazing experience, to get to enjoy today with the guys on this team,\" Rizzo said. \"It's something we'll never forget. It's something you never take for granted. This is one of the best days I've ever had.\" Twitter @PWSullivan Joe Maddon on Cubs' visit to the White House Cubs manager Joe Maddon reacts to the team's visit to the White House on Monday, Jan. 16, 2017.

Omar Mateen, right, with his wife, Noor Zahi Salman, and their son. (Facebook via the Sun Sentinel)) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The wife of the Orlando nightclub shooter, who was extensively questioned by federal agents in the days after the massacre , was arrested by the FBI on Monday in connection with the attack, a U.S. law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official said Noor Salman was taken into custody Monday morning in the San Francisco area and is facing charges in Florida including obstruction of justice. A Twitter post from the United States attorney's office in Orlando said Salman will make her initial appearance Tuesday morning in Oakland, California. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Noor Salman moved to the San Francisco area after her husband, Omar Mateen , was killed in a shootout with SWAT team members during the June 12 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. FBI agents repeatedly questioned Salman in the aftermath of the shooting about whether she had advance knowledge of her husband's plans. She told The New York Times in an interview published in November that she was unaware that Mateen planned to shoot up the nightclub. He was the only shooter, and by the time a three-hour standoff between Mateen and law enforcement had ended, 49 patrons were killed and another 53 people required hospitalization. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a 911 call to emergency officials during the standoff. He also made a series of Facebook posts and searches before and during the attack. The Times first reported on the arrest. Last month, Salman filed a petition in a California court to change the name of the son she had with Mateen.

Also unclear is how Trump's presidential communications will be saved, as required by law. Related: President-Elect Trump Defends Use of Twitter Amidst Democrat Attacks Barack Obama has maintained two Twitter accounts during his presidency, one official, the other personal. The president-elect's advisers told NBC News that Trump wants to continue building his base of roughly 20 million followers, which exceeds Obama's official Twitter account, with its 13.5 million. (Obama's personal account has 80.5 million.) In an interview with the Times of London published Sunday, Trump attributed his Twitter habits to the media, asserting that he had been covered unfairly. Pointing out that he had 46 million followers across different social media accounts, Trump told the newspaper: \"I'd rather just let that build up and just keep it @therealdonaldtrump. And the tweeting, I thought I would do less of it but I am covered so dishonestly by the press, so dishonestly.\" Play ",

More than 30 House Democrats have declared they will not attend President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday. (Allison Shelley/Getty Images) A growing group of Democratic lawmakers will boycott President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday as a protest of Trump\u2019s worldview and his criticism of civil rights icon John Lewis, congressman of Georgia. There are now more than 30 House Democrats \u2014 35, at last count \u2014 who have declared that they will not attend the inauguration on Capitol Hill this week. The number rose sharply after Trump tweeted Saturday that Lewis is \u201call talk, talk, talk\u201d and should \u201cfinally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities.\u201d Lewis, who sees Trump\u2019s Nov. 8 win as illegitimate because of Russia\u2019s alleged\u00a0interference in the election, is best known for leading civil rights protests in the 1960s, including the 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in which state troopers brutally attacked the crowd.

    "text": "Huge gator spotted taking stroll in Florida reserve Published               January 16, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A massive gator caused quite a stir when it took a recent stroll on a central Florida nature reserve. A video posted to Facebook by Kim Joiner shows the huge alligator sauntering across a path at the Circle B Bar Reserve in Polk County Sunday. Visitors to the nature center can be seen capturing the unusual spectacle. \u201cI love Circle B. Nature at its best,\u201d Joiner wrote on the post, which has been shared more than 18,000 times. SCIENTISTS GLIMPSE RARE RUBY SEADRAGONS IN THE WILD FOR THE FIRST TIME Some Facebook commenters say that the well-known gator is nicknamed \u201cHumpback\u201d on account of his large, curved back, FOX 13 reports. This is not the first big gator to hit the headlines in Florida recently. Last year a hunter in the Sunshine State nabbed a 13-and-half-foot alligator. The state record for length was a 14 foot 3 1/2 inch male at Lake Washington in Brevard County, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Florida\u2019s heaviest recorded gator was a 1,043 pound (13 feet 10-1/2 inches long) male at Orange Lake in Alachua County. Last year a humongous gator became something of a media sensation when it was spotted wandering around the Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto on Florida\u2019s Gulf coast. \u00a0 ",

    "text": "An Ice Shelf Is Cracking In Antarctica, But Not For The Reason You Think An Ice Shelf Is Cracking In Antarctica, But Not For The Reason You Think Embed Embed A NASA scientist with project IceBridge took this photo of the crack in November. John Sonntag/NASA hide caption toggle caption John Sonntag/NASA A group of scientists is gathering today in the U.K. to discuss a slab of ice that's cracking in Antarctica. The crack could soon split off a frozen chunk the size of Delaware. One glacier scientist, Heidi Sevestre, spent six weeks last year living on that giant slab of ice off the Antarctic Peninsula. \"It's like being on a different planet,\" says Sevestre, a glaciologist with the University of St Andrews in Scotland. She and her colleagues would get really excited whenever they saw a bird pass overhead because it was the only other sign of life around. A Really Big Crack In An Antarctic Ice Shelf Just Got Bigger \"Everything is gigantic, everything is white,\" she says. And everything seemed so frozen and still. But it wasn't. \"When you're camping on the ice shelf, you have no idea that you're on something that is floating and moving,\" she says. The ice shelf is in constant motion: rising with the tides, splitting off icebergs at its edges, and growing again as inland glaciers feed it. The ice shelf Sevestre was studying is called Larsen C, and it now has a massive 90-mile crack running through it. \"The big rift is slicing the ice shelf from top to bottom,\" Sevestre says. It's now a third of a mile deep, and as wide across as 25 highway lanes. But this is not just another sad climate change story. It's more complicated. \"A lot of things are going on deep inside the ice,\" says Adrian Luckman , a glaciologist at Swansea University in the U.K. He's also leading a project to track changes in the ice shelf. Article continues after sponsorship Luckman says climate change is certainly influencing this region. Larsen C used to have two neighbors to the north, Larsen A and Larsen B. As the air and water warmed, those ice shelves started melting and then splintered into shards in 1995 and 2002. But the crack in Larsen C seems to have happened on its own, for different reasons. \"This is probably not directly attributable to any warming in the region, although of course the warming won't have helped,\" says Luckman. \"It's probably just simply a natural event that's just been waiting around to happen.\" Ice Shelf Collapse In 2002, most of the Antarctic's Larsen B ice shelf collapsed in just three weeks. It was the size of Rhode Island. Source: MODIS/NASA Larsen C has a bunch of cracks. All ice shelves do. This particular crack has been around since at least the 1960s. The unusual part is that in 2014, this crack \u2014 and only this crack \u2014 started growing in spurts. Why? \"Well, that is a little bit of a mystery and that's why it drew itself to our attention,\" says Luckman. It left other cracks in the dust about 50 miles ago. Now, scientists are crunching satellite and radar data to figure out how. \"And that knowledge will be useful in helping us to understand other ice shelves and how they might respond to rifts coming into them,\" says Luckman. One puzzling aspect is how it managed to plow through areas of softer ice, called suture zones, that bind the ice from neighboring glaciers into one giant sheet. \"There's something different about that ice that slows it down or causes it to hang up for some period of time,\" says Dan McGrath , a glaciologist at Colorado State University. But, starting in 2014, that soft ice did very little to slow down this rift. Antarctica's Ice Sheets Are Melting Faster \u2014 And From Beneath \"We need to get to the bottom of understanding what changed that allowed this rift to progress as it has, and will other rifts follow suit,\" says McGrath, who spent four field seasons camped out on the Larsen C ice shelf. (At one point, bad storms kept him inside his tent for more than a week. \"Yeah, you're peeing in a bottle,\" he says. \"There were moments during those seven days that I questioned whether I should have studied tropical reef ecology.\") Scientists are split on how important this crack is for the stability of the whole ice shelf. \"Just because this iceberg calves off, the ice shelf isn't just going to collapse and disappear overnight,\" says McGrath. Some say if this giant section breaks off, it won't make a difference. Others think it could eventually cause the whole shelf to fall apart. Calving is a natural process that produces icebergs, as seen here with the Getz Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. Jeremy Harbeck/NASA hide caption toggle caption ",
