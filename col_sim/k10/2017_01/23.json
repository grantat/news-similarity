Heidi M Przybyla , USA TODAY Published 12:26 p.m. ET Jan. 22, 2017 | Updated 5 hours ago CLOSE x Share Hundreds of thousands of people from around the United States flood Washington, DC, on Saturday for a massive rights march in defiance of America's hardline new president, Donald Trump. Video provided by AFP Newslook Demonstrators protest near the White House during the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017. (Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds, AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Now that the Women\u2019s March on Washington is over,\u00a0women like 32-year-old Jacqueline Glass will determine whether it marked a historic one-day demonstration\u00a0or the start of a widespread resistance to Donald Trump's presidency. Glass was\u00a0among the more than 2 million people who came out in a show of global protest \u2014 from Washington to Sydney, Australia. Now women\u2019s groups and civil rights organizations, such as Planned Parenthood and EMILY's List, \u00a0are scrambling to harness that energy by enlisting more supporters and encouraging women to run for local public office. Glass, an African American who recently\u00a0settled in Norfolk, Va., after retiring from the military, has felt off ever since the election, when her 10-year-old son woke up crying. \u201cI don\u2019t want him feeling like he\u2019s in a place where he\u2019s up against the world. This is America,\u201d she said. \u201cI was having these sinking feels about the world and really down for a period of time,\u201d she said. The feeling became so strong Glass took to Google, which led her to VoteRunLead , a New York nonprofit that grooms women for public office. She's now researching local commissions and boards in which to get active.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m taking these tiny steps toward an ultimate goal,\u201d she said, which is to run for U.S. Senate. Read more: At 2.6 million strong, Women's Marches crush expectations There's early\u00a0anecdotal evidence that \u00a0some women are turning grief over the Election Day loss by Hillary Clinton into action. According to VoteRunLead, more than 2,300 women have signed up for training seminars in the past two months, a major increase.\u00a0Planned Parenthood, which provides free health screening to poor women and is targeted by Republican leaders for funding cuts , is seeing hundreds of thousands of people signing up to volunteer and reach out to their members of Congress. EMILY's List, which works to elect pro-abortion-rights women, drew at least 500 women for a Sunday workshop in downtown Washington on running for office. \u201cThis is the moment of the beginning of the revival of the women\u2019s movement,\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., told the throng of demonstrators around the Capitol Saturday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have equal pay for equal work in this country\u201d or national paid family leave. \u201cUntil every woman and girl in this country has a chance to reach her God-given potential that America will not reach its full potential,\u201d said Gillibrand, something that won\u2019t happen until they're better represented in government. Women are more than half of the U.S. population, yet they hold fewer than one in four seats in the nation\u2019s state legislatures, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Running for office is just of many ways the event\u2019s organizers are hoping women will take action. Demonstrators rally on Capitol Hill during the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 22, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP) Filmmaker Michael Moore gave the crowd a \u201cto-do list,\u201d including running for office and calling Congress on a daily basis to resist the Republican agenda. He urged marchers to turn their communities into \u201cregions of resistance\u201d to fight Republican policies and pass progressive laws on health care and anti-discrimination measures. Recently, in Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s hometown of Janesville, Wis., 50 medical students in lab coats delivered a letter signed by 400 health care professionals to his office. Nearly 50% of the low-income counties served by Planned Parenthood have no alternative health-care provider. About\u00a03% of its services\u00a0are abortion-related, with the majority focused on providing contraception and screening for\u00a0treating sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Despite these bursts in activism, the same thing that made the march an overwhelming\u00a0success \u2014 it drew half a million in Washington alone, or twice as many as expected \u2014 also makes it hard to measure its long-term impact. Many of the women who streamed into Washington in buses, trains and planes are busy mothers, working professionals or older women who already fought the battle over women\u2019s rights in the 1960s.\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t live long enough, most of us, to see the damage done by any Supreme Court appointees that are going to be made during the Trump administration,\u201d said Marcelle Leahy, wife of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. \u201cThis is such an important time. You\u2019re all geared up and I want you to go home and keep on going,\u201d she told a breakfast before the march.

Joan Treistman, who came from New York City to the march, was heading for lunch with her friend and daughter. It was her first time in public activism, and she left resolved to stay active. She said she planned to be in contact with her senators and local lawmakers\u00a0as well as talk more with her friends about issues important to her.\u00a0She had mixed emotions leaving the parade. \"It's the intersection of exhilaration being at the parade, and sadness that we have to be so vigilant\" of government, she said. Samantha Schindler and Samantha Woodman flew all the way from Seattle. On their flights they connected with a group of people who do\u00a0community outreach and they've decided to join.\u00a0Claire Wexler, a social worker from Baltimore, said she intends to keep donating to Planned Parenthood. She also left the march compelled to contact her local lawmakers on issues. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Women first began to run for office in the 1920s, after passage of the 19th Amendment granting the right to vote. Yet they weren\u2019t truly successful until the modern women\u2019s movement during the late 1960s and early 1970s, according to Susan J. Caroll\u2019s The Book of the States. Since the mid-1970s, women greatly increased their numbers in state government. Yet, progress has slowed in recent years, and nationwide statistics show little or no growth in the numbers of women serving in state-level offices since the turn of the century, according to Rutgers data. This may be partly due to the increasingly polarized nature of politics, says Erin Vilardi, who founded VoteRunLead. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a place where you can get anything done, so that\u2019s a turn off,\u201d she said. Women also tend to undervalue their qualifications, she said. Yet, since the election, her group has been overwhelmed. \u201cMy cellphone rang for one week straight,\u201d said Vilardi. \u201cIt was both in a sad way about not getting to the mountaintop, but also in a \u2018it\u2019s time for me\u2019 way,\u201d she said. Trump is also the first U.S. president with no military or government experience. Women are realizing \u201cI don\u2019t need to hold myself to these ridiculous standards. The ship is sinking, I\u2019ve gotta jump on board,\u201d she said. Read more: The best protest signs from the Women's March on Washington There\u2019s many causes to latch on to. The Women\u2019s March\u2019s platform calls for equal rights for women but also racial and economic equality; anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans; access to affordable reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion; criminal justice reform; an increase in the federal minimum wage; immigration reform; and protections for the environment. While the women who came to Washington cited broad concerns, a majority say it\u2019s still better to be a man in America and sexism remains a problem, according to the first major survey on gender following the election. Trump\u2019s Cabinet is 90% male and 90% white. And, according to the poll by the nonpartisan research firm, Perry Undem, the biggest predictor of getting more politically involved \u2014 more than ideology, age, gender, race and geography \u2014 is negative feelings about Trump\u2019s comments and past behavior toward women, including bragging about sexual assault. \u201cWe always say that women run because they want to fix something or when they\u2019re mad as hell,\u201d said Muthoni Wambu Kraal, a senior director at EMILY's List. \u201cWatch out for the one who is both.\u201d Contributing: Dustin Racioppi, The (Bergen) Record; Nicole Gaudiano and \u00a0Eliza Collins, USA TODAY A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

USA TODAY NETWORK Ashley Judd crashed a Women's March after-party Saturday night following her fiery reading of a poem at the protest in Washington earlier in the day. And she quickly hit back at those who found issue with the poem, written by\u00a019-year-old Nina Donovan . \"I got it from the president of the United States,\" she said of the provocative wording, specifically the use of the P word, famously uttered by President Trump in a 2005 video that caught him bragging about grabbing women by their genitalia. \"I'm just quoting him. And I am really more entitled to the word because I've actually got one.\" Ashley Judd onstage during the Women's March on Washington. \u00a0(Photo: Theo Wargo, Getty Images) Judd took the stage at the 9:30 Club during an official after-party, billed as \"Laugh. Dance ... then Get to Work!\" and hosted by Funny or Die and benefiting Planned Parenthood. She joined Ani DiFranco and Lizzy Caplan as unexpected but\u00a0welcomed guests by the crowd, on top of a full lineup that also featured rock band Sleater-Kinney and The National. The sold-out crowd, decked in pink Pussyhats ,\u00a0ate up the \"nasty women\" lines\u00a0which Judd recapped, including some blunt talk about women's periods. With that she brought up the \"tampon tax,\" the state tax codes\u00a0that exempt medical supplies such as Rogaine and Viagra but not feminine hygiene products. \"Is the thinning of your hair more of a necessity?\" she questioned. \"We are feminists. We deserve equal justice.\" Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Alicia Keys and Cher get close at the Women's March on Washington rally, on Jan. 21, 2017.

Chuck Todd, of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d asked Conway early Sunday morning why Mr. Trump had Spicer utter a \u201cfalsehood\u201d the first time he formally faced reporters from the White House briefing room. \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d Todd questioned, referencing Spicer\u2019s incorrect assertion that the audience at Friday\u2019s inauguration was the largest to ever witness the ceremony both in person and around the globe. \u201cIt undermines the credibility of the entire White House press office on day one.\u201d Conway dismissed the question. \u201cDon\u2019t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s a falsehood and they\u2019re giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.\u201d \u201cAlternative facts?\u201d Todd shot back. \u201cLook, alternative facts are not facts, they\u2019re falsehoods.\u201d The television host followed up on the continuing argument over audience turnout, which Mr. Trump also harped on Saturday while visiting CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. \u201cWhat was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?\u201d Todd pressed. Conway quipped: \u201cYour job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president. That\u2019s not your job.\u201d The senior Trump defended Spicer further against Todd: \u201cChuck, I mean, if we\u2019re going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think that we\u2019re going to have to rethink our relationship here,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to gave a great open relationship with our press.\u201d Following the interview, social media exploded with a new trending topic: \u201c#AlternativeFacts.\u201d Twitter users criticized Conway\u2019s television appearance by coming up with their own \u201calternative facts.\u201d\u00a0 As a member of the @backstreetboys , I had a love child with @BettyMWhite . #AlternativeFacts \u2014 Lance Bass (@LanceBass) January 22, 2017 I'm about to devour this alt-salad. #alternativefacts pic.twitter.com/EZKdmDN1RP \u2014 Andrea Chalupa (@AndreaChalupa) January 22, 2017 Even a member of Congress got in on the social media action: BREAKING NEWS: @seanspicer at #WhiteHouse says Warriors beat Cavs in championship game last year.

During an appearance at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics earlier this month, Spicer told David Axelrod: \u201cI don\u2019t think any communicator worth their salt to go out and tell a lie...To go out and tell a lie is something that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d \u201cI may tell a reporter I can\u2019t comment on something\u2026 I\u2019m not able to discuss it. But I\u2019ve never lied,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI would argue that anybody who\u2019s an aspiring communicator adhere to that.

    "text": "Missile Failure off Florida? British Leader Won't Say By gregory katz, associated press LONDON \u0097 Jan 22, 2017, 10:33 AM ET 0 Shares Email The British government is being accused of concealing the failure of an unarmed ballistic missile launch ahead of a debate in Parliament over whether to refurbish the country's aging Trident nuclear launching system. Britain's prime minister refused to say Sunday whether she knew about an unarmed Trident missile that reportedly failed when it was test-fired off the coast of Florida last year. Theresa May told BBC she has total confidence in Britain's Trident nuclear launching system, but didn't confirm or deny a newspaper report about the alleged failure of a ballistic missile designed to carry nuclear warheads. The prime minister was asked about the missile test after the Sunday Times reported that an unarmed missile launched from a submarine off Florida's coast in June veered off course and may have headed toward the U.S. The newspaper said top government officials decided to keep the failure of a Trident II D5 ballistic missile out of the public eye because of an upcoming debate the next month in Parliament over whether to spend 40 billion pounds to refurbish the aging Trident, the cornerstone of Britain's nuclear deterrent system. \"I have absolute faith in our Trident missiles,\" May said Sunday when asked if she had known about a possible missile failure when she spoke to Parliament in July. \"When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident, whether or not we should have Trident missiles.\" The government triumphed in that debate, winning overwhelming support for the Trident overhaul in July, but some opposition figures in the British government now seek an inquiry into the reported missile failure and a possible cover-up. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon, who opposes having the Trident submarine fleet based in Scotland , said reports of a failure and cover-up are a \"hugely serious issue.\" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, also a Trident opponent, called it \"a pretty catastrophic error.\" The British government hasn't confirmed the newspaper's report of a misfire. A government statement posted on a Defense Ministry blog indicated there was a \"routine unarmed Trident missile test launch from HMS Vengeance\" in June. The Royal Navy launch was \"part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew,\" the statement said. The Vengeance submarine and its crew were \"successfully tested and certified,\" it said. The statement says the government does not provide further details on submarine operations for \"obvious\" national security reasons. The British government's website says Trident has provided Britain's security every day for the last 46 years. The system consists of Vanguard-class submarines which can carry up to 16 Trident ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. Defense policy calls for one of the submarines to be on patrol at all times. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Russia Set to Move Closer to Decriminalize Domestic Violence By nataliya vasilyeva, associated press MOSCOW \u0097 Jan 22, 2017, 3:17 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this photo taken on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017, Activist Alyona Popova speaks to the Associated Press at her home in Moscow, Russia. Popova, whose online petition against the bill to decriminalize domestic violence has attracted more than 180,000 signatures, sees the efforts to decriminalize this as a continuation of the Kremlin's increasingly aggressive policy abroad as well as at home after several repressive laws targeting various groups, from foreign-funded NGOs to gay people. (AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin) 0 Shares Email In Russia , giving one's spouse a slap is nothing extraordinary for many people. This week, the Russian parliament is expected to take a step closer toward decriminalizing it altogether. Battery is a criminal offense in Russia, but nearly 20 percent of Russians openly say they think it is sometimes OK to hit a spouse or a child. In a bid to accommodate conservative voters, deputies in the lower house of parliament have given initial approval to a bill eliminating criminal liability for domestic violence that stops short of serious bodily harm or rape. If the measure passes its second reading in the Duma on Wednesday, when the draft can be changed, approval in the third and final reading would be a foregone conclusion. From the Duma, it would proceed to the upper house, largely a rubber-stamp body, and then to President Vladimir Putin's desk. Data on domestic violence in Russia are obscure, but Interior Ministry statistics show that 40 percent of all violent crimes in Russia are committed in family surroundings. In 2013, more than 9,000 women were reported to have been killed in incidents of domestic violence. The bill stems from a Supreme Court ruling last summer to decriminalize battery that doesn't inflict bodily harm, but to retain criminal charges for those accused of battery against family members. Conservative activists objected, saying the ruling meant a parent spanking a child could be punished more harshly than a non-relative striking the child. Ultra-conservative lawmaker Yelena Mizulina, who also authored Russia's \"gay propaganda\" ban, then introduced the bill to decriminalize domestic violence. It initially was shelved after a disapproving review from the government. Tables turned at the end of the year when a journalist from a conservative publication pressed Putin about it at his annual news conference. \"If the father spanks his child for a good reason as a means of education, a traditional Russian one, he will be sentenced to two years in prison \u2014 and if a neighbor does this, he will get away with a fine!\" the journalist told Putin. Putin replied that \"it's better not to spank children and refer to some traditions,\" but then said, \"We should not go overboard with it (punishment for battery). It's not good, it harms families.\" The bill would make battery on a family member punishable by a fine of less than 30,000 rubles ($500) or a 15-day arrest. The Moscow-based Anna Center foundation, which runs Russia's only domestic violence hotline, received more than 5,000 calls last year. The foundation says many more calls that go unanswered since the line operates only between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. The Duma bill \"is not going to improve the situation to say the least,\" said Irina Matvienko, who runs the hotline. \"Domestic violence is a system which makes it difficult for a woman to seek help,\" she said. \"It's not a traditional value. It's a crime . \" Calls to the Anna Center hotline show that a lot of Russian women initially don't even realize that domestic violence is an offense, Matvienko says. A survey this month by state-run pollster VTsIOM showed that 19 percent of Russians say \"it can be acceptable\" to hit one's wife, husband or child \"in certain circumstances.\" The nationwide poll by phone of 1,800 people was held Jan. 13-15. The survey had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. Russian police are notoriously reluctant to react to domestic violence calls, which many regard as meddling in family affairs. Prosecutors in November began investigating a police officer who took a call from a woman complaining about her boyfriend's aggressive behavior. Instead of offering help, the officer reportedly told the woman that the police would only come if she got killed. Shortly thereafter, the man beat the woman to death, prosecutors say. Activist Alyona Popova, whose online petition against the bill has attracted more than 180,000 signatures, sees the efforts to decriminalize domestic violence as a continuation of the Kremlin's increasingly aggressive policies after several repressive laws targeting various groups, from foreign-funded NGOs to gay people. \"I think it's part of an overall ideology: aggression and violence are on the rise in society in general since war is everywhere and we're surrounded by enemies,\" Popova said, referring to the state media narrative that portrays Russia as a besieged fortress. Council of Europe Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland earlier this week sent a letter to the speakers of both houses of Russia's parliament, expressing deep concern at the legislation. Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin dismissed the letter as an \"unacceptable\" attempt to influence parliament. Olga Batalina, one of the bill's co-authors, said in the Duma last week that the penalty for battery should be lenient for acts of violence \"committed in an emotional conflict, without malice, without grave consequences.\" \"Battery doesn't even involve grave bodily harm. We're only talking about bruises, scratches, which is bad, too, of course,\" Batalina said. The comment rattled some lawmakers. \"Has anyone tried going around with a bruise for a week?\" deputy Oleg Nilov asked Batalina at the hearing. \"Does anyone think it's OK?\" There haven't been any significant protests against the bill so far. Activist Popova is not surprised: discussing domestic violence still is taboo in Russia. \"Society is judgmental,\" she said. \"It goes like this: you're a bad woman if you allow this to happen to you, or you're airing dirty laundry and you're to blame, or it's he beats you it means he loves you. And a lot of people don't want to go public about it.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Adam Elmahrek and Joseph Serna Contact Reporters The latest and most powerful in a series of three winter storms slammed into California on Sunday, flooding roads, forcing evacuations in communities near burn areas and adding more snow in mountains from the Sierra Nevada\u00a0to the San Bernardinos.\u00a0 Numerous roads around Southern California were flooded by sustained bursts of intense rain. The 710 Freeway flooded near Pacific Coast Highway, and the 110 Freeway experienced high water near Torrance. Numerous surface streets were also blocked by standing water and fallen trees. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for a large swath of the region, including the South Bay, harbor area, Long Beach, Anaheim,\u00a0Santa Ana and the Inland Empire. Several people had been rescued from cars in flooded intersections, and thousands have lost power. Forecasters had been warning this storm could be the strongest in Southern California in seven years, and it appears to be delivering. While earlier storms produced periods of heavy showers, this storm has\u00a0delivered several hours of pounding rain, which has caused the street flooding.\u00a0 The heaviest rain was hitting Sunday afternoon and evening, with forecasters anticipating as much as an inch per hour during the storm\u2019s peak, said Stuart Seto, weather specialist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\u00a0Some areas will see up to 3 inches of rain by the end of the day, Seto said. Evacuation orders were issued for burn areas in Glendora, Duarte, Silverado Canyon in Orange County and parts of Santa Barbara County. The city of Glendora issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents adjacent to the burn area of the 2014 Colby fire . The order affects about 1,000 homes in an area bounded by the Little Dalton Wash, Sierra Madre Avenue and Yucca Ridge Road. Officials established an evacuation center at the Teen Center at 214 W. Dawson Ave. Also Sunday, the city of Duarte issued evacuation orders for residents living in the areas burned in last\u00a0year\u2019s Fish fire in the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa. An evacuation center was set up at the Duarte Community Center at 1600 Huntington Drive. The city of Santa Clarita issued evacuation notices Saturday evening for about 120 homes in the vicinity of last year\u2019s Sand fire. The affected area is bounded by\u00a0Placerita Canyon to the south, Sand Canyon to the west and Iron Canyon to\u00a0the north. Fast moving waters flooded\u00a0several roads leading to the Val Verde area Sunday afternoon, where residents are being urged to shelter in place. An evacuation center was set up at Canyon High School, 19300 Nadal St. Animals may be taken to the Castaic Animal Shelter at 31044 Charlie Canyon Road. Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday National Weather Service Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday Rainfall totals for Sunday and Monday (National Weather Service) Residents are urged to visit the county\u2019s storm season website at www.lacounty.gov/LARain for additional information. Most of Southern California is under a flash flood watch. The city of Hermosa Beach closed its pier as a precaution because of high surf and it will remain closed until further notice, said Sgt. Mick Gaglia\u00a0of the Hermosa Beach Police Department. Orange County officials were also bracing Sunday for possible flooding, particularly in Silverado Canyon, which is still recovering from a fire in 2014. Extra emergency crews have been brought in to help, including a bulldozer operator and two additional swift-water rescue teams. \u00a0 \u201cThe ground still remains pretty saturated and \u2026 it can be problematic,\u201d said Capt. Alan Wilkes, of the Orange County Fire Authority. \u201cWe just want to be ahead of [any problems].\u201d During the heaviest period of rain on Sunday, coastal areas are expected to see up to an inch of rain, the San Fernando Valley up to 1\u00bd inches, the San Gabriel Mountains up to 2\u00bc\u00a0inches, and downtown Los Angeles up to 1\u2153 inches.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s shaping up to be the strongest storm of the season,\u201d said Carol Smith, of the National Weather Service. A Southern California Edison official\u00a0said Sunday morning that about 5,500 customers in its service area have lost power as a result of the storm. The worst outages are in the San Bernardino Mountains, where 1,500\u00a0customers have lost power, said spokeswoman Susan Cox.\u00a0 Flooding forced road closures across the region. All lanes of northbound and southbound traffic along the\u00a0110 Freeway at 223rd Street has been halted due\u00a0to flooding.\u00a0A weather-related rockslide that occurred Friday has kept Malibu Canyon Road closed into Sunday afternoon, said Officer Elizabeth Kravig, spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.\u00a0 Thunderstorm conditions will ease slightly late Sunday into\u00a0Monday. But the rainfall is expected to continue until Tuesday and end sometime before noon. All told, the storm system is expected to generate 4 to 6 inches of rainfall over the next three days, with the most rainfall in the foothill and mountain areas. Clearer skies and temperatures in the mid to high 60s are expected to return beginning Friday.\u00a0 The storm is also expected to hit the Sierra Nevada\u00a0hard. The weather service warned of \u201ccrippling snow amounts on top of existing snow cover\u201d and urged\u00a0residents to stock up on food, water and firewood, and \u201cessentially prepare for being stranded at home for multiple days.\u201d Power outages are likely, and mature trees are expected to\u00a0fall. It\u2019s possible that residents could endure multiple-day power outages, failures of carports and decks, and avalanches. As of Sunday morning, there was flooding reported in some areas including Santa Cruz County. Snow\u00a0once again closed Interstate 80 in the Sierras, where a new avalanche warning was issued. For the second time in as many days, mudslides closed Highway 17, the main route between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz. The forecast is heightening concerns about mudslides and flooding across the state. Another powerful storm that hit California on Friday caused numerous road closures and mudslides in areas burned by recent fires, including a major incident near Santa Barbara\u00a0that destroyed cabins\u00a0and cars, and forced rescues. The storm is expected to peak on Sunday, with thunderstorms possible and continuing into Monday. ",

As the suspects tried to get away, they ran into two bystanders. McManus said one of the men who tried to intervene was shot and killed. The other Good Samaritan, who had a concealed carry permit, shot one of the suspects.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s absolutely senseless. Absolutely senseless. This is the second [recent] time that a Good Samaritan was killed trying to intervene in a crime to help the victim,\u201d McManus told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely senseless.\u201d The other suspect managed to escape the mall, firing at bystanders as he went. Police say the suspect is still at large and described him as a Hispanic male.\u00a0 KABB reported that the robbery suspect was taken to a local hospital in critical condition. Two other shooting victims also taken to a hospital, as was a woman who complained of chest pains and a pregnant woman who went into labor. There was no immediate word on any of their conditions.\u00a0 McManus said the mall was placed on lockdown after the shooting and officers were escorting people out of the stores one by one. \"We searched the mall and we feel as confident as we can feel that the [second] suspect is not in there,\" McManus said.

    "text": "Tribune news services Contact Reporter Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. announced a recall Sunday of certain 12-ounce bottles of its pale ales, IPA's and other beers after detecting a packaging flaw that could cause a piece of glass to break off into the bottle. In a statement Sunday, it said the recall applies to eight different types of its craft beers, including its popular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, purchased in 36 states across the Midwest, the South and East Coast of the United States. The California-based company issued the voluntary recall after quality inspections at its Mills River, North Carolina, brewery detected a limited number of bottles made with a flaw \"that may cause a small piece of glass to break off and possibly fall into the bottle, creating a risk of injury,\" the statement said. The affected beer has a package date that falls between Dec. 5, 2016, and Jan. 13, 2017 and a brewery code of \"M'' \u2014 which stands of Mills River \u2014 printed directly on bottles and the packaging of cardboard cases. \"We have decided to take this precaution to ensure the safety of our customers,\" Mike Bennett, chief supply chain officer, was quoted as saying. He said Sierra Nevada had not received any consumer reports of injuries, and it believed the concern could impact about 1 in every 10,000 \u2014 or .01 percent \u2014 of its bottles packaged during the five-week time period. Aside from its Pale Ale, the Sierra Nevada recall includes 12-ounce bottles of its Beer Camp Golden IPA, Sidecar Orange Pale Ale, Torpedo Extra IPA, Tropical Torpedo, Nooner, Hop Hunter and Otra Vez. The company has stopped distributing all affected beer and is working to have it removed from retails shelves, the statement said. Consumers were urged to check the company's website for details on the recall and not to drink any of the recalled beer, which would be fully refunded. The recall applies to the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachussets, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

    "text": "Trump, Amid Combative Start, Pledges to Rise to Moment By jonathan lemire, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 22, 2017, 7:06 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press President Donald Trump speaks at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va., Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) 0 Shares Email After a combative start to his presidency, Donald Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was ready to begin governing a divided nation. Trump began rolling out his plans for diplomatic outreach, speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and announcing plans for early meetings with Netanyahu and other world leaders. He thanked top law enforcement officers for their service and support. And he swore-in a group of aides, telling them he believed they were ready to rise to a daunting task. \"But with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\" Trump said in a ceremony in the White House East Room. \"We will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\" Trump's reassurance came after a day marked by global protests against his presidency and his own complaints about media coverage of his inauguration, a combination of events that made for a contentious first full day in office on Saturday. But even as the White House tried to forge forward, the president's aides continued to defend the president and his press secretary, both of whom tore into journalists for accurately reporting that his swearing-in ceremony drew a smaller crowd than President Barack Obama did eight years ago. On Sunday, a top adviser said the Trump administration was supplying \"alternative facts.\" \"There's no way to really quantify crowds. We all know that. You can laugh at me all you want,\" Kellyanne Conway told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" She added: \"I think it's actually symbolic of the way we're treated by the press.\" Trump on Saturday declared he believed \"it looked like a million and a half people.\" But ridership on the Washington's Metro system didn't match that of recent inaugurations. As of 11 a.m. Friday, there were 193,000 trips taken, according to the transportation service's Twitter account. At the same hour eight years ago, there had been 513,000 trips. Four years later, there were 317,000 for Obama's second inauguration. Conway also declared that Trump will not release his tax returns now that he's taken office, breaking a promise he made during the campaign. As a candidate, he said he would release his returns after an IRS audit was completed. Every president since 1976 has released the information, but Conway said she does not believe Americans care whether Trump follows suit. \"He's not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care,\" Conway said on ABC's \"This Week.\" Trump's advisers have set Monday up as the president's first major day of action on his sweeping campaign promises, but as of Sunday night, it appeared as though his team was still making decisions on what moves to make. Some congressional Republicans had expected Trump to sign orders over the weekend, but those never materialized. Trump campaigned on a very specific 18-point plan for this first day in office. If he follows it, he could sign executive orders on immigration, trade and national security . Trump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama's executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as children. He's due to begin formally discussing his agenda Monday at a meeting with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders. Trump's early call to Netanyahu was aimed at signaling his support for Israel and a new start in a relationship that became increasingly fraught during the Obama administration. Trump described that conversation as \"very nice.\" White House officials said Trump \"affirmed his unprecedented commitment to Israel's security.\" The leaders agree to meet at the White House in early February. Trump announced that he's set up meetings with the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto. \"We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\" he said of his meeting with Mexico, along with immigration and security at the border. Trump has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it. The new president showed he was clinging to some of his pre-presidential habits. He responded to Saturday's protests on Twitter, offering a scattershot response. In one tweet, he sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defended demonstrators' rights a short time later. \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,\" Trump tweeted early Sunday morning. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone. \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\" the president tweeted, still using his personal account. The dueling tweets marked his administration's first response to the more than 1 million people who rallied at women's marches in Washington and cities across the world. Hundreds of protesters lined the street as Trump's motorcade drove past on Saturday afternoon, with many screaming and chanting. The Washington rally appeared to attract more people than attended Trump's inauguration on Friday, but there were no completely comparable numbers. Regional transportation officials tweeted on Sunday that 1,001,616 trips were taken on the rail system on Saturday. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel had said that on Friday, the day of Donald Trump's inauguration, just over 570,000 trips were taken on the rail system. Trump, whose 12th wedding anniversary was Sunday, also attended a reception for law enforcement officers and first responders who helped with his inauguration. He singled out the work of FBI Director James Comey, whom he offered a handshake and hug. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Julie Pace contributed reporting. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Lerer at http://twitter.com/@llerer 0 Shares ",

But we\u2019re going to start renegotiating on NAFTA, on immigration, on security at the border.\u201d Mexico, the president went on, has so far been \u201cterrific\u201d in their conversations, and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto -- who spoke with Mr. Trump by phone Saturday -- has been \u201creally very amazing.\u201d Mr. Trump ran a campaign in 2016 promising to rip up international trade deals, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and blasting them as reasons for the lowering employment opportunities in the manufacturing industry. In an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2015 , the then-candidate promised to revamp NAFTA or \u201cwe will break it.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cEvery agreement has an end,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cEvery agreement has to be fair. Every agreement has a defraud clause. We\u2019re being defrauded by all these countries.\u201d Trump calls NAFTA a \"disaster\" Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary also listed a second look at NAFTA as a top priority.\u00a0 In his confirmation hearing last week, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said the trade agreement was \u201clogically the first thing for us to deal with.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe must solidify relationships in the best way we can in our own territory before we go off to other jurisdictions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be a very, very early topic in this administration...I think all aspects of NAFTA will be put on the table.\u201d The discussions to overhaul the 23-year-old trade deal could start as early as next week: the president is scheduled to meet with the Mexican president on Jan. 31, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer.\u00a0 And Mr. Trump said Sunday at East Room ceremony that he has also scheduled a meeting with Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, the third country directly impacted by NAFTA. Mr. Trump is also expected to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, following an appearance May will make at a retreat in Philadelphia for Congressional Republicans. The president, in his wide-ranging remarks to his senior White House staff, briefly hinted at running for re-election in 2020. \u201cWe are going to do some great things over the next eight years,\u201d he said, before stepping aside to allow Vice President Mike Pence to swear in his administration officials. Mr. Trump also weighed in on the traditional letter every departing president gives to his successor, which he held up during the ceremony to show the audience. \u201cWe will cherish that,\u201d he said, before ribbing that \u201cwe won\u2019t even tell the press what is in that letter.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) during the Jan. 11 Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan By Karoun Demirjian and Sean Sullivan January 22 at 7:12 PM Follow @karoun Follow @WaPoSean Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey O. Graham said Sunday that they will back the nomination of Rex Tillerson, clearing the way for the oil executive to become secretary of state and leaving just one drama unresolved: What will Marco Rubio do? The Republican senator from Florida made clear during Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing earlier this month that he had significant reservations, chastising the ExxonMobil chief executive for refusing to call Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Aleppo a war crime and declining to condemn Saudi Arabia and China as human rights violators. \u201cIn order to have moral clarity, we need clarity. We can\u2019t achieve moral clarity with rhetorical ambiguity,\u201d Rubio told Tillerson. \u201cWe need a secretary of state who will fight for these principles.\u201d Since then, Rubio has come under significant pressure from Republican party leaders to back Tillerson and avoid a split within the GOP on one of President Trump\u2019s most high-profile picks, according to those close to him. Rubio held an unannounced meeting with Tillerson last week, according to two people with knowledge of the get-together, although it was unclear whether Tillerson was able to alleviate Rubio\u2019s concerns. Now-Vice President Pence and now-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus were also in the meeting, according to a Rubio adviser familiar with the gathering. It lasted 90 minutes and was a blunt conversation not just about Tillerson\u2019s answers at the hearing, but also about Rubio\u2019s overall concerns about Russia and other matters, said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private talk. (Reuters) The White House did not respond Sunday to a request for comment on the meeting. The Tillerson decision is a potentially pivotal one for the former presidential candidate, who during the campaign challenged President Trump on foreign-policy differences that have since been reflected in concerns Republicans have voiced about Tillerson. Many in the party are leery of Trump\u2019s friendly approach to Russia and its leader, Vladi\u00admir Putin, with whom Tillerson frequently interacted as the head of ExxonMobil. Putin awarded Tillerson the Kremlin\u2019s Order of Friendship in 2013, and Tillerson has criticized sanctions the United States imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. \u201cMarco exposed a tension between kind of where a lot of Republicans are on Russia,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, who served as an adviser to Rubio during his 2016 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great opportunity to kind of lead this wing of the national security establishment that believes the long-standing orthodoxy on Russia.\u201d Politically, however, several people in Rubio\u2019s circle said they see no upside to defying Trump, especially now that Tillerson is on the path to being confirmed. Rubio is aware that the backlash from the new White House would be intense, according to those close to him. George Seay, a Dallas-based investment manager who was a major Rubio donor during his presidential run, said that many people close to him have been texting, calling and writing Rubio to urge him to support Tillerson \u201cin very blunt fashion.\u201d \u201cI think this is the wrong fight. I think it\u2019s the wrong position to make a stand,\u201d Seay said. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos did not respond to multiple inquiries Sunday about Rubio\u2019s thinking on Tillerson or his meetings. Seeming uncertainty is a familiar position for Rubio. During the 2013 debate over immigration reform, Rubio initially joined with Democrats to push for a comprehensive bill before backing away from the effort when conservative ire reached a boiling point. The fallout would follow him into his presidential campaign, where he took heat from the right for being part of the effort and criticism from the left for backing away from it. During his presidential campaign, Rubio had a pattern of articulating two positions on some politically sensitive topics: his personal view, and what he considered to be politically doable. This mirrored how he campaigned against Trump, as well. Early on, Rubio avoided attacking Trump, even when he clearly disagreed with him. When the primaries heated up, Rubio switched his strategy and launched a forceful \u2014 at times awkward \u2014 attack, calling Trump a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d After Trump won the nomination, Rubio switched again and supported his party\u2019s nominee. On Sunday morning, McCain (Ariz.) and Graham (S.C.) \u2014 Tillerson\u2019s two other most vocal GOP critics \u2014 released a statement announcing they would support him for secretary of state when the full Senate votes on it. Citing additional conversations with Tillerson, the pair expressed \u201cconfidence\u201d that Tillerson \u201ccan be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,\u201d despite continued \u201cconcerns about his past dealings with the Russian government.\u201d Of all the Republican senators, only Rubio, McCain and Graham\u2019s support for Tillerson has ever been seriously in doubt. Of the three, Rubio\u2019s complaints have been the most broad, centering on his fear that as secretary of state, Tillerson might not be a strong-enough defender of human rights. Rubio warned Tillerson that being too soft \u201cleads to people to conclude . . . America cares about democracy and freedom as long as it isn\u2019t being violated for something else.\u201d McCain and Graham\u2019s support all but guarantees that Tillerson will easily win the simple majority he needs to be confirmed as secretary of state by the full Senate. But if Rubio votes against Tillerson\u2019s nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 where Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote \u2014 it could throw a wrench into plans to move Tillerson\u2019s nomination to the floor smoothly. \u201cI recognize the partisan split on the committee and what it would all mean,\u201d Rubio told reporters after Tillerson\u2019s hearing, asserting that he was \u201cprepared to do what\u2019s right.\u201d If Rubio opposes Tillerson, GOP leaders are prepared to use a variety of procedural options to get his nomination to the floor. \u201cI expect him to come out of the committee on Monday,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said following Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday, although he admitted \u201cthe votes are still in flux.\u201d If committee members do not vote to report Tillerson\u2019s nomination to the floor with a favorable recommendation, they can vote to send it to the floor with caveats, such as an unfavorable recommendation, or with no recommendation at all. If those efforts fail, a senator can file a discharge motion to circumvent the committee\u2019s review authority entirely and send Tillerson\u2019s nomination straight to the floor. Top committee Democrat Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said Friday that while he believes \u201cour committee\u2019s recommendation\u2019s extremely important,\u201d he does \u201crecognize the fact that confirmations are by the Senate, not by committee.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

But in the dead of night this week, Britain's military sent five tanks down the 30-mile \"Chunnel\" to test whether it would be an effective route for forces if deployed to places such as Eastern Europe amid tensions between Russia and NATO. The fact that Wednesday's exercise came two days before President Trump's inauguration appears coincidental; the British army told NBC News the test had been planned for a year. . @BritishArmy moving tanks through Channel Tunnel in long-planned test tonight \u2013 means we can move kit by rail as well as sea & air. pic.twitter.com/cjj4LMsq7x \u2014 Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) January 17, 2017 But the potential need to fast-track forces to the Russian front served as a reminder of how seriously Washington's allies in Europe perceive the threat on their doorstep. These allies have traditionally felt that Washington has their back, something thrown into doubt by Trump cozying up to Moscow and branding NATO \"obsolete\" earlier this week. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said these remarks caused \"astonishment\" and \"agitation\" across the continent, and NATO members are now facing a future where they may no longer be able to rely on Washington. \"We cannot trust Trump to take care of [Europe's] security,\" said Josef Braml, a transatlantic expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. \"If Trump cuts a deal with Putin, then maybe there will be fewer tanks, American tanks, on European soil and we should prepare for that scenario. Trump's comments this week came after he suggested during his campaign that he might not honor NATO's central tenet that an attack against one member state would be seen as an attack against all. \"It's certainly freaked people out,\" according to Alexander Lanoszka, an expert in American foreign policy at City, University of London . He said Trump's comments have brought European concerns about an emboldened Russia \"into sharp focus.\" A Eurostar passenger train exits the Channel Tunnel in Calais, France. Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg via Getty Images, file Kier Giles, an associate fellow at London's Chatham House think tank, agreed. \"I think we're already seeing that happening,\" he said of the shock waves sent through Europe by the president-elect. \"Almost all of Trump's comments have got the attention of NATO governments.\" Like many of Trump's public statements, his stance on NATO has been laced with contradiction. After telling The Times of London that NATO was \"obsolete,\" he added it was \"very important to me.\" Furthermore, his picks for secretary of state and defense secretary backed the alliance. #tillerson says NATO allies right to be alarmed abt Russia, blames lack of US leadership, moving of \u2018red lines.\u2019 \u2014 Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) January 11, 2017 Trump's main grip with NATO is that some members do not pull their weight financially. The facts support this view, and Barack Obama had complained of similar. Encouraging these smaller states to become self-sufficient may even be a good thing, according to some analysts. But suggesting the U.S. could withdraw support because of these complaints was a radical move. In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg played down any rift with the president-elect. But he also made a point of highlighting that the only time NATO's principle of collective defense has ever been enacted was when allies came to America's aid after 9/11 \"The military operation [in Afghanistan] was a direct response on an attack on the United States,\" he said. \"So NATO is important both for Europe, and for the United States.\" If Trump's support for NATO did ebb, it would represent a dramatic about-turn from current policy. The Obama administration recently deployed the biggest build up of U.S. forces in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Some 2,700 troops, along with tanks and heavy equipment, arrived in Poland earlier this month. The country shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Russia's ally Belarus. American military officials have highlighted a 60-mile sliver of land between Poland and NATO ally Lithuania, known as the Suwalki Gap , as a potential target in the unlikely event of a Russian invasion.

    "text": "British Leader to Meet With Trump to Discuss Trade, NATO By gregory katz, associated press LONDON \u0097 Jan 22, 2017, 10:37 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks on the third day of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Michel Euler) 0 Shares Email British Prime Minister Theresa May said Sunday she plans to discuss free trade and the importance of the NATO military alliance when she becomes the first foreign leader to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. The White House's invitation for May to meet with Trump on Friday was seen in Britain as affirmation that Trump values the vaunted \"special relationship\" between the United States and its longtime ally across the Atlantic. She told BBC's Andrew Marr that the Trump team is interested in discussing a new trade arrangement with Britain despite the \"America first\" theme of Trump's inaugural address and his vow to evaluate every trade deal for its possible benefits to the United States. Any national leader would do the same when deciding whether to sign a trade pact, May said. Britain sees a future trade agreement with the United States as vital as the country prepares to leave the European Union. However, Britain's desire for increased trade could clash with Trump's protectionist stance. May said she would also raise the value of the NATO military alliance during the meeting. She called it the \"bulwark\" of Europe's defense system. Trump has rattled European allies by suggesting NATO is \"obsolete\" and that the United States might not come to the aid of countries that don't meet targets for their own defense spending. May maintained that Trump understands NATO's vital role. European leaders worry about a watering down of the NATO role given the increasingly aggressive actions by Russia in recent years. The prime minister didn't directly answer questions about whether she will use Friday's meeting to challenge Trump over derogatory comments he has made about women. May criticized crude remarks of his that surfaced during the presidential campaign. But she said she would speak out if she finds his future behavior or comments \"unacceptable.\" May said she has a long track record promoting equal rights for women, adding that she is proud to be Britain's second female prime minister. \"When I sit down, I think the biggest statement that will be made about the role of women is the fact that I will be there as a female prime minister, prime minister of the United Kingdom , directly taking to him about the interests that we share,\" she said. British officials say May will also speak to Republican senators and representatives at a retreat in Philadelphia. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump's Cabinet picks face questions from both parties; McConnell 'confident' Published               January 22, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The Senate is expected on Monday to hold its confirmation vote on President Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director, Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo. But the chamber\u2019s Republican and Democratic leaders this weekend offered sharply different perspectives about the future of the president\u2019s 20-plus Cabinet nominees. Top Senate Democrats on Friday postponed Pompeo\u2019s vote saying they wouldn\u2019t rush through the conformation process for Trump and fellow Republicans who control Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that several of Trump\u2019s remaining nominees will be subject to \u201ca thorough debate.\u201d The New York Democrat said he was \u201cdubious\u201d about eight or nine of Trump's picks -- citing potential conflicts of interests and policy stands. The Senate has so far confirmed just two Trump nominees. Gens. James Mattis, as defense secretary, and John Kelly, as Homeland Security secretary on Friday, when Trump was sworn-in as president. However, Senate Democrats have little chance of blocking a confirmation unless some chamber Republicans defect. Senate Republicans have a 52-to-48 majority and need only a simple majority of 51 to confirm a nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed confidence Sunday about having enough votes to get all of Trump\u2019s nominees confirmed. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll be able to confirm the president\u2019s entire Cabinet,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m optimistic.\u201d The prospects for former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson becoming secretary of state improved this weekend when two influential Republican senators expressed support, after having waivered over Tillerson\u2019s past professional ties to Russia. \"Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,\" Sens. John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, said in a joint statement. Tillerson also faces a vote Monday, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. McCain, Graham and fellow GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida, have questioned whether Tillerson has too many conflicts of interests to champion U.S. policy abroad, especially in Russia. As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson spoke out against U.S. sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The penalties cost the energy giant hundreds of millions of dollars. The episode became even more of a concern after the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House race. McCain and Graham are not on the Foreign Relations committee, like Rubio. However all three will cast a final vote on the Tillerson nomination, if he gets enough votes Monday in the committee, which has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats. Graham told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that he was persuaded to back Tillerson after they met privately.\u00a0 According to Graham, Tillerson told him \"when America doesn't lead, other people will, and the vacuum is always filled by bad actors. He said that we have to have a foreign policy that engages the world. We need to lead from the front.\" McCain said on ABC's \"This Week\" that he talked to Tillerson about his views on Russia and his duty heading a major corporation. \u201cThis wasn't an easy call,\" McCain said. \"But I also believe that, when there's doubt, the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt.\" Rubio, who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination last year, clashed with Tillerson at a hearing earlier this month. Rubio bristled at Tillerson's refusal to label Putin a \"war criminal\" or condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He also chided Tillerson over the need for \"moral clarity.\" Hours after Trump was sworn in on Friday, Rubio was tight-lipped, saying he would make his decision \"certainly before the vote\" Monday and that Tillerson's responses to written questions had addressed \"some of\" his concerns. Still, a \"no\" vote from Rubio would not doom Tillerson's confirmation, because the nomination could go directly to the Senate floor even without a positive committee recommendation. But it would be an embarrassing rebuke to Trump just as his presidency gets under way, with questions swirling about his ties to Russia.

Jones , USA TODAY Sports Published 6:31 p.m. ET Jan. 22, 2017 | Updated 4 minutes ago Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan (2) celebrates his touchdown run with wide receiver Aldrick Robinson (19) in the second quarter in the 2017 NFC Championship Game at the Georgia Dome. (Photo: Dan Powers, Appleton Post Crescent/USA TODAY Sports) ATLANTA \u2013 The most memorable sound in the final football game at the Georgia Dome was a chant, reverberating through every square inch of this old stadium. \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d chanted Falcons fans, from the first moment Matt Ryan jogged through the tunnel one last time, through the last seconds of the fourth quarter as the Atlanta Falcons quarterback helped make the last game here the most memorable. Ryan threw for four touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown in a 44-21 win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, sending the Falcons to Houston for Super Bowl LVI. It is their first trip to the Super Bowl since the 1998 season. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Ryan. This sort of offensive explosion from the Falcons offense wasn\u2019t exactly unexpected, not after Ryan and the Falcons dismantled the vaunted Seattle Seahawks defense last week in the divisional round and after averaging nearly 34 points per game in the regular season. \u201cWe played great today in all three phases,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe knew going against Green Bay and Aaron (Rodgers) that it\u2019s never over.\u201d What was a surprise was the way the Falcons defense made sure the game never turned into the anticipated shootout. The Falcons shut out the Packers in the first half Sunday, forced two turnovers and flustered Aaron Rodgers with well-timed blitzes. Even with the return of No.1 receiver Jordy Nelson, the hottest quarterback in the NFL was still no match for what looks like the NFL\u2019s complete team. JULIO JONES IS A BEAST. 73 yards all the way to the house! \uf631 #GBvsATL #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/Iau1EnDgVJ \u2014 NFL (@NFL) January 22, 2017 \u201cA good defense,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe hurt ourselves early\u2026hurt the momentum for us. Playing a team like that have to start better than that. We had zero points at halftime. Not going to win games like that.\u201d Much of that is a credit to Ryan, the favorite to win the NFL\u2019s MVP award which will be announced on the eve of the Super Bowl. Voting was completed weeks ago, but his performance in the NFC Championship Game only bolstered his case. Ryan\u2019s most emphatic throw might have come after his 14-yard touchdown run, as Ryan celebrated by drilling the ball off the Falcons\u2019 logo on the wall behind the end zone as he was swarmed by his teammates. Yes, this game clearly meant something for Ryan, who had been plagued by questions about his play in big games throughout his career, including four years ago, when the Falcons squandered a 17-point lead after Ryan through two second-half interceptions in a NFC Championship Game loss to the San Francisco 49ers. But what makes Ryan a real threat to lead the Falcons to their first Super Bowl title in two weeks is the cast of offensive players around him. Few offenses in recent memory have had such diversity \u2013 with a scary pair of running backs in Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, who combined for a modest 71 rushing yards against the Packers \u2013 and a deep stable of receivers. Julio Jones is certainly and deservedly the star, which he emphasized Sunday with 180 yards and two jaw-dropping touchdowns, but Ryan connected with seven other Falcons for at least one pass. The Falcons\u2019 offensive diversity should be a model for the Packers, whose eight-game winning streak is over after the team became too one-dimensional around Rodgers. The Packers rushed just 13 times \u2013 including four scrambles by Rodgers, who was the leading rusher with 46 yards. Rodgers threw three touchdowns, even while playing behind an offensive line that lost three players by the fourth quarter and had to use a defensive tackle at guard, but those scores were too late to make the game competitive.

    "text": "advertisement A suspect was in custody and a second remained at large Sunday after a bystander was killed and five other people were injured in an attempted robbery at a mall in San Antonio, Texas, police said. At least two of the five people with injuries were struck by gunfire, said authorities, who didn't report their conditions. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus described a terrifying scene in which a bystander who was simply trying to help was shot and killed, one suspect was shot and wounded, and a second suspect fled through Rolling Oaks Mall spraying bullets as he ran. Officers patrol the corridors of Rolling Oaks Mall in San Antonio after a person was killed and six other people were injured by armed robbers Sunday. Colbri Brought-Burke \"It is absolutely senseless,\" McManus said. Police said the two robbers were fleeing a Kay Jewelers store in the mall in northeast San Antonio when two bystanders confronted them. One of the suspects shot one of the bystanders, who was declared dead, authorities said. The second bystander, who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, the shot one of the suspects, sending the second suspect racing away down the mall's corridors, firing his gun as he ran. Police said the mall has been swept and would be swept again by a K9 team. They said no one inside the mall, which was under lockdown, was in any danger. Leslie Garza, a spokeswoman for San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor, said: \"We do not know where the second suspect is at this point. We searched the mall and feel he is not in there. The shootout shattered the nerves of shoppers on a busy Sunday afternoon. \"I heard several gunshots and saw people screaming and running, and I told my best friend to get down, and I was yelling at the employees of the store to get down, and we all ran to the back office to hide,\" Colbri Brought-Burke, 19, told NBC News by phone from inside New York & Company, a women's clothing store. Monica Marie Carreon, sheltered inside Shoe Palace with her two toddler sons and three other people, said she heard as many as 10 shots. \"We immediately heard people screaming and running inside the back of the stores, so we ran to the back of Shoe Palace,\" Carreon said. Officers who stopped by the store told Carreon and the others to stay in place, she said. Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified San Antonio's mayor. She is Ivy Taylor, not Ivy Jones. Alex Johnson ",

AP After weeks of uncertainty and political tension, the longtime ruler of Gambia, Yahya Jammeh, has boarded a plane to fly into exile. On Dec. 1, Jammeh lost an election to Adama Barrow in a shocking upset . Initially, Jammeh accepted the result \u2014 then, a week later, he changed his mind. He issued a state of emergency, and later Parliament extended his term in hopes of easing tensions. Troops from regional powers gathered at the border, prepared to take military action if Jammeh did not step down, and international pressure against him mounted. Gambia Prepares For Showdown As Foreign Troops Threaten Intervention As NPR has reported, Jammeh has a dismal human rights record, and is seen as a leader who does not tolerate dissent. Prior to the election, which he assumed he would win, he said \"only divine intervention\" would remove him from office. After the election commissioner declared victory for Barrow last month, Jammeh ordered that troops seize the commission's headquarters . As the political stalemate dragged on in recent weeks, Gambia prepared for a showdown, and foreign intervention. Gambians poured across the border into Senegal fearing unrest and violence \u2014 including the president-elect, Adama Barrow. Barrow, a businessman, was sworn in while still in Dakar, Senegal, where he remains while security troops complete a final sweep. Jammeh's exile clears the way for Gambia's first peaceful and democratic transfer of power since the nation gained independence in 1965. Jammeh became the leader of the West African nation 22 years ago after staging a coup, and had vowed he would rule for \" a billion years. \" NPR thanks our sponsors ",

The two Saturday strikes killed Abu Anis al-Abi, an area field commander, and two others, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information to journalists. Report raises questions about civilian casualties in drone strikes U.S. drone strikes against suspected al Qaeda targets have been commonplace in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, as a retaliatory measure against the group. The use of unmanned aircraft as well as air strikes in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country rose dramatically under President Barack Obama , with data from the Britain-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism showing spikes in attacks, especially in 2012 and 2016. Last summer,\u00a0 then-President Obama took the unusual step of acknowledging the \u201clegitimate criticism\u201d of U.S. drone strikes in the Middle East that have caused civilian deaths. At the same time, he said the U.S. has now \u201cconstructed a fairly rigid and vigorous set of criteria\u201d to justify continued drone strikes that kill whole groups of people at once. \u201cIn the past, there was legitimate criticism that the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes wasn\u2019t as precise as it should have been,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d U.S. intelligence officials have said as many as 117 civilians had been killed in drone and other counterterror attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere during Obama\u2019s presidency. Human rights and other groups criticized the Obama administration, saying it undercounted civilian casualties. They also worried that President Trump will more aggressively conduct drone strikes, which are subject to little oversight from Congress or the judiciary. In the years since the drone program began, Yemen has fallen ever deeper into chaos. A two-year-old civil war began after Shiite Houthis rebels seized the capital Sanaa and forced the President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee the country, prompting the launch of an extensive air campaign by a Saudi-led coalition that began in March 2015 aimed at restoring Hadi\u2019s government. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, long seen by Washington as among the most dangerous branches of the global terror network, exploited the chaos, seizing territory in the country\u2019s south and east, and the Islamic State group has also claimed attacks. The northern region remains under Houthi control. On Sunday, Mwatana, one of Yemen\u2019s top human rights groups, released a documentary on civilian victims of drone strikes, interviewing family members who say their relatives were innocent and have had no compensation from the U.S. despite their wrongful deaths. It cited much higher civilian death tolls than the U.S. intelligence report, saying that hundreds of innocents had been killed by the U.S. strikes across the country since at least 2002. In one segment from Bayda, the same province where Saturday\u2019s drone strikes hit, Ali Abedrabbo Ahmed said his 17-year old son was only a simple construction worker killed while he was going to work in a pickup truck with colleagues in 2014, an incident other witnesses corroborated in the video. \u201cWho do we talk to? America? Where is America?\u201d said Nasser Mohammed Nasser, a survivor from the targeted convoy. \u201cThey would kill two or three from al Qaeda on one hand and 10 or 15 civilians on the other hand. Where is this al Qaeda they claim to be killing? ... There are many other incidents like ours due to drones .\u201d Women loyal to the Houthi movement parade to show support to the movement in Sanaa, Yemen January 17, 2017.

USA TODAY NETWORK Crowds fill Pennsylvania Avenue during Saturday's Women's March on Washington. (Photo: Joe Lamberti/Courier-Post) In his inaugural address , President Trump bragged that he was leading \"a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\" Turns out he helped spawn two of them. On Friday, a legion of Americans cheered Trump as a refreshingly pugnacious leader elected with a promise to shake\u00a0the regular order in a country they say has gotten off on the wrong track. On Saturday, a multitude of Americans demonstrated against the new president for policies and rhetoric they see as misogynist\u00a0and dangerous. Elections are by definition divisive, of course, and Trump takes control of the White House at a time politics have\u00a0become increasingly polarized. But historians struggle to cite a precedent for a new president who is both beneficiary and target of such powerful and rising grass-roots movements. At stake are clashing visions of America on everything from the role of women and the impact of immigration to how the United States should engage with the world. \"It's hard for anyone to say when we're at a pivotal point, but I think these may be seismic shifts,\" Timothy Naftali, an historian at New York University and the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, said in an interview. \"We thought there was an era of new politics because of the role Trump played in the Republican Party, but the new politics may not just be of the right. We may be seeing a new politics in the center and the left.\" Read more: Change direction?\u00a0 Last year's surprising presidential primaries set the landscape for this year's political turmoil. Among Republicans, Trump tapped\u00a0rising discontent, especially\u00a0among whites, men and workers who had watched well-paying manufacturing jobs evaporate in the Rust Belt. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders did the same \u2014 especially among liberals, women and Millennials \u2014\u00a0with his strong bid for the Democratic nomination. Now both movements believe politics-as-usual has failed them, and neither owes their origins to the political establishment.\u00a0While those in both movements would agree the nation is headed in the wrong direction, though, they disagree on just what the right direction would be. In his address Friday, Trump said his lodestar would be \"America First,\" a phrase with resonant history suggesting a withdrawal from global engagement. One core campaign promise was to protect American workers by ending or renegotiating free-trade deals. Another was to build a wall along the Southern border to limit illegal immigrants he portrayed as rapists and murderers. He suggested he might propose a registry for Muslims. He wants the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision recognizing abortion rights. President Trump celebrates after his inaugural address on Jan. 20, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Pool, Getty Images) In contrast, the Women's Marches on Saturday limited official participation to groups that support abortion rights, and they accused Trump of trying to roll back hard-won equal rights for women. Marchers made a point of welcoming Muslims to their ranks and extolling\u00a0the value of immigrants, including the young people known as DREAMers who may be about to lose protection from deportation that former president Barack Obama had extended. Katie Page Sander \"boycotted\" watching Trump's Inauguration,\u00a0instead driving to Washington from her hometown of Ann Arbor., Mich., to march against him on Saturday. \"Trump is the quintessential bully and we teach our children how to stand up to bullies,\" she said, marching alongside her husband and three children. \"What I hope is this is a catalyst that people realize you can't be complacent any more.\" A day earlier, Gary Nystrom of Boone, Iowa, was elated as he stood on the National Mall to watch Trump sworn in, calling it a victory for the \"silent majority.\" \"It's a breath of fresh air,\" said Nystrom, a city councilman and member of the Iowa GOP state central committee. \"There's a new life ahead of us.\u00a0President Trump \u2014\u00a0I can say that now:\u00a0President\u00a0Trump \u2014 said today is a new day, and the people are going to dictate what goes on from this point forward. I truly believe that\u2019s why he got elected.\u201d Read more: Analysis: Trump\u2019s short, dark and defiant inaugural address A secret swearing-in Demonstrations in Washington are nothing new, even during Inaugural celebrations.\u00a0Tens of thousands of marchers protested the Vietnam War during President Nixon's second inaugural, in 1973. At Woodrow Wilson's first inaugural, in 1913, suffragettes demanding the right for women to vote staged their own parade and were roughed up by police. In 1877, the official swearing-in of Rutherford Hayes was held in secret for fear that\u00a0supporters of Samuel Tilden, who had won the popular vote in a disputed election, might try to disrupt it. (There was a public ceremony the next day.) But the size of the protests in Washington and across the country Saturday were unprecedented, dwarfing the number of Americans who had gathered to cheer Trump into office. Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee, on ABC's This Week called Saturday's turnout \"an urgent plea for us all to sit down together.\" The broad reach and rapid pace of new technology and social media have made the crowds bigger and the conversation coarser. \"It's not enough to disagree with somebody else,\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said with dismay. \"You have to hate them.\" President Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters on Jan. 21, 2017, in Langley, Va. \u00a0(Photo: Pool, Getty Images) Trump didn't comment on the protesters Saturday during an appearance at the CIA , but on Sunday morning he posted a mocking tweet : \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Two hours later, he took a different tone on Twitter: \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.\" Some political veterans worry about the task of governing in a nation where battle lines are hardening. Even inside the White House, press secretary Sean Spicer at his first briefing accused reporters of trying to delegitimize the new president , inaccurately asserting that news stories had misrepresented the size of the Inaugural crowds. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday's Meet the Press said Spicer was presenting \"alternative facts,\" sparking a derisive Twitter meme. \"We've never had as many people who don't trust the media, don't trust the politicians, don't trust economics, don't trust business,\" Republican political consultant Frank Luntz said on CBS' Face the Nation. \"I think we're going to remember this weekend for a long time to come as not the end, not the campaign being over, but this is the beginning of the most tempestuous ... awful conflict between left and right, between men and women, between young and old.\" He warned, \"I think we\u00a0are breaking apart.\" Contributing: Kathleen Gray of the Detroit Free Press, Jason Noble of The Des Moines Register.\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Rhode Island Governor Looks to Pioneer Free Tuition for All By matt o'brien, associated press PROVIDENCE, R.I. \u0097 Jan 22, 2017, 12:37 PM ET 0 Shares Email A college-for-all idea that sparked Democratic voter enthusiasm during the presidential race could now be tested in the smallest state. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said she is pushing to make Rhode Island the first state to guarantee free access for every student who wants to go to college. The idea of expanding free public education beyond high school catapulted into the national discourse during Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ' Democratic presidential campaign, and is now being considered seriously by states including New York. \"As a country we have to start asking ourselves, 'Isn't it the right thing to do now?'\" Raimondo said in an interview Friday. \"What's the magic of 12th grade? Once upon a time , that's what you needed to get a job. Those days are long gone and vanishing quicker every day.\" At a cost she described as a $30 million \"drop in the bucket\" of Rhode Island's $9 billion budget, Raimondo's proposal would give in-state residents two years of free tuition at public colleges. Details were released Thursday when Raimondo submitted her annual spending plan to state lawmakers. It would need approval from the legislature, which has the nation's second-largest Democratic majority. Republican leaders are calling it another costly entitlement. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, who has prioritized tax cuts, called it a \"laudable goal\" but hasn't endorsed it. He said it will have to be vetted by a finance committee. News of the idea quickly spread among high school students and \"people are excited,\" said 18-year-old Rachel Berson, a senior at the suburban North Kingstown High School, which sends many graduates to the nearby University of Rhode Island. But while cost is a consideration for Berson and her family, so is her desire to study elsewhere. \"The reason I wanted to go out of the state is just for a new perspective, new experiences, just to learn a little bit more about the world,\" she said. Raimondo's program would cover a two-year education at the Community College of Rhode Island or the final two years of a 4-year-degree at the University of Rhode Island or Rhode Island College. By eliminating tuition for students in their junior and senior years, Raimondo said, the aim is to create an incentive to graduate on time. It's a proposal she said came out of conversations with university leaders and students who have had to drop out or delay their education because of financial burdens. \"It gives them an incentive that makes them want to come to the institutions, make sure they take the classes they need, perform well in those classes, and then, when for many families the financial pressures start to grow, the state is ready to step in with assistance,\" said David Dooley, president of the University of Rhode Island, who projects as much as a 20 percent spike in enrollment of state residents if the program rolls out. Raimondo said her staff spent months studying tuition-free college programs in states such as Tennessee and Georgia. Most are limited to community colleges. Georgia's more expansive merit-based scholarships have scaled back in recent years by excluding all but the top-ranking high school graduates. Raimondo said she wanted to avoid the \"unintended consequences\" of Georgia's high GPA requirement, which \"encouraged grade inflation and tended to veer folks into easier classes.\" Rhode Island's proposal also differs from one announced this month by Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for students from families making $125,000 a year or less. Raimondo didn't want an income cap that would exclude some middle-class families. Raimondo budgeted $10 million for the program's first year. Only $3 million of that would go directly to pay for students' tuition at Community College of Rhode Island, which costs about $4,000 a year to attend. It is a \"last-dollar\" scholarship that supplements what is not already covered by federal Pell Grants and other financial aid. More than half of the community college's students already attend classes for free. Another $6 million in the first year would invest in the state's higher education institutions to build teaching capacity and brace for a future influx. The program would later expand to $30 million annually once it includes students at Rhode Island College, which costs about $8,000 a year to attend, and the University of Rhode Island, which costs more than $12,000. Raimondo said a longer-term goal is halting the flight of skilled young people who find jobs and settle near the out-of-state colleges they attend. \"You will see more people consider URI and go to URI, graduate, and then stick around in Rhode Island,\" she said. 0 Shares ",

While aerial photos showed that Trump drew a smaller\u00a0crowd to his inaugural address than President Obama did, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Saturday : \"This\u00a0was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe.\" When Meet the Press host Chuck Todd described that claim as a \"falsehood,\" Conway said:\u00a0\"You're saying it's a falsehood and Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.\" Todd shot back, however:\u00a0\"Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods.\" \"I don't think you can prove those numbers one way or another. There's no way to really quantify crowds,\" Conway said. Read more: Posted!

Schumer said Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the bill, to be introduced this coming week, is in response to the possibility that the Trump administration could offer to lift sanctions against Russia in exchange for Russia's reducing its nuclear arms. The New York senator said such an exchange would be misguided. \"For us to repeal sanctions, given what Russia has done in Ukraine and threatened the Baltics, and now they have clearly tried to intervene in our election -- whether it had an effect or not -- that is something, that\u2019s a danger that we have never faced to this extent in American history. \u201cWe repeal sanctions, it tells Russia, 'Go ahead and interfere in our elections and do bad things;' it tells China; it tells Iran. That would be terrible,\u201d Schumer said. The Democratic senator added that Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham , both of whom have been vocal critics of some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric on Russia, support the bill. Schumer also criticized Trump's speech to the CIA on Saturday and his inaugural address the previous day. \"President Trump ought to realize, he's not campaigning anymore. He's president. And instead of talking about how many people showed up at his inauguration, he ought to be talking about how many people are going to stay in the middle class and move into the middle class,\" Schumer told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos . The senator said another thing that bothered him about Trump's inaugural speech , \"as much as sort of the narrowness of it and the darkness of America that he portrayed, was this -- I think he's trying to use populist rhetoric to cover up a right-wing agenda.\" \"If you look at this Cabinet, they are far from the populism that [Trump] talked about, people like [the nominee for health and human services secretary, Tom] Price, who want to end Medicare as we know it by privatizing it.\" ",

    "text": "View slideshow Updated at 6:10 p.m. ET As the Women's March on Washington has swelled in support, attracting attention and supporters in the lead-up to Saturday's demonstrations, its name has become something of a misnomer. Women's March Floods Washington, Sparking Rallies Worldwide Sister marches have been organized in all 50 states, several U.S. territories and countries around the world. They have tried to express solidarity with the aims of the original march: opposition to President Trump's agenda, and support of women's rights and human rights in general. Given the quirks of time zones, many of those marches kicked off before the event that inspired them. In Sydney, London, New Delhi, and other cities, demonstrators broke out their signs and pink hats before even their compatriots in D.C. could. Straight from NPR and member station reporters on the ground: Here's a glimpse of the marches Saturday \u2014 across the country, and around the world. Boston Tens of thousands participated in the Boston Women's March, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Marty Walsh (bottom right). Meredith Nierman/WGBH hide caption toggle caption Meredith Nierman/WGBH \"It is shoulder to shoulder\" in Boston Common, WBUR's Deborah Becker tells Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday. She describes the rally there as a \"sea of pink,\" referring to the pink knit caps that have become distinctive of the Women's March on Washington. The caps have come to be known as \"pussyhats,\" in reference to a tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women by grabbing their genitals. Deborah reports that the message of the Boston protesters is one of solidarity with the primary march in Washington. They bear signs not only protesting Trump, but supporting a range of issues \u2014 from climate science to women's access to abortion and birth control. Both Massachusetts senators, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, addressed the rally in Boston. \"I'm here to fight back!\" Warren told the crowd. \"We are in marches to say we are fighting back. That's who we are.\" Article continues after sponsorship Chicago Protesters make their way through Chicago during the city's women's march. John Gress/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption John Gress/Getty Images In what the Chicago Tribune is reporting to be the largest crowd outside of Washington , Chicagoans gathered at Grant Park on Saturday morning with plans for a rally, followed by a march. In the end, the march portion of the event was cancelled by the organizers when they determined there were too many people to march safely. \"Our march route is flooded. There is no safe way to march. We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhmer told the crowd, according to the Tribune. If participants were disappointed, they didn't show it. Organizer Liz Radford told the crowd, \"We called, and you came. We have flooded the march route. We have flooded Chicago.\" London Source: NPR Credit: Frank Langfitt Thousands marched through the British capital Saturday in what was billed as a women's march, but was ostensibly an anti-Trump rally. Marchers walked about 2 miles from the U.S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square to Trafalgar Square, within eyesight of Big Ben. The event ran for more than three hours and the size of the crowds easily dwarfed political rallies in the lead-up to last summer's Brexit vote here. As in other cities around the world, protesters carried signs criticizing America's 45th president. Many signs read \"We Shall Overcomb,\" referring to the U.S. president's signature hair-style. \"Trump Special Relationship? Just Say No,\" read others, referring to the historically close diplomatic ties between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Many in this cosmopolitan, multicultural city \u2014 which voted heavily against the U.K. leaving the European Union \u2014 were already upset by Trump's election in November. The president's \"America first\" inaugural speech only fueled alarm here. In Inaugural Address, Trump Decries 'Carnage' And Promises 'America First' A British software engineer named David said he watched the speech with officemates yesterday in stunned silence. \"It was a harrowing, chilling experience,\" David said, as he stood in front of London's National Gallery overlooking the rally in Trafalgar Square. \"The sense of nationalism and protectionism was there and there was quite a sinister undercurrent.\" David, who did not offer his last name, said he was disturbed by the insularity of the Trump's address, elements of which reminded him of the positions espoused by the political far-right here in the U.K. \"There is a movement in Britain called 'Britain first,' \" he said, \"which is a terrifying, horrible right-wing group.\" The march in London was among a number of anti-Trump rallies across Western Europe on Saturday, including cities such as Berlin, Paris, Belfast and Copenhagen. Los Angeles Participants hold signs as they wait for the start of the women's march in Los Angeles. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \"I've never seen so many people standing in one place in Los Angeles in my life, and that includes sold-out Dodger Stadium,\" NPR's Ina Jaffe tells Michel Martin on Weekend All Things Considered. As the demonstrators marched from one rally in Pershing Square to another rally outside City Hall, Ina says a single street could not contain all of them. Instead, marchers had to proceed down three parallel streets. Supporters there brought up LGBTQ rights, religious freedom and women's rights, Ina reports \u2014 including one marcher who held up a sign with a picture of Carrie Fisher, which read: \"A woman's place is in the resistance.\" New York City Thousands of participants converge on Dag Hammarskjold Plaza and Second Avenue during the women's march in New York City. NY Daily News via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption NY Daily News via Getty Images For a march fueled in part by dissatisfaction with President Trump, it seems only natural that the protesters finished their procession nearby Trump Tower on Saturday. WNYC reporter Sarah Hayley Barrett tweeted that marchers shut down whole stretches of Madison Avenue, as they spilled off the planned route and took alternate paths to Trump Tower. Shumita Basu, a producer with WNYC, noted that in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, where many of the protesters converged, the march was a \"sea of pink hats, signs.\" Raleigh, N.C. \"There's been a steady stream of marchers\" in the streets of downtown Raleigh, reports Jess Clark of member station WUNC. \"It spans the spectrum \u2014 protesters represent diverse issues, diverse backgrounds.\" She notes that she has seen men in baseball caps, women in hijabs and several people in those distinctive pink caps. \"The massive crowd has taken over the downtown area, shutting down several streets in the process,\" The Associated Press reports from Raleigh. The news service notes marches and rallies are taking place in cities across the state, including Charlotte and Asheville. Mexico City \u2014 Carrie Kahn (@ckahn) January 21, 2017 The march in Mexico City began at the U.S. Embassy and proceeded to the Angel of Independence monument. But, as NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, the march was so large, the crowd of demonstrators stretched from one landmark to the other. Carrie says the march comprised a mix of Americans and Mexicans, who appeared to be protesting Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto as much as President Trump. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has dismal approval ratings in his own country; a recent poll showed only 12 percent of Mexicans approve of the job he's doing. The chants \u2014 shouted in both Spanish and English \u2014 focused not only on the two leaders, but women's rights and gender equality, as well. Sioux Falls, S.D. \u2014 Kealey Bultena (@KealeySDPB) January 21, 2017 In Sioux Falls, the women's march has focused partly on American Indian rights, reports Kealey Bultena of South Dakota Public Broadcasting. Chants of \"Native lives matter\" rippled throughout the march. \"We want to protect Mother Earth, first of all, for the future generations and also we have our human rights as women,\" marcher Julia Brown Wolf told Kealey. Brown Wolf had traveled from the Crow Creek Indian Reservation for the demonstration. \"You know, we have to think in seven generations ahead.\" Kealey reports Brown Wolf marched with her granddaughters. \"She does not want them to face discrimination for being a woman or a Native American,\" Kealey says. Sydney Protesters demonstrate against President Trump in Sydney. Brook Mitchell/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brook Mitchell/Getty Images Demonstrators gathered in the city's Hyde Park carrying signs with slogans like \"Bridges not walls,\" and \"A woman's place is in the revolution.\" As protester Stef Vogt told The Sydney Morning Herald, \"We want to send a sign to the women in the U.S. that we're all in this together.\" But participants also say this isn't just about Trump. \"Women's rights are not about women,\" musician Amanda Palmer told a the marchers. \"They're about everyone. My son and husband are feminists.\" Buenos Aires, Argentina In Buenos Aires, American expats and locals held signs and wrote messages across their bodies as they gathered for a rally in support of the women's march. Local organizers echoed the guiding principle behind the march in Washington, D.C. \u2014 that \"Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights.\" New Delhi Indian women in New Delhi participate in a nationwide \"I Will Go Out\" march to raise questions about safe access for women and marginalized communities in public spaces across India. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images While some protests are principally marching to express solidarity with the demonstrators in the U.S., others are directly raising issues of misogyny on a more local level. In New Delhi, protesters carried signs reading \"I will go out,\" to protest sexual harassment in public spaces. Park City, Utah Crowds gather for the women's march on Main Street during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb hide caption toggle caption Rich Polk/Getty Images for IMDb Women's Marches Go Global: Postcards From Protests Around The World 1:25 Embed Embed <iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/510940708/511106148\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\"> The Sundance film festival is underway in the city, but women, men and children still stepped away to trudge down Main Street in the blustery snow. Many of the filmmakers and movie-lovers in Park City for the annual event came to protest Donald Trump's presidency and to defend women's rights. They chanted slogans such as \"Love Not Hate, Make America Great\" and \"We live in Trumpled Times.\" Then they rallied as the snow flurried around them, with comedian Chelsea Handler and actress Maria Bello among the speakers. Longtime activist Dolores Huerta, who's the subject of a documentary that premiered at the festival, led the crowd in chanting, \"Si se puede, Yes, we can.\" Jessica Williams, who stars in one of the feature films premiering at the festival, told the crowd that her ancestors fought for her to be where she is \u2014 to \"stand in the snow in front of a bunch of white people in Uggs.\" \"I grew up thinking (the) civil rights movement already happened,\" said Williams. \"This election is a wake up call. The silver lining is, we are here ... in literally 21 degrees supporting each other.\" And all the way from Baltimore, the Lethal Ladies of Bliss step team, featured in a new documentary premiering Saturday, roused the crowd with foot-stomping chants of resistance. Paradise Bay, Antarctica \u2014 linda zunas (@lindazunas) January 21, 2017 There were even \"marchers\" in Antarctica. Linda Zunas, a reseacher in a remote corner of the continent called Paradise Bay, told The Independent that she organized a group of 30 people with banners reading \"Penguins for peace\" and \"love from seven continents.\" ",

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence attend the National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral on Saturday. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images President Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Pence and Karen Pence continued a long inaugural tradition Saturday morning, attending a prayer service that was notable for the diversity of faith participants. While most who led prayers and offered readings at the service at the Washington National Cathedral were overwhelmingly evangelical , the long list of participants also included leaders from the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faiths. The service opened with a Navajo blessing. The inaugural prayer service is a tradition that began with President George Washington and was revived in 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt, continuing ever since. While Trump's team had reportedly asked there be no sermon \u2014 a break with past services \u2014 the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, who's the dean of the Cathedral, was pointed in his prayer by asking God to \"break down the walls that separate us.\" With President Trump in attendance, Dean of Washington National Cathedral prays for God to break down walls, take away arrogance pic.twitter.com/tigM6aikbd \u2014 CNN Religion (@CNNbelief) January 21, 2017 On Friday in a pre-inaugural service at St. John's Church , First Baptist Dallas Pastor Robert Jeffress \u2014 a vocal supporter of Trump throughout his campaign \u2014 preached a sermon that compared Trump to Nehemiah, who had worked to rebuild the crumbling walls around Jerusalem, much like the border wall Trump has proposed. Article continues after sponsorship \"You see, God is not against building walls!\" Jeffress said. Many of the prayers at Saturday's service asked God to provide wisdom and protection for President Trump and the country. A rabbi recited a reading in Hebrew while an imam delivered a prayer in Arabic. Sajid Tarar, a Trump supporter who also prayed at the Republican National Convention, read from the Quran. Trump has stirred up opposition among both faith groups. During the campaign, he proposed a ban on Muslims coming into the country and has talked about a need for surveillance at mosques in order to stop terrorism. And Trump's support among the so-called \"alt-right\" movement of white nationalists has alarmed many in the Jewish community. Several of the songs were patriotic ones, including \"My Country 'Tis Of Thee\" and \"America the Beautiful,\" and a choir from Liberty University, whose president Jerry Falwell Jr. was also a vocal Trump supporter, sang \"We've Come This Far By Faith.\" President Trump's children and their families were also in attendance, including Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a new White House adviser to Trump. The couple and their children are Orthodox Jews. Notable participants included Alveda King, an anti-abortion activist who is the niece of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of evangelist Billy Graham whose father Franklin Graham prayed during the inauguration ceremony.

(Photo: Sergei Grits, AP) The Syrian government of President Bashar Assad and the rebel militants working to oust him will begin the latest round of talks Monday aimed at solidifying a cease-fire and easing the humanitarian crisis that has dragged on for much of the six-year civil war. The talks\u00a0held in the Kazakhstan capital of Astana, if successful, could also lay the groundwork for a comprehensive political solution to the crisis. The two-day talks are led by Russia, Turkey\u00a0and Iran, the same nations that brokered the rickety cease-fire that began Dec. 30. The Trump administration declined an invitation\u00a0to the talks issued from\u00a0Russia, citing the \"demands of the transition,\u201d the State Department said.\u00a0However, the\u00a0U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan, George Krol,\u00a0will attend as an observer. Another round of talks, led by the United Nations, is\u00a0set to begin Feb. 8 in Geneva, and U.N.\u00a0envoy\u00a0Staffan de Mistura\u00a0is in Astana. Neither the cease-fire nor the Astana talks involve the Islamic State. Islamic State destroys more ancient monuments in Palmyra The opposition delegation, which arrived in Astana on Sunday, is made up of about a dozen rebel figures led by Mohammad Alloush, of of Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam). A\u00a0spokesman for the rebel delegation, Yahya al-Aridi,\u00a0said a firm truce is key to beginning work on long-term solutions. \u201cIf the other side doesn\u2019t care about stopping the bloodshed in Syria, and cares most about staying in power at the expense of Syrian blood \u2026 in that case, nothing will work,\u201d he told the Associated Press. The rebel delegation will lack representation from one key rebel group, Ahrar al-Sham, which said it is skipping Astana to protest cease-fire violations and ongoing Russian airstrikes.\u00a0Each side has accused the other of cease-fire violations.\u00a0Ahrar al-Sham said it would align with agreements made\u00a0by other rebel groups if they were \u201cin the interest of the nation.\u201d Alloush said the rebels also would press for\u00a0release of captives held by the Assad regime\u00a0and an end to regime sieges on opposition-held areas. Syrian\u00a0U.N. Ambassador Bashar\u00a0Ja'afari, an experienced negotiator also involved in the U.N.-sponsored talks, leads\u00a0Assad's delegation in Astana. The government's position has been strengthened by a wave of victories in recent months, including driving the last rebel holdouts from Syria's largest city, Aleppo. The regime's military upper hand could\u00a0bode well for Assad's future, as\u00a0U.S. demands for his ouster drift further from the headlines. The U.S. and Turkey have backed rebel forces fighting Assad's military and the Islamic State. But the U.S.-Turkish alliance has been bruised by the authoritarian practices of Turkish\u00a0President Tayyip Erdogan and Erdogan's ire at U.S. support for Kurdish forces fighting Assad. Turkey, long struggling against militant Kurdish separatists, considers Kurdish fighters terrorists. 2202 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kfG2js NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

About 200 students from 40 public high schools are enrolled in the program, which is currently recruiting \"diverse, academically motivated students\" from neighborhood schools. Of the 58 high school seniors in the class, at least 31 have been accepted to colleges and universities to date. \"We're really looking to be a resource for the students, and we try to work as much as we can with their schools to make sure that they're on track to be competitive for the colleges that they're going to apply to,\" said program director Cassandra Geiger. Launched in 2013, the program provides supplemental support services including tutoring, leadership training, academic and college counseling and family workshops. The academy will graduate its inaugural cohort of seniors this spring. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Northwestern alumnus, and Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro toured the facility Sunday and alongside students and parents. \"What they're doing is leveling the playing field \u2014 that no student's experiences and opportunities and dreams should be limited by their zip code, their background or their family's income,\" Emanuel said. \"And that is a tremendous statement by Northwestern.\" Previously located at Northwestern's Evanston campus, the program now is housed in space that was converted from student housing into a high-tech learning center.

(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Renita Washington, 16, a South Shore resident, joined the academy's inaugural class in spring 2014. A junior at Gary Comer College Prep, she plans to study early childhood education and teach women and gender studies in high school classrooms. \"I like the fact that I'm able to be myself and get that second piece of advice that I wouldn't get from my school \u2014 they're good with the college process, but they have hundreds of students to worry about, when Northwestern Academy only has so many students to worry about,\" Washington said. The academy is part of an ongoing effort from the elite university to create a wider pipeline to college for CPS students. Northwestern also recently launched a new partnership with Lake View High School to develop academic programming, professional development, and college and career training centered on Lake View's science, technology, engineering and math curriculum. In 2008, Northwestern only enrolled 28 CPS graduates as part of its freshman class. More than 100 CPS students enrolled this fall, university spokespeople said Sunday. ",

He was a member of the Royals\u2019 2015 World Series-winning team. Andy Marte #28 of the Arizona Diamondbacks makes a play on a bouncing ball during the fifth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates Close Norm Hall, Getty Images In a separate incident, also in the Dominican Republic, former MLB player Andy Marte was also killed in a car accident, reports\u00a0 CBSSports.com . He was 33. \u00a0\u00a0 Once a top prospect, Marte played parts of seven MLB seasons with the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians and Arizona Diamondbacks. Most recently, he played for the KT Wiz in the Korean Baseball Association. In a tragic coincidence, St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras , a friend of Ventura\u2019s, was also killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic in 2014. He was 22. During the 2014 World Series, Ventura started Game 6, just days after Taveras\u2019 death. Ventura paid tribute to Taveras, writing \u201cRIP O.T. #18\u201d on his cap.

Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. WATCH: pic.twitter.com/Ao005dQ13r \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017 If there is one video clip that describes the new reality for the political media \u2014 and for the truth \u2014 during the President Trump era, it is the one above. It's a discussion about White House press secretary Sean Spicer, on his first full day in that job, having taken to the podium and made easily disproved claims about the size of Trump's inauguration crowd. \u201cWhy put him out there for the very first time, in front of that podium, to utter a provable falsehood?\u201d Chuck Todd asked Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president . \u201cIt's a small thing, but the first time he confronts the public, it's a falsehood?\u201d After some tense back and forth, Conway offered this: Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. You're saying it's a falsehood, and they're giving \u2014 our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to that. But the point really is \u2014 At this point, a visibly exasperated Todd cut in. \u201cWait a minute. Alternative facts? Alternative facts? Four of the five facts he uttered . . . were just not true. Alternative facts are not facts; they're falsehoods.\u201d President Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer made public statements questioning the media on Saturday, Jan. 21. The following morning, Trump's White House team, his supporters and his opponents responded to the controversial day. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) \u201cFake news\u201d is so yesterday. \u201cAlternative facts\u201d is where it's at now. This, of course, isn't the first time the Trump team and its supporters have responded to journalists calling out their falsehoods by claiming the truth isn't so black and white or that it's not a big deal. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski offered this after the election , comparing Trump with a guy at the bar and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going to say things, and sometimes you don\u2019t have all the facts to back it up.\u201d That same week, pro-Trump CNN pundit Scottie Nell Hughes offered this on Diane Rehm's show: One thing that's been interesting this campaign season to watch is that people that say facts are facts \u2014 they're not really facts. Everybody has a way \u2014 it's kind of like looking at ratings or looking at a glass of half-full water. Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not true.\u00a0There's no such thing, unfortunately anymore, of facts. Hughes is not an official spokesman for the Trump team, but that last comment is basically what Conway is arguing today \u2014 that there are so many shades of gray that clear facts just don't really exist. This, of course, is a hugely cynical worldview. But it's about the only way the Trump team can fight back, given how questionable\u00a0 the new president's purported facts have been throughout his time as a politician . Whether you like Trump or not, it's demonstrably true that he says things that are easily proved false, over and over again. The question the media has regularly confronted is not whether Trump's facts are correct but whether to say he's deliberately lying or not. A memo is circulating on social media right now that claims to be from someone who worked in a past White House and tries to explain what the Trump team is doing. Re Spicer's lies, this is from someone who worked in a past administration. Important read. pic.twitter.com/XrjLJHRAGL \u2014 Anna Rascou\u00ebt-Paz (@rascouet) January 22, 2017 It's not clear where this memo came from, but no matter the provenance, it makes some good points. Trump himself has been using his own brand of the truth, which is often false, for months. And there was really no way that his administration wasn't going to have to deal with that same tendency during his presidency. On Saturday in Spicer's statement and now Sunday in Conway's interview, the two are attempting to set a precedent that says they don't recognize the concept of facts as the media has come to define them; they have their own \u201calternative facts\u201d and they'll rely on those. During a briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer accused members of the press on Saturday of \"deliberately false\" inaugural coverage. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) And as brazen as it is, it's likely to appeal to that one-third of Americans the memo describes as being Trump's base. Polls have regularly shown a large portion of Republicans are more apt to believe Trump's claims even if they are pretty patently false, as Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell wrote last month . It's a symptom of media distrust. The New York Times's Glenn Thrush tweeted this Saturday after Spicer's statement: Prediction: There will be a poll, out next week, that will show 70-80% of Trump supporters believing that Mall photos were fake news. \u2014 Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) January 21, 2017 Both \u201cfake news\u201d and the concept of \u201calternative facts\u201d are now cudgels in the effort to obfuscate when reporters point out that Trump and his team have their facts wrong.

During a phone call today, one of Trump's first with a foreign leader, Trump and Netanyahu discussed Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, according to the White House and the prime minister's office. They also touched on the U.S.-Israel relationship, ISIS \"and other radical Islamic terrorist groups,\" according to a statement from the White House. Trump also invited the Israeli prime minister to visit Washington in early February, according to the White House. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that a final date would be determined in the coming days. The call today was the third Trump has held with a foreign leader since Friday, according to the White House. He previously spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Saturday. British Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday -- which would be Trump's first meeting with a foreign leader -- and Pena Nieto is set to meet with Trump at the end of the month. Trump's call with Netanyahu comes as Israeli authorities today authorized building permits for 566 new homes in contested East Jerusalem, which Palestinians widely view as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Netanyahu and former President Barack Obama long had a frosty relationship, but Netanyahu has signaled he looked forward to working with Obama's successor. His office characterized their conversation today as \"very warm.\" \"There are many issues between us including the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the situation in Syria and the Iranian threat,\" Netanyahu tweeted today, before the call. \"Stopping the Iranian threat, and the threat reflected in the bad nuclear agreement with Iran, continues to be a supreme goal of Israel .\" The White House said, during the call, Trump \"emphasized that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Israel to make progress towards that goal.\" Trump has said he would move the United States' embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital, a move Palestinians and Israel's other Arab neighbors have warned could prove destructive to the peace process.

That was until the percussion of gunfire began. \"The driver was bleeding from the mouth,\" said Wojcik, who lives in the suburbs and spent the previous night out at various clubs in the city. Police later identified the driver as a 26-year-old man who was shot in the lip. \"It was blood over his whole face. It was so surreal,\" Wojcik said. Her\u00a0boyfriend, 30, was hit twice in the right calf. The front passenger, who police said was a 25-year-old man shot in the left shoulder, appeared to be in the worst condition of the three, Wojcik said.\u00a0 \u201cNo one screamed,\u201d Wojcik said. \u201cBut I was FaceTiming with my friend Robert, and he was freaking out.\u201d All three were taken to\u00a0Stroger Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized, police said. It was the second triple shooting of the morning Sunday. The\u00a0other happened\u00a0around 6:30 a.m.\u00a0 Hours later there was\u00a0another shooting with multiple victims, this one leaving\u00a0four people wounded at 12:15 p.m. in the 1800 block of West 63rd Street in the Englewood neighborhood. In all, 10 people were wounded in multiple-victim shootings within less than six hours Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon. \"We've had quite a few multiple-victim incidents this weekend,\" said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. There were six triple shootings from Friday afternoon to early Sunday afternoon, in addition to the quadruple shooting.\u00a0 The most seriously injured in the Englewood shooting was a 26-year-old man who suffered a gunshot wound to the right eye and was taken by a family member to St. Bernard Hospital before being transferred to Stroger Hospital in critical condition, police said. The others wounded were: Another 26-year-old man, shot in the right buttocks and left foot; a\u00a056-year-old woman, shot multiple times in the left leg; and a 48-year-old woman shot in the right hip. All three were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where their conditions were stabilized. The four were in a convenience store when they heard gunshots and ran outside, where four armed men or boys shot\u00a0them, police said. The four attackers got into a white sedan and fled the scene. No one was in custody. Earlier in an attack that only injured one victim, a\u00a0man was shot while driving along the 1100 block of North Lockwood Avenue about 11 a.m., police said.\u00a0 He was traveling north on Lockwood in a 2014 Ford Escape when someone opened fire on his vehicle. He was shot in his left shoulder, arm and ear before crashing his vehicle in the same block, causing his SUV to overturn.\u00a0 He was taken to Stroger, where he was listed in stable condition, officials said. No one\u00a0has been arrested in connection with the shooting and authorities continue to investigate.\u00a0 The shootings come as part of a particularly violent weekend in Chicago, with 29 people shot, three fatally, in a 24-hour period from Saturday to Sunday. From Friday to Saturday, one person was killed and 14 were wounded in shootings across the city.\u00a0 ",

Wade, even with a single Trump appointment to the court, but in the long run, with the possibility of a second or third Trump appointment, there is a substantial threat to the core of Roe v. Wade,\" Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, told NBC News. Weddington and abortion rights activists have seen threats to Roe before \u2014 including the 1992 Supreme Court decision Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey. While the case affirmed the basic findings in Roe, it gave states increased liberty to begin regulating abortion from the moment of conception, Carol Sanger, a law professor at Columbia University and author of \"About Abortion: Terminating Pregnancy in the 21st Century,\" told NBC News. \"That just opened the door to all legislators who wanted to pour out legislation,\" Sanger said, citing state laws such as mandatory waiting periods, ultrasounds for women seeking abortion and laws regulating fetal remains. But in June, the Supreme Court struck down one of the nation's toughest restrictions on abortion, a Texas law passed in 2013 that would have caused more than 75 percent of the state's clinics to shut down. \"I think the importance of that case is that the current majority on the court, including Justice Kennedy, is quite suspicious of these laws and unlikely to be receptive to them,\" Tushnet said. Pro-choice advocates gather outside the Supreme Court after the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt decision where justices weighed a case that imposes heavy restrictions on abortion clinics in Texas in Washington, on June 27, 2016. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA, file While a complete reversal of the Roe decision is unlikely in the near future, Tushnet and Sanger said, states could become emboldened to enact additional restrictions on abortion rights in a more conservative political climate. \"Roe doesn't have to be overturned to take us back to the good old bad days,\" Sanger said. Sanger said one alarming trend to watch is states banning abortions after 20 weeks. Nineteen states ban abortions at about 20-weeks post-fertilization, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with laws in effect in 16 of those states. \"The 20-week ban is so pernicious and not just because it's violating Roe,\" Sanger said, adding that she believes these bans violate the decision because a fetus is not viable at 20 weeks. Weddington said if abortion restrictions continue to increase, many women could face having to travel hundreds of miles and to different states to get an abortion. Play ",

By Glenn Kessler By Glenn Kessler January 22 at 11:40 AM Follow @GlennKesslerWP During a briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer accused members of the press on Saturday of \"deliberately false\" inaugural coverage. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe.\u201d \u2014White House press secretary Sean Spicer, remarks to reporters, Jan. 21, 2017 \u201cI looked out, the field was \u2014 it looked like a million, million and a half people.\u201d \u2014President Trump, remarks to the CIA, Jan. 21, 2017 It\u2019s rather remarkable that the Trump White House has decided to make easily disproved claims about the size of the inauguration crowd Friday. On the face of it, there is no reason Trump should have expected bigger crowds than Barack Obama drew in 2009 and 2013. The Washington area leans left. Trump\u00a0 earned only 4 percent of the vote in the District of Columbia. Among the areas served by the Washington Metro, Trump received 8 percent of the vote in Prince George\u2019s County, less than 15 percent of the vote in Montgomery County, less than 17 percent of the vote in Arlington County and less than 30 percent of the vote in Fairfax County. Trump may believe he heads a new national movement, but that movement does not exist in the D.C. metropolitan area. Given the animosity of the election, it\u2019s fair to say that Hillary Clinton voters were not motivated to attend his inauguration. Further, the political leanings of the surrounding area help explain why the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Saturday drew a substantially larger crowd. Nevertheless, let\u2019s examine how wrong these statements are. The Facts Spicer, in his tongue-lashing of reporters, offered little evidence to back up his claims \u2014 and what he did say was wrong. He did not respond to requests for additional information, either via Twitter or email. \u201cThis was the first time in our nation\u2019s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\u201d False. Floor coverings were first used in 2013 . It\u2019s actually astonishing a White House press secretary would get such a basic fact wrong in a prepared statement from the podium. A simple Google search would have helped.

From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people.\u201d Spicer appears to imagine that simply because a space can hold this many people, this many people attended the inauguration. But there is ample evidence that the crowd on Friday did not extend to the Washington Monument.

W @bterris #Inauguration #InaugurationDay2017 pic.twitter.com/hFChmRACCs \u2014 Gillian Brockell (@gbrockell) January 20, 2017 Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still, crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain, analyzed photographs and video taken of the Mall and its vicinity for the New York Times and concluded that about 160,000 people were in those areas in the hour before Trump\u2019s speech. By contrast, they said, at least 470,000 people were in those areas for the Women\u2019s March as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, the time of the march\u2019s peak density. Crowd estimates, of course, are not definitive. Both Friday and Saturday were overcast, meaning no satellite images are available. Satellite images would certainly provide consistent perspective. From Trump\u2019s perspective at the Capitol, the crowd must have looked massive. But other images, extending over the Mall to the Capitol, clearly show fewer people than at Obama\u2019s inaugurations. In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million people attended Obama\u2019s first inauguration. In 2013, the number attending Obama\u2019s\u00a0second was estimated at 1 million, making that the third largest. About 1.2 million people are believed to have attended the swearing-in of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. A combination photo showing, at left, the 2009 inauguration (Emily Barnes/Getty Images) and at right, the 2017\u00a0inauguration (Lucas Jackson/ Reuters) \u201cWe know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama\u2019s last inaugural.\u201d This is also false. The actual numbers are 783,000 trips for Obama in 2013 \u2014 double Spicer\u2019s figure \u2014 and 571,000 for Trump in 2017. There were 1.1 million trips for Obama in 2009, the biggest day in Metro\u2019s history. The number for Trump is actually lower than the average weekday ridership of 639,000 trips. Again, we must emphasize that Spicer provided these numbers as part of a prepared statement. There is simply no excuse for such a basic failure to do due diligence in double-checking facts. What was the second biggest day in Metro\u2019s history? Jan. 21, 2017, for the Women\u2019s March. BREAKING: Jan. 21, 2017, was the second-busiest day in Metro history, with 1,001,613 trips. #wmata \u2014 Faiz Siddiqui (@faizsays) January 22, 2017 \u201cThis was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\u201d This also appears to be a false claim. The Secret Service denied the use of magnetometers to reporters. A USSS spokesperson tells us no magnetometers were used on the National Mall for Trump's inauguration. \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) January 22, 2017 According to two senior law enforcement officials, magnetometers WERE NOT USED in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall. \u2014 Michael S. Schmidt (@nytmike) January 22, 2017 In any case, our colleagues at PolitiFact said that a 2017 Congressional Research Service report noted the use of magnetometers in previous inaugurations. Also, even if magnetometers were on the Mall, this does not explain the sparse crowds for the parade. Trump today: \"We had a massive field of people. You saw them. Packed.\" \u2014 Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) January 21, 2017 \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe.\u201d This was Spicer\u2019s summing-up statement. As seen above, his previous claims leading up to this sentence were false, so it already lacks credibility. The \u201cin person\u201d claim is simply wrong. But there is no explanation for why he believes the audience was the largest ever around the globe. We have not seen global data, but in terms of U.S. television viewers, Trump already falls short. According to the preliminary data from Nielsen for inauguration coverage, 30.6 million television viewers in the United States watched Trump\u2019s swearing-in, 19 percent below the audience of 37.8 million for Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration. The record-holder for an inauguration TV audience remains Ronald Reagan, who attracted 41.8 million viewers in 1981. We will update this as more data comes in, including viewership via live streams. The Pinocchio Test This is an appalling performance by the new press secretary. He managed to make a series of false and misleading claims in service of a relatively minor issue. Presumably he was ordered to do this by Trump, who conjured up fantastic numbers in his own mind, but part of a flack\u2019s job is to tell the boss when lies are necessary \u2014 and when they are not.

    "text": "\u2014 Mark Zohar (@markzohar) January 22, 2017 For those who missed it, Spicer graced the lectern of the White House briefing room on Saturday to dispute the mainstream media's efforts \u201cto minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the Mall\" during Trump's inauguration. Metal detectors slowed people's arrival to the mall, he said. White floor coverings used for the first time highlighted empty spaces, making it look as though fewer people had showed up. And the \u201creckless\" media put out a false narrative playing down how many came out to support Trump. His key point: \u201cNo one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the Mall, does not put any out.\" Spicer then goes on to list a few numbers that back up his assertion that Friday's crowd \u201cwas the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" President Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer made public statements questioning the media on Saturday, Jan. 21. The following morning, Trump's White House team, his supporters and his opponents responded to the controversial day. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) [ Kellyanne Conway says Donald Trump\u2019s team has \u2018alternative facts.\u2019 Which pretty much says it all. ] That touched off a brief flurry to determine whether Spicer had spoken correctly. For example, crowd estimates can be fuzzy, but Metro keeps count of every person who uses a Metro card to hop onto a train \u2014 and Spicer mentioned Metro numbers in his remarks. According to Metro, Friday's ridership was the lowest in at least two presidential inaugurations. As The Post's Luz Lazo reported ,\u00a0570,557 people took trips in the system between its early 4 a.m. Friday opening through its midnight closing.\u00a0The figures are significantly lower than those from the 2009 and 2013 inaugurations of former president Barack Obama: 1.1 million trips in 2009 and 782,000 in 2013, according to Metro. And The Post's Fact Checker gave Spicer Four Pinocchios, adding \u201c we wish we could give five ,\" after examining his other statements. After his remarks on Saturday, Spicer refused to take questions and strode off the stage, apparently unaware that he had just become a meme. \"The rebels didn't blow up the Death Star.

Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to President Donald Trump, prepares to appear on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" from the north lawn at the White House\u00a0on Jan. 22, 2017. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) John Wagner, Cleve R. Wootson Jr.The Washington Post Kellyanne Conway , a senior aide to President Donald Trump , said Sunday that he has no plans to release his tax returns, a marked shift from Trump's pledge during the campaign to make them public once an audit was completed. \" The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns,\" said Conway, counselor to the president, during an appearance on ABC 's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" \"We litigated this all through the election. \"People didn't care,\" Conway added. \"They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are -- are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like.\" Presidents are not required to release their tax returns, but presidents dating back to Richard Nixon have routinely voluntarily done so. A Washington Post-ABC poll last week showed that Trump's continued refusal to release his tax returns continues to be an unpopular decision, with 74 percent of Americans saying he should make the documents public, including 53 percent of Republicans. Conway was questioned about a petition page on the White House website that allows citizens to ask government officials to take up issues of importance to them. Under former President Barack Obama , the White House would note any actions related to petitions that garnered more than 100,000 signatures online. Former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson 's bid to be the next secretary of state received a major boost Sunday when a pair of Republican senators who had expressed consternation about him announced they will vote to confirm him, a move that effectively clears the way for him to win confirmation. ... Former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson 's bid to be the next secretary of state received a major boost Sunday when a pair of Republican senators who had expressed consternation about him announced they will vote to confirm him, a move that effectively clears the way for him to win confirmation. ... (Sean Sullivan) As of Sunday morning, a petition for Trump to immediately release his tax returns had received more than 200,000 signatures. One petition asks the administration to \"immediately release Donald Trump's full tax returns\" and says it wants Trump to not be in conflict with the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Less than a day after the petition was started, it eclipsed the 100,000-signature mark -- enough to elicit an official response. There were a handful of petitions this weekend. Another petition on the site is also about Trump's money, demanding he \"divest or put in a blind trust all of the President's business and financial assets.\" One asked Trump to resign. Another sought the repeal of the National Firearms Act, removing restrictions on gun ownership. Oh, and some people want farmers to be able to grow hemp. The most popular petition, about the tax returns, says that \"unprecedented economic conflicts of this administration need to be visible to the American people.\" It seeks documentation about \"foreign influences and financial interests which may put Donald Trump in conflict with the emoluments clause of the Constitution.\" The clause prohibits a president from accepting a gift or a benefit from a foreign leader. It was drafted by the Founding Fathers to prevent the leaders of the fledgling United States from being under the financial thumb of a foreign country like France or England. But Trump's critics say the billionaire businessman was violating the Constitution the moment he swore an oath to protect and defend it. Ron Fein, the legal director at Free Speech for People, told The Washington Post's Matea Gold that there are several examples of Trump violating the emoluments clause, including rent paid by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China for its space in Trump Tower in New York and spending by foreign diplomats at the Trump properties, including his hotel in Washington, a few blocks from his new home. Trump has said he would donate profits from foreign business clients to the U.S. Treasury, although he hasn't said exactly how he'd track, collect and disburse such payments, according to Gold. And even if he's found to be in violation of the emoluments clause, it is unclear whether a violation of it qualifies as \"treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" that could lead to Trump's impeachment. Trump's refusal to release his tax returns became a heated issue on the campaign trail. On Jan. 11, during Trump's first official news conference since winning the election, he continued to resist suggestions to release the returns. \"The only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters,\" Trump said. \"You learn very little from a tax return.\" During the campaign and since then, Democrats consistently criticized Trump for not releasing his returns, saying that information was needed to evaluate conflicts that might be posed by his vast business holdings. \"You know full well that Trump -- President Trump and his family are complying with all the ethical rules, everything they need to do to step away from his businesses and be a full-time president,\" said Conway, who previously served as Trump's campaign manager. On NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, Conway said that White House press secretary Sean Spicer had presented \"alternative facts\" on Saturday when he falsely stated that Trump's swearing-in ceremony drew \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.\" Spicer made that claim during a late Saturday afternoon briefing, in which he scolded reporters for trying to \"lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration\" by deliberately reporting numbers that were lower than the White House believed. The National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, where crowds gather for the swearing-in ceremonies, does not release crowd estimates. But photographs and other means make clear that Trump's crowd was far smaller than the 1.8 million people that Obama's first inauguration was estimated to have attracted in 2009. Television ratings released by Nielsen on Saturday also showed a smaller audience for Trump than for Obama in 2009. Confronted by \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd about Spicer's characterization, Conway responded by saying: \"You're saying it's a falsehood, and Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that.\" Conway later backtracked and said there was no way to know which audience was larger. \"I don't think you can prove those numbers one way or another,\" she told Todd. \" There's no way to quantify crowd numbers.\" The Washington Post ",

The incident began when two suspects tried to rob a Kay Jewelers store at Rolling Oaks Mall, according to San Antonio police. One person tried to intervene and was shot and killed by one of the suspects, police said. Another person shot that suspect, and the second suspect fled through the mall, shooting several other people, police said. The suspect who was shot is in custody, but the other was still at large this evening, police said. Officials said besides the person who was shot trying to intervene in the attempted robbery, three others were also shot and taken to SAMC and were in unknown condition. Two others were also taken to the hospital: one woman with chest pains and another with labor pains, officials said. This is a developing story. Check back for more. 0 Shares ",

Four people died in the storm. John Fitzhugh/Biloxi Sun Herald/TNS via Getty Images Overnight in southern Georgia, near the border with Florida, severe weather turned deadly. At least 11 people were killed and 23 more were injured as the area was racked with storms, according to local officials. Now, Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency Sunday morning for seven counties in the state. \"These storms have devastated communities and homes in South Central Georgia, and the state is making all resources available to the impacted areas,\" Deal said in a statement. Deal continued: \"I urge all Georgians to exercise caution and vigilance in order to remain safe and prevent further loss of life or injuries.\" In his opening remarks at a Sunday swearing-in ceremony for senior White House staff, President Trump said that he had spoken with Deal earlier in the day. He had expressed his \"sincere condolences for the lives taken,\" Trump said, adding that people in Georgia have \"suffered greatly\" from the storms. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency has also issued a warning that there is \"a HIGH RISK for severe weather\" for much of the state Sunday. Article continues after sponsorship The deaths overnight in southern Georgia occurred in Cook, Brooks and Berrien counties, according to Catherine Howden of the GEMA. National Weather Service Atlanta had issued a flash flood watch and a tornado watch in the region Saturday, but officials could not clarify further whether tornadoes were to blame for the loss of life overnight. This is not the first time the weather turned deadly in the Southeast this weekend. As WABE's Elly Yu reports, at least four people died when a tornado swept through southern Mississippi. Multiple structures damaged in downtown Hattiesburg. #mswx pic.twitter.com/6E9dE3eyzY That predawn tornado had winds above 136 miles per hour, according to The Associated Press .

Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt would be a lot of fun to watch,\u201d he said of the lawsuit, \u201cbut I imagine it will be kicked out.\u201d Mr. Eisen said the legal team intended to use the lawsuit to try to get a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s federal tax returns, which are needed to properly assess what income or other payments or loans Mr. Trump has received from foreign governments. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is a liberal group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which until recently was controlled by David Brock, a Democratic Party operative and fervent supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Eisen now serves as chairman of the organization\u2019s board, and Mr. Painter is vice chairman. The lawsuit may run into trouble, other legal experts said, given that CREW, as the organization is known, must demonstrate that it would suffer direct and concrete injury to give it standing to sue. The group says it has suffered harm by having to divert resources from other work to monitor and respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s activities. For example, the group said, it has answered hundreds of questions from news organizations. In a 1982 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a civil rights organization had standing to sue because its use of black \u201ctesters\u201d to see whether landlords and home sellers were abiding by federal law had hurt its ability to conduct other activities. But in recent decades, and outside the context of civil rights violations, the court has often been skeptical of broad assertions of standing. Regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s fate, it is just the first hint of the legal assault that the Trump administration will face. Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , said it was separately looking for plaintiffs to file a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause. It hopes to find a hotel or bed-and-breakfast that might compete against a Trump hotel as a party that might have standing to sue. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The A.C.L.U. filed an extensive Freedom of Information Act request on Thursday asking the Justice Department, the General Services Administration and the Office of Government Ethics for all legal opinions and memos they have prepared addressing potential financial or ethical conflicts that Mr. Trump might face. It could perhaps use those documents in litigation against the Trump administration. CREW separately filed a complaint with the General Services Administration on Friday over a provision that appears to prohibit the leasing of the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to an elected federal official. The building is the site of Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel. Perhaps more important, the legal groups said they may challenge executive actions Mr. Trump is expected to take on topics like international trade deals, illegal immigration and climate change. ",

(Jan. 22) AP Storm damage is seen at South Georgia Motorsports Park in Cecil, Ga., on Jan. 22, 2017. (Photo: Brendan Farrington, AP) A series\u00a0of furious storms roared through the Southeast on\u00a0Sunday, killing at least 12 people in Georgia, splintering homes and toppling trees and power lines in the\u00a0path. The Georgia tragedies pushed the two-day death toll from a wall of storms and tornadoes to 16. Four people died Saturday in southern Mississippi, when a tornado left a trail of devastation in and around Hattiesburg. On Sunday, damaging storms were reported from South Carolina to northern Florida. The National Weather Service said late Sunday afternoon that a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located about 21 miles north of Carrabelle, Fla., on the state's Gulf Coast, about 50 miles southwest of Tallahassee. The storm was moving northeast at 55 mph, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. A tornado watch for 30 counties in north and central Florida was extended until 8 p.m. In south central Georgia,\u00a0Karen Moore survived when an apparent tornado destroyed a swath of the Sunshine Acres Mobile Home Park in the Cook County seat of Adel. She said the storm woke her up before dawn Sunday. \"It sounded like a freight train coming through, and I told my husband that is no train, that is a tornado.\" Moore said.\u00a0\"There was rubble everywhere. ... It took out five trailers, double-wides, I mean, it just turned them.\" Eight people were killed in Cook County and two each in Brooks and Berrien counties,\u00a0the Georgia Emergency Management Agency reported. Spokeswoman Catherine Howden said at least 23 people were injured. The numbers could rise. \"We are working with the local officials to assess the situation,\" she told USA TODAY. \"This is ongoing.\" Debra Buckholts, who lives just outside Adel, said she feared for the safety of her friends in Sunshine Acres. Closed roads, power outages and spotty cellphone service have made it difficult to check on friends and loved ones. \"Half the trailers aren't there anymore,\" Buckholts said. \"There is nothing left of them.\" @weatherchannel Adel in Cook County GA has extensive damage. A mobile home park is destroyed with at least 15 deaths. pic.twitter.com/hjTPrtavDQ \u2014 Lauri Hartley (@laurihartley) January 22, 2017 Gov. Nathan Deal declared a week-long state of emergency for seven Georgia counties. He said the area could be increased as responders assess the damage. He added that \"all indications suggest\" a request would be made for federal assistance, as well. \u201cThese storms have devastated communities and homes in south central Georgia, and the state is making all resources available,\u201d Deal said. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Georgians suffering from the storm\u2019s impact.\" Florida State issued an alert for it students on the Tallahassee campus. *FSU ALERT!* SEVERE THUNDERSTORM! Main Campus - Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows,\" the school tweeted. As night fell, the danger across the region was far from finished. The National Weather Service forecast a possible\u00a0\"major severe weather outbreak\" in parts of the South into early Monday. Tornado rips through southern Mississippi, leaving 4 dead Howden said all the Georgia\u00a0deaths were related to severe weather, but it was not immediately clear whether\u00a0tornadoes had touched down in the area. Patrick Marsh, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center,\u00a0said,\u00a0\"In all likelihood it appears that these were tornadoes.\" In Mississippi on Saturday, at least an EF3 tornado tore through the Hattiesburg area with wind gusts estimated from\u00a0136 mph to\u00a0165 mph, according to preliminary reports from the weather service. The tornado touched down about 4 a.m., leaving extensive damage for several blocks. The streets were littered with toppled tress and power lines, and thousands of homes and businesses were without power. \"The total debris cleanup will be weeks at this point,\" said\u00a0Lee Smithson, executive\u00a0director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, having declared post-inaugural Monday the true opening day of his new administration, spent Sunday pondering a string of executive orders on topics ranging from immigration to Israel to the economy, including what he called a re-working of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Supervising the swearing-in of 30 new White House staff members, Trump said he will soon meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss changes to NAFTA, the trade deal he claims has shipped U.S. jobs to those other countries. \"We will start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA. Anyone ever\u00a0hear of NAFTA? I ran a campaign somewhat based on NAFTA,\" he said. \"Mexico has been terrific, actually, and the president has been really quite amazing.\" Two days after his inauguration, Trump also spoke with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the Situation Room, and prepared to meet with\u00a0law enforcement and first responders who worked during the inaugural weekend. Trump said his conversation with Netanyahu was \"very nice,\"\u00a0 but declined to elaborate. The White House later said the two men discussed Iran, the Islamic State, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and that Trump invited Netanyahu to Washington in February. Netanyahu said he accepted. Not mentioned in the White House summary of the call: A possible plan to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump had pledged to do so during his campaign \u2014 bucking 20 years of precedent by Democratic and Republican presidents \u2014 although press secretary Sean Spicer said the White House was \"at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject.\" The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995\u00a0requires the president to move the embassy to Jerusalem unless he certifies every six months that it's not in the national interest. Every president since Bill Clinton has done so, including President Obama most recently last Dec. 1\u00a0\u2014 giving Trump until the end of May to make a formal decision. Read more: ",

Around 6:30 a.m., there was another triple shooting, officials said. \u00a0 \"We've had quite a few multiple-victim incidents this weekend,\" said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago police spokesman. He said no details about the age, sex or injuries were available in the city's most recent multiple-victim incident.\u00a0 Police unspooled red crime scene tape to rope off a stretch of well-kept brownstones and modernized condos in the 1500 block of West Huron Street, after dozens of 911 calls came in reporting shots fired. The driver, a 26-year-old man, was shot in the lip; a 30-year-old man was hit twice in the right calf. The front passenger, who police said was a 25-year-old man, was shot in the left shoulder.\u00a0All three were taken to\u00a0Stroger Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized, police said. Investigators looked through a white minivan with two apparent bullet holes in the side door and the rear quarter-panel while neighbors hesitantly peeked out of their windows and doorways. Luis Rodriguez, 42, who lives a block away, looked out of his window after hearing gunfire. \"I heard four shots, bam-bam-bam-bam,\" he said. Rodriguez, who has lived in the neighborhood for five years, said the area has a lingering problem with gangs, which has come as a surprise to some of the people who moved into the new developments. \"The house on the corner over there has to repaint every year because they tag it 'SD'\" Rodriguez said, in reference to the Satan Disciples. \"These guys who just moved into these new condos have no idea what's going on,\" he added, as a pregnant woman on the first floor of a building inside the crime scene drew her shades. After experiencing the most deadly year in two decades, Chicagoans like Rodriguez, who is considering buying a bullet-proof vest for personal safety, are disheartened at the violent start of 2017. \"It's not even summer yet and it's only gonna get worse,\" he said. The triple shooting was the second in\u00a0less than three hours, officials said. Three people were shot about 6:30 a.m. Sunday in the 3500 block of South Rhodes Avenue in the Ida B. Wells/Darrow Homes neighborhood. A 22-year-old man was shot in the left leg and was taken by a friend to Mercy Hospital. He was later transferred to Stroger Hospital, where his condition was stabilized. A 24-year-old man was shot in the left leg, and his condition was stabilized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. A 23-year-old woman was shot in the leg, and her condition was stabilized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Estrada said\u00a0there have been a number of triple shootings recently, but it isn't easy to pinpoint exactly why. \"Usually it happens when there's a group all together,\" he said. \"It's one target, and they're firing indiscriminately.\" In East Garfield Park, a 23-year-old man was fatally shot Saturday while he was inside a parked car in the first block of North Sacramento Boulevard, police said. About 11:15 p.m., someone inside a car fired shots at him, wounding him in the left thigh. He was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Hospital. Shortly before 4:55 p.m., a 21-year-old man was shot in the first block of West 104th Place in the Roseland neighborhood. Tremayne Henderson, who lived on the block where the shooting took place, was approached by someone who shot him in the chest. He was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ Medical Center, and he was later pronounced dead at 9:16 p.m., officials said.\u00a0 Earlier Saturday, a 24-year-old man was fatally shot in the Near West Side neighborhood about 1:45 p.m. in the 2600 block of West Monroe Street, police said. According to\u00a0preliminary reports, a 24-year-old man was sitting inside a vehicle when someone approached and shot him in the neck, police said. He was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The man was later identified as Jacob Norwood, of the 800 block of South Karlov Avenue. He was pronounced dead at 2:09 p.m.\u00a0after suffering multiple gunshot wounds, the Cook County medical examiner's office determined Sunday following an autopsy. Two teens were wounded in a shooting about 4:25 a.m. in the East Garfield Park neighborhood.\u00a0 A 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy were standing in the 700 block of North Hamlin Avenue when someone inside a black SUV opened fire, wounding the older teen in the abdomen and the 15-year-old boy in the left shoulder.\u00a0 The 17-year-old boy was in serious condition at Stroger Hospital, and the 15-year-old boy's condition was stabilized at the same hospital.\u00a0 Other shootings: In South Austin, a 27-year-old man was shot in the abdomen and left leg about 3:40 a.m. Sunday in the 500 block of South Central Avenue, police said.

His condition was stabilized at Advocate Christ Medical Center.\u00a0 Just before 2:50 a.m., a 23-year-old man was shot in the back of the head while he was in a car in the 6500 block of West Irving Park Road in the Dunning neighborhood.

He was shot in both legs and abdomen. His condition was stabilized at Presence St. Francis Hospital.\u00a0 In the East Garfield Park neighborhood, a 26-year-old man was wounded in a drive-by shooting about 10:45 p.m. Saturday, police said. He was standing in the 600 block of North St. Louis Avenue when someone inside a passing black SUV opened fire, wounding him in the right leg. He was taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai Hospital.\u00a0 A 27-year-old man was seriously wounded after he was shot in the abdomen. About 9:40 p.m., officers heard gunfire and found the man on the ground in the 3300 block of West Monroe Street in the Fifth City neighborhood on the West Side. He was taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai Hospital.\u00a0 Two people were shot about 9:10 p.m. while they were walking in the 7900 block of South Woodlawn Avenue in the Grand Crossing neighborhood. The shooter got out of a car and fired toward the pair. An 18-year-old man was shot in the right arm and a 20-year-old woman was shot in the left hand. Both were taken in good condition to Jackson Park Hospital.\u00a0 A 17-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man were shot just before 8:10 p.m. in the 300 block of South California Avenue in the East Garfield Park neighborhood. They were walking out of an alley when someone inside a dark-colored car opened fire. The 22-year-old man was shot in the neck, and he was taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai Hospital. The teen was shot in the back, and he was in good condition at Mount Sinai Hospital. Just before 7:40 p.m., a 19-year-old woman was shot in the chest as she was leaving a business in the 7900 block of South Exchange Avenue in South Chicago. The shooter was inside a vehicle, and police do not believe the woman was the intended target. She was in critical condition at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.\u00a0 Three people were wounded in a drive-by shooting about 5:15 p.m. in the 1300 block of North Mayfield Avenue in the Austin neighborhood.

About 2:25 p.m., a 27-year-old man was shot in the 4400 block of West Maypole Avenue in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. He was shot in the leg and was taken in fair condition to Mount Sinai Hospital. About 11:35 a.m., a 24-year-old man was shot while he was driving in the first\u00a0block of West 69th Street in the city's Englewood neighborhood, police said. He pulled over after traveling a short distance to check his vehicle for damage and then noticed he had been shot in the right knee, Estrada said. Officers who were called to the scene said the victim suffered a wound to the knee, but he refused treatment, Estrada said. No one was in custody for any of the shootings, and police were investigating. ",

By Liz Sly By Liz Sly January 22 at 10:00 AM Follow @LizSly ASTANA, Kazakhstan \u2014 At a time of widespread global anxiety about President Trump\u2019s foreign policy goals, the Middle East stands almost alone in its optimism about his presidency. The United States\u2019 traditional Arab allies are hoping he reengages in the region after years of what they perceive as neglect by Barack Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. rivals are hoping he becomes an ally and aligns with their interests. But after eight years of steady disengagement by his predecessor, Trump may find his room for maneuver constrained by the expanded influence of Russia and Iran , analysts say. \u201cEven if Trump wants to have a more assertive policy, he will not be able to bring America back as the strongest regional player,\u201d predicted Ibrahim Hamidi, the chief diplomatic correspondent of the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat. \u201cThe Americans can\u2019t go back to being the only super\u00adpower anymore.\u201d That Trump does intend to pursue a more assertive Middle East policy has been evident from some of the more consistent of his often contradictory statements, including his inauguration pledge to eradicate what he called \u201cradical Islamic terrorism . . . from the face of the earth.\u201d Although the president and some of his foreign policy nominees appear to have opposing views on some issues \u2014 such as the importance of NATO and whether Russia can be trusted \u2014 they seem to agree on the need to do more to fight the Islamic State and to push back against Iran\u2019s widening influence, making the Middle East one of the few areas on which there appears to be some level of foreign policy consensus. [ As Obama leaves the world stage: Criticism, nostalgia \u2014 and concern over his successor ] It is also one of the areas where the Obama administration\u2019s policies have most noticeably eroded the once unchallenged U.S. role. Russia now holds sway in Syria, has forged a close relationship with Turkey that could threaten Ankara\u2019s ties with NATO and has been courting traditional U.S. allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Most recently, Russia has been exploring relationships in Libya, dispatching its aircraft carrier to the waters off Libya and inviting the erstwhile U.S. ally Khalifa Hifter on board for a video conference with the Russian defense minister this month. Trump\u2019s repeated promises to forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin could facilitate the kind of alliance in the Middle East against terrorists that the Obama administration sought but failed to achieve, said Vladimir Frolov, a columnist with the Moscow Times. But Russia would not want such an alliance to come at the expense of the role it has already carved out for itself in the region. \u201cThe U.S. has been exiting the Middle East under Obama for a while, and with Trump talking about an America First agenda, that creates even more opportunities for Russia to fill the vacuum. We may see a situation where the U.S. actually empowers Russia to do the dirty work in the Middle East,\u201d he said. The constraints are most immediately apparent in Syria, where Russia has taken the lead in promoting a peace initiative that includes Turkey and Iran as co-sponsors but offers no role for the United States. Russia and Turkey have coordinated the agenda and preparatory negotiations for the talks that will begin Monday in Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, Astana, Western diplomats say. Turkish, Russian and Iranian officials, U.N. and European diplomats, Syrian rebels and representatives of the Syrian government arrived in Astana for the talks on Sunday. The Trump administration will not be sending a delegation, and instead the United States will be represented by its ambassador in Kazakhstan. Russia will welcome offers of help from Trump to bomb terrorists and perhaps provide funding for reconstruction, but it doesn\u2019t want the United States becoming involved in crafting the terms of a settlement, Frolov said. The Syrian regime is also unlikely to want the United States playing any significant role in the country, which has a long history of fraught relations with Washington, said Salem Zahran, a Beirut-based media entrepreneur who runs media outlets in Syria and has close ties to the Syrian regime. Trump\u2019s statements in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have come as a relief to the Syrian government, signaling an end to the Obama administration\u2019s mantra that Assad should eventually step aside, Zahran said. But the Syrian regime is hoping mostly that the United States stays away, by halting support for the rebels, lifting sanctions and ceasing the calls for Assad to be removed. \u201cTrump is a businessman and if Syria were a company, he would see it as a losing company. Why would anyone invest in a losing company?\u201d Zahran asked. \u201cSyria just wants Trump to be neutral,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that they have Russia, they don\u2019t need America.\u201d [ Iran nuclear deal may not survive the Trump administration ] Iran has more reason to fear the tough anti-Iranian rhetoric that has emanated both from Trump and his foreign policy nominees. But any attempt to push back against Iran would contradict the goals of allying more closely with Russia and Syria \u2014 which are, at least nominally, allied with Iran \u2014 and also run the risk of confrontation. \u201cWhy would Iran respond to anything other than military pressure?\u201d asked Tobias Schneider, a German analyst based in Washington. \u201cIran has won right now. It\u2019s represented everywhere; it\u2019s aligned with the winners everywhere.\u201d Iran has been instrumental in helping Assad survive, sending money and militias to fight on the front lines and securing in the process vast influence over the country. Last week, Tehran signed a series of contracts with Syrian government officials that included giving Iran control over Syria\u2019s largest phosphate mine and a license to operate a mobile telecommunications network. Since the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, Iran has also secured its place as the most influential power in Iraq, said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq who is now with Texas A&M University. Reviving the U.S. role there would not be impossible, he said, but \u201cit would be very, very difficult.\u201d The United States does have staunch allies. Israel is counting on Trump to fulfill his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, which has made Palestinians one of the only groups vociferously opposed to his presidency. The Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria are hoping his pledges to fight the Islamic State will translate into more military assistance for them. [ After a slow and bloody fight against ISIS, Iraqi forces pick up the pace in Mosul ] The United States also still holds important levers in the Middle East, notably its big military presence in the Persian Gulf and its economic might, neither of which Russia can match, said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia that blame Obama for the rising power of Iran are looking forward to an administration that might more closely mirror their priorities, he said. \u201cThe Gulf states need the United States as a counterbalance to Iran. You need to reestablish confidence that you are really going to back your allies,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that needs radical change, but it does need a steady, patient, consistent effort.\u201d But whether Trump is a leader who will provide patience and consistency is a concern for some in the region, Hamidi said. \u201cThe scary thing is that to pave a way for an American role in the upcoming years needs vision and imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this vision, you might find yourself in confrontation. Or, completely giving up and handing it all to Russia.\u201d ",

Photo by Rogelio V. Solis/Associated Press. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed ATLANTA \u2014 At least 16 people were killed and 43 more injured in Georgia and Mississippi after thunderstorms and tornadoes roared through the South this weekend, leaving some things standing and some things fallen, some lives whole and others blown to bits. Charles McDowell, the pastor of Barney United Methodist Church in Barney, Ga., was safe at his home on Sunday in nearby Valdosta. So was the modest church where he preaches to his flock of a few dozen people. Photo Jenny Bullard\u2019s home in Adel, Ga., was severely damaged by a tornado. Credit Branden Camp/Associated Press But many of his church members were suffering, their homes damaged, including roofs torn away, and their electricity off. There was little for Mr. McDowell to do but to try to reach out to them on their cellphones. \u201cAs a church,\u201d Mr. McDowell said, \u201cwe\u2019re praying for each other.\u201d Catherine Howden, a spokeswoman for Georgia\u2019s emergency management agency, said 12 people had died and 23 more had been injured in central and southern parts of the state because of the storm. She said there had been up to 20 reports of tornadoes. Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Sunday for seven counties: Atkinson, Berrien, Brooks, Colquitt, Cook, Lowndes and Thomas. Photo An Air Force airman surveyed debris on Sunday at the Sunshine Acres trailer park in Adel, Ga. Credit via Reuters \u201cThese storms have devastated communities and homes in south-central Georgia, and the state is making all resources available to the impacted areas,\u201d Mr. Deal said in a statement. He said that he was prepared to expand or extend the emergency declaration, and that the state was likely to seek help from the federal government. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sunday afternoon, during a ceremony to swear in White House senior staff members, President Trump said he had spoken with Mr. Deal, and mentioned Florida and Alabama as other states that had been affected by storms. Mr. Trump said that he had expressed to Mr. Deal \u201cour sincere condolences for the lives taken\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ll be helping out the state of Georgia.\u201d He added that he planned to reach out to Florida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott. Photo Fallen trees near Zoar United Methodist Church in Baxley, Ga., which sustained damage to its steeple. Credit Lewis Levine/Associated Press George Wetzel, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Ga., said that in the past three days, a strong low-pressure system had moved east across the South, which had been unseasonably warm in recent days, with moisture moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. A statement on the website of Mississippi\u2019s emergency agency said a tornado had caused extensive damage in the southern part of the state early Saturday, killing at least four people in or near Hattiesburg and injuring more than 20 others. Gov. Phil Bryant called for a state of emergency as power lines and debris littered roads. In Georgia, an intense round of thunderstorms that started on Saturday morning produced a number of tornadoes, and a second round overnight produced flooding rains, including more than six inches that fell in 24 hours just east of Albany. Photo Marilyn Bullard made her way to her parents\u2019 damaged home in Adel on Sunday. Credit Branden Camp/Associated Press A third wave of storms began in some parts of the state early Sunday. On Sunday morning in Adel, Jeff Lane, a county commissioner, was surveying the wreckage at the Sunshine Acres trailer park, where he said all eight deaths in the county had occurred. He said search and rescue crews were still making their way through the community. Photographs of the trailer park showed an open field surrounded by thin trees, strewn with splintered wood, scraps of metal sheeting and destroyed cars. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bomb had been dropped out here, at ground level,\u201d Mr. Lane said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got mobile-home frames that look like spaghetti noodles. We\u2019ve tried to evacuate as many as we can. But it\u2019s raining real hard, and we\u2019re getting ready to start another round of storms.\u201d Mr. McDowell, the pastor in Barney, Ga., a small community known for its peaches, said he was forced to cancel Sunday services because of the power failures \u2014 and because the dangerous storms had not abated. \u201cA lot of my people have physical damage,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the roofs are ripped off, trees are down, and of course the power is off now.\u201d The weather also caused damage in parts of Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, though information on whether anyone had been killed or injured in those states was not immediately available on Sunday.

Cox, Getty Images ATLANTA -\u00a0Matt Ryan tumbled into the end zone, slammed the ball to the turf with a thunderous spike, and let out a scream that showed just how much he wanted this game.\u00a0 He wants the next one even more. With another MVP-worthy performance and plenty of help from Julio Jones, Matty Ice guided the Atlanta Falcons to a 44-21 rout of the Green Bay Packers for the NFC championship Sunday, a showing that erased any doubts about whether Ryan can win the big games. In his ninth season, he\u2019s finally headed to his first Super Bowl . Call him Super Matty. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy it because it\u2019s hard to get to this point. I know that from experience,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut our ultimate goal is still in front of us.\u201d The Falcons (13-5) will face Tom Brady and the Patriots on Feb. 5 in Houston , just the second Super Bowl appearance in Atlanta\u2019s 51-year history. Eighteen years ago, they lost to Denver in John Elway\u2019s final game.\u00a0 New England, heading to its ninth Super Bowl, blew out Pittsburgh 36-17. The Patriots opened as a 3-point favorite.\u00a0 Ryan threw for 392 yards and four touchdowns, but it was his 14-yard scoring run -- his first TD on the ground since 2012 -- that really set the tone. \u00a0\u00a0 Matt Ryan rose to the occasion. pic.twitter.com/NAsreef1z6 \u2014 NFLonCBS (@NFLonCBS) January 22, 2017 Jones was right in the middle of things, too. After barely practicing during the week because of a lingering toe injury, he finished off the Packers with a 73-yard catch-and-run on Atlanta\u2019s second snap of the second half, pushing the lead to 31-0 and essentially turning the rest of the Georgia Dome finale into one long celebration.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a beast,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to play with him as long as I have. He was impressive today. I know he wasn\u2019t feeling his best, but he\u2019s a warrior.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 JULIO JONES IS A BEAST. 73 yards all the way to the house! \uf631 #GBvsATL #NFLPlayoffs https://t.co/Iau1EnDgVJ \u2014 NFL (@NFL) January 22, 2017 Jones finished with nine catches for 180 yards and two scores, which included a toe-dragging catch for a 5-yard touchdown with 3 seconds left in the first half, sending the Falcons to the locker room up 24-0.\u00a0 After the break: the play that showed every one of Jones\u2019 remarkable skills. He blazed down the middle of the field, shook off LaDarius Gunter\u2019s attempt to grab him on a cut toward the sideline, hauled in the pass from Ryan, broke Gunter\u2019s diving attempt at tackle, and defiantly knocked away Damarious Randall\u2019s with a brutal stiff-arm.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t practice that much throughout the week,\u201d Jones said, \u201cbut today I came out and gave it all I had.\u201d\u00a0 Ryan sparked more delirious chants of \u201cMVP! MVP! MVP!\u201d as he carved up an injury-plagued Packers secondary that had no way of stopping a team that averaged nearly 34 points a game during the regular season and romped to a 36-20 victory against Seattle\u2019s Legion of Boom last week.\u00a0 The Packers, riding an eight-game winning streak and coming off a thrilling upset of the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys , got a taste of what they\u2019d be in for on Atlanta\u2019s very first possession. Driving 80 yards in 13 plays, the Falcons converted three third downs, the last when Ryan scrambled away from pressure and flipped a shovel pass to Mohamed Sanu for a 2-yard score.\u00a0 Aaron Rodgers pushed the Packers quickly into Atlanta territory with a 27-yard pass to Jordy Nelson, who missed the previous game with a rib injury. But Mason Crosby, who hit two field goals longer that 50 yards in the closing minutes against the Cowboys, pushed a 41-yard attempt right of the upright to snap a playoff-record streak of 23 straight field goals.\u00a0 The Falcons drove the other way, settling for Matt Bryant\u2019s 28-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead. Then, with Green Bay poised to make a game of it, Atlanta\u2019s much-maligned defense - one of the lowest ranked in the NFL -- came through a momentum --swinging play. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski was breaking tackles and rumbling toward the end zone when Jalen Collins stripped the ball from behind and fell on it just across the goal line for a touchback.\u00a0 \u201cTheir offense is hot right now,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cPlaying a team like that, you\u2019ve got to start faster. We had no points in the first half. You\u2019re not going to win many games like that.\u201d\u00a0 After the fumble, Ryan hooked up with Jones three times for 56 yards and finished it off from the 14 with some surprisingly nimble running skills, faking out one defender with a pump fake before sprawling into the end zone.\u00a0 \u201cI just saw a lane open up,\u201d said Ryan, who had a 1-4 record in the playoffs over his first eight seasons. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest run I\u2019ve had in a while. It came at a good time.\u201d\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget the defense Atlanta\u2019s defense, an afterthought compared to the other side of the line, kept the Packers out of the end zone until the game was essentially locked up.\u00a0 Rodgers finished 27 of 45 for 287 yards and three TDs, but he also threw an interception, was sacked twice and faced a relentless Falcons rush.\u00a0 The Falcons finished with a 493-367 edge in total yards.\u00a0 Dome finale What a send-off for the Georgia Dome, the Falcons\u2019 home since 1992, which will be torn down and replaced next season by $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\u00a0 With the home team comfortably ahead, the raucous crowd of more than 71,000 partied through the second half, bouncing along to rap music that turned the stadium with the big top-like roof into the world\u2019s largest dance club.\u00a0 The intensity of the celebration was understandable, given the Falcons\u2019 largely forgettable history and the heartache doled out by all of Atlanta\u2019s pro sports teams. The Braves, way back in 1995, are still the city\u2019s only team to capture a big league championship.\u00a0 Now, the Falcons are one win away from adding another title to that barren trophy case.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Margaret Sullivan By Margaret Sullivan Media Columnist January 22 at 4:35 PM Follow @sulliview The presidency is not a reality show, but President Trump on his first full day in office made clear that he\u2019s still obsessed with being what he once proudly called \u201ca ratings machine.\u201d He cares enough about it to send his press secretary, Sean Spicer, out to brazenly lie to the media in his first official briefing. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u201d Spicer said. And he added a scolding about widespread reports that differ from his evidence-free assessment: \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.\u201d Crowd size experts estimate Trump\u2019s audience at far fewer than the million or more that Trump is claiming, and at far less than the size of the following day\u2019s women\u2019s march, which the new president has said little about. And side-by-side photographs showed the contrast between the comparatively thin gathering for Trump\u2019s inauguration and the record-setting one in 2009 for former president Barack Obama\u2019s first. Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush press secretary, saw Saturday\u2019s bizarre session for what it was. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \u201cThis is called a statement you\u2019re told to make by the President. And you know the President is watching,\u201d Fleischer wrote. (MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski pegged it as \u201cSean Spicer\u2019s first hostage video.\u201d) The mainstream media, including The Washington Post, appropriately made clear note of the falsehoods about crowd size. The New York Times called out \u201cfalse claims\u201d in a prominent headline, and many broadcast journalists challenged Spicer immediately \u2014 although they didn\u2019t get a chance to do so to his face, since he took no questions. CNN wisely chose not to air the briefing in full, but to report on it and to show parts, providing context. Fox News showed it in its full glory, infomercial style. Some journalists, afterward, sounded stunned at what had transpired. \u201cAstonishing,\u201d said Jim Acosta of CNN. \u201cJaw meet floor\u201d was the reaction of Glenn Thrush of the New York Times. The reaction is understandable. Some semblance of truth from the White House ought to be reasonable enough, especially on Day Two. But nothing about this should shock. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Anyone \u2014 citizen or journalist \u2014 who is surprised by false claims from the new inhabitant of the Oval Office hasn\u2019t been paying attention. That was reinforced when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday that Spicer had been providing \u201c alternative facts \u201d to what the media had reported, making it clear we\u2019ve gone full Orwell. Official words do matter, but they shouldn\u2019t be what news organizations pay most attention to, as they try to present the truth about a new administration. White House press briefings are \u201caccess journalism,\u201d in which official statements \u2014 achieved by closeness to the source \u2014 are taken at face value and breathlessly reported as news. And that is over. Dead. Spicer\u2019s statement should be seen for what it is: Remarks made over the casket at the funeral of access journalism. As Jessica Huseman of ProPublica put it: \u201cJournalists aren\u2019t going to get answers from Spicer. We are going to get answers by digging. By getting our hands dirty. So let\u2019s all do that.\u201d She\u2019s right. So was Tim O\u2019Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg View and a Trump biographer, who urged journalists to remember that the White House briefing room is \u201cspoon-feeding and Trump is a habitual fabulist.\u201d There\u2019s a deeper story here, beyond a single briefing, no matter how memorable. Saturday made clearer than ever that President Trump intends to make the American media his foremost enemy. During his first official visit to the CIA , Trump once again attacked the media, as he did throughout the campaign as he blacklisted news organizations and called reporters \u201cscum.\u201d Journalists shouldn\u2019t rise to the bait and decide to treat Trump as an enemy. Recalling at all times that their mission is truth-telling and holding public officials accountable, they should dig in, paying far more attention to actions than to sensational tweets or briefing-room lies \u2014 while still being willing to call out falsehoods clearly when they happen. They also should quickly acknowledge and correct their own inevitable errors, as Time\u2019s Zeke Miller did \u2014 multiple times and with an apology \u2014 after erroneously reporting that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. That didn\u2019t keep the president from making Miller\u2019s reporting error a major issue as he raged during his CIA visit: \u201cThis is how dishonest the media is.\u201d Trump wants a flat-out war with the nation\u2019s media for one well-calculated reason: Because he believes it will continue to serve his political purposes, as it has for months. Journalists should respond by doing their jobs responsibly, fairly and fearlessly, in service of the public good. Somebody has to be the grown-up in the room. We\u2019ve just been reminded of who it won\u2019t be. For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan . lifestyle ",

    "text": "McCain Doesn't Know if He Has 'Utmost Confidence' in President Trump By Nicki Rossoll Jan 22, 2017, 2:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Sen. John McCain Says He Will Vote 'In Favor' of Rex Tillerson 0 Shares Email Sen. John McCain praised President Donald Trump 's cabinet picks and revealed he will vote in favor of Rex Tillerson , Trump's pick to lead the State Department , despite concerns about the nominee's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin . \"I will be voting in favor of his nomination,\" McCain said of Tillerson in an interview Sunday with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week.\" \"Listen, this wasn't an easy call. But I also believe that when there's doubt the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt, and that's the way I've treated every president that I've had the obligation to vote for or against as a member of the United States Senate .\" Sen. John McCain and his fellow Republican foreign policy hawk Sen. Lindsey Graham released a joint statement today supporting Tillerson's nomination. \"\"After careful consideration, and much discussion with Mr. Tillerson, we have decided to support his nomination to be secretary of state. Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,\" the statement said. But, another prominent Republican senator has still apparently not made up his mind on Tillerson. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who sharply questioned Tillerson on Russia's involvement in Syria during the confirmation hearing, has not decided whether to vote for Tillerson, according to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee, who spoke to Rubio on Friday. Rubio has met with Tillerson privately since the hearing, the senator's office said. He's also met with Vice President Mike Pence on the subject, according to Corker. Wihtout Rubio's vote, Tillerson's nomination would not move out of committee. Republican leadership could still hold a full Senate vote and confirm him, especially now that he has McCain and Graham's public support, but it would be an embarrassing bruise for Trump administration. McCain also praised some of Trump's other Cabinet picks on \"This Week,\" saying he has the \"utmost confidence\" in Trump's national security team, in particular. \"I have the utmost confidence in Gen. Mattis, Gen. Flynn, Gen. Kelly, Dan Coats . I couldn't have picked a better team,\" he said. But, the Arizona senator did not have the same praise for the president himself. Asked by Stephanopoulos if he has the \"utmost confidence\" in the commander-in-chief, McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, replied, \"I don't know because he has made so many comments that are contradictory.\" \"I think the fact that he's appointed and nominated these outstanding individuals is bound to be an encouraging sign,\" McCain added. \"I trust them, and I believe in them, and I've worked with them over many years.

Mainstream news media still command attention and control the agenda. In Times Square on Jan. 20, 2017. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) Since Donald Trump upended everything we thought we knew about politics, hands have been wrung and ink has been spilled about the \"post-factual age.\" How could the candidate with the worst\u00a0 Politifact \u00a0rating in the 2016 campaign come out on top? How could fake news cause\u00a0a man to shoot up a pizzeria \u00a0in a quiet Washington neighborhood?\u00a0How could the Trump administration claim its new press secretary was using \" alternative facts \"? Do facts still matter \u2014 and if they don\u2019t, will real journalism stay relevant? Or is the \u201clamestream\u201d media a relic? We shouldn\u2019t overreact. Now that President Trump has taken the oath of office and the business of governance has begun, the impact of fake news and \u201calternative outlets\u201d will be revealed as vastly overblown. \u201cTraditional\u201d media will still control the national conversation. Policymakers will still have to build their days around what the mainstream media reports. The scandals,\u00a0conflicts\u00a0and reality checks the mainstream press unearths will dominate the headlines , as they did\u00a0 just before the inauguration . Those of fake news sites will not. Let\u2019s start with the numbers. Infowars, which received tremendous attention as a haven for conspiracy theories during the campaign, has about 6 million\u00a0 unique monthly visitors . Breitbart\u00a0had roughly\u00a0 19 million \u00a0in October\u00a02016 when interest in the presidential campaign was peaking. The USA TODAY NETWORK,\u00a0on the other hand,\u00a0had\u00a0 more than 122 million \u00a0unique visitors in November.\u00a0CNN's monthly average is about 105 million . The Washington Post\u00a0and The New York Times, meanwhile, rose to about 100 million apiece just before the election. It is hard to deny that mainstream media outlets reach a huge swath of America\u2019s news consumers. ",

    "text": "<p>Jenny Bullard carries a pair of boots from her home that was damaged by a tornado, Sunday, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Ga.</p> Close Branden Camp, AP ATLANTA --\u00a0A severe storm system that spun off apparent tornadoes and left scattered destruction around the Southeast has claimed at least 18 lives on a two-day sweep across the region, authorities said.\u00a0 Deadly tornadoes ravage Southern United States The enormous system put millions of people in the South on edge during a weekend of violent weather that left crumpled trailer homes, downed trees and other damage in the hardest-hit communities from Mississippi to Georgia. The severe weather threat was still continuing Sunday night in some parts, extending into the Carolinas and north Florida.\u00a0 At least 14 people were killed Sunday in Georgia as the fast-moving storms tore across the state throughout the day, with at least one deadly tornado reported before dawn and violent storms still rumbling after nightfall. Four people were killed Saturday in Mississippi when the system began its deadly assault. \u201cThere are houses just demolished,\u201d said Norma Ford, who rushed out with other relatives Sunday evening after hearing a reported twister had overturned her nephew\u2019s mobile home in the southwestern Georgia city of Albany, the region\u2019s largest city with some 76,000 residents. She said downed trees and powerlines made roads impassable, forcing them to walk the 2 miles to the mobile home park to check on her relatives. She said her nephew was fine, but several of his neighbors\u2019 homes were destroyed. Georgia\u2019s latest three deaths were confirmed Sunday evening in Dougherty County where Albany is located, said Catherine Howden, spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.\u00a0 Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said early Sunday afternoon that he had declared a state of emergency for seven counties impacted by tornado touchdowns and severe weather. The counties were Atkinson, Berrien, Brooks, Colquitt, Cook, Lowndes and Thomas. \u201cThe state of emergency is currently in effect and will remain so for the next seven days,\u201d Deal said in a Facebook post. \u201cAs we continue to assess the damage, I\u2019m prepared to expand or extend this emergency declaration as needed,\u201d the post said. \u201cIn addition to the state\u2019s response, all indications suggest we will also be submitting a request for federal assistance as well.\u201d I've declared a state of emergency for seven South Central Georgia counties impacted by severe weather and tornado... Posted by Governor Nathan Deal on\u00a0 Sunday, January 22, 2017 Sebon Burns, the county\u2019s deputy chief for emergency management, said search and rescue efforts were continuing Sunday night following reports of injuries and extensive damage.\u00a0 Yet the day\u2019s deadliest toll came before daybreak Sunday when an apparent tornado blew through a mobile home park in south Georgia - about 60 miles southeast of Albany - shearing away siding, upending homes and killing seven people. Coroner Tim Purvis of south Georgia\u2019s Cook County confirmed that seven people died at the mobile home park, where about roughly half of the 40 homes were \u201cleveled.\u201d Georgia state emergency officials initially reported an eighth death in that county, but Howden later said that was incorrect. The other deaths in Georgia were reported elsewhere. Not far from the mobile home park, 19-year-old Jenny Bullard wore a sling on her injured arm as she combed through the rubble of her family\u2019s brick house. All that remained standing Sunday afternoon was the master bedroom and parts of the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible tragedy,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cBut all this stuff can be replaced. We can\u2019t replace each other. We\u2019re extremely lucky.\u201d Bullard said she awoke before dawn Sunday to the sound of hail pounding the roof. When she went outside her bedroom door, she was knocked down by a collapsing wall in the hallway. She managed to get up and found her father calling for her, trapped under debris. She pulled him free, and they found her mother in the master bedroom. They escaped by climbing over piles of furniture and debris where the wall to their home office once stood. President Donald Trump said Sunday he had spoken with Georgia Gov. Deal and \u201cexpressed our sincere condolences for the lives taken.\u201d \u201cTornadoes were vicious and powerful and strong, and they suffered greatly,\u201d Trump said during a White House ceremony where he was swearing in aides. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be helping out the state of Georgia.\u201d Several homes appeared to be destroyed along on a road within about 2 miles of the mobile home park, with cinderblocks scattered on the ground, and pine trees uprooted and snapped in half. The tops of broken utility poles lay alongside the road.\u00a0 Storm damage in Adel, Georgia. Close Nathaniel R. Maine/Facebook The South Georgia Motorsports Park in Cecil also was heavy damaged; a grandstand was ripped apart. Barrels, signs, insulation and garbage were strewn over the speedway and parking lot.\u00a0 Two of Sunday\u2019s deaths occurred when a mobile home was struck by an apparent tornado in Brooks County, which moved the home roughly 100 yards before dawn Sunday.\u00a0 \u201cA tornado hit a mobile home, picked it up and put it in the middle of Highway 122,\u201d Brooks County Coroner Michael Miller said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it rolled or was lifted, but it blocked the entire highway.\u201d Georgia emergency officials in a news release said two people were also killed in nearby Berrien County. While the central part of the U.S. has a fairly defined tornado season -- the spring -- the risk of tornadoes \u201cnever really goes to zero\u201d for most of the year in the southeast, said Patrick Marsh of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. January tornado outbreaks are rare but not unprecedented, particularly in the South. Data from the Storm Prediction Center shows that, over the past decade, the nation has seen an average 38 tornadoes in January, ranging from a high of 84 in 2008 to just four in 2014. The last time the prediction center issued a high-risk weather outlook - where forecasters are very confident of a tornado outbreak - was in 2014. Sunday marked only the third time since 2000 that any part of Florida had been at a high-risk for severe weather, Marsh said. \u201cThis is a pretty rare event in this location,\u201d Marsh said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY Sports Yordano Ventura had a career 3.89 ERA. (Photo: Peter Aiken, USA TODAY Sports) Yordano Ventura, the hard-throwing and fearless right-hander who was a crucial part of two pennant-winning teams for the Kansas City Royals, was killed in a car accident in his native Dominican Republic on Sunday, the team confirmed on Sunday. Ventura was 25. Ventura was killed on the\u00a0Juan Adri\u00e1n highway in San Jose de Ocoa, according to Colonel Jacobo Mateo Moquete , director of communications for the military and police of the Dominican Republic. Moquete said Ventura was the lone passenger in the vehicle. Ventura started 93 games in his career with the Royals, posting a 38-31 record and 3.89 ERA, and going 27-18 in 2014-15, when the Royals won back-to-back American League pennants and the 2015 World Series. Ventura made 10 postseason starts in those seasons. Reporter Cristian Moreno , who cited the Dominican police, was the first to report the news. Ventura\u2019s death comes more than two years after another very promising young player, outfielder Oscar Taveras, was killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic. Taveras was 24 when he and his girlfriend were killed in Puerto Plata on Oct. 26, 2014. News of Taveras\u2019 death emerged during Game 5 of the 2014 World Series, and Ventura started and won Game 6 to force a decisive Game 7. It is with a heavy and broken heart that we confirm the passing of Yordano Ventura. The club will release a statement soon. #RIPAce \u2014 Mike Swanson (@Swanee54) January 22, 2017 Ventura pitched Game 6 with Taveras\u2019 initials and uniform number on his cap. In an odd coincidence, former major league infielder Andy Marte, 33, also died in a car crash in the Dominican over the weekend. Ventura was the starting pitcher in the final game of Marte's career , in August 2014. Fans everywhere mourn the tragic death of Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura Perhaps generously listed at 6 feet and 195 pounds, Ventura bedeviled hitters with a fastball that averaged 96\u00a0mph and an often devastating slider. Yet he became perhaps best known for not backing down from opponents, a mentality that created on-field confrontations with the Chicago White Sox and Oakland Athletics, a mound-charging battle with Baltimore Orioles All-Star Manny Machado and a staredown at home plate with a much larger Mike Trout. That attitude was both his salvation and, occasionally, his downfall. Ventura won 14 games during his rookie season and was part of their playoff rotation. But in 2015, he was getting hit hard by batters and inciting occasional chaos on the field in response to his performance. The Royals optioned him to the minor leagues, recalling him in July when fellow starter Jason Vargas needed elbow surgery. He returned a better pitcher, going 11-4 and striking out 98 batters in 91 innings as the Royals ran away with the AL Central. He started five postseason games, the Royals winning both of his starts, including the Game 6 clincher, in their conquest of the Toronto Blue Jays in the AL Championship Series. \"I know at times you were tough,\" infielder Christian Colon wrote in a posting on Twitter, \"but I knew you were just misunderstood.\" \u2014 Christian Col\u00f3n (@C24Colon) January 22, 2017 Ventura went 11-12 with a 4.45 ERA in 2016, earning $1 million in the second season of a five-year contract that guaranteed him $23 million. His death will create a signficant void in the Royals rotation, although the club's greater concern Sunday, of course, was remembering their fearless starter who developed from a skinny 16-year-old signed for a mere $28,000 to one of their key cogs in a glorious chapter in franchise history. \"Our prayers right now are with Yordano's family as we mourn this young man's passing,\" Royals general manager Dayton Moore said in a statement. \"He was so young and so talented. \"We will get through this as an organization, but right\u00a0now is a time to mourn and celebrate the life of Yordano.\" ",

Trump didn\u2019t agree with some in the intelligence community\u2019s who concluded that Russia influenced the 2016 White House race to help him win. And he argued more recently that somebody within that community leaking an unofficial dossier with alleged damaging personal information about him was like living in \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d Priebus told Fox that \u201cone bad actor\u201d likely leaked the document so Trump wasn\u2019t angry at all of the country\u2019s intelligence officers. \u201cI\u2019m telling you; It was a love fest in there,\u201d Priebus said about Trump\u2019s visit at CIA headquarters that was attended by about 300 staffers. He also suggested that a reporter was at best careless in erroneously reporting that Trump has removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. \u201cIt could have had explosive ramifications. \u2026 It was shoot first, point later,\u201d he said about the inaccurate report, for which the reporter later apologized. Priebus also defended Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s comments Saturday about the news media underreporting the crowd size at Trump\u2019s swearing-in Friday. At a hastily called White House press conference, Spicer angrily accused the media of \u201cfalse reporting\u201d on the inauguration as part of what he called a \u201cshameful\u201d attempt to minimize enthusiasm for Trump. He then left without taking questions. Priebus said Sunday: \u201cThe point is not the crowd. The point is the media is trying to delegitimize the presidency.\" Advertisement ",

After Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday morning that Mr. Trump had no plans to release his tax returns , a shift from his stance during the campaign, WikiLeaks tweeted its disappointment: Trump Counselor Kellyanne Conway stated today that Trump will not release his tax returns. Send them to: https://t.co/cLRcuIiQXz so we can. WikiLeaks, founded by Julian Assange , posted thousands of hacked emails last year, first from the Democratic National Committee last summer and then from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s personal email account in the fall. Assange has said he did not get the emails from the Russian government, despite the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that the hacks were directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the wake of the intelligence report on Russian hacking, Mr. Trump appeared to side with Assange over U.S. intelligence agencies on the issue of Russian hacking, though he has denied that he agrees with Assange. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Animated infographic shows how debris flows and deep-seated landslides happen Animated infographic shows how debris flows and deep-seated landslides happen Rong-Gong Lin II , Rosanna Xia and Raoul Ranoa Contact Reporters Through five years of severe drought, El Capitan Canyon above\u00a0the Pacific Ocean near\u00a0Goleta\u00a0endured bone-dry conditions that at times seemed like they would\u00a0never end. Then, on Friday, the skies opened up. Nearly 2\u00a0inches of rain dropped in a single\u00a0hour in the Santa Ynez Mountains.\u00a0 So a\u00a0creek that had once disappeared came roaring alive, full of mud, brush and broken trees pouring from the burned slopes of the \u00a0Sherpa fire in the summer.\u00a0 Five cabins were lifted off their foundations and swept down the creek. The\u00a0muddy torrent claimed 22 vehicles. One of the cabin\u2019s remains were found south of the 101 Freeway.\u00a0Nearly two dozen people had to be rescued,\u00a0including one trapped in a car, said Santa Barbara County fire Capt. Dave Zaniboni. The remains of five smashed vehicles floated all the way down to the beach.\u00a0 What happened in a matter of minutes at the campground is emblematic of the drought -to-deluge cycle\u00a0that has always been at the heart of California\u2019s climate. All it can take is an intense amount of rain in a short amount of time to create damaging flows of mud and\u00a0debris that can kill people and destroy buildings.\u00a0 The flows are part of nature. But the situation has become\u00a0more dangerous as humans came to inhabit these paths of destruction. \u201cThere\u2019s a competition between the growth of the mountains and the erosion from the rainstorms,\u201d\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Jason Kean said. \u201cThey\u2019re in this constant battle.\u201d Flood waters and a debris flow sweep away cabins and vehicles at El Capitan Canyon Resort & Campground in Santa Barbara County Friday.

(Mike Eliason / Santa Barbara County Fire) California\u2019s dramatic shift in the last few months \u2014\u00a0from extreme dryness to some of the strongest storms in a decade \u2014\u00a0has brought mudslides that have closed roads, damaged vehicles and homes and left residents on edge. On Friday night,\u00a0Highway 17 \u2014\u00a0the key route between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz \u2014\u00a0was closed for hours after sliding mud and a fallen tree blocked all southbound lanes, causing a commuter nightmare. One Sierra highway alone has endured nearly 20 major slides. And a\u00a0rare warm winter storm two weeks ago sent rains that deposited 10,000 cubic yards of decomposed granite that shut down all westbound lanes of Interstate 80 west of Lake Tahoe\u00a0for more than 12 hours.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s truly a battle,\u201d Caltrans spokeswoman Liza Whitmore said.\u00a0 The situation is expected to get worse in Southern California on Sunday, when a storm \u2014\u00a0which could be the most powerful to strike the region since 2010\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 moves in. Officials have warned of mudslides and mudflows. Why do\u00a0landslides happen during a storm? In a burned area , a wildfire can make the soils repellent to water, creating a floodlike flow on the ground that picks up rock and debris, Kean said.\u00a0 In an area that has not burned, soil can become saturated. Pressure builds up underground, and soil starts\u00a0moving\u00a0and begins picking up mud and debris as it starts flowing downhill. Water rushing down with only mud is called a mud flow. If the flow picks up rocks, branches and sometimes massive boulders, that\u2019s called a debris flow.\u00a0 This debris flow on Jan. 8, 2017 was caused by a warm winter storm that dumped rain on the Sierra, sending a flow of water and decomposed granite to wash over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit. California Highway Patrol This debris flow on Jan. 8, 2017 was caused by a warm winter storm that dumped rain on the Sierra, sending a flow of water and decomposed granite to wash over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit. This debris flow on Jan. 8, 2017 was caused by a warm winter storm that dumped rain on the Sierra, sending a flow of water and decomposed granite to wash over Interstate 80 at Donner Summit. (California Highway Patrol) Mud and debris flows are types of shallow landslides , generally defined as less than 15 feet deep.\u00a0 Another type of shallow landslide involves a saturated hillside that collapses but does not move very far, such as one that buries a roadway with dirt and rocks from a neighboring slope. They can happen up to an hour after a burst of intense rain.\u00a0\u201cThere were widespread shallow landslides as recently as 2005\u201d in Southern California, Kean said.\u00a0 What\u2019s the easiest type of landslide to predict? Landslides that strike in recently burned areas are the easiest to predict, as wildfires have burned away roots of trees and vegetation that had kept soils in place. Sometimes, authorities have accurately predicted when debris flows will occur, based on forecast rainfall rates, and have called for evacuations of homes before the rivers of mud and debris begin flowing. Can debris flow still catch people off guard? Yes. In 2010, the winter after the worst fire in L.A. County history, a debris flow \u2014 which one resident described like a \u201c Niagara Falls \u201d \u2014 flowed down La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\u2019s northernmost neighborhood when a 10-ton boulder clogged a critical basin, plugging up the drain like a giant stopper. More than 40 homes were damaged. It came as a surprise because the storm was supposed to be fast moving, but unexpectedly stalled and dumped rain at an alarming rate. The forecast that authorities had relied on in the days leading up to the three-day storm had called for a light to moderate rains. No evacuations had been ordered. A debris flow hit La Canada Flintridge in 2010. Mud and debris came rushing through an entire house on Manistee Drive. Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times A debris flow hit La Canada Flintridge in 2010. Mud and debris came rushing through an entire house on Manistee Drive. A debris flow hit La Canada Flintridge in 2010. Mud and debris came rushing through an entire house on Manistee Drive. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) How much rainfall is needed to trigger mud or debris flow? In Southern California\u2019s unburned areas, 10 inches of rainfall during the winter is needed to nearly saturate the ground. After that point, a burst of rain of just one-quarter of an inch an hour can trigger widespread shallow landslides, including debris flow, Kean said.\u00a0 Since July 1, downtown Los Angeles has received 11.33 inches of rain as of Friday, which is 178% of average at this point of the winter. Santa Barbara has received 12.03 inches, which is 149% of average.\u00a0 But for burned areas, mud and debris flows can strike with only intense rainfall, even if the ground is not saturated. What\u2019s the least predictable type of landslide? The kind that can strike on a dry day. In areas where the bedrock is very deep, rainwater can seep deep underground during multiple rainstorms. During a series of repeated heavy storms, water can eventually start to accumulate and build up pressure, Kean said. The pressure can destabilize an entire chunk of land, causing it to collapse downhill. The landslide can happen slowly, and show warning signs like cracking or subtle movements, allowing people time to escape. But they can also strike rapidly with no warning, even on a rainless day months after the end of winter. This is called a deep-seated landslide, involving landslides greater than 15 feet deep. Often, deep-seated landslides strike in areas with a history of such events. The USGS has warned that such\u00a0\u00a0landslides can become active many months after a very wet winter. A deep-seated landslide struck Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach in 2005. Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times A deep-seated landslide struck Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach in 2005. A deep-seated landslide struck Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach in 2005. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) What\u2019s an example of a deep-seated landslide? An example of where a deep-seated landslide has occurred is Bluebird Canyon of Laguna Beach. One occurred on a foggy morning in June 2005 after heavy rains fell between the previous December through February. No rainfall occurred during or just before the landslide. Seventeen homes were destroyed and 11 seriously damaged. There has been a history of devastating landslides in Bluebird Canyon. The neighborhood suffered a slide in October 1978 that destroyed more than 20 homes. The California Division of Mines and Geology said the heavy rains between December 1977 through April 1978 are believed to have played a role, along with a history of landslides and erosion at the site, and weakness in the rock. What about the coastal hamlet of La Conchita in Ventura County? Did landslides there\u00a0come as surprises? The first landslide, in March 1995, came as no surprise, Ventura County geologist Jim O\u2019Tousa said. The summer before, officials had observed ground cracks and other signs of a pending landslide. A sheriff\u2019s official was assigned to patrol the area, and town meetings were held to prepare the community for what was coming. Then about 24 inches of rain hit the region in January \u2014 way above the average of about 4 inches for that month. \u00a0The slide hit March 2. The slopes started sliding at a pace so slow that residents could outrun it. The patrol officer was still knocking on doors as the ground was moving and got everyone down the hill in time, O\u2019Tousa recalled. \u201cThe groundwater finally built up to a high enough level to destabilize the slope,\u201d O\u2019Tousa said. A deep-seated landslide buried 10 people, killing them, in 2005 in La Conchita. Stephen Osman / Los Angeles Times A deep-seated landslide buried 10 people, killing them, in 2005 in La Conchita. A deep-seated landslide buried 10 people, killing them, in 2005 in La Conchita. (Stephen Osman / Los Angeles Times) The second landslide in 2005 occurred at the end of an intense 15-day rainy period that saw heavy precipitation throughout Southern California. This slide came with no warning, and buried 10 people, killing them. The 2005 landslide was actually a \u201cremobilization of part of the 1995 slide,\u201d O\u2019Tousa said. The 1995 landslide had fractured and was sitting in the bottom of the canyon, he explained. Then in 2005, when enough water saturated the bottom of the canyon, the material came flushing out of the canyon \u2014 a speed of 20 mph \u2014 and flowed into the neighborhood where the fatalities occurred. What about cliffs that fall into the sea? Last winter, California saw cliffs erode into the sea in Pacifica, about a 15-mile drive south of San Francisco. There, apartment units have been ordered vacated because of the crumbling coastline. Pacifica has some of the weakest soils along the California coast composed of cliffs, USGS research civil engineer Brian Collins said. The cliffs are being attacked from both the bottom and on top from water. At its base, the ocean is eroding the cliffs. When heavy rains come from above, water seeps into the soils, and eventually exits when it reaches less permeable layers. The nature of this seepage weakens the bonds in the soil that keep the soil particles bonded together, \u201cso it collapses,\u201d Collins said. The coast in this region has been eroding for thousands of years. As sea levels have risen, the ocean has eroded the cliffs. And the San Andreas fault has been lifting the cliffs up, only for them to be taken down by the seas and the rain.\u00a0 Caption Huge crowds converge on Washington, D.C., for Women's March on Washington Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Caption Huge crowds converge on Washington, D.C., for Women's March on Washington Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Huge crowds converge on the nation's capital\u00a0for Women's March on Washington.\u00a0 Caption Recap: Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C.

Ventura, whose fiery personality on the field matched his high velocity fastball, was only 25-years-old at the time of his death. \"The Kansas City Royals regretfully announce the passing of Yordano Ventura, who perished in a car accident last night in the Dominican Republic,\" the Kansas City Royals said in a statement, adding that no further details were available regarding the accident that claimed Ventura's life. \u2014 Kansas City Royals (@Royals) January 22, 2017 Dayton Moore, Royals' Senior VP of Baseball Operations and General Manager, said the club was praying for Ventura's family. \"Our prayers right now are with Yordano\u2019s family as we mourn this young man\u2019s passing,\u201d Moore said in the team's statement. \u201cHe was so young and so talented, full of youthful exuberance and always brought a smile to everyone he interacted with.

Taveras, a highly-touted baseball prospect, also died in a car accident, prior to the game. The Taveras tribute game was arguably Ventura's finest moment, as he pitched through his emotions and led his team to victory, throwing seven shutout innings for the win. Ventura finished his career with a record of 38-31. 0 Shares ",

Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan reacts after a touchdown in the fourth quarter against the Packers in the NFC Championship Game at the Georgia Dome on Jan. 22, 2017, in Atlanta. (Tom Pennington / Getty Images) Matt Ryan and Julio Jones teamed up for a dominant playoff performance, and the Atlanta Falcons ignored all those ghosts from the last half-century. Now, they're headed to the Super Bowl. Ryan threw for 392 yards and four touchdowns in another MVP-worthy showing, while Jones shook off a lingering toe injury to haul in nine catches for 180 yards and two scores, leading the Falcons to a 44-21 blowout of the storied Green Bay Packers in the NFC championship game Sunday. Atlanta (13-5) will face either New England or Pittsburgh in the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston. It will be only the second appearance in the Falcons' 51-year history, the first coming 18 years ago with a team known as the \"Dirty Birds.\" They have never won an NFL championship. If Ryan and the league's highest-scoring offense keep playing like this, the AFC winner will sure have its hands full in the Lone Star State. The Falcons led 24-0 at halftime against the Packers (12-6), perhaps the league's hottest team, and essentially put the game away on their second offensive snap of the second half, a play that showed every one of Jones' remarkable skills . He blazed down the middle of the field, shook off LaDarius Gunter's attempt to grab him on a cut toward the sideline, hauled in the pass from Ryan, broke Gunter's diving attempt at tackle, and defiantly knocked away Damarious Randall's with a brutal stiff-arm on the way to a 73-yard touchdown. In the final game at the Georgia Dome, Ryan sparked more delirious chants of \"MVP! MVP! MVP!\" as he carved up an injury plagued Packers secondary that simply had no way of stopping a team that averaged nearly 34 points a game during the regular season and romped to a 36-20 victory against Seattle's Legion of Boom in the divisional round. For good measure, Ryan also ran for a touchdown. The Packers, riding an eight-game winning streak and coming off a thrilling upset of the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, got a taste of what they'd be in for on Atlanta's very first possession. Driving 80 yards in 13 plays, the Falcons converted three times on third down, the last of them when Ryan scrambled away from pressure and flipped a shovel pass to Mohamed Sanu for a 2-yard score. Aaron Rodgers and the Packers came right back, moving quickly down the field in what had all the makings of a back-and-forth shootout. Top receiver Jordy Nelson hauled in a 27-yard pass after missing the victory at Dallas with a rib injury. But, on third-and-4 at the Atlanta 23, the Falcons hurried Rodgers into an incomplete pass. Mason Crosby, who hit two field goals longer that 50 yards in the closing minutes against the Cowboys, pushed a 41-yard attempt right of the upright to snap a playoff-record streak of 23 straight field goals. The Falcons drove down the field again, settling for Matt Bryant's 28-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead. Then, with Green Bay poised to make a game of it, Atlanta's much-maligned defense \u2014 one of the lowest ranked in the NFL \u2014 came through a momentum-swinging play. Fullback Aaron Ripkowski was breaking tackles and rumbling toward the end zone when Jalen Collins stripped the ball from behind and fell on it just across the goal line for a touchback. On the ensuing possession, Ryan hooked up with Jones three times for 56 yards. Ryan finished it off with some surprisingly nimble running skills, faking out one defender with a pump fake before diving into the end zone for a 14-yard touchdown run. It was Matty Ice's first rushing touchdown since Week 1 of the 2012 season and sparked an uncharacteristic outburst from the normally even-tempered quarterback. Ryan gave the ball a thunderous spike and let out a scream that made it clear he wanted this game more than anything in his career. The guy who had a 1-4 record in the playoffs over his first eight seasons has finally earned his spot on the biggest stage of them all. Associated Press ",

Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect for swaths of greater Los Angeles, where mountain areas could see more than 2 inches of rain.\u00a0 Authorities ordered evacuations near wildfire burn areas in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange counties. Officials said potential debris flows could restrict access for emergency responders.\u00a0 Some residents refused to leave, but Ralph Olivas loaded up his family and their dog and left his home in Duarte, nestled in scenic foothills east of Los Angeles that were left bare by wildfires last June. Recent rain sent rocks down steep streets where homeowners built protective barriers out of lumber and sandbags.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re packing and leaving because the muds are coming, the mudslides,\u201d he told CBS Los Angeles , adding that the risk \u201ccomes with the territory living up here.\u201d\u00a0 In northern Los Angeles County, about 120 residents near burn areas of Santa Clarita were ordered to leave late Saturday. During a storm Friday, raging floodwaters overflowed a creek and sent a sheriff\u2019s cruiser floating down a street.\u00a0 A pedestrian walks under the rain downtown Los Angeles, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017 Close Damian Dovarganes, AP Craig Herrera, a CBS Los Angeles meterologist, said the storm moving in from Monterey Bay is expected to bring between one to three inches of rain to the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. Further north, a band of strong thunderstorms lashed the San Francisco Bay Area with heavy rain and hail. Wind gusts brought down trees across Northern California.\u00a0 In Mendocino County, a massive oak tree toppled onto an apartment in the city of Ukiah early Saturday, crushing the building and killing a woman as she lay in her bed, fire officials told the Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa. The woman\u2019s boyfriend and a 3-year-old boy escaped.\u00a0 Capt. Pete Bushby of the Ukiah Valley Fire Authority said heavy rain apparently had destabilized the 125-foot oak.\u00a0 Heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, which was already blanketed after weeks of storms. The weather service warned of \u201ccrippling snow amounts on top of existing snow cover\u201d and urged residents to stock up on food, water and firewood, and \u201cessentially prepare for being stranded at home for multiple days.\u201d\u00a0 Along the coast, big surf was rolling ashore, and forecasters said waves could build to 30 feet on the Central Coast.\u00a0 Elsewhere in the West, Nevada, Arizona and Utah expected strong winter storms overnight into Monday.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Jan 22 2017, 2:25 pm ET Donald Trump Will Not Release Tax Returns, White House Adviser Says by Alexandra Jaffe advertisement Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, said Sunday that the president would not be releasing his tax returns, reversing months of repeated campaign-trail promises to do so after an audit is completed. Conway's comments came in response to a Whitehouse.gov petition with more than 200,000 signatures calling on Trump to release his tax returns. Any petition on the site that receives 100,000 signatures in 30 days receives a response from the White House; this petition reached twice that in two days. \"The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns,\" Conway said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week.\" Related: Donald Trump's Taxes: What We Know and What We Don't Trump broke with decades of precedent during the campaign by becoming the first major party nominee since the 1970s to refuse to release his tax returns. He repeatedly cited an ongoing IRS audit in refusing to do so but said he would eventually release them when the audit was completed. But Trump and his allies have argued that his tax returns are irrelevant, a statement Conway made again on Sunday. \"We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care,\" she said. \"They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. And you know full well that President Trump and his family are complying with all the ethical rules, everything they need to do to step away from his businesses and be a full-time president.\" Both of Conway's statements are false \u2014 multiple polls showed a majority of Americans believe Trump should release his tax returns, including an ABC News/Washington Post survey out last week that found three-fourths of Americans believe he should release them . And a ProPublica investigation out Friday revealed that despite Trump's pledge to transfer control of his businesses to his children as part of an ethics agreement as president, he hasn't filed any of the necessary documents to do so in Florida, Delaware and New York.

    "text": "Now, after President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the health law, one of the most vexing questions is whether people like Ms. Fitzgerald will be covered. Advertisement Continue reading the main story About 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of pre-existing condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed, according to a recent study. The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law. The issue \u201cis the third rail\u201d for the Republicans, said Michael Turpin, a longtime health industry executive. Before the law, a fairly typical life event \u2014 like a divorce or the loss of a job \u2014 and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person\u2019s health coverage options. Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion. Mr. Trump insists he wants to keep the pre-existing requirement for insurers, and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away. Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged, but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea \u2014 known as high-risk pools \u2014 that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past. The challenge for lawmakers is this: How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care \u2014 and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone? The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty. That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance, distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population. The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up, the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers. Top Republicans, though, say the system is not working and point to double-digit price increases for premiums. \u201cThere is a better way to fix that problem without giving everybody else all these massive premium increases,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said at a recent televised forum. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Finding a fix is far from simple. Before the law was passed, insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy, and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care. The companies wanted to minimize the risk of losing money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers. Often, insurers offered no options to people with pre-existing conditions, because they considered the potential costs to be too high. As a result, 35 states had high-risk pools, the program again on the lips of top lawmakers, including Mr. Ryan. The high-risk programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions. The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy, insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people. Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions, but they would also rely on other sources of funding, including from the government, to cover their costs. Photo Dennis Carr, rejected by insurers because of his asthma and a sinus condition, was directed to California\u2019s high-risk pool. The premiums were too high, said Mr. Carr, who now lives in Arizona. Credit Caitlin O'Hara for The New York Times The system worked for Dan Nassimbene and his wife, who had breast cancer but is in remission. They enrolled in Colorado\u2019s high-risk pool for three years. She paid about $375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments. In 2014, though, the high-risk pool was closed, and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost around $900 a month and came with a family deductible of around $12,000, much higher than it was before. His income was too high for him to receive any government subsidies, which help about 80 percent of people buying such plans. \u201cI had coverage but no access,\u201d said Mr. Nassimbene, 55. He has since switched to a Christian health care sharing ministry , in which members cover one another\u2019s medical bills. It does not qualify as coverage under the law.

British leader won't say Published               January 22, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print In this file photo dated Monday, Dec. 4, 1989, a Trident II missile launched by the U.S. Navy during a performance evaluation from the submerged submarine USS Tennessee in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Canaveral in Titusville, Fla., USA \u00a0(AP Photo/Phil Sandlin, FILE) LONDON \u2013 \u00a0The British government is being accused of concealing the failure of an unarmed ballistic\u00a0missile\u00a0launch ahead of a debate in Parliament over whether to refurbish the country's aging Trident nuclear launching system. Britain's prime minister refused to say Sunday whether she knew about an unarmed Trident\u00a0missile\u00a0that reportedly failed when it was test-fired off the coast of Florida last year. Theresa May told BBC she has total confidence in Britain's Trident nuclear launching system, but didn't confirm or deny a newspaper report about the alleged failure of a ballistic\u00a0missile\u00a0designed to carry nuclear warheads. The prime minister was asked about the\u00a0missile\u00a0test after the Sunday Times reported that an unarmed\u00a0missile\u00a0launched from a submarine off Florida's coast in June veered off course and may have headed toward the U.S. The newspaper said top government officials decided to keep the failure of a Trident II D5 ballistic\u00a0missile\u00a0out of the public eye because of an upcoming debate the next month in Parliament over whether to spend 40 billion pounds to refurbish the aging Trident, the cornerstone of Britain's nuclear deterrent system. \"I have absolute faith in our Trident\u00a0missiles,\" May said Sunday when asked if she had known about a possible\u00a0missile\u00a0failure when she spoke to Parliament in July. \"When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident, whether or not we should have Trident\u00a0missiles.\" The government triumphed in that debate, winning overwhelming support for the Trident overhaul in July, but some opposition figures in the British government now seek an inquiry into the reported\u00a0missile\u00a0failure and a possible cover-up. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon, who opposes having the Trident submarine fleet based in Scotland, said reports of a failure and cover-up are a \"hugely serious issue.\" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, also a Trident opponent, called it \"a pretty catastrophic error.\" The British government hasn't confirmed the newspaper's report of a misfire. A government statement posted on a Defense Ministry blog indicated there was a \"routine unarmed Trident\u00a0missile\u00a0test launch from HMS Vengeance\" in June. The Royal Navy launch was \"part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew,\" the statement said. The Vengeance submarine and its crew were \"successfully tested and certified,\" it said. The statement says the government does not provide further details on submarine operations for \"obvious\" national security reasons. The British government's website says Trident has provided Britain's security every day for the last 46 years. The system consists of Vanguard-class submarines which can carry up to 16 Trident ballistic\u00a0missiles\u00a0armed with nuclear warheads. Defense policy calls for one of the submarines to be on patrol at all times. Advertisement ",

The comments came at a swearing in ceremony for key White House staff, at which Trump showed off a personal letter from Barack Obama, saying \"we won't even tell the press what's in that letter\". Video provided by AFP Newslook Employees at work in the multibillion-dollar Honda car plant in Celaya, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato (Photo: Eduardo Verdugo, AP) Donald Trump's incoming administration has wasted no time setting as official policy the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, moves send shock waves through the automotive industry. Until now, automakers and auto executives have been reluctant to publicly speak out about the potential consequences of renegotiating or pulling out of NAFTA because Trump's comments on the campaign trail were not official White House policy. But on Friday, shortly after Trump was sworn in, the administration pledged to negotiate \"tough and fair\" trade agreements with the goal of creating more U.S. jobs as one of its top policy issues posted on Whitehouse.gov. \"This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade deals are in the interests of American workers,\" the statement says. \"President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA. If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States\u2019 intent to withdraw from NAFTA.\" According to the statement, Trump's goal is \"to put American workers and businesses first when it comes to trade\" with the goal of returning millions of jobs to America \u2014 even though many analysts and economists say America's lost more manufacturing jobs to China and automation than to Mexico. On Friday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, General Motors, Ford and the Auto Alliance \u2014 a lobbying organization for the industry \u2014 all either declined to comment or did not respond to e-mails seeking comment. Automakers also have been racing in recent weeks to pull any plans they have for U.S. investments and job creation off the shelf and announce them in an effort to blunt criticism from Trump for investing in Mexico. NAFTA has contributed to a decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs, but it has led to massive automotive industry investment in Mexico and the growth of a supplier network there. Nearly every automaker \u2014 both foreign and domestic \u2014 has built new plants in Mexico in recent years. Mexico has surpassed Canada in annual vehicle production. Reversing those investments to build new plants in the U.S. would take years to accomplish even in a best-case scenario. Meanwhile, a large border tax, such as the 35% tariff Trump has often talked about, would cause the price of many cars and trucks sold in the U.S. to soar and could lead to a decline in industry sales and lead a steep decline in profits for automakers. \"The new administration is suggesting a reversal in trade policy of a magnitude that hasn't been seen in decades, possibly since the 1920s,\" said Hoyt Bleakley, an associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan. \"A sudden increase in trade costs is a recipe for a slowdown, maybe a recession, as the higher costs disrupt the supply chain.\" Last week, the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor issued a study that suggested scuttling NAFTA or imposing a massive border tariff could lead to U.S. job losses and could cause automakers to move to other low-cost countries for vehicle production rather than building new plants in the U.S. The Ann Arbor-based research organization estimates that a 35% tariff on light vehicles imported from Mexico would quickly lead to a decline of 450,000 cars and trucks in the U.S. because of higher prices, hurting U.S. dealers and automakers. It also would lead to the loss of at least 31,000 U.S. jobs because of the volume of parts that are made in the U.S. and shipped into Mexico. \"If the U.S. leaves NAFTA, companies in Mexico and Canada may seek alternate, more affordable places to purchase these goods, such as China, India, and other regions with large, international U.S. competitors,\" the Center for Automotive Research said. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said last week that a 35% border tariff could force the automaker to stop producing cars in Mexico.. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that if economic tariffs are imposed ... and are sufficiently large, it will make production of anything in Mexico uneconomical and we would have to withdraw,\u201d Marchionne said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible.\u201d Marchionne also added that the automotive industry needs clarity from the Trump administration on what its official trade policy and trade agreements will be. \u201cI think we will adjust whenever the rules get changed, if they get changed. We have no choice in this. We are not policy setters,\u201d Marchionne said during a news conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. \u201cI am not sure exactly what the rules are. Let\u2019s wait.\u201d Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America, said last week that a border tariff would not hurt the German automaker as much as some other automakers. Audi decided five years ago to build a $1.3-billion factory in a south-central Mexico town called San Jose Chiapa to build its Q5 SUV. \"This plant ... is a global plant. It makes cars for the entire world,\" Keogh said. \"So, there is only one place to get a Q5 and that\u2019s (a Q5) made in Mexico. And it goes to Africa, and South America and Europe and all over the world. The car used to be made in Germany, in fact, and now it's made in Mexico.\" Revealed last week at the Detroit auto show, the new Q5 is scheduled to go on sale in the U.S. by spring. 13804 CONNECT TWEET 42 LINKEDIN 150 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jMeMfv NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

    "text": "Jan 22 2017, 1:59 pm ET Mars Investigating Skittles Said to Be Intended for Cattle by Associated Press advertisement NEW YORK \u2014 A mysterious Skittles spill on a rural highway in Wisconsin is taking another twist, with Mars Inc. saying it doesn't know why the discarded candy might have been headed to become cattle feed. The case began when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook this week that \"hundreds of thousands of Skittles\" had been found spilled on a highway. Later, he updated the post to say the candy had fallen off a truck on its way to be cattle feed. Only red Skittles had spilled out, and Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt joked in the post that it would be difficult to \"Taste the Rainbow\" in its entirety. The incident gained attention after CNN wrote about it, citing a report from a local affiliate. Related: Meet Scooter, the Calf that Lay Down With the Lambs A variety of food byproducts are commonly used for animal feed, and Skittles maker Mars Inc. says it has procedures for discarding foods for that purpose. However, the company says the Skittles in question came from a factory that doesn't sell unused products for animal feed. \"We don't know how it ended up as it did and we are investigating,\" Mars said. Company spokeswoman Denise Young said the Skittles were supposed to be destroyed because a power outage prevented the signature \"S'' from being placed on the candies. She said Mars planned to contact the sheriff's office and the farmer to find out more. Schmidt said one of his deputies had come across the spill and sent him photos, which he posted on Facebook. He said the Skittles spilled from a box that started to disintegrate in the rain, and about half of them got out. The Skittles on the ground did not have the standard letter \"S'' on them, he said. The sheriff said he has spoken to the farmer, but did not have his phone number. Schmidt did not respond when asked by email for the farmer's name. Related: Candy Maker Mars Inc. Supports Eating Less Sugar Linda Kurtz, a corporate environmental manager at Mars, said the company sells unused candies and ingredients to processors that incorporate them with other materials to make animal feed. She said Mars does not sell directly to farmers, and its procedures follow Food and Drug Administration regulations. Kurtz said Mars determined the spilled Skittles came from its plant in Yorkville, Illinois, which does not sell products for animal feed. The other U.S. plant that makes Skittles, in Waco, Texas, sells to a local processor that melts them down into syrup. Josh Cribbs, a cattle nutritionist and director of commercial development for the American Maine-Anjou Association, which promotes a particular cattle breed, said that the food byproducts that get used for cattle feed vary depending on what's available in the region and particular time of year. In places like Texas, for instance, Cribbs said citrus rinds are common. Cribbs said a specific product would not be used alone, but be mixed with other ingredients to achieve a particular nutritional profile. \"You might think, 'Oh my gosh, they might be eating a Skittle.' In reality, that piece of candy is being broken down,\" he said. Associated Press ",

By THE NEW YORK TIMES on Publish Date January 22, 2017. Photo by Left, Lucas Jackson, Right, Stelios Varias/Reuters. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community, Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community, a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago. He also called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest human beings on earth,\u201d and he said that up to 1.5 million people had attended his inauguration, a claim that photographs disproved. Later, at the White House, he dispatched Sean Spicer, the press secretary, to the briefing room in the West Wing, where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country, warning that the new administration would hold them to account. Continue reading the main story The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump , a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in. It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency, usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader. OPEN Graphic Instead, the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive, signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation\u2019s highest office. Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community, with an appearance at the C.I.A.\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va. While he was lavish in his praise, the president focused in his 15-minute speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation\u2019s spy agencies, and meandered to other topics, including the crowd size at his inauguration, his level of political support, his mental age and his intellectual heft.

In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia meddled in the United States election on his behalf. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Trump, he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on Twitter , \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? \u2014         Donald J.

Mr. Spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed \u201cto minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d although he provided no proof of either assertion. Photographs of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 and of Mr. Trump\u2019s plainly showed that the crowd on Friday was significantly smaller , but Mr. Spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the Mall. Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009. \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. He also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on Friday that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, calling the mistake \u2014 which was corrected quickly \u2014 \u201cegregious.\u201d And he incorrectly claimed that ridership on Washington\u2019s subway system was higher than on Inauguration Day in 2013. In reality, there were 782,000 riders that year, compared with 571,000 riders this year, according to figures from the Washington-area transit authority. Mr. Spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the National Mall this year, preventing \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d from viewing the ceremony. But the Secret Service said the measures were largely unchanged this year, and there were few reports of long lines or delays. Video White House Press Secretary Slams Media At his first news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, accused news outlets of intentionally manipulating photographs \u201cto minimize the enormous support\u201d that President Trump had received at his inauguration. By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb Commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made Mr. Trump increasingly angry on Friday, according to several people familiar with his thinking. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on \u201cdishonest media\u201d coverage \u2014 mostly referring to a Twitter post from a New York Times reporter showing side-by-side frames of Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd and Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. But most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president. However, in his remarks at the C.I.A., he wandered off topic several times, at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39 (he is 70); reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying, \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person\u201d; and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy. Photo The photograph of President Trump\u2019s inauguration that was displayed during Mr. Spicer\u2019s briefing. Mr. Trump said that when he looked out from his podium, \u201cit looked like a million, a million and a half people.\u201d Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times \u201cProbably everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same wavelength, folks.\u201d But most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media. And Mr. Spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the White House briefing room. But his appearance, according to the people familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking, went too far, in the president\u2019s opinion. Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance at the C.I.A. touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials. Nick Shapiro, who served as chief of staff to John O. Brennan, who resigned Friday as the C.I.A. director, said Mr. Brennan \u201cis deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump \u2019s despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of C.I.A.\u2019s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. \u201cBrennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,\u201d Mr. Shapiro added. \u201cI was heartened that the president gave a speech at C.I.A.,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency. \u201cIt would have been even better if more of it had been about C.I.A.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he had had high hopes for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community, but that Mr. Trump\u2019s meandering speech had dashed them. \u201cWhile standing in front of the stars representing C.I.A. personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country \u2014 hallowed ground \u2014 Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cHe will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world.\u201d Mr. Trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\u201d He did not mention his apparent willingness to believe Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is widely detested at the C.I.A., over his own intelligence agencies. He also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president. The agency sees the president as its main audience, and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the White House. Since the election, hopes at the C.I.A. that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what Mr. Trump and his loyalists have planned. But the nomination of Mike Pompeo, a former Army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community, to lead the C.I.A. has been received positively at the agency. \u201cHe has left the strong impression that he doesn\u2019t trust the intelligence community and that he doesn\u2019t have tremendous regard for their work,\u201d Mark M. Lowenthal, a retired C.I.A. analyst, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe obvious thing to do is to counter that by saying, \u2018I value you. I look forward to working with you.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe called them Nazis,\u201d Mr. Lowenthal added, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the intelligence community. Mr. Lowenthal said Saturday\u2019s visit should have been \u201ca stroking expedition.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Glenn Thrush, Michael S. Schmidt and Eric Schmitt.

By Amy B Wang By Amy B Wang January 22 at 6:23 PM Follow @amybwang \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\u201d is one of George Seurat's most well-known paintings. (Art Institute of Chicago/PRNewsFoto) If there is one fact about crowd size over the weekend that everyone can agree on, it's that an inordinate amount of time has been spent arguing about it. Short of counting attendees one by one \u2014 and barring technological advancements that could retroactively analyze images to do so \u2014\u00a0there may never be undisputed numbers pinned to the inauguration of President Trump or to the Women's March\u00a0on Washington that stormed the city the following day. Yet that has not stopped people from trying to come to a consensus. Crowd size was at the center of the Trump administration's first stormy White House media briefing Saturday.\u00a0It was debated on social media, amid an array of side-by-side images and accusations of doctored photographs. Predictably, crowd size was even one subject discussed by \u201cVladimir Putin\u201d on \u201cSaturday Night Live's\u201d cold open . Why is estimating crowd size so difficult \u2014 and so contentious? History tells us that\u00a0disputes about crowd estimates are nothing new. The politicization of crowd sizes in the United States has its roots partly in the Million Man March on the Mall in 1995.\u00a0At the time, the National Park Service, which oversees the Mall, gave official crowd-size estimates for all major events that took place\u00a0there. After the Million Man March, the agency released figures that put the crowd at about 400,000. That estimate rankled organizers, who threatened to file a lawsuit for defamation.\u00a0In 1996, Congress banned the Park Service from using its money to count crowds, and the agency has refrained from doing so since. \u201cNo matter what we said or did, no one ever felt we gave a fair estimate,\u201d U.S. Park Police Maj. J.J. McLaughlin, who had been in charge of coordinating crowd estimates, said in 1996, according to the Associated Press . Still, the agency has continued to estimate crowd size without releasing numbers to the public. In 2009, the Park Service released a statement saying it would \u201cnot contest\u201d the D.C. mayor's office's estimate of 1.8 million attendees for Barack Obama's first presidential inauguration, in 2009 . Other, more conservative estimates have placed that at a far lower number.\u00a0Before that, the record had been 1.2 million attendees for Lyndon B. Johnson's inauguration in 1965. Part of the reason crowd-size estimates can be so\u00a0contentious is that they are one of the few metrics available to gauge an event's popularity, real or perceived, said Steve Doig, a data journalism professor at Arizona State University. \u201cI think it's always meant kind of the same thing: The size of my crowd is a measure of how wonderful I am or how wonderful my movement is,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery political rally of any kind ... one of the first things that anybody who is involved in it wants to do is claim a large and enthusiastic crowd. The counter-argument is often, 'No, it wasn't really that big.' \" [ Listen to 360-degree audio from Inauguration Day and the Women\u2019s March on Washington ] Doig has researched and taught crowd estimation for several years, but first became interested in the subject while as a Miami Herald reporter in the mid-1980s, when he was assigned to cover an\u00a0annual street festival. \u201cEvery year the organizers were claiming it got bigger and bigger and bigger until it got ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like, half of Miami would have had to be there.\u201d Realizing he could not rely solely on crowd estimates released by the organizers, Doig\u00a0began researching ways for journalists to independently and accurately do so. He found one of the most commonly used approaches was the \u201cJacobs Method,\u201d devised in the 1960s by Herbert Jacobs, a Berkeley journalism professor whose\u00a0office happened to be in a tower that overlooked a plaza where student protests took place. Conveniently, the plaza was divided by markings on the ground so that it appeared as a grid from above. \u201cIt was like standing on graph paper,\u201d Doig said. From his vantage point, it was easy for Jacobs to estimate how many students were in each grid, calculate an average and then multiply that average by the number of grids to arrive at a rough estimate \u2014 or, as Doig put it, \u201celementary-school math.\u201d \u201cMeasure the area that a crowd is in \u2014 basically the square footage \u2014 and then divide by whatever your reasonable density estimate is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that produces a reality-based estimate of how many people are likely to be there.\u201d For the most part, the boundaries of crowds are stable; the density of the crowd is where there is some room for interpretation. In\u00a0a loose crowd, where people are about one arm's length away from one another, Doig estimates about 10 square feet per person. In a very tight crowd, where people are essentially \u201cback to chest,\u201d he allows about five square feet per person. Anything less is not really believable, he said. \u201cThere are bad estimates where I've seen one\u00a0square foot per person,\u201d Doig said. Even the stampedes in Mecca, where people were crushed in 2015 , didn't\u00a0reach that kind of density, he added. \u201cThat's like beyond mosh pit.\u201d [ How mainstream media missed the march that social media turned into a phenomenon ] Washington comes with its own set of challenges when it comes to crowd estimation. In 2015, a report by The Washington Post showed that perspective mattered greatly when estimating crowds on the Mall. When viewing a crowd from a low angle \u2014 say, from the inaugural dais \u2014 the spaces between people can easily visually disappear, causing the crowd to appear less spaced out. Because of this, the most accurate way to capture a crowd is to take a straight-overhead image. However, much of the city is covered in a no-fly zone, preventing aircraft and most aerial photographers from doing so. About 15 years ago, Curt Westergard and a team developed a tethered, bagel-shaped balloon about 12 feet in diameter that could be floated to record aerial images of large gatherings, ideally from about 900 feet above the ground. Westergard, the owner of Virginia-based Digital Design and Imaging Service, has since provided crowd estimates for a variety of major events, including the Women's March on Washington on Saturday. When analyzing aerial images afterward, instead of using grids to estimate attendance, Westergard uses\u00a0computer programs to draw polygons \u2014 any irregular shapes \u2014 around clusters of people with similar density. While he acknowledges that \u201cgrids work,\u201d he said that an irregular polygon can often be more accurate, because crowd density is not always consistent within a grid. (His fascination with polygons comes in part from his background as a landscape architect:\u00a0\u201cIt's just part of our training to figure out polygons: for example, how much concrete you put around a kidney-shaped swimming pool,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's calculus, really.\") Westergard and his business partner, Ryan Shuler, try to take politics out of the equation as much as possible. \u201cOur interest is very technical and scientific,\u201d Westergard said. \u201cIf it's a rally for X or Y ... we'll probably just call [the project] by the date. That way, we'll try to get even more scientific and psychological distance between the event and us.\u00a0So while others may argue about it, we just try to put blinders on and just deal with the size, which is hard enough. It's extremely hard. This is not a pure science. You don't come up with a hard answer.\u201d [ Challenged on falsehoods, adviser says Trump team has \u2018alternative facts\u2019 ] Trump has been known to care, deeply,\u00a0about the size of his crowds. Throughout his campaign, the mogul frequently inflated the attendance at his campaign rallies: After a stop Phoenix in July, for instance, he said he had addressed 15,000 to 20,000 people there \u2014 even when the Phoenix Fire Department said that capacity at the event space was limited to 4,200 people, the Arizona Republic reported . Similar scenes played out\u00a0at campaign events in Colorado and Ohio, this time with additional accusations against local fire marshals for their \u201cincompetence,\u201d according to PolitiFact . Given this history,\u00a0it perhaps was no surprise that the crowd-size wars heated up this weekend, in the wake of two historic events that attracted people from both ends of a divided country. Before his inauguration on Friday, Trump had been vamping up expectations for record crowds at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cInauguration Day is turning out to be even bigger than expected,\u201d he tweeted on Jan. 14. \u201cHopefully we're going to get a million people,\u201d he said again in a video ad on Wednesday . \u201cWe're going to really make a big statement.\u201d Regarding the Trump inauguration, Metro released figures Saturday that said 570,557 people took trips in the system between its early 4 a.m. Friday opening through midnight closing. That compared with 1.1 million trips for Obama\u2019s 2009 inaugural and 782,000 in 2013, according to Metro. The day following Trump's inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women descended upon the streets of the nation's capital for the Women's March on Washington, a rally for women's rights that some described also as a rebuke of Trump. The Washington organizers had sought a permit for 200,000 for the gathering. On Saturday, they said that as many as half a million people participated, dwarfing Friday\u2019s inaugural crowd. It was only a matter of time before a crowd-related response from Trump and his team was issued. On Saturday afternoon, Trump claimed at CIA headquarters that, from his view on the dais, attendance at his swearing-in \u201clooked like a million, a million and a half people.\u201d Later that evening, White House press secretary Sean Spicer held a media briefing \u2014 to accuse news outlets of underreporting the crowds at Trump's inauguration. He used false statements to back up his claims, alleging incorrectly that Friday was \u201cthe\u00a0first time in our nation's history\u201d that floor coverings had been used to protect the grass on the Mall. [ Spicer earns Four Pinocchios for false claims on inauguration crowd size ] He also provided Metro ridership figures that were incorrect.\u00a0Several media outlets, including The Post ,\u00a0quickly pointed out that Spicer was wrong on several counts. (Shortly after the briefing, his false statements inspired a series of memes and hashtags on Twitter .) \u201cThis is an appalling performance by the new press secretary,\u201d The Post's Glenn Kessler wrote in his fact-check of Spicer's claims . \u201cHe managed to make a series of false and misleading claims in service of a relatively minor issue.\u00a0...\u00a0Spicer earns Four Pinocchios, but seriously, we wish we could give five.\u201d On Sunday morning, Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway appeared on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and sparred with host Chuck Todd over Spicer's false statements. The Trump team, she insisted, had \u201c alternative facts .\u201d Doig noted that turnout at Trump's inauguration, still in the hundreds of thousands, was nothing to sneeze at, he said. \u201cThat's the other thing that sort of aggravates me about the inflated claims,\u201d Doig said. \u201cThey actually destroy credibility for what was actually amazing turnout.\u201d Still, he said it was clear from overhead images that the inauguration was not, by any means, \u201cthe largest,\u201d as Trump's team had claimed.\u00a0Using his methods, Doig estimates that the crowd size for Trump's inauguration was actually about a third of the size of Obama's 2009 inauguration. Crowd counting scientists came to the same conclusion in a New York Times analysis of photos and videos of the Mall from both events. \u201cWho are you going to believe?\u201d Doig asked. \u201cSpicer or your lying eyes?\u201d A view from the top of the Washington Monument shows large crowds near the National Mall attending the Women's March on Washington.

The U.S. military's Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay Naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on March 10, 2016. (Thomas Watkins/ AFP/Getty Images) Missy Ryan, Julie TateThe Washington Post Donald Trump 's inauguration on Friday elated and enraged Americans, as both supporters and detractors looked ahead to the changes the Republican leader's presidency will bring. For a small group of foreign detainees locked in the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the start of the Trump era has a different sort of meaning: a narrowly missed chance for freedom. The five men -- an Algerian, a Moroccan, a Tunisian, a Yemeni, and an apparently stateless detainee -- were all certified by Obama administration officials as eligible for resettlement overseas. But they did not form part of a final flurry of transfer deals sealed by the departing Obama administration. Now, as Trump declares that no additional prisoners should leave Guantanamo, it appears their long detentions may continue for at least four more years. Trump assumes responsibility for a much more sparsely populated Guantanamo than former President Barack Obama did eight years ago. Following Obama's resettlement of 196 prisoners overseas, only 41 inmates remain today, far fewer than the prison's peak of over 700 under President George W. Bush. But Obama failed to accomplish his primary goal of shuttering the facility, unable to overcome political opposition to congressionally sanctioned steps, and unwilling to resort to executive action to make such a controversial move. Trump, in contrast, has suggested he might put new prisoners in Guantanamo, and possibly use the facility to try Americans. In line with his administration's day-one promise to defeat \"radical Islamic terror groups,\" Trump, like Republicans in Congress, believes prisoner resettlement undermines American security. Like nearly all remaining prisoners, none of the five men now expected to be marooned at Guant\u00e1namo has been convicted of a crime. Two of the men, an Algerian named Sufyian Barhoumi and Moroccan Abdul Latif Nasir, now face indefinite detention after the defeat of an eleventh-hour court action aimed at securing their release. Attorneys for the men, who were not included in a final set of notifications officials submitted to Congress regarding upcoming transfers, say their repatriation did not come together for reasons unrelated to their backgrounds or security profiles. The legal teams requested that judges waive steps required before transfers can take place, including a 30-day congressional notice period, to allow the men to be moved before Trump took office. Last week, judges denied those requests. According to prisoner profiles made public by WikiLeaks, Barhoumi, the Algerian, is believed to have lived in Europe before being arrested in Pakistan in 2002. The 43-year-old has been held at Guantanamo since June of that year. Nasir, 51, was captured in Afghanistan in late 2001 and held at an American detention center there before being brought to Guantanamo in May 2002. Thomas A. Durkin, who represented Nasir, said that Morocco had complied with U.S. requirements regarding security guarantees for transferred prisoners. It had just been done so too late. For the court to deny the transfer was to leave his client in a \"legal black hole,\" Durkin argued in a filing this week. \"His whole life hangs in the balance due to a mere technicality that the courts and more importantly the Obama Justice Department didn't have the courage to act on,\" he said Friday. He called the fact that Nasir and others would remain at Guantanamo despite having been deemed eligible for resettlement \"disgraceful.\" Another of the five is Rida bin Saleh al Yazidi, a 51-year-old Tunisian who military officials believed lived in Italy and was later captured in Pakistan. He was taken to Guantanamo in January 2002. Officials said they had identified a country that was willing to accept him, but Yazidi rejected a proposal to be resettled there. Military officials alleged that Tawfiq Nisar al-Bihani, a 44-year-old Yemeni citizen, smuggled himself into Iran from Afghanistan in 2001, and was later captured by Iranian authorities. He was held by Afghan officials before being turned over the United States in 2002, and arrived at Guantanamo in February 2003. Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who stepped down last\u00a0week, did not support Bihari's transfer due to security concerns, the officials said. The final prisoner is a man of undetermined nationality named Muieen al-Din Jamal al-Din al-Sattar. According to U.S. officials, Sattar is a member of the Rohingya, a Bengali-speaking Muslim minority that lives in large numbers in Burma. While Sattar was born in the United Arab Emirates in 1974, he is considered stateless. Officials were unable to find a home for him, partly for that reason and partly because of foreign officials' concerns about the threat Sattar might pose. He has been at Guant\u00e1namo since February 2002. Many of the other detainees remaining at Guantanamo are expected to be held indefinitely without charges due to a lack of admissible evidence against them. Wells Dixon, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), which represented the Algerian prisoner, said the Obama administration's instinct to fight off legal challenges like the one about Barhoumi and Nasir was partly to blame for the fact the prison remains open. He said the government's rejection of the legal petition to free the two prisoners, just days before Trump took office and shut down future transfer options, meant the men \"may remain stranded at Guantanamo forever.\" The Washington Post ",

At least 14 people died and around two dozen were injured in Georgia from tornadoes early Sunday morning, following four tornado-related deaths that occurred in Mississippi on Saturday morning. According to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, three people died in Dougherty County near Albany, seven in Cook County near Adel, and two people died in both Berrien and Brooks counties. Branden Camp/AP Photo Marilyn Bullard makes her way to her parents home that was damaged by a tornado, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Georgia. After storms ripped through the region overnight, more tornado watches were issued today for the Panhandle of Florida and southern Alabama, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency has issued a state of emergency for the seven south central Georgia counties impacted by the storm. \"The National Weather Service predicts a third wave of severe weather today, which may reach as far north as metro Atlanta. I urge all Georgians to exercise caution and vigilance in order to remain safe and prevent further loss of life or injuries,\" Gov. Nathan Deal said in a statement. Branden Camp/AP Photo Jenny Bullard carries a pair of boots from her home that was damaged by a tornado, Jan. 22, 2017, in Adel, Georgia. President Trump expressed condolences to the people of Georgia affected by the tornadoes to the press today from the White House. \"I want to start off by telling you I just spoke with Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia, great state, great people,\" Trump said. \"Florida affected, Alabama affected by the tornadoes, and just expressed our sincere condolences for the lives taken.\" Trump added that the tornadoes \"were vicious and powerful and strong,\" and said that people suffered as a result of them. \"So we'll be helping out the state of Georgia,\" Trump added.

By NICHOLAS FANDOS Continue reading the main story Photo Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, before speaking live on TV outside the White House on Sunday. Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press WASHINGTON \u2014 Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the White House had put forth \u201calternative facts\u201d to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. She made this assertion \u2014 which quickly went viral on social media \u2014 a day after Mr. Trump and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had accused the news media of reporting falsehoods about the inauguration and Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the intelligence agencies. In leveling this attack, the president and Mr. Spicer made a series of false statements. Here are the facts. In a speech at the C.I.A. on Saturday, Mr. Trump said the news media had constructed a feud between him and the intelligence community. \u201cThey sort of made it sound like I had a \u2018feud\u2019 with the intelligence community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is exactly the opposite, and they understand that, too.\u201d In fact, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intelligence agencies during his transition to office and has questioned their conclusion that Russia meddled in the election to aid his candidacy. He called their assessment \u201cridiculous\u201d and suggested that it had been politically motivated. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him, Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material. \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d he asked in a post on Twitter. Advertisement \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 11, 2017 Mr. Trump said of his inauguration crowd, \u201cIt looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.\u201d Aerial photographs clearly show that the crowd did not stretch to the Washington Monument. An analysis by The New York Times , comparing photographs from Friday to ones taken of Barack Obama \u2019s 2009 inauguration, showed that Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd was significantly smaller and less than the 1.5 million people he claimed. An expert hired by The Times found that Mr. Trump\u2019s crowd on the National Mall was about a third of the size of Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009. Mr. Trump said that though he had been \u201chit by a couple of drops\u201d of rain as he began his address on Inauguration Day, the sky soon cleared. \u201cAnd the truth is, it stopped immediately, and then became sunny,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I walked off, and it poured after I left. It poured.\u201d The truth is that it began to rain lightly almost exactly as Mr. Trump began to speak and continued to do so throughout his remarks, which lasted about 18 minutes, and after he finished. Speaking later on Saturday in the White House briefing room, Mr. Spicer amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u201d he said. There is no evidence to support this claim. Not only was Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd far smaller than Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2009, but he also drew fewer television viewers in the United States (30.6 million) than Mr. Obama did in 2009 (38 million) and Ronald Reagan did in 1981 (42 million), Nielsen reported. Figures for online viewership were not available. Estimates put the crowd gathered for President Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration at far less than President Obama\u2019s in 2009. Mr. Spicer said that Washington\u2019s Metro system had greater ridership on Friday than it did for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration. \u201cWe know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama\u2019s last inaugural,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. Neither number is correct, according to the transit system, which reported 570,557 entries into the rail system on Friday, compared with 782,000 on Inauguration Day in 2013. Mr. Spicer said that \u201cthis was the first time in our nation\u2019s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.\u201d In fact, similar coverings were used during the 2013 inauguration to protect the grass. The coverings did not hamper analyses of the crowd size. Mr. Spicer said that it was \u201cthe first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\u201d The Secret Service said security measures were largely unchanged this year. There were also few reports of long lines or delays. Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting. ",

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gathered the press to deliver a five-minute statement Saturday in which he issued multiple falsehoods, declaring erroneously the number of people who used the D.C. metro on Friday, that there was a change in security measures this year and that \"this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" \"These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,\" Spicer said Saturday. However, crowd size experts told the New York Times they estimated Trump's audience at fewer than 200,000 people, and widely distributed side-by-side photographs showed the stark contrast between the comparatively sparse crowd for Trump's inauguration and the record-setting crowd for Obama's first. Asked on \"Meet the Press\" why Spicer used his first appearance before the press to dispute a minimal issue like the inauguration crowd size, and why he used falsehoods to do so, Conway pushed back. \"You're saying it's a falsehood and Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,\" she told NBC's Chuck Todd. She then went on to echo Spicer's claim on Saturday that it wasn't possible to count the crowd, despite Trump's team's accompanying insistence that it was the \"largest audience.\" \"I don't think you can prove those numbers one way or another. There's no way to quantify crowd numbers,\" Conway said. Conway also suggested that Todd's insistence on asking why Spicer delivered a demonstrably false statement could affect the White House's treatment of the media. \"If we're going to keep referring to the press secretary in those types of terms I think we're going to have to rethink our relationship here,\" she said.

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! Got it (Reuters) By Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan By Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan January 22 at 12:44 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @WaPoSean President Trump\u2019s executive order instructing federal agencies to grant relief to constituencies affected by the Affordable Care Act has begun to reverberate throughout the nation\u2019s health-care system, injecting further uncertainty into an already unsettled insurance landscape. The political signal of the order, which Trump signed just hours after being sworn into office, was clear: Even before the Republican-led Congress acts to repeal the 2010 law, the new administration will move swiftly to unwind as many elements as it can on its own \u2014 elements that have changed how 20 million Americans get health coverage and what benefits insurers must offer some of their customers. But the practical implications of Trump\u2019s action on Friday are harder to decipher. Its language instructs all federal agencies to \u201cwaive, defer, grant \u00adexemptions from or delay\u201d any part of the law that imposes a financial or regulatory burden on those affected by it. That would cover consumers, doctors, hospitals and other providers, as well as insurers and drug companies. The prospect of what could flow from pulling back or eliminating administrative rules \u2014 including no longer enforcing the individual mandate, which requires Americans to get coverage or pay an annual penalty, and ending health plans\u2019 \u201cessential benefits\u201d \u2014 could affect how many people sign up on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces before open enrollment ends Jan. 31 for 2017 coverage, as well as how many companies decide to participate next year. Robert Laszewski, president of the consulting firm Health Policy and Strategy Associates, called the executive order a \u201cbomb\u201d lobbed into the law\u2019s \u201calready shaky\u201d insurance market. Given the time it will take Republicans to fashion a replacement, he expects that federal and state insurance exchanges will continue to operate at least through 2018. \u201cInstead of sending a signal that there\u2019s going to be an orderly transition, they\u2019ve sent a signal that it\u2019s going to be a disorderly transition,\u201d said Laszewski, a longtime critic of the law , which is also known as Obamacare. \u201cHow does the Trump administration think this is not going to make the situation worse?\u201d [Trump signs executive order that could effectively gut Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate] Teresa Miller, Pennsylvania\u2019s insurance commissioner, said Saturday that several insurers on her state\u2019s exchange \u201cseriously considered leaving the market last year\u201d and that Trump\u2019s action could propel them to indeed abandon it in 2018. In fact, she added, some have raised the possibility of withdrawing from the ACA\u2019s exchanges during 2017, which would mean consumers could keep their plans but no longer receive federal subsidies to help them afford the coverage. \u201cThat would create a nightmare scenario,\u201d Miller said. As of this year, nearly a third of all counties nationwide have just one insurer in the federal marketplace, and almost two-thirds have two or fewer insurers. The White House did not return requests for comment over the weekend. On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders offered cautious praise for the president\u2019s executive order. Yet more broadly, the GOP remains in a state of uncertainty on health care, with unresolved questions about the path forward. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was briefed on the details of Trump\u2019s order only Thursday, according to a GOP aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks. Alexander said in a statement late Friday that Trump was \u201cright to make the urgent work of rescuing Americans trapped in a collapsing Obamacare system a top priority on his first day in office.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace,\u201d focused primarily on what Trump could do through executive action. \u201cPresident Obama implemented a lot of Obamacare himself, so President Trump will be able to undo a lot of it himself,\u201d McConnell said. Asked whether he knew what the new president\u2019s replacement plan is, he said Senate Republicans are working with the administration \u201cto have an orderly process.\u201d The GOP-led House and Senate have passed a budget measure that was designed to serve as a vehicle for repealing key parts of the law. But they have yet to rally around a consensus idea for when and what to do to replace it. They were placed under further pressure to act quickly after Trump vowed \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d in a recent interview with The Washington Post. A key Trump ally said Sunday that the president\u2019s decision to sign the order on his first day in office, coupled with his recent comments about moving swiftly on repealing and replacing the law, has applied pressure on GOP lawmakers to act faster than they might have initially planned. \u201cI think Trump has consistently moved that needle with the mindset of our conference,\u201d Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said. [ Pressure mounts on GOP for an Obamacare replacement ] Democratic leaders, however, are casting the executive order as evidence that Republicans are in a state of disarray on health care. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do. They can repeal, but they don\u2019t have a plan for replace,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said in an interview that aired Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s executive order just mirrored that.\u201d At least publicly, the insurance industry\u2019s reaction has been muted. America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Kristine Grow, whose group represents nearly 1,300 insurers, said in an email Saturday that it is \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d what the executive order will mean for the industry. \u201cThere is no question the individual health-care market has been challenged from the start,\u201d Grow said. \u201cThe president said he would take swift action to move our country to improve it, and he has.\u201d A key question following Trump\u2019s order is what actions Republican-led states might take to withdraw from key provisions of the law. Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s (R) office said Saturday that he was reviewing his options. Jackie Schutz, a Scott spokeswoman, said the governor \u201cappreciates\u201d that the new administration is \u201cswiftly taking action.\u201d But as to how and when Scott would seek to take advantage of it, \u201cwe\u2019re still looking into it to see what it specifically means to Florida,\u201d Schutz said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who met with Senate Finance Committee Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and nearly a dozen other GOP governors on Thursday to discuss the future of Medicaid, said afterward that there are \u201csome fundamental things that we can do that can settle people down so they are not worried they are going to lose their coverage but that at the same time bring significant changes to the Obamacare package.\u201d Kasich, who expanded Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act, said that one option he favors is paring Medicaid coverage to people with incomes up to 100 percent of the poverty level, rather than the current 138 percent, and then letting those above 100 percent go on the marketplace to get coverage. Asked whether he could guarantee that none of his constituents would lose health-care coverage, Kasich responded, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything.\u201d Even if the new administration is eager to grant waivers to states, it does not have the political appointees in place at the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments to do so. But timing is important. While the exact deadline varies depending on the state, insurers generally must decide by the spring whether to participate in Affordable Care Act marketplaces for the next year and, if so, propose the rates they would like to charge. Their decisions could be complicated if the president\u2019s order results in rule changes that affect the benefits those health plans must include \u2013 or alters rules in other ways that, in turn, prompt fewer healthy customers to seek coverage through the marketplaces. Chris Jennings, who served as a senior White House adviser on health care in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said that in the health-care arena, \u201cmore than any other domestic policy, details matter. Plans, they live off a comma, or an incentive, or a disincentive, or a penalty, or an enforcement mechanism.\u201d Ceci Connolly, president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, said her members are in a particularly difficult position because they are unlike large national companies that can \u201cpick and choose\u201d which markets they operate in under the federal exchange. \u201cLocal nonprofit plans are in their communities, so they can\u2019t look around for certain markets and pull out of ones that they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Connolly, who added that her group\u2019s \u201cbiggest concern\u201d is that some consumers might stop paying their premiums if they believe they will not be penalized for lacking coverage. That could lead to hospital and doctor visits that would not be reimbursed, which then would impose costs on providers and insurers more broadly. With fewer than 10 days to go in the current enrollment period, Mila Kofman, executive director of the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange Authority, said that \u201call of this discussion of whether or not people will have access to affordable quality health insurance is very unsettling.\u201d Some residents have asked Kofman whether she can assure them they will get the same health benefits if Congress and the administration overhaul the system in the coming months. \u201cI tell them, \u2018Sign up. We will certainly do everything we can to ensure that you\u2019ll have access to quality health insurance.\u2019 \u201d Yet Mona Mangat, a solo practitioner in allergy and immunology in St. Petersburg, Fla., is not sure what to say when patients ask her whether they will be able to afford the kind of prescriptions and services they have taken advantage of under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have an answer for them,\u201d Mangat said. \u201cI say, \u2018Oh my God, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. national ",
