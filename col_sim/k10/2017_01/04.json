Officers were dispatched to the intersection of 54th Street and Springfield Avenue just before 4 p.m. Monday after two families reportedly gathered at the location to fight. *Warning: This video contains offensive language and violent images A video posted by AwezomeTay (@hostgodawezome) on Jan 2, 2017 at 1:57pm PST Witnesses began recording as police arrived on the scene and attempted to get the brawling families to disperse. The videos show one unidentified officer grabbing a 16-year-old girl and pushing her away. The two then get into another confrontation, which ended with the officer throwing the girl to the ground and repeatedly throwing punches while on top of her. The Philadelphia Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Unit is investigating, but Commissioner Richard Ross says what people missed was the teen girl slapping the officer before the video began. \u201cThat was not shown, but she admitted that she did that,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThe officer admitted that she threw her to the ground and she jumped on top of her, and that she struck her several times. And the female said that she also struck the officer while she was on the ground as well.\u201d In a news release, police said that the 16-year-old was interviewed in the presence of her guardian and informed investigators that she attempted to interfere with officers as they were attempting to arrest one of the individual engaged in the fights. The teen allegedly admits to striking the officer and knocking the glasses off her face. A struggle then ensued where the teen was grabbed by her hair and taken to the ground and both the officer and the teen exchanged punches. The officer reportedly sustained bruising to her right eye and cheek along with abrasions to the right knee, but chose not to go to the hospital. The teen was transported to the hospital because of complaint of pain to her neck. She is being charged with assault on police, disorderly conduct and related charges. The officer has been pulled from the streets upon an internal affairs investigation. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Ryan received 239 votes -- three more votes than he received in 2015 -- to remain the leader of Congressional Republicans. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ken., was the lone vote against Ryan. He supported Florida Rep. Daniel Webster. Ryan will lead a GOP majority with an ambitious agenda centered on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, and cutting taxes and regulations for American businesses. \"We've got our work cut out for us. As your speaker, I intend to keep this place running at full speed,\" Ryan said after his election. California Rep. Nancy Pelosi will also remain House minority leader, though four Democrats voted for other members. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who notably challenged Pelosi for the post in a Democratic caucus vote last year, earned two votes. Democratic Reps. John Lewis and Jim Cooper also received votes. After the deeply divisive 2016 election, Ryan pledged to Democrats that he would ensure hearing them out. \"To the minority, I want to say this: We've never shied away from our disagreements, and I do not expect anyone to do so now,\" said Ryan. \"But however bright of a contrast that we draw between us, it must never blind us to the common ground that we share.\" Andrew Rafferty ",

You\u2019ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You\u2019re all set! By Sari Horwitz January 3 at 2:25 PM Follow @sarihorwitz A group of more than 1,100 law school professors from across the country is sending a letter to Congress on Tuesday urging the Senate to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) for attorney general. The letter , signed by professors from 170 law schools in 48 states, is also scheduled to run as a full-page newspaper ad aimed at members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be holding confirmation hearings for Sessions on Jan. 10-11. \u201cWe are convinced that Jeff Sessions will not fairly enforce our nation\u2019s laws and promote justice and equality in the United States,\u201d states the letter, signed by prominent legal scholars including Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, Geoffrey R. Stone of the University of Chicago Law School, Pamela S. Karlan of Stanford Law School and Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of California at Irvine School of Law. [ Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general is shadowed by race and history ] The professors \u2014 from every state except North Dakota and Alaska, which has no law school \u2014 highlight the rejection of Sessions\u2019s nomination to a federal judgeship more than 30 years ago. Robin Walker Sterling of the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, one of the organizers of the letter, said that 1,000 professors signed on within 72 hours. \u201cClearly, there are many, many law professors who are very uneasy with the prospect of Attorney General Sessions, and they are willing to take a public stand in opposition to his nomination,\u201d she said. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) The law professors wrote that some of them have concerns about Sessions\u2019s prosecution of three civil rights activists for voter fraud in Alabama in 1985, his support for building a wall along the nation\u2019s southern border and his \u201crepeated opposition to legislative efforts to promote the rights of women and members of the LGBTQ community.\u201d [ These are all of the law schools represented in the letter sent opposing Sen. Sessions ] \u201cNothing in Senator Sessions\u2019 public life since 1986,\u201d the letter states, \u201chas convinced us that he is a different man than the 39-year-old attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge.\u201d Sessions\u2019s former chief counsel William Smith, who is African American, has said that people who call Sessions racially insensitive are \u201cjust lying. And they should stop the smear campaign.\u201d \u201cThe people making these allegations against Senator Sessions don\u2019t know him,\u201d Smith said in an interview. \u201cIn the last 30 years, they probably haven\u2019t spent 10 hours with him. I spent 10 years working with him . . . as his top legal adviser. There are not statements that he made that are inappropriate.\u201d Allegations of racial insensitivity were made against Sessions at a 1986 Senate hearing when he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be a federal judge. His nomination was defeated after being opposed by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, People for the American Way and the NAACP, which is now protesting his nomination for attorney general, calling it \u201cdespicable and unacceptable.\u201d Supporters of Sessions note that his nomination has been endorsed by Gerald A. Reynolds, a former chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s highest-ranking Republican and Democrat, Reynolds, who is African American, said, \u201cSessions is a man of great character and integrity with a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law.\u201d More than 100 former U.S. attorneys who served under Democratic and Republican presidents have written to the Senate in support of his confirmation. Sarah Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said Friday in response to the NAACP statement that Sessions \u201chas dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption.\u201d \u201cMany African-American leaders who\u2019ve known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next Attorney General,\u201d Flores\u2019s statement said. \u201cThese false portrayals of Senator Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited. From the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association to civil rights leaders and African-American elected officials, to victims\u2019 rights organizations, Senator Sessions has inspired confidence from people across the country that he will return the Department of Justice to an agency the American people can be proud of once again.\u201d Read more: ",

By Paul Kane January 3 at 7:12 PM Follow @pkcapitol The Trump effect has landed forcefully on Capitol Hill. Less than two hours after President-elect Donald Trump criticized House Republicans \u2014 in a tweet, of course \u2014 for trying to gut an ethics investigative unit on the first day of business in the new Congress, those plans lay in shambles in the Republican conference\u2019s meeting room. The immediate outcome was to keep intact the independent Office of Congressional Ethics \u2014 exactly the status quo that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and his leadership team had hoped to protect. That result, however, appeared largely due to Trump\u2019s intervention rather than Ryan\u2019s maneuvering. There was a broader outcome, too: The unruly Republican caucus that has wreaked havoc in the House for the entirety of Ryan\u2019s tenure fell in line. And there were signs, judging from Tuesday\u2019s drama, that they might continue doing so this year. House leaders attributed the reversal of the ethics decision to many factors, not the least of which was a rough period of media coverage highlighting how the lawmakers were abandoning Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington of corruption. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) But lurking behind it all was the prospect that Trump\u2019s political power, now aimed at Capitol Hill, can instill fear and force action. By aiming his social-media fire hose on fellow Republicans \u2014 even as he assembles a Cabinet filled with billionaires and insiders \u2014 Trump made clear that he intends to continue giving voice to the anti-establishment outsiders that propelled him through the Republican primaries against much more seasoned politicians and to an electoral-college win against Democrat Hillary Clinton. [ A day of chaos at the Capitol as House GOP backs down on ethics changes ] That may give him leverage over those members of the Republican conference who have claimed the \u201coutsider\u201d mantle for the past six years, a period when the most conservative Republicans have gained stature back home by flouting leadership, whether it was John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) as speaker or Ryan for the past 15 months. These Republicans regularly turned their backs on party leadership and claimed ideological purity in their carefully crafted districts that were bastions of like-minded conservatives. They operated on the assumption that the only likely political penalty was a primary challenge from the right. Now, their party\u2019s leader wields a Twitter account with 18.5 million followers. As he prepares to enter the Oval Office in little more than two weeks, Trump is far more popular in their districts than they are. He employs as his chief strategist the former leader of Breitbart News, a conservative media outlet that has included among its top targets the skewering of Republicans not deemed suitably conservative. As a result, the first day of the 115th Congress served as a sort of beta test of how some Republicans will react when Trump sics his media power on them. If the most conservative flank tries to buck Trump on a pricey infrastructure deal, how will they handle the heat from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed? If moderate Republicans try to block his moves on health care, will they withstand the heat if Trump goes to Breitbart to attack them by name? On Tuesday the answer came fast: Run for cover. \u201cWith all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog . . . their number one act and priority,\u201d Trump asked in a pair of tweets just after 10 a.m., adding that there were \u201cso many other things of far greater importance.\u201d By 11:50 a.m., literally 10 minutes before the constitutionally mandated start of the new Congress, Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called an emergency meeting. Some Republicans piled into the meeting with their children in tow, there to see their mother or father sworn into another term in Congress. The night before, by a large margin, House Republicans had approved an amendment to their new rules package for the 115th Congress that would have substantially impaled the investigative capabilities of the Office of Congressional Ethics \u2014 an independent body that was formed almost a decade ago after a raft of mostly Republican corruption cases landed in federal courthouses. The OCE, as it is known, was meant to serve as a quasi-grand jury that would handle complaints from the public and tipsters, as well as reviewing media stories of potentially corrupt acts. If there\u2019s a high likelihood an infraction occurred, it gets referred to the House Ethics Committee, which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and has full subpoena power and can mete out punishment. Lawmakers in both parties have seen the OCE as overly zealous at times, and there have been previous calls to rein in the team of former federal prosecutors who have overseen it the past nine years. But the Monday night massacre of OCE, on a federal holiday, with almost 50 Republicans still not back in Washington, came with little warning or debate. It was an amendment offered by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Ryan and McCarthy tried to tell their rank-and-file they would look foolish if they blew up the ethics process in this manner. The leaders were steamrolled, with Goodlatte winning 119 to 74. At the same time Tuesday morning that Trump was tweeting his displeasure, Ryan\u2019s office issued a wordy statement that tried to explain what had happened, and McCarthy held a media briefing. Neither could clearly explain what would come next. Then the leaders brought in the rank and file for another meeting. Many arguments were made about appearances and how the issue was dominating media coverage. Oh, and someone brought up Trump. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a recent chairman of the Ethics Committee, said that members of House GOP leadership mentioned Trump\u2019s opposition to the OCE changes at the brief closed-door meeting in the Capitol basement, giving weight to reversing the decision Monday night. \u201cThat should be a consideration,\u201d Dent said, explaining how leaders framed the thinking. Within minutes, lawmakers rolled out of their meeting, having completely reversed course. Nothing would change for the OCE. Instead, the normally fractious House GOP marched upstairs and displayed the most unity it\u2019s shown in the vote for speaker in six years: All but one Republican supported Ryan, who lost 10 Republican votes in his initial vote in October 2015. \u201cWe will deliver,\u201d Ryan told the House in his valedictory speech.

Dwane Rowlett, 43, was charged with one felony count of aggravated fleeing, one misdemeanor count of DUI and three misdemeanor counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer. Police say officers tried to pull over Rowlett around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after he ran a stop sign in the 12000 block of South State Street. As the officers got out of their car, Rowlett sped south in his Hyundai and drove onto the sidewalk. The officers lost sight of Rowlett after five blocks but later saw him sideswipe several vehicles in traffic before crashing into another police car, police said. Officers tried to arrest Rowlett as he sat in the driver's seat, but he wouldn't comply and resisted arrest, police said. A fight broke out outside the car when officers tried to restrain him, officials said. During the struggle, an officer discharged his service weapon twice, striking Rowlett. He was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn. Three officers also were hospitalized. Rowlett lives in the 12900 block of South Aberdeen Street in Calumet Park, police said. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Past inquiries stretching over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s more than two decades in public life have examined his family trips and home expenses without resulting in charges. But allies and enemies alike were already saying on Tuesday that this case could be different. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The three-hour police interrogation at his official residence on Monday night came at a high-profile moment for Mr. Netanyahu on the international stage. After years of grinding battle, he has engaged in a guns-blazing war with President Obama during the president\u2019s final weeks in office. At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu has been warmly embraced by President-elect Donald J. Trump, presenting a closer alignment than any other president-prime minister pairing in modern times. A conservative with a stable governing coalition, Mr. Netanyahu emerged from the police interrogation on Monday with a defiant blast at left-wing elites and the news media for prematurely counting him out. Appealing to supporters on the right, he dismissed the allegations against him, insisting they will all \u201ccome to nothing because there is nothing.\u201d But the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, who was Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s choice for the post after a tour as his cabinet secretary, has been a paragon of caution, taking months to turn a preliminary inquiry into a criminal investigation, something that Israeli legal and political commentators said added weight to the suspicions. \u201cMandelblit tried doing everything he could so as not to reach the point of having Netanyahu questioned as a suspect,\u201d Amir Oren, a columnist, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper on Tuesday. \u201cIf, after all his contortions and twists, the A.G. was forced into ordering an investigation that he was hoping to shelve, the default option from here on is an indictment.\u201d After the police investigators left Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s home late Monday, Mr. Mandelblit issued a statement close to midnight, vaguely outlining the contours of the case. It said Mr. Netanyahu was suspected of receiving gifts and benefits. By early Tuesday, Israelis were debating how all this might affect Mr. Netanyahu, whether sitting prime ministers should even be investigated, and if so, at what point they should resign. The months of multiple inquiries have centered on issues involving \u201cmoral integrity\u201d \u2014 a term that legal experts said could include suspicions of breach of trust, conflict of interest and bribery. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of Mr. Mandelblit\u2019s statement was devoted to prior cases that were closed because of lack of evidence of crimes, including a travel expense scandal known as Bibi Tours, using Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s nickname, and one about campaign funding in 2009. Mr. Netanyahu, who is serving his third consecutive term since that election, and his fourth over all, denounced those inquiries in a Facebook post . \u201cBibi Tours \u2014 nothing! Claim of forbidden election funding \u2014 nothing!\u201d he wrote, describing reports in the Israeli news media over the years as \u201cdaily persecution of me and my family\u201d and \u201ccomplete gibberish.\u201d Israeli law requires a prime minister to resign if convicted of serious crimes. But in a precedential ruling in 1993, the Israeli Supreme Court determined that a cabinet minister, Aryeh Deri, had to resign immediately after the attorney general submitted an indictment against him for corruption. \u201cIf everyone who faces an investigation would have to resign, this could turn into a tool used to politically destroy others,\u201d Ayelet Shaked, the justice minister, told Israel Radio. \u201cThis is why the idea that resigning should only be after an indictment is a correct one,\u201d she added. Monday was not the first time Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned as a criminal suspect while in office. During his first term, in the late 1990s, he was queried in a case that involved the appointment of an attorney general as part of what the police said was a political deal involving Mr. Deri. Mr. Netanyahu was never charged in that case, nor in several others for which he was investigated while out of office. Other Israeli prime ministers, too, have been the subject of police investigations into allegations of campaign irregularities and corruption. Ehud Barak and Ariel Sharon were both questioned. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from office in 2008, even before any charges were filed against him, and became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison . He is serving a 19-month term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Moshe Katsav, a former president, was recently released from prison after serving five years of a seven-year term for rape. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some of Mr. Olmert\u2019s supporters felt he was the victim of an overzealous state prosecutor, though many Israelis take pride in the fact that nobody is immune from the law. But with Netanyahu loyalists asserting that he is the victim of a political witch hunt, some right-wing legislators are now trying to advance a bill that would ban criminal investigations of incumbent prime ministers. (Any such legislation would likely come too late to spare Mr. Netanyahu.) Critics of the bill argue that such a ban would be problematic in a small country like Israel, and with a political system that has no term limit for prime ministers. \u201cIf prime ministers knew there would be an investigation only after their term was over, they would turn the prime minister\u2019s office into a safe haven and use the powers and resources of the state to extend their stay in office and avoid prosecution,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center in Jerusalem. Mr. Plesner, a former Parliament member, added that suspicions would still surface in the news media and if they were not formally investigated, public trust in political institutions could erode. When Mr. Olmert was under investigation, it was Mr. Barak, then his defense minister \u2014 though from a different political party \u2014 who pushed him to leave office. Israel\u2019s coalition governments have an inherent weakness, in that parties participating in the coalition are often also political rivals competing for votes in the next election. So far Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party and coalition partners appear to be backing him, either voicing support or remaining silent. But the investigation could last for months, if not more, and that could create political strain. For now, Mr. Plesner said, \u201cwhoever is critical of Mr. Netanyahu will use this to continue to be critical, and his supporters will find their ways to interpret it.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2017, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: In Graft Inquiry, Netanyahu\u2019s Worst Enemy May Be Himself.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Megyn Kelly has decided to join NBC News, and Fox News says her last day on the air will be Friday. The network announced today that Kelly will be giving up her prime-time role at Fox for a multi-year deal that includes several roles at NBC. She will launch a daytime program as well as a Sunday evening news magazine show, and be part of the network\u2019s coverage of major political and breaking-news events. Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a statement: \u201cWe thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to FOX News. We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best.\u201d In a Facebook posting, Kelly said: \u201cWhile I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge. I remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters.\u201d Fox News fought hard to keep Kelly, who became a breakout star and whose 9 p.m. show was the second-highest rated in cable news, behind \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Kelly during the campaign helped turn her into an international celebrity and she was featured on the cover of the New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and other publications. She also just published a best-selling memoir, \u201cSettle for More.\u201d Kelly\u2019s contract at Fox was not due to expire for another six months. Kelly stood to make an eight-figure salary wherever she went. As she talked about her decision, it became clear that a top priority was a schedule that would allow her to spend more time with her three young children, who went to bed before she returned home from her nighttime program. Fox News now faces the challenge of replacing Kelly in prime time, as well as at such major events as debates and political conventions, where she has generally appeared alongside Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. Kelly was an increasingly unhappy lawyer in 2004 when she parlayed a part-time gig at a Washington station into a reporting job at Fox. She quickly rose through the ranks, co-anchoring \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d with Bill Hemmer and then hosting a 1 p.m. show before the move to prime time. In agreeing to join NBC, Kelly said, \u201cI have decided to end my time at FNC, incredibly enriched for the experiences I've had.\u201d NBC Universal Chairman Andrew Lack said in a statement, \u201cMegyn is an exceptional journalist and news anchor, who has had an extraordinary career\u201d Lack said. \u201cShe\u2019s demonstrated tremendous skill and poise, and we\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d The move gives Kelly access to the potentially larger audience of a major broadcast network. But launching a daytime program can be difficult, even for famous journalists. Katie Couric, the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host and CBS anchor, lasted two years in an ABC-backed daytime show whose first executive producer was Jeff Zucker, now CNN\u2019s president. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper also lasted two seasons in daytime. The largely female audience tends to favor entertainment and lighter fare over serious news topics. NBC did not announce a time for Kelly\u2019s new show. Trump\u2019s attacks on Kelly after the first presidential debate, when she asked him about his demeaning comments toward some women, brought her a torrent of online abuse and, she disclosed in her book, her family was forced to use security guards. The two buried the hatchet in an interview that aired on the Fox broadcast network. Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

USA TODAY Carrie Fisher and mother Debbie Reynolds in January 2015 when Reynolds received the Screen Actors Guild life achievement award in Los Angeles. (Photo: Vince Bucci/Invision/AP) 5257 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Plans for Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds to be laid to rest together are moving closer to fruition, according to reports by ABC News and The Hollywood Reporter . ABC News\u00a0cited family sources as saying a private memorial service for family and close friends only will take place Thursday. The network\u00a0interviewed Reynolds' son and Fisher's brother, Todd Fisher, on Friday in his first TV appearance since Fisher died Dec. 27\u00a0and Reynolds followed her on Dec. 28. THR said services would be in Beverly Hills, where both women lived next door to each other. People reported the burial will be Friday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, as Todd said to ABC last week. A public commemoration is expected later, but details for that have not been released yet. Representatives of the family did not return a message from USA TODAY. Todd, 58,  said on ABC's\u00a020/20\u00a0on Friday that the family, including Fisher's 24-year-old daughter Billie Lourd, planned a joint funeral for the mother-daughter duo, whose bond in life was unbreakable. Now they'll be buried side by side at famed Forest Lawn, amidst all the other boldfaced Hollywood names laid to rest there. Deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds: What we know Fisher, 60, died at a hospital four days after suffering a heart-related medical emergency on a flight from London to Los Angeles. The official cause of death has not been established and it's not clear when that might be available. One day later, Reynolds, 84, died at a hospital after an apparent stroke at her son's home while discussing funeral plans for her daughter. She had suffered several smaller strokes in recent years, but Todd said he believes his mother could not bear to lose Carrie, having said in the past she did not want to outlive her daughter.

Joely said Reynolds told her before Carrie died that she was praying for more time with her daughter. \u201cShe kept saying that she wanted more time, and I knew that if Carrie wasn\u2019t going to survive this, then Debbie would not,\" Joely said. \"She would not last without her on the planet. She wouldn\u2019t. And she didn\u2019t.\u201d ",

    "text": "MoneyWatch Last Updated Jan 3, 2017 4:30 PM EST \u00a0Megyn Kelly is leaving Fox News, where she had been one of the network\u2019s biggest stars, for NBC News. At NBC, she\u2019ll host a weekday daytime show, an in-depth Sunday magazine and take part in the network\u2019s coverage of high-profile events. She was at the 21st Century Fox ( FOX ) TV network for 12 years and gained notoriety after she clashed during presidential debates with Donald Trump. According to The New York Times, NBC News President Andrew Lack was able to convince the 46-year-old Kelly to leave Fox News, even though it seemed doubtful that NBC or other networks could match the $20 million annual compensation that Fox offered her to stay.\u00a0 Kelly\u2019s contract isn\u2019t due to expire until the summer, and it isn\u2019t clear if Fox will allow her to start ahead of time, the newspaper said. Financial terms of Kelly\u2019s deal were not disclosed. NBC News didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment for this story. In a statement, 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch said: \u201cWe thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News. We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best.\u201d \u201cWhile I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge,\u201d Kelly said in a\u00a0 statement on her Facebook page. \u201cI remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the (Fox News Channel) viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters.\u201d Kelly\u2019s tenure at Fox News has been rocky since she gained notoriety for questioning now President-elect Trump during a 2015 presidential debate about why he called women he didn\u2019t like \u201cfat pigs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\u201d When Trump joked that he said mean things only about his longtime nemesis Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Kelly responded that his remarks were targeted more broadly than at just the stand-up comedian.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Kelly later complained about getting death threats from pro-Trump supporters. She wound up in the headlines again last summer when former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson accused longtime Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes of sexual harassment in a lawsuit. Several high-profile Fox hosts such as Bill O\u2019Reilly, Maria Bartiromo and Sean Hannity publicly defended Ailes against the accusations. \u00a0 O\u2019Reilly even called the 76-year-old Ailes \u201cthe best boss I ever had.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 Kelly, however, broke ranks and told an internal Fox investigation that Ailes had made unwanted advances toward her when she was starting out her career. More than a dozen other women made similar claims, and Ailes was eventually forced to resign. Ailes has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\u00a0 Lachlan and James Murdoch, sons of Rupert Murdoch, reportedly were keen on keeping Kelly at the network. The elder Murdoch took over from Ailes as the head of Fox News on a temporary basis. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for Fox,\u201d said Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University\u2019s \u00a0Bleier Center for Television & Popular Culture, who called Kelly a \u201cbona fide news celebrity.\u201d He added that \u201cThere has been a lot of animosity between Megyn Kelly and Fox, and I have a feeling that they aren\u2019t terribly surprised\u201d by her decision. Moving to NBC News will greatly increase the size of Kelly\u2019s audience. Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, the most of any cable network in 2016. However, \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d attracted more than 9 million viewers during the week of Dec. 19 , topping rivals ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney ( DIS ) and CBS ( CBS ), the parent company of CBSNews.com \u00a0\u00a0 NBC\u2019s move isn\u2019t without risks. High-profile talent such as Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper tried and failed to attract audiences in daytime. NBC\u2019s magazine show \u201cRock Center\u201d was canceled in 2013 after two seasons. Plus, Kelly faces a challenge in switching from cable to a wider audience on a broadcast network. \u201cOne has to wait and see how these transitions get made,\u201d Thompson said.\u00a0 \u201cSometimes you move from one place to another, and it\u2019s a triumph. Sometimes it\u2019s not. They aren\u2019t going to put Megyn Kelly into a daytime show that people are going to confuse with a Fox show, but at the same time they would be wise to play upon the strengths for which she is known.\u201d Kelly, who has a law degree, could wind up with high-profile assignments like anchoring the news or appearing on the \u201cToday\u201d show given her experience and credibility with the audience, according to Thompson. \u201cNow that she\u2019s with NBC, she could potentially be popping up on MSNBC,\u201d noted for being the liberal answer to Fox News, \u201cwhich is funny,\u201d Thompson said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

    "text": "Charles Manson reportedly seriously ill, taken to hospital Published               January 03, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Charles Manson, the 1960s cult leader who orchestrated a series of high profile murders, was taken to the hospital Tuesday for an undisclosed medical issue, the Los Angeles Times reported . One of the sources familiar with the situation told the newspaper Manson, 82, was seriously ill, but could not provide specific information. Vicky Waters, Press Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) told Fox News,\u00a0 \"Federal and state medical privacy laws preclude CDCR from commenting on protected health information for any inmate in our custody.\" A separate spokeswoman from the agency, Terry Thornton, told the Los Angeles Times that Manson \"is alive.\" Related stories... Parole considered for Charles Manson's 'right-hand man' TMZ reported that Manson was transported to a hospital in Bakersfield, Calif., about an hour from California State Prison in Corcoran, where he was being held. Sporting a carved swastika on his forehead, Manson was the long-haired, wild-eyed head of a California desert commune in the late 1960s. The \u201cManson Family\u201d was largely made up of runaways and societal dropouts whom Manson controlled with a mix of his charismatic yet calculating personality and hallucinogenic drugs. Obsessed with Armageddon and what he saw as a coming race war, Manson masterminded a series of murders that he hoped would spur black vs. white violence. A failed musician, Manson believed several songs on The Beatles\u2019 \u201cWhite Album\u201d \u2013 notably \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d \u2013 also predicted a racial clash. He ordered a small, devoted group of followers to carry out the murders, although he never took part in the actual acts. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty,\u201d Manson said during an interview in the 1980s. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of.\u201d While Manson may have ordered dozens of slayings, he was eventually convicted for two high-profile massacres. The first occurred at the Beverley Hills house of director Roman Polanski and claimed the lives of his wife, actress Sharon Tate, her unborn child and five others. Polanski was away at the time. One of the enduring images of the brutal slaying is the word \u201cpig\u201d scrawled in blood on a door of the house. The next night, another group of Manson devotees killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Manson was convicted of first-degree murder in 1971 for the Tate/LaBianca killings and sentenced to death. But the California Supreme Court\u2019s 1972 decision to outlaw capital punishment automatically commuted Manson\u2019s sentence to life behind bars at California\u2019s Corcoran State Prison. In interviews, he\u2019d frequently challenge the notion that he was guilty of the murders and never showed remorse. \u201cRemorse for what?\u201d Manson said. \u201cYou people have done everything in the world to me. Doesn\u2019t that give me equal right? I can do anything I want to you people anytime I want because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d Despite his infamous reputation as one of the 20th century\u2019s most twisted mass murderers, Manson still managed to attract fans behind bars and nearly married a woman in her 20s in 2014. The woman, who called herself Star, applied for a marriage license with Manson, then 80, but a ceremony never took place. Manson was rejected for parole 12 times and would not have been eligible to apply again until 2027. ",

    "text": "Close CBS Denver AURORA, Colo. -- Police in the Denver suburb of Aurora say they have found a child\u2019s body amid a search for a 6-year-old boy who is believed to have wandered away from his home on New Year\u2019s Eve. Late Monday afternoon, authorities issued an Amber Alert for David Puckett. Over 150 law enforcement personnel from a variety of agencies including the FBI, Aurora Police and Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office, along with more than 200 volunteers, joined the search, said Aurora Police Chief Nicholas Metz. Tuesday, Metz said, crews discovered a child\u2019s body in an iced-over pond. \u2014 Aurora Police Dept (@AuroraPD) January 3, 2017 The body remains unidentified, according to Metz, but he said Puckett\u2019s family has been notified. \u201cI have the very unfortunate news of letting you know \u2026 we found the body of what appears to be a child, inside the pond, underneath the ice,\u201d Metz said. Before the grim discovery, police said foul play isn\u2019t suspected, but asked for help to find David as quickly as possible partly because of coming cold weather. \u00a0Police said David had wandered off before. Metz said authorities are treating the pond as a crime scene to ensure a throrough investigation. His mother said he was only wearing a light jacket. On Sunday night, she issued a tearful appeal for people to help find him. Metz said it could take time to confirm the body\u2019s identity. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Email A San Francisco-bound flight with United Airlines from Australia was diverted to New Zealand because of an unruly passenger who berated the flight crew and other passengers with derogatory slurs, according to a passenger onboard. Neil Kay of San Francisco told The Associated Press that the man became outraged when two men he was seated in-between spoke over him on the New Year\u2019s Day flight. \u201cThat was it. That was what set him off and he jumped up and started screaming,\u201d Kay said. \u201cThe veins in his neck were bulging.\u201d The 42-year-old American citizen was detained by police in New Zealand while other arrangements were made to get him back to America, reports CBS San Francisco . The outbursts continued for several hours - at one point the man began pulling soda cans from the drink cart - before the crew decided to turn the plane around and land in Auckland, Kay said. Videos Kay shot that were\u00a0 posted to New Zealand media outlets showed the man cursing, sweating profusely while on his phone and telling a flight attendant, \u201cDo you know how cool it would be to have the airplane turned around cause of me?\u201d before he made a disparaging comment about her weight. United spokeswoman Erin Benson would only say the flight was diverted because a passenger failed to follow crew instructions. She said authorities in New Zealand met the man on the plane. The six-hour ordeal wasn\u2019t without an upside. As they waited to board their flight back to San Francisco, Kay celebrated the New Year with his fellow passengers with a glass of champagne. The passengers were put up in a hotel overnight, before the flight continued to San Francisco from Auckland on Monday afternoon. \u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Indeed, Mr. Cuomo unveiled his proposal at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, alongside Mr. Sanders, who called the idea \u201crevolutionary.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThat is a message that is going to provide hope and optimism for working-class families all across the state,\u201d the senator said. If Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal goes forward, it will place New York at the forefront of such efforts; Tennessee and Oregon have programs to cover the costs of community college. The governor\u2019s plan would include four-year schools, including dozens of campuses that are part of the state university system, as well as the city\u2019s university system \u2014 a once-free network whose tuition has risen and reputation has fallen over the last decade. Under the proposal, the state would complete students\u2019 tuition payments by supplementing existing state and federal grant programs \u2014 essentially covering the balance, though administration officials said some students could have their entire four-year education covered. In his remarks, the governor \u2014 who had endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sanders\u2019s opponent in the primary \u2014 picked up the senator\u2019s mantle, arguing that student debt was crippling the prospects of generations of young Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s like starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, adding that many students in New York and elsewhere left college $30,000 or more in debt. \u201cThis society should say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pay for college because you need college to be successful,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cAnd New York State \u2014 New York State is going to do something about it.\u201d Mr. Cuomo hopes for a quick start for his idea, with a three-year rollout beginning in the fall, with a $100,000 income limit, rising to $125,000 by 2019, a timetable the administration billed as more speedy than the one embraced by Mrs. Clinton during her presidential campaign. (On Twitter, Mrs. Clinton said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the governor\u2019s proposal, calling it a plan that she and Mr. Sanders had \u201cworked hard on.\u201d) Still, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan would affect a far smaller pool of students than federal proposals. Initial estimates from the administration said the program would allow nearly a million New York families with college-age children, or independent adults, to qualify. The actual number of students receiving tuition-free education would probably be about 200,000 by the time it was fully enacted in 2019, according to Jim Malatras, the director of state operations. Video Free Tuition at New York State Colleges The plan would give free tuition to any college student accepted to a state or city university in New York if they or their family earn $125,000 or less annually. By REUTERS. Photo by Sam Hodgson for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb It was likewise unclear how much the program would cost. The administration estimated that the state\u2019s annual outlay would be $163 million by 2019, though it acknowledged that estimate could be affected by participation and level of need. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThere are some kids that aren\u2019t getting anything right now that would be made whole,\u201d Mr. Malatras said. \u201cAnd some kids that are in the program, we would just fill in the gap.\u201d New York already offers in-state students one of the lowest tuition rates in the nation. Current full-time tuition at four-year State University of New York schools for residents is $6,470; at two-year community colleges, the cost is $4,350. Full-time costs for City University of New York schools are about the same . The state also provides nearly $1 billion in support through its tuition assistance program , which has an adjusted gross income limit of just under $100,000. Those awards top out at $5,165; many grants are smaller. Costs for the state could also rise as enrollment rises. Some 400,000 students attend state or city universities full time, but the administration projects that the lure of a tuition-free system could increase the student population by 10 percent by 2019. Estimates for other free-tuition proposals have said that costs would be even higher. A 2015 report by the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office put the cost for the city\u2019s community colleges alone at $138 million to $232 million. But Mr. Malatras expressed confidence in the administration\u2019s estimate, saying it had calculated costs considering a variety of factors, including the number of students receiving money through federal Pell grants, the state tuition assistance program and tuition credits. But even some supporters expressed some doubt about how much Mr. Cuomo\u2019s plan could cost the state. \u201cThe cost estimate of $163 million begs the question: If it costs so little, why haven\u2019t we done it before?\u201d said Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, the chairwoman of the Assembly\u2019s Higher Education Committee. The tuition plan will require legislative approval, a potential challenge when the governor and lawmakers have been at odds over a raise and other issues. On Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans offered qualified support for the plan, saying they wanted more details on the proposal and adding that each party had also worked to lower tuition. \u201cWe are pleased to see the governor join us in our efforts,\u201d said Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Carl Heastie, speaker of the Democrat-dominated Assembly, noting that his fellow Democrats had made similar proposals for free tuition in the past. Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Republicans, who rule the Senate with the help of a group of breakaway Democrats, said his party had \u201cbeen fighting for years to expand TAP eligibility,\u201d referring to the tuition assistance program. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis proposal appears to move us in a positive direction,\u201d he said. Bruce Gyory, an Albany-based political consultant, said the governor\u2019s announcement would appeal to the voters who flocked to Mr. Sanders during the Democratic presidential primaries last year \u2014 and to voters with some college education but no degree, who swung to Donald J. Trump in the general election. Such voters made up nearly a third of the electorate, according to exit polls, Mr. Gyory said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re able to take an innovative policy and have it affect a broad cross section of the state and the electorate, and you know it also resonates nationally, that\u2019s not a bad play,\u201d Mr. Gyory said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a very astute move.\u201d Students and faculty also seemed intrigued by the proposal. Katie Montwill, a junior studying health science at Stony Brook University, called the idea \u201cpretty awesome, on the outside,\u201d though she added she was not sure how it would be funded. Ms. Montwill, 20, also suggested that the idea of tuition-free education might not sit well with some parents \u2014 including her own \u2014 who did not want their tax dollars to help put other people\u2019s children through school. \u201cI feel like my parents wouldn\u2019t be for it,\u201d she said. United University Professions, which represents 35,000 faculty members at New York State campuses, offered support for the plan but also argued for more full-time faculty, a sentiment echoed by other groups. For his part, Mr. Sanders \u2014 who was greeted by shouts of \u201cI love you, Bernie\u201d and loud cheers by the crowd in Long Island City \u2014 was effusive in his praise of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s idea, calling it \u201ca revolutionary idea for higher education\u201d that he envisioned would be emulated elsewhere. \u201cHere\u2019s my prediction,\u201d the senator said. \u201cIf New York State does it this year, mark my words, state after state will follow.\u201d Arielle Dollinger contributed reporting from Stony Brook, N.Y., and John Surico and Vivian Yee from New York.

    "text": "(Megan Neitzel) Amazon's Alexa sure is one high-class shopper. The retail giant's Alexa voice assistant aims to revolutionize the shopping experience, but recently delivered a big surprise to one six-year-old's parents. Dallas, Tx. resident Megan Neitzel, recently received the Echo Dot as a holiday gift from her in-laws. However, Neitzel was surprised when she received a confirmation email for cookies and a dollhouse that had been ordered. According to Neitzel, the device had not been hooked up for long, and while she overheard her kids telling Alexa Knock-Knock jokes, the cost of the items on the invoice was no laughing matter. \u201cIt was a $170 Kidcraft dollhouse and 64 ounces, four pounds, of cookies,\u201d she told Foxnews.com. AMAZON ALEXA DATA WANTED IN MURDER INVESTIGATION Neitzel knew the only person who could have possibly placed such an order was her six-year-old daughter, Brooke. While Brooke denied ordering anything, she did confess that she had asked Alexa about cookies and a dollhouse. It turns out Alexa mistook the conversation for an order and selected the items itself. Alexa is not without its SNAFUs when it comes to tiny tots. Just a few days ago, Alexa made\u00a0 headlines \u00a0after it returned a child\u2019s request for a favorite song with \"crude porn.\" Neitzel said they ultimately decided to use the incident as a teachable moment. They have thoroughly enjoyed the tin of cookies and they are looking for a local charity that will take the dollhouse. Neitzel also activated a parental control feature that requires four digits for all future purchases and has warned fellow parents to heed the lesson and set up security measures of their own. AMAZON ECHO VS. GOOGLE HOME IN A VIRTUAL STANDOFF Given that this is their first experience with Alexa, Neitzel said they are a bit more cautious with what they say around it. \u201cI [feel] like whispering in the kitchen,\u201d she said. \u201cI tell my kids Alexa is a very good listener.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Megyn Kelly will leave Fox News for NBC Megyn Kelly Kelly, 46, has been with Fox News for 12 years. Kelly, 46, has been with Fox News for 12 years. (Victoria Will / Associated Press) Stephen Battaglio Contact Reporter News anchor Megyn Kelly is leaving Fox News to join NBC, where she will have a wide-ranging role. The move was announced Tuesday by NBC News chairman Andy Lack, who personally handled the negotiation to lure Kelly away from the cable channel that has been her professional home for 12 years. \u201cMegyn is an exceptional journalist and news anchor, who has had an extraordinary career,\u201d Lack said in a memo sent to staffers. \u201cShe\u2019s demonstrated tremendous skill and poise, and we\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d Kelly will host a daytime talk program and\u00a0a Sunday night news magazine show and will have a role in its political and event coverage. The daytime show is likely to be a morning program that will follow the fourth hour of the \u201cToday\u201d show. No launch date has been set. Kelly, 46, has been with Fox News for 12 years and is the anchor of its second most-watched prime-time program, \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Her contract, which currently pays her $15 million a year, is up in July. Kelly was said to have an offer in the range of $20 million to remain at Fox News as she has long been a favorite of Lachlan and James Murdoch, who run parent company 21st Century Fox . People familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity said NBC did not match the Fox offer. But Kelly had made it clear in interviews and private conversations that money would not be the sole determining factor in deciding on her future. In a statement on her Facebook page, Kelly said, \u201cWhile I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge. I remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters.\u201d Both CNN and ABC had expressed interest in Kelly. But NBC\u2019s emergence was surprising. The network had locked up new deals with its \u201cToday\u201d co-anchors Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie , the only two jobs that would command the kind of compensation that Kelly\u2019s representatives were looking for. Carving out a new role for Kelly at NBC News for the annual eight-figure deal she was seeking is a bold move. It has been a challenge in recent years for TV news stars to transfer their popularity to daytime programs and prime-time magazine shows. Kelly, currently the biggest star to break out of TV news in recent years, will be the latest to test whether it can be done. Kelly\u2019s NBC News deal does not include a role on its cable news channel MSNBC. Fox News has not commented on Kelly\u2019s departure or whether she will continue to anchor her program for the duration of her contract.

GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said the company also made the hatchback available to U.S. dealers. GM sold about 190,000 Chevy Cruze models in the country in 2016, and about 4,500 were the Mexican model, he said.

Ford CEO Mark Fields told employees Tuesday that the company has canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion into a new plant in Mexico, instead funneling a little less than half of that amount into producing electric and self-driving vehicles at facilities in Michigan and Illinois. The move is expected to create 700 jobs at a plant in Flat Rock, Mich., Fields said. But at the same time, Ford also announced plans to expand production at a separate facility in Mexico. [ The real story behind that exaggerated Ford tweet from Donald Trump ] Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said that uncertainty has played part in these decisions. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a close judgment call, maybe people are tilting more toward the side of U.S. production, not necessarily because they anticipate any specific policy change but because they don\u2019t know what the policy environment is going to be like and they\u2019re afraid to find out.\u201d The Chevy Cruze sedan manufactured in Lordstown has suffered from declining demand. In November, GM announced it would eliminate the factory\u2019s third shift, cutting 1,245 salaried and hourly workers in the process. The jobs will end this quarter. The plant currently employs about 4,500. \u201cWe are not reducing a shift based on quality or performance,\u201d wrote Scott Brubaker, chairman of United Auto Workers Local 1714, one of the two that represent the factory, in a message to members posted on the union website. \u201cUnfortunately, the market dictates our livelihoods and this is a business that changes based on consumer demand. To date, small cars as well as all passenger vehicle sales are slowing due to the strong market demand for SUV's and trucks. The auto industry is a cyclical business and hopefully, the tide will eventually turn in our favor.\u201d At Ford, Joseph Hinrichs, president of Ford in the Americas, said the\u00a0decision to produce the newly announced cars in the U.S. was made recently and without consulting people connected to Trump, Hinrichs said. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford shared the news with Trump in a phone call Tuesday morning, though the details of that call were not immediately available. While the Focus will soon be produced south of the border, Hinrichs said the 3,500 workers who currently make the car at its production facility in Wayne, Mich. will instead build two yet-to-be-named vehicles, and thus those jobs will stay in place. The $700 million investment in Flat Rock, Mich. is part of broader plans to Ford to produce 13 electric and self-driving vehicles over the next five years, including hybrid versions of the automaker\u2019s iconic Mustang sports car and F-150 truck. Ford also plans to produce an electric SUV by 2020 that can reach 300 miles on a single charge, an attempt to bring greater fuel efficiency to the bulkier vehicles that many American consumers prefer. A self-driving car intended for use in a ride-hailing fleet will also be produced. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States does not impose tariffs on products imported from Mexico and Canada, but renegotiating the long-standing treaty was one of Trump\u2019s key campaign promises. Since his election, he has attempted to claim credit for saving or creating thousands of U.S. jobs, but the details of the deals are not so straightforward. Trump boasted that telecom giant Sprint was bringing back 5,000 American jobs. Instead, the company is working with third-party vendors that\u00a0manage its call centers to move work to the United States. Trump claimed he had stopped Ford from moving a Kentucky plant to Mexico. The automaker said it had never planned to shut down the factory but had intended to replace production of the Lincoln MKC with more Ford Escapes. And after Trump announced that more than 1,000 jobs would remain at a Carrier factory in\u00a0Indiana, workers at the plant found out the actual number was closer to 800. The Post's Fact Checker took a closer look at the claims President-elect Donald Trump made during a speech in Indiana on Dec. 1, about the deal to keep jobs at a Carrier plant there that were due to be shipped to Mexico. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) [ 'He lied his a-- off': Carrier union leader on Trump's big deal ] Trump\u2019s tweet Tuesday about GM does not make clear whether he is calling for a targeted tax to punish individual companies that shift production out of the United States or for a blanket tariff on imports. Trump has repeatedly said he would\u00a0slap a 35 percent tariff on Mexican products, but there is no framework for a broad-based border tax in his proposal to overhaul the corporate tax code. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has put forth a plan that would fundamentally restructure the way the federal government taxes businesses both at home and abroad. That proposal would allow companies to deduct the cost of goods made in America and sold in other countries. However, businesses that import products for sale in the United States would not be able to deduct that cost. It remains unclear whether such measures would violate World Trade Organization rules.

This confirms that we are in a new phase of \"open war\", where #ISIS feels it can operate more \"openly\" on Turkish soil \u2014 Michael Horowitz (@michaelh992) January 2, 2017 Throughout 2014 and part of 2015, Turkey and ISIS had \"an implicit understanding,\" according to Fawaz Gerges, the author \"ISIS: A History.\" Their mutual approach was live and let live, he added. During that period, Ankara prioritized unseating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over direct engagement in the war against the Sunni militants. A Turkish coast guard boat patrols in front of the Reina nightclub in Istanbul hours after Sunday's deadly attack. UMIT BEKTAS / Reuters In Sept. 2014, Turkey managed to negotiate the release by ISIS of 49 hostages who had been captured at the country's consulate in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. ISIS is not the type of group to give up hostages in exchange for nothing. No details were made public, but some observers suspect a quid pro quo of some type \u2014 perhaps a tacit non-aggression pact. \"If ISIS had any political vision or imagination, it would have maintained that non-aggression pact with Turkey,\" Gerges said. \u2014 Prime Source (@PrimeSourceME) January 2, 2017 In the following months, Turkey did little to impede the flow of foreign fighters passing through its borders on the way join ISIS in Iraq and Syria. And despite international pressure, Turkey didn't join the fight against the terrorist group, even as the horrors it perpetrated became ever more brutal. So what changed? Why Did Turkey Sit By as ISIS Controlled Swaths of Two Neighbors? For one thing, both Turkey and ISIS dislike Assad. Weakening the opposition to Assad by attacking ISIS was not something Turkey wanted to do. Furthermore, many Turks joined ISIS. According to Gerges, intelligence experts estimate that between 800 and 1,000 Turks currently belong to ISIS. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may have been reluctant to bomb people whose families and friends were voters. Why Did Turkey Change Its Mind? As ISIS' atrocities mounted, Turkey, as a major player in the region, faced huge pressure to take action. On July 20, 2015, a suicide bomber killed more than 30 people in the Turkish town of Suruc , near the Syrian border. The scene after an explosion in the Turkish town of Suruc on July 20, 2015. DICLE NEWS AGENCY via AFP - Getty Images Two days later, Erdogan received a phone call from President Barack Obama. Within days, American warplane began roaring off the runway the the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey to strike ISIS targets in Syria. Turkish planes, too, bombed ISIS targets in Syria \u2014 along with Kurdish camps in northern Iraq. Alex Kassirer, of Flashpoint and an NBC News terrorism analyst, said allowing the Americans to attack from inside Turkey was the turning point for ISIS. \"After Erdogan started cooperating with the U.S. military \u2014 at the point, you stop being a Muslim country and you become the enemy,\" she said. Gerges suggested that Erdogan used opposition to ISIS to cover his primary goal, which was to avoid having an independent Kurdish state forming on Turkey's southern border. That, Erdogan felt, would only encourage Turkish Kurds in their effort to create an independent homeland. What Is Happening Now? According to Kassirer, ISIS militants are now taking aim at Turkey's pocketbook \u2014 as other terrorists have done elsewhere in the past. In this case, that involved the Istanbul nightclub that attracted tourists and the wealthy. Play ",

Chief Executive Mark Fields speaks during the presentation of Ford\u00b4s new model Fiesta 2017 in Cologne, Germany, on Nov. 29. (Patrik Stollarz / AFP/Getty Images) Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporter Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it was scrapping plans to build a $1.6-billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million to expand a Michigan plant to build hybrid, electric\u00a0and autonomous vehicles that will add 700 jobs there in a move Ford\u2019s chief executive said was a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump . The announcement also highlighted the importance of hybrid and electric vehicles to Ford, which revealed it would produce hybrid versions of its popular Mustang sports car and F-150 pickup truck by 2020. Ford isn\u2019t abandoning expanded production in Mexico. The company said that to \u201cimprove company profitability\u201d it would build its next-generation Ford Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. But in the wake of criticism by President-elect Donald Trump of the U.S. automaker and other companies moving\u00a0manufacturing jobs across the border, Ford said it would cancel its plans for a major new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. A company news release didn\u2019t mention Trump, but Chief Executive Mark Fields told CNBC\u00a0on Tuesday that the new plans were \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in the direction of the U.S. economy under the president-elect. \u201cOne of the factors that we see is a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment\u00a0under President Trump,\u201d Fields said. \u201cThis is a vote of confidence in what we think the president-elect is going to pursue, and it\u2019s right for our business.\u201d The company spoke with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence about the news earlier Tuesday. A few hours before Ford\u2019s announcement, Trump complained via Twitter that General Motors Corp. was selling Chevrolet Cruze vehicles made in Mexico tax-free in the U.S. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201d Trump tweeted. GM responded that nearly all the Chevy Cruze vehicles sold in the U.S. are made here.\u00a0 \u201cAll Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM\u2019s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio,\u201d the company said. \u201cGM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.\u201d Ford\u2019s announcement was in the works well before Trump\u2019s GM tweet, said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford\u2019s Americas group. \u201cOur commitment to U.S. has always been there. It\u2019s our home. It\u2019s our largest market,\u201d Hinrichs said in an interview. \u201cThis reinforced that commitment we have to the U.S. economy and U.S. manufacturing.\u201d The\u00a0company outlined detailed plans for seven of the\u00a013 new hybrid or electric vehicles it plans to introduce in the next five years. The moves are part of a $4.5-billion investment in electric vehicles by 2020. The $700-million expansion of Ford\u2019s Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Mich.,\u00a0over the next four years will enable the factory to make a new \u201csmall utility vehicle with extended battery range\u201d as well as \u201cfully autonomous\u201d vehicles for ride-hailing services, Ford said. It said the plant will also make the Ford Mustang and Lincoln Continental.\u00a0 Shifting Focus production to Hermasillo, Mexico, from Wayne, Mich., will enable that U.S. plant to make \u201ctwo new iconic products\u201d there that will safeguard 3,500 jobs, Ford said.\u00a0Hinrichs would not reveal what those models would be. The Wayne factory has two shifts of workers producing the Focus, whose production will move to Mexico in 2018. One of the new vehicles to be built at the plant will begin production in 2018 and the other in 2020, so by then there will be at least two shifts operating there for existing workers, Hinrichs said. Shortly after Trump was elected in November, he tweeted that Ford had decided to keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky rather than move it to Mexico. Ford said it had decided to keep producing a small Lincoln utility vehicle at its Louisville Assembly Plant and had not intended to move all its production from its Kentucky facilities. The changes announced Tuesday should not have a dramatic effect on Ford\u2019s suppliers, Hinrichs said. \u201cWe use largely the same supply base around the world,\u201d he said. Some large products that are difficult to shift, such as seats, are produced near Ford factories, so the expansion in Michigan should lead to some additional work there for suppliers.

(Photo: JUAN BARRETO, AFP/Getty Images) The new year is expected to bring the highest gas prices since 2012, and lead to U.S. drivers shelling out $52 billion more at the pump than they did in 2016, according to price watcher GasBuddy. The average cost\u00a0for regular, unleaded gasoline is expected to spike to $2.49 per gallon this year, up from $2.13 in 2016. That significant uptick is in marked contrast to the steady price drops consumers had likely grown used to in the previous four years. \u201cThe era of falling prices from year to year is likely to be over,\u2019\u2019 says Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy\u2019s senior petroleum analyst. Instead, U.S. drivers are projected to spend $354.6 billion on gas this year, a jump from the $302.5 billion doled out in 2016. While a potentially stronger jobs picture may make a steeper gas tab a bit less painful to individual consumers, it could take a toll on the overall economy. \u201cThis is removing $52 billion in one year\u2019s time from motorists\u2019 wallets,\u2019\u2019 says DeHaan. \u201cSome motorists have been saving and putting into the bank whatever they\u2019re not spending on fuel. And . . . it may be an expense that creeps up on them and causes them to cut back in other areas.\u2019\u2019 The key reason for the price increases \u00a0is the November decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u00a0(OPEC) to pare back oil production, and the group\u2019s subsequent success in convincing Russia and several other major oil producers to do the same. Just two years ago, gas prices plunged after OPEC\u2019s announcement that it would produce as much crude oil as it could. \u201cThe attitude change in 2014 opened the door to cheap gas,\u2019\u2019 DeHaan said, and \u201cthe meeting this past November is shutting the door.'' A cross country drive may be most expensive in May, with the average gas price projected to peak at $2.67 a gallon nationally, while February is expected to feature an average price of $2.32 per gallon, the lowest of the year. Those are the traditional months when drivers see \u00a0highs and lows at the pump, with refineries often offering discounts to gas stations in February to drain their remaining winter gasoline supplies, while prices surge\u00a0in the spring when refineries do maintenance and switch over to summer gas formulas that can be more expensive. Summer gasoline is also a primary reason why motorists in some \u00a0major cities may see particularly steep price increases. For instance, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco\u00a0each have a different formula, a \u201cprime example of the logistical challenges that add to the prices we pay every spring,\u2019\u2019 says DeHaan. Still, higher oil prices may get dormant oil drillers in the U.S. back to work, \u201cand that would create a ceiling to how high oil prices can go,\"\u00a0keeping them from soaring to the $3.34 a gallon that was the national average in 2014, DeHaan says. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2j1j9zm NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Prosecutors said that\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers were trying to incite a race war that he believed was in the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter.\" Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was 8 1/2 months pregnant when she was killed at her hilltop home in Benedict Canyon on Aug. 9, 1969. Besides Tate, four others were stabbed and shot to death: Jay Sebring, 35; Voytek Frykowski, 32; Abigail Folger, 25, a coffee heiress; and Steven Parent, 18, a friend of Tate's caretaker.

Manson, now 82,\u00a0has had \"hundreds\" of rules violations, prison officials say, and has been in trouble for having a cellphone and a homemade weapon while incarcerated.\u00a0 Manson has been denied parole 12 times . His next parole hearing is scheduled for 2027, when he will be 92. He has been in prison since 1971 and is serving his time at Corcoran State Prison.

Last week,\u00a0state parole officials postponed a decision on setting free\u00a0Patricia Krenwinkel, a Manson follower and convicted killer, after the woman\u2019s attorney made new claims that she had been abused by Manson or another person.

BOUDETTE Video Ford Cancels Plans for Mexico Plant Mark Fields, the C.E.O. of Ford, said market demand \u2013 not criticism from Donald Trump \u2013 was the main reason for canceling plans to build a Mexican plant. By CNBC on Publish Date January 3, 2017. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Ford Motor said on Tuesday that it was canceling plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and would instead invest $700 million to increase production in Michigan. Ford had come under heavy criticism from Donald J. Trump during the election campaign for plans to expand production in Mexico. But at a news conference on Tuesday, Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, said the company was optimistic that Mr. Trump and the new Republican-controlled Congress would pursue growth policies that will strengthen American competitiveness in manufacturing. Mr. Fields said that confidence, and a desire to maximize use of existing plants, had prompted the decision to expand a factory in Flat Rock, Mich., for electric and hybrid vehicles. The announcement bought cheers from the hundreds of workers in the audience at the news conference, held at the Flat Rock plant. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can really understand the impact of this investment,\u201d said Jimmy Settles, a vice president of the United Auto Workers union, who represents Ford workers and spoke after Mr. Fields. \u201cThis is the equivalent to a new assembly plant.\u201d Mr. Fields said Ford planned to use the Flat Rock plant to produce gas-electric hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle. The plant also makes the standard Ford Mustang and the Lincoln Continental . Photo Ford employees in Michigan cheered the news on Tuesday that the company would invest millions of dollars to increase production there. Credit Carlos Osorio/Associated Press The Mexican plant was to be in San Luis Potos\u00ed and would produce small cars. Ford will still move production of its Focus compact to Mexico. The company said it would make that car at an existing plant in Hermosillo. The Focus is currently made in Wayne, Mich. \u201cWe are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,\u201d Mr. Fields said. \u201cAnd we believe that these tax and regulatory reforms are critically important to boost U.S. competitiveness, and, of course, drive a resurgence in American manufacturing and high-tech innovation.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to protect manufacturing jobs, and his portrayal of the North American Free Trade Agreement as a job-killer in the United States, helped him win the support of working-class voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. Ford\u2019s unexpected news came hours after Mr. Trump turned his sights on General Motors. In a Twitter post Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump suggested G.M. should pay a tax for producing certain versions of a Chevrolet compact car in at a plant in Mexico. \u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201d General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 3, 2017 G.M. makes most Cruzes at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, but last summer it disclosed plans to produce a hatchback version at a factory in Ramos Arizpe, about 100 miles south of the Texas border. Photo At a news conference on Tuesday, Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, said the company was optimistic that Mr. Trump and the new Republican-controlled Congress would pursue growth policies that will strengthen American competitiveness in manufacturing. Credit Carlos Osorio/Associated Press In a statement, the company said it exported most of the Cruze hatchbacks from Mexico to \u201cglobal markets\u201d and ships \u201ca small number\u201d to the United States. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Until now, Mr. Trump has said little about G.M., which is investing billions of dollars to expand production in Mexico. He named G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary Barra, to an economic policy board that is supposed to advise him on the economy after he takes office. The attack on G.M. is the latest by Mr. Trump on a big American corporation. In recent weeks, he has criticized Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One and did the same to Lockheed Martin about the cost of developing a new F-35 fighter jet . During the campaign, he railed against Carrier and its decision to close a plant in Indianapolis and open one in Mexico. Carrier recently agreed to keep about 850 jobs in Indianapolis, although it is still moving about 1,000 to Mexico. Mr. Trump also slammed Ford for its plan to shift small-car production to Mexico, while using United States plants to produce larger vehicles like pickup trucks and S.U.V.s. Ford officials have said the change will not result in a loss of jobs at American plants. After the election, Ford\u2019s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., told Mr. Trump in a phone call that the company had decided to cancel plans to move production of a small Lincoln S.U.V. to Mexico from Kentucky. Mr. Trump then erroneously said on Twitter that Ford had decided not to move a \u201cLincoln plant\u201d to Mexico from Kentucky. ",

Trump tweeted it's not the right time. USA TODAY NETWORK The Capitol Rotunda on Nov. 15, 2016. (Photo: Shawn Thew, European Pressphoto Agency) It was a line buried in an Office of Congressional Ethics report that tipped me off to members of Congress and staff receiving more than 200 improper trips overseas from groups tied to a Turkish cleric now accused of launching a failed coup in Turkey. Under the new rules House Republicans approved late Monday then abandoned Tuesday, I never would have seen the report. The 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign\u00a0oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down\u00a0200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules. But the House Ethics Committee didn't want this report released. The committee had ordered OCE in March 2015 to drop its probe of the Azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who was a member of the Ethics Committee. But OCE refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the Ethics Committee. Under the rules changes pushed by House Republicans on Monday night, OCE would have had to stand down. Read more: ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy The reason is the swearing in last month of Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a veteran state lawmaker who has made mental illness and homelessness signature issues of his political career. One of Mr. Steinberg\u2019s first mayoral acts was to expand access to warming centers in Sacramento. On any given night in the county, roughly 2,600 people are homeless. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The move was welcomed by homeless leaders who had lobbied for it for years. On Monday, Mr. Steinberg said his administration planned to free up at least 1,500 housing units for the homeless by the spring. The City Council and Sacramento County supervisors are scheduled to meet in a joint session this month to discuss the proposal. Some critics are skeptical, questioning how the costs will be met. Photo Darrell Steinberg in 2014. At the time, he was the State Senate\u2019s president pro tempore. Credit Max Whittaker for The New York Times Others have challenged the mayor over his reluctance to embrace a so-called tent city for the homeless \u2014 like those created in Seattle \u2014 which supporters say would offer a temporary safer alternative to life on the streets and river banks. \u201cThat\u2019s the essential first step,\u201d said Mark Merin, a civil rights lawyer who has advocated for the homeless in Sacramento. \u201cWithout that there\u2019s no foundation on which to build a program.\u201d We caught up with Mr. Steinberg by phone. These are edited excerpts from the conversation: \u2022 Do you think Sacramento could solve the problem of homelessness? Well I think we need to aim very high. But I also have no illusions. And we talk about a concept called \u2018functional zero,\u2019 which means that we ought to have more permanent housing and supportive services than the number of homeless people. And then the goal is to match them up. But no, I\u2019m not talking about trying to absolutely fix it. I think that\u2019s the aspiration. But I think it\u2019s our obligation and our opportunity to make it much better. \u2022 How does your approach differ from what\u2019s been tried before? We have a lot of tools in place and we also know what works. What works \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen it \u2014 is assertive outreach by clinically trained outreach workers, case management, single points of entry, supportive services, especially mental health and substance abuse services, and an absolute commitment to increasing the inventory of permanent housing. \u2022 How do you overcome local resistance to adding housing for the homeless? When the inevitable question of \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 arises, I think it\u2019s a different discussion when you say to people: \u2018The status quo is having an impact on your neighborhood and on your neighborhood and city park. It\u2019s having an impact on your business corridors. And it\u2019s better to house people with services than to allow people to live on the street.\u2019 We are so far removed from pinching ourselves and remembering what this is really about, that we tolerate this social condition in 2017 California in America.

Still, no suspect has been identified, he said. The Hollywood Sign Trust, a nonprofit group that takes care of the sign, said it planned to increase security at the landmark, which has been the object of similar stunts over the years. The latest modification appeared to involve some climbing on the sign\u2019s 45-foot block letters, which are themselves perched on a steep hillside. Two tarps were draped on the o\u2019s in \u201cwood,\u201d transforming them into lowercase e\u2019s. Chris Baumgart, chairman of the trust, said his main concern was safety. \u201cSomebody\u2019s having fun doing a prank. I get that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd somebody falls and then you have a tragedy.\u201d Asked how vigorously the police were pursuing the culprit, Officer Lopez said they would try to obtain surveillance video. \u201cBut,\u201d he said again, \u201cin the meantime, we didn\u2019t have a crime.

    "text": "Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images WATCH House Republicans Withdraw Move to Weaken Ethics Watchdog 0 Shares Email House Republicans reversed plans to gut a congressional ethics watchdog on Tuesday after a backlash that included criticism from President-elect Donald Trump over the timing of the move. Late Monday night House GOP members voted to dramatically restructure the Office of Congressional Ethics, putting the independent office under the jurisdiction of a congressional committee. Trump tweeted this morning that the timing of the change was poor and should not have been the first priority for the newly elected Congress. \"With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\" he wrote. He included a hashtag referring to one of his campaign slogans, \"Drain the swamp.\" One of his main campaign promises was to end perceived corruption in Washington. GOP leadership, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Leader Kevin McCarthy, had spoken out against the move. Like Trump, McCarthy said that he didn't think it was the \"right time\" for a controversial change to the chamber's independent ethics watchdog. The OCE is currently a nonpartisan office led by lawyers, former members of Congress and others tasked with investigating alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress. The group may publicly release its findings and call for the House Committee on Ethics to take action. The amendment passed by House Republicans would have limited the OCE's ability to act autonomously and make its investigations public. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Monday's vote in a statement, saying, \"Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.\" Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., the outgoing chairman of the Ethics Committee, told reporters the amendment was too \"ambiguous\" and \"needed further clarification.\" Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., agreed, saying members were bombarded with calls after waking up to bad headlines this morning. \"There was a perception that this would weaken independence ... American people want to see that ethics are for real,\" he said. \"Now we're going to work this through properly ... going to open up bipartisan debate.\" Some members, including Steve King, R-Iowa, voiced their disappointment with the reversal. King doubled down on the idea that all members of Congress should have a right to face accusers on ethics issues and promised to continue to fight for \"full abolishment\" of the office. Asked if Trump\u2019s tweet made a difference, King said, \"Yes, it animated the press.\" 0 Shares ",

The camera never leaves the man's unsmiling face as he walked through Taksim Square during the 44-second clip that was broadcast on state-run Anadolu television and other Turkish media. It wasn't immediately clear if the video was made before or after the New Year's massacre at the Reina nightclub, or how it was obtained. The gunman, who hasn't been publicly identified, is still at large. On Monday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, which also wounded nearly 70 people. The extremists said a \"soldier of the caliphate\" had carried out the mass shooting to avenge Turkish military operations against IS in northern Syria . Funerals began Tuesday in Jordan, Lebanon , Israel and Turkey for the dead, most of them tourists. Mourners wept for the lives that were cut short in the early hours of 2017 at the popular and glamorous club. Thousands attended the funeral of Layan Nasser, an 18-year-old Arab Israeli dental assistant who was buried the Israeli city of Tira. \"She had dreams to work, to progress, to study, to raise a family, but unfortunately the terror put an end to her dreams,\" said Tira Mayor Mamoun Abd El Hai. Hundreds of people attended funerals for two of three Lebanese victims. One of them, 26-year-old fitness instructor Elias Wardini, was recently engaged to be married. His family and friends set off fireworks as his white coffin arrived at a church in Beirut. At least 14 people have been detained in connection with the attack, including two foreigners stopped Tuesday at the international terminal of Istanbul's Ataturk Airport after police checked their cellphones and luggage, according to Anadolu. The Hurriyet newspaper said a woman identified by Turkish media as the wife of the suspect has told police she didn't know her husband was a member of the Islamic State group. The woman was detained in the central town of Konya as part of the investigation. Neither she nor her husband has been identified. Hurriyet reported in its online edition that the woman said she learned about the attack on TV and told police she didn't know her husband harbored \"sympathies\" toward IS. Media reports said the gunman flew to Istanbul from Kyrgyzstan with his wife and children on Nov. 20. From there, they drove to the Turkish capital, Ankara, before arriving two days later in Konya. The family rented a studio there, paying three months of rent in advance. The gunman told the real estate agent he was looking for work, according to the report. Hurriyet said the gunman returned to Istanbul Dec. 29. Several media outlets, citing unidentified security sources, reported Monday that the man was believed to be from Central Asia and may have been part of the cell that attacked Ataturk Airport in June, killing 45 people. On Tuesday, Haber Turk newspaper said the man is thought to be a member of China's Muslim Uighur minority. Turkish media showed photos of a Kyrgyz passport, but police said it did not belong to the gunman. The assailant, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian early Sunday outside the Reina nightclub before opening fire on the estimated 600 revelers inside. The club is frequented by local celebrities, including singers, actors and athletes. Turkey has been rocked by violence in the past year, carried out by IS as well as by Kurdish militants. The government survived a failed coup in the summer and is fighting Kurdish insurgents. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told parliament that authorities thwarted 339 possible attacks in 2016, including 313 by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and 22 by the Islamic State group. Lawmakers were to decide later whether to extend the state of emergency that was declared after the coup attempt. Turkey, a NATO member, launched an offensive to northern Syria in August in hopes of clearing a strategic border area of IS militants and stemming the gains of Kurdish fighters. Turkish jets regularly bomb IS targets in the Syrian town of al-Bab in support of Syrian opposition forces try to re-capture it from the extremists. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Hinnant reported from Paris.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Louisa Adams, above, the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825-29), was the first. She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English, her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors, including John Quincy, who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797. Louisa arrived in the U.S. in 1801 when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted, her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas, and her soirees were the heart of Washington\u2019s social life when he was secretary of state, proving critical to his ascension to the presidency. The question of her \u201cAmericanness\u201d became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to refute rumors that she was British only drew more attention to her background. Louisa continued to be John Quincy\u2019s political partner as he served in Congress after leaving the White House, supporting his antislavery efforts. When she died in 1852, both Houses adjourned. A Washington publication wrote that hers was one of the \u201clongest funeral processions ever witnessed in this city.\u201d Adeel Hassan contributed reporting.

The purported heist took place on New Year's Eve at the West 36th Street offices of Gregg Ruth, described on the company\u2019s website as \u201ca designer and manufacturer of fine jewelry.\u201d The business is known for high-profile collections featuring rare yellow and pink diamonds. Surveillance Video Shows Moment of New York City Explosion The three suspects, one of whom looked directly into the surveillance camera during the heist, removed about $6 million worth of jewelry from two safes, police said. The suspects then fled through the stairwell of the midtown Manhattan high-rise that was blocks from the nearly 7,000 police officers who were stationed in and around Times Square for New Year\u2019s Eve festivities. Police said there were no injuries in the alleged robbery. ABC News' contributor Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent, said some clues could point to the alleged theft as an inside job. \"There are some pieces of inside information as to how this place operated and what its security apparatus was, both outside and inside,\" he said. Garrett also said the excitement of nearby New Year's Eve celebrations could have contributed to the suspects' timing of the heist. \"The utter distraction of what's going on a number of blocks away at Times Square also, I think in their mind, probably gave them some sort of cover,\" Garrett said. New York Police Department officials are asking for the public\u2019s help in identifying the suspects, described as three males. Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD 's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or visit www.nypdcrimestoppers.com. 0 Shares ",

REUTERS/Carlos Barria    TPX IMAGE OF THE DAY - RTX2SV15</p> Close REUTERS Bill and Hillary Clinton will attend President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C., aides confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday. The announcement, which was first reported by New York magazine, comes after it was announced that former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush would attend the inauguration. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter, 92, announced that he would attend the inauguration. Sources told New York magazine that the Clintons decided to attend out of a sense of duty and respect for the democratic process. Mr. Trump won the Electoral College 306-232 while Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, beat Mr. Trump in the popular vote \u00a0by nearly 2.9 million votes. Since the election, Clinton has been lying low except for events for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and a tribute to retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, near the end of last year. She has also run into some of her neighbors in the woods near her home in Chappaqua, New York. CBS News\u2019 Steve Chaggaris contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The rise, fall and rise of R&B singer Sara Stokes Tony stokes said police forcibly grabbed Gabrielle, a student at Macomb Community College, from the apartment, handcuffed her and dragged her down the stairs. \"It was ... white cops, and they seen a bunch of black kids and mixed kids,\" Tony Stokes said. \"This excessive use of force sh#$\u00a0has to stop because black lives do matter. ... We will be filing a lawsuit against the city of Warren and those officers. \"She said she was scared for her life,\" he said.\u00a0\"They put her in the car, and then they pulled her out of the car and walked her around her complex twice \u2014 handcuffed \u2014 but they were putting so much force as to where she had to walk bent over with her arms straight in the air. They were trying to break her freakin\u2019 arms. She was like, 'Please, please, in the name of Jesus, please you\u2019re hurting me. Why are you doing this to me? I\u2019m a basketball player.

(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas and Elyssa Cherney Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune Two 16-year-old boys were killed and a woman in her 60s was wounded in the leg in a shooting in the East Garfield Park neighborhood Tuesday. The shooting happened about\u00a0noon in the 3400 block of West Fulton Street, authorities said.\u00a0 Neighbors said the shots apparently came from a passing SUV. One of the boys was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other 16-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Authorities said the teens were outside on the street or sidewalk when they were shot. A 65-year-old woman in the house behind them was hit in the leg and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was stabilized, police said.\u00a0 Neighbors said the woman had just moved to the neighborhood and the teens were standing in front of her house when they were shot. A 51-year-old man who lives across the street said he was lying in bed when he heard about seven gunshots. He and his wife rushed outside to find the two teens lying on the ground, shot. \"In the past year there's been so much shooting, it's pathetic,\" said the man, who works at a hotel laundry service. He did not want to be named. The woman with him said she recognized one of the boys as her son's friend. She said the woman who was shot just moved to the block and kept to herself. The woman said she rushed across the street to help the boys. \"It hurt my heart watching them lying on the ground struggling to breathe. I'm glad my baby was inside. This used to be a nice neighborhood where kids could play.\" About an hour later, a 32-year-old man was shot in the shoulder while riding in a car at 69th Street and Lafayette Avenue in Englewood, police said. An acquaintance drive him to 71st Street and Jefferey Boulevard where he called police. \u00a0The man was taken in good condition to a hospital. ",

(Ben Arnst / Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows) Joseph Serna Contact Reporter Snowpack in the resort town\u00a0of Phillips, Calif.,\u00a0measured just 53% of the seasonal average on Tuesday, but water officials said there was still reason for optimism as the\u00a0state enters\u00a0its sixth year of drought.\u00a0 Standing in 3\u00a0feet of snow at the El Dorado County measuring station, Frank Gehrke of the California\u00a0Department of Water Resources counseled hope as he announced the survey results. \u201cWhile that seems perhaps a little gloomy, keep in mind that we had pretty much bare ground here about a week ago,\u201d Gehrke said. The statewide snowpack measurement is somewhat better \u2014 70% of the seasonal average \u2014 but still nowhere near last year\u2019s measurement of 105% of average for this time of year. The situation is likely to improve very soon, however, as even more snow is on the way, according to the National Weather Service . The National Weather Service said it expected 4 to 5 feet of snow in some Sierra areas and encouraged drivers to avoid mountain roads.... Higher elevations of Northern California were hit by heavy snowfall overnight, prompting avalanche warnings, as the region braced for a week of intense weather. The National Weather Service said it expected 4 to 5 feet of snow in some Sierra areas and encouraged drivers to avoid mountain roads.... (Angel Jennings) A pair of Northern California storms \u2014\u00a0the first on Wednesday followed by another on\u00a0Saturday \u2014\u00a0are expected to drench mountains and valleys through early next week. Up to 4\u00a0feet of snow may drop at the highest elevations with the second storm, which is part of an atmospheric river, said National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Tolby. The storms\u00a0could contribute to the snowpack at the highest elevations, he said. Melted snow provides about a third of the state\u2019s water,\u00a0and thanks to a snowy winter last year, a lot of the groundwater in Northern California has been replenished, relieving drought conditions there. Another year like last year\u00a0would make even greater gains in alleviating California\u2019s drought, Gerhke said. A series of storms that washed across Northern California over the weekend dropped more than 20 inches of snow on the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which provides water for key state water projects. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very encouraging start to winter,\u201d he said. Snowpack level That\u2019s because the precipitation hitting the state this year is mostly coming in the best way to help the drought \u2014\u00a0slow and steady. Northern California had its wettest October in 30 years, followed by a dip in November,\u00a0but then a resurgence of rain and snow in December. \u00a0\u00a0 According to the Department of Water Resources, the current water content in the northern Sierra Nevada is 68% of average for this time of year; the central Sierra clocked in at 65% and the southern Sierra at 73%. Southern California may also see a turn in the tide when it comes to the\u00a0drought. After missing out on the gains from last year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o, downtown Los Angeles has seen recent rainfall totals not experienced in years. The average rainfall downtown between Oct. 1 and Jan. 2 is 4.24 inches, said National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Sukup. This year it has already rained 5.95 inches. Last year, it was a paltry 1.03, he said. A set of storms heading to California over the weekend, dubbed the \u201cpineapple express\u201d could hit Central or Southern California by Saturday or Sunday, he said.

(Published 3 hours ago) A criminal investigation is underway into an accidental poisoning involving a professional-grade pesticide that left four children dead and an Amarillo woman in critical condition, police said Tuesday. Authorities are looking into why the family had the pesticide pellets, called Weevil-cide, which is only supposed to be sold to people with professional licenses or certification and is marketed for use in rodent control in commercial transport of commodities and animal feed. Video Federal Judge Mulls Fate of Texas Fetal Remains Rules The father told first responders through a Spanish language interpreter that he had spread the pellets under the family's mobile home after obtaining the product from a friend, Amarillo Fire Capt. Larry Davis said. Davis said the product is not available for sale to the general public. Davis said the father does not have that certification as far as he knows. He did not know whether the friend who gave him the product had a certification. Top News: Turkey Nightclub Attack, Brazil Prison Riot, More Getty Images Amarillo police spokesman Officer Jeb Hilton says the department's special crimes unit is investigating because of the child deaths. Once completed, the investigation will be turned over to the district attorney to determine whether charges will be filed. Hilton said other federal and state environmental regulation agencies may also investigate. Pressurization Issue Forces Southwest Flight to Land Fire officials said the children who died were three boys, ages 7, 9 and 11, and a 17-year-old girl. Officials have said all four children lived at the home in Amarillo, which is about 350 miles northwest of Dallas. The children's mother, Martha Balderas, 45, was in critical condition Tuesday at University Medical Center in Lubbock, according to a hospital spokesman. Texas Organization Rescues 4 Young Tigers from Florida Five other family members, including the father and four other children, were being treated at BSA Health System in Amarillo and were in stable condition, hospital and fire officials said. Crews who responded to a 5 a.m. call to the home on Monday originally thought it was related to carbon monoxide poisoning. Texas Winegrowers Concerned About Herbicides Authorities later determined that phosphine gas was likely released when the father took a garden hose at some point Sunday and tried to rinse away some of the pellets because family members had complained of the smell. The water started the chemical reaction that released the phosphine gas. A visitor arrived early Monday, found everyone sick and called 911. Cause of Death Released in Fall at Colorado Ski Resort Phosphine gas can cause respiratory failure and in severe cases can cause a pulmonary edema, which fills the lungs full of fluid. About 10 first responders from the police, fire and medical response departments were also taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, Davis said. San Antonio Records 151 Homicides in 2016, Most in 2 Decades Two were kept overnight for observation because of headache and nausea but were in good condition Tuesday, he said. Chip Orton, emergency management coordinator for the city of Amarillo and Potter and Randall counties, says his staff was working with a number of state and federal agencies to decontaminate the home. Ford Cancels $1.6B Plant in Mexico, to Reinvest in Michigan The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has hired a private contractor to help. Orton said phosphine gas typically casts off in about eight to 12 hours after it's been in contact with water, but emergency workers close to the home were wearing protective breathing equipment and hazmat suits as a precaution. He said he does not know when the home will be safe for the family to return. Published 4 hours ago | Updated 3 hours ago Get the latest from NBCDFW.com anywhere, anytime.

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to hold a press conference on Jan. 11 to address conflicts of interest, though an adviser said the date might shift. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP President-elect Donald Trump is expected to hold a press conference on Jan. 11 to address conflicts of interest, though an adviser said the date might shift. Evan Vucci/AP Some prominent conservatives have signed onto a letter warning President-elect Donald Trump that he needs to sell off his businesses to address his many conflicts of interest. \"Respectfully, you cannot serve the country as president and also own a world-wide business enterprise, without seriously damaging the presidency,\" says a letter sent Monday by a bipartisan group of politicians, ethics advocates and academics. The letter was signed by several moderate Republicans, including former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, former Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson and former Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, who chaired the House Republican Policy Committee. But the signers also include some further-right conservatives, including Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute , and political consultant John Pudner of Take Back Our Republic , which seeks to build GOP support for campaign finance reform. Pudner was instrumental in the successful Tea Party-backed effort to unseat then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican. He also is a contributor to Breitbart News, which has been managed in recent years by Trump's senior counselor, Stephen Bannon. Article continues after sponsorship A Trump supporter, Pudner said that cleaning up Washington had been a central part of the president-elect's campaign and that now he needs to follow through. \"He made such a theme of things like the revolving door and the ways in which decisions can be influenced, not for the public good,\" Pudner said. \"If you have the presidency and people are going to question every week, 'Why is he making this decision? Is there some business angle on it?' I just think it undercuts so much of the reason that people did support him.\" Other signatories included several good-government groups, such as People for the American Way, Public Citizen, Common Cause and the Revolving Door Project, as well as liberal Democrats such as Zephyr Teachout of Columbia Law School and Harvard Law School's Laurence H. Tribe. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Monday that a press conference is planned for Jan. 11 to address conflicts of interest. But she added that the date might shift, depending upon the advice of Trump's lawyers. In the past, Trump has said he will turn over his companies to his grown children to operate. The letter notes that the president-elect has begun to address some of the conflicts he faces, terminating real estate deals in Brazil, Azerbaijan and Argentina and announcing plans to close his charitable foundation. \"That is a good start, but we wish to be clear that the only way to solve the problems you face remains divesting your business enterprises into a blind trust managed by an independent trustee or the equivalent,\" the letter stated.

The theft occurred at KGK Holdings, which specializes in rare pink and yellow diamonds, jewelry wholesaler in midtown Manhattan, located on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building. Investigators said two of the men were seen on the surveillance video attacking a safe before busting the security camera, CBS New York reports.\u00a0 The trio broke into the building armed with a pry-bar and a sledge hammer, police told the station. The suspects took jewelry valued at about $6 million from two safes and left through a sixth-floor stairwell, CBS New York reports. The NYPD is investigating whether the heist was an inside job carried out by someone who knew about the expensive merchandise and where they could find the safes. CBS News\u2019 Don Dahler reports the freight entrance was unlocked, and so were two of the four safes -- unless the burglars had the combination. \u201cThe focus on that day was terrorism, active shooter, violent crimes -- burglary of a jewelry store was not on their radar. That is why these perpetrators acted on New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d said former FBI agent Manny Gomez told CBS News.\u00a0 Police haven\u2019t yet identified the suspects, but the video captured a close-up image of one of the suspect\u2019s faces. The NYPD is asking anyone who recognizes the suspects to contact them. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

Eisenstein Ford Announces Plan to Create 700 New US Jobs 0:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170103210822if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/846480963812\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Ford Motor Co. announced Tuesday it has scrubbed plans to build a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico, a project that had been spotlighted by then-candidate Donald Trump, especially after Ford said it would move small car production from the U.S. into that new factory. But while the move is being hailed by some as a victory for the president-elect, a closer look at the announcement, made by senior Ford executives at a suburban Detroit assembly plant, did not actually reverse the central decision the automaker announced last April. Small car production, such as the compact Focus model, will still move to Mexico, just into an existing Ford plant in Hermosillo. And while Ford will use some of the savings from the planned Mexican plant to expand its factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, that project appears likely to have happened anyway. The maker's new body shop and expanded assembly line will handle production of two new battery-based models that were not expected to be built in Mexico, anyway. \"We reached the point where we believed we could get\u2026capital savings\" by abandoning the new plant, Joe Hinrichs, Ford's President of the Americas, told NBCNews in an exclusive interview. One of the key reasons was an update of sales projections for the Ford Focus. Demand for passenger cars - smaller models, in particular -- has been falling rapidly as American motorists shift to SUVs, crossovers and light trucks. That was a key reason Ford wanted to move the Focus and C-Max \"people-mover\" out of the Wayne Assembly Plant to Mexico in the first place. The factory is being converted to built higher-volume, and notably higher-profit, light trucks. According to Hinrichs, the revised forecast didn't justify building an entirely new plant. Instead, he explained, Ford now can make room for lower volume production at its existing factory in Hermosillo. In the process, that frees up money to update a second factory in suburban Detroit. Even then, the \"net savings,\" the executive explained, come to around $500 million. Ford will also get improved economies of scale for the Focus by building it in Hermosillo, since the plant will now operate near capacity. And, it will save substantially on labor costs compared to what it paid union workers in Michigan to produce the Focus. \"There's more to manufacturer than labor costs,\" Hinrichs noted. Logistics are critical, as is the fact that Mexico has more free trade agreements in place than any other country in the world but for Israel. That means fewer tariffs when exporting the Focus, further improving the business case for keeping it in Mexico. Meanwhile, some of the savings on the abandoned Mexican plant will help Ford not just justify upgrading its plant in Flat Rock, but, in turn, help make a business case for adding two new electrified models that will be produced in the factory. That includes an all-new pure battery-electric vehicles expected to have a range of \"at least\" 300 miles. The other product will be a hybrid-powered model due out in 2020 that would be Ford's first model to allow fully autonomous driving. The Tuesday announcement is expected to be promoted by the incoming Trump Administration as an indication of how its hardball stance on trade with Mexico is paying off - even if Ford will continue with its plan to move small car production out of the U.S. At the very least, the shift in plans will create about 700 new jobs in suburban Detroit. Whether that will be enough to bring a simmering feud between the two sides to an end is uncertain. After candidate Trump started criticizing Ford, the maker's Chairman Bill Ford met with the business-cum-politician but failed to get Trump to stop criticizing Ford. Shortly after the November election, during a keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford CEO Mark Fields went public with the dispute, arguing that the idea of trade barriers, especially steep tariffs, would be harmful to U.S. consumers and the overall economy. On Tuesday, Chairman Ford -- the great-grandson of the automaker's founder - made a private call to advise the president-elect of the news. Hinrichs told NBCNews that Trump had not been in the loop as the decision was being made to abandon the Mexican plant. There appears to be no direct quid-pro-quo, though Ford CEO Fields was effusive in his praise of the president-elect on Tuesday, suggesting he had \"confidence\" in Trump's \"pro-growth policies.\" That may help Ford to step out of the spotlight. Though the incoming president has already turned his attention towards Ford's cross-town rival General Motors. \"Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax,\" the next president declared in an overnight tweet, slamming General Motors for \"sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.\" The nation's largest automaker fired back later in the morning by noting, \"General Motors manufacturers the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio.\" In a rebuttal statement, it added, \"All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.\" Senior officials with several other manufacturers contacted by NBCNews said they are watching developments with Ford and GM closely to see if they will next be targeted. \"We're waiting to see,\" said an executive with one of the major Japanese automakers. Mexico has found itself at the center of the manufacturing debate, and the auto industry is at ground zero. The country has gone from a relative backwater a decade ago to become one of the world's five largest sources of automotive production. Virtually every major automaker now assembles vehicles in Mexico. In the past year alone, new factories have been opened or started by players including Nissan's Infiniti - which is pairing up on a plant with Mercedes-Benz - Kia and Audi. Paul A. Eisenstein ",

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, introduced a resolution that will serve as the vehicle for repealing key parts of Obamacare. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Lawmakers returned to Washington and wasted no time getting to work on the repeal of Obamacare. Senator Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., introduced a resolution just hours after the new Congress convened Tuesday that will serve as the vehicle for repealing much of the president's signature health care law. \"Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation's broken health care system, removing Washington from the equation and putting control back where it belongs: with patients, their families, and their doctors,\" Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a press release posted on his website Tuesday. It's the first step in Republican lawmakers' plan to fulfill their most ardent campaign promise \u2014 to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a Republican alternative. Republicans have to use a special legislative maneuver, called a budget resolution, to undo the ACA because they don't have enough votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Budget bills aren't subject to filibuster, so lawmakers will be able to repeal the parts of the law that have budget and tax implications. Article continues after sponsorship That means they can essentially gut the law, removing all the subsidies that help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance and getting rid of the smorgasbord of taxes \u2014 on medical devices, insurance companies and wealthy individuals \u2014 that pay for those subsidies Enzi's resolution calls on the Senate to get a bill to the Senate Budget Committee by Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers say they don't want the 20 million people who have newly gained insurance because of the ACA to lose their coverage. So they plan to phase out Obamacare over time while they devise a replacement plan that they say will make affordable health insurance available to everyone, without the much-hated mandate to buy insurance if you don't want it. Many analysts are skeptical that this \"repeal and delay\" strategy will work. \"The most likely end result of 'repeal and delay' would be less secure insurance for many Americans, procrastination by political leaders who will delay taking any proactive steps as long as possible, and ultimately no discernible movement toward a real marketplace for either insurance or medical services,\" said Joe Antos and James Capretta of the conservative American Enterprise Institute in a blog published Tuesday in Health Affairs. Antos and Capretta say a partial repeal with no replacement would lead insurance companies to pull out of the Obamacare market altogether, leaving those who get coverage there today with no insurance at all. It's not clear exactly what will be included in the actual repeal bill. The best model we have now is a bill passed by the House and Senate and vetoed by President Obama last year. That bill eliminated the mandate for individuals to have insurance coverage right away but delayed the other parts of the repeal for two years. \"I can see how it would be hard for Republicans to maintain the individual mandate, which is possibly the most objectionable part of the ACA in their view,\" says Larry Levitt , a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"On the other hand, getting rid of the individual mandate immediately risks a collapse of the individual insurance market.\" The ACA includes the mandate to ensure that both sick and healthy people buy insurance to spread the costs across a broad population and keep premiums low. If Republicans follow the model of last year's bill and eliminate the mandate immediately, many healthy people would forgo insurance, and the price of coverage for sick people would spiral out of control, analysts say. \"That is a prescription for health plan disaster during this transition and brings into question just how many plans would stay in the program for 2018,\" says Robert Laszewski , a health policy consultant.

The Clintons will be joined by former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush at the inauguration ceremony in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, aides to the former president said Tuesday afternoon. Hillary Clinton talks with her husband former President, Bill Clinton in Chappaqua, New York on Nov, 8. EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ / AFP-Getty Images \"They are pleased to be able to witness the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 a hallmark of American democracy \u2014 and swearing-in of President Trump and Vice President Pence,\" the Bush family said in a statement. For President Barack Obama's first inauguration, Bill Clinton was in attendance along with former presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter (the departing President Bush was on stage as Obama will be this year). For the second Obama inauguration in 2013, Clinton and Carter were the only two former presidents to attend. A spokesman for former President George H.W. Bush told NBC News that he and his wife Barbara would not be attending this year's inauguration. \"At ages 92 and 91 \u2014 and all that entails \u2014 President and Mrs. Bush are simply not able to attend the Inauguration this month. He was also unable to attend in 2013,\" spokesman Jim McGrath said. Trump's inaugural committee said on Twitter last month it was planning a welcome rally, a parade, two inaugural balls and a ball saluting armed service members and first responders for the inaugural week. Planning for the ceremonies has not been without some controversy though. After it was announced that Radio City Rockettes would be performing at the ceremony, one member of the group took to social media to share her frustration at having to perform for Trump. Play ",

(Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Whatever President Obama had planned for life after the presidency, the election of Donald Trump will likely change those plans. Instead of building on his legacy, he'll be defending it. Instead of helping to nurture his Democratic Party as an elder statesman, he'll be helping to rebuild it\u00a0\u2014 finding new generational leaders who can carry the banner in future elections. And instead of providing friendly counsel to President Hillary Clinton, he'll have a more complicated relationship with President Donald Trump. \"Obama's post-presidency just got exponentially more interesting,\" said Cody Foster, a University of Kentucky historian who has studied\u00a0 the post-presidential\u00a0lives of former presidents . \"Whereas he might have focused on building upon policies created during his administration, he must now defend his administration's legacy,\" Foster said. \"Every policy, every veto, every word must now be carefully defended against an incoming leader eager to blindly press 'undo'\u00a0on everything that Obama created. And President Trump can do that because he has a Republican Congress and is likely to have a more conservative Supreme Court.\" Read more: Trump gives mixed signals on transition with Obama It's Obama's relationship with Trump that will likely be most scrutinized. Presidents have often relied on their predecessors for advice, support and even some sensitive diplomacy. In return, modern presidents have avoided public criticism of their successors \u2014 although they've sometimes conducted freelance foreign policy in a way that's flummoxed the incumbent, as with Jimmy Carter's outspoken work on human rights. \"I don\u2019t see him immediately becoming a Jimmy Carter-like thorn in the new president's side,\" said Anthony Clark, author of\u00a0 The Last Campaign: How Presidents Rewrite History, Run for Posterity & Enshrine Their Legacies .\u00a0\"But I also think he's going to be more critical than previous presidents have been.\u00a0He's going to have to find a way to be anti-Trump without appearing to be anti-Trump.\" After the election, Obama himself described that tightrope as having\u00a0\"less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle\" but about \"core questions about our values and our ideals.\" In recent weeks, Obama has begun to talk more specifically about the role he'll play in partisan politics after the election.\u00a0At his end-of-the-year press conference , Obama said he sees a role in giving \"counsel and advice\" to the Democratic Party in an effort to reach areas of the country where Democrats have not performed well \u2014 places where he said \"Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal, latte-sipping, politically correct, out-of-touch folks.\" Obama said he'll also work to rebuild a Democratic Party that's been decimated over the course of his presidency. Democrats have won the popular vote in six of the past seven\u00a0presidential elections. But since 2010, Democrats have lost\u00a0thousands of downballot races\u00a0\u2014 the congressional seats, governor's mansions, state legislative districts and local offices that form a kind of\u00a0bench for a political party. \"With respect to my priorities when I leave, it is to build that next generation of leadership; organizers, journalists, politicians. I see them in America, I see them around the world, 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds who are just full of talent, full of idealism,\" he said. \"And the question is how do we link them up? How do we give them the tools for them to bring about progressive change? And I want to use my presidential center as a mechanism for developing that next generation of talent.\" \"But the day-to-day scrum, not only is it contrary to tradition for the ex-president to be involved in that, but I also think would inhibit the development of those new voices,\" Obama\u00a0said. That's not a departure from past presidents, Clark said, but Obama may be a bit more upfront about using his foundation as a party-building tool. \"Prior\u00a0to the election, my thought was that both the library and the foundation would be more in line with Jimmy Carter, who spent more time on his foundation and less on his library,\" Clark said. \"Now, I see it more like the Reagan Presidential Center, which is the altar on which rising conservative stars must go to become baptized.\" Posted!

The Pentagon announced Tuesday it has set up a process to reimburse or eliminate the debts of some 17,000 members of the California Army National Guard who got the bonuses between 2004 and 2010. California Army National Guard soldiers watch the arrival of the body of soldier Sean Walsh, who died on Nov. 16 during a combat operation in Afghanistan, at Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California in 2011. Paul Sakuma / AP file \"The process is in place,\" said acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Peter Levine. \"We believe that we can complete all these cases well before the July 1st deadline.\" Levine's announcement came three months after Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the Pentagon to stop grabbing-back those bonuses, which were improperly awarded during the Bush Administration when it was struggling to find soldiers willing to fight in two unpopular wars. Related: DoD Sec. Ash Carter Orders Pentagon to Stop Reclaiming Reenlistment Bonuses \"The error was an error on the part of the government as to whether they were eligible\" for the bonuses, Levine said. \"They may have been misled as to whether they were eligible.\" The soldiers were then targeted by auditors after federal investigators discovered in 2010 that thousands of those bonuses, as well as student loan payments, were improperly approved. The next year, Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe , the California National Guard's bonus and incentive manager, pleaded guilty to filing $15.2 million in false claims and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. Play ",

Tommy Thompson, Dec. 28, 2016, in Palm Beach, Fla. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) President-elect Donald Trump, who canceled a news conference last month amid protests about his alleged conflicts of interest, said Tuesday he will take questions from reporters next week. \"I will\u00a0be having a general news conference on ELEVENTH in N.Y.C. Thank you,\" Trump tweeted. It would be his first formal news conference since July 27.\u00a0No president-elect in the modern era has waited so long to hold a formal news conference, although Trump\u00a0has answered questions from reporters in informal settings, including over the holiday break at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump canceled a press conference scheduled for Dec. 15, one he had called to discuss plans on how his many business interests would be handled while he is in the White House. Since then, Trump has said his sons will direct the family's business affairs, and that he will have nothing to do with his businesses while he is president. The news conference scheduled for a week from Wednesday is \"general\" in nature, Trump said. He will likely face\u00a0questions about whether his corporate plans comply with conflict of interest laws. The news conference is scheduled for the day after President Obama is slated to deliver his farewell address. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

One user replied, \"Aren't you an atheist?' \"No,\" wrote back Zuckerberg. \"I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.\" The pivot occurs the same year Mark Zuckerberg met with the Pope.

James Morales, 35, escaped from the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Center Falls, Rhode Island, this past Saturday, Dec. 31, around 6:45 p.m., Massachusetts State Police said in a wanted poster released today. Officials said Morales broke out of the prison by climbing a basketball hoop to reach a rooftop, cutting through a fence and then climbing through razor wire, reported ABC affiliate WCVB in Boston . Morales had been in federal custody for the \"theft of numerous firearms from the Worcester Army Reserve Armory in 2015,\" and he is wanted \"for an alleged violent and brutal sexual assault of a child,\" Massachusetts State Police said. $6M in Jewelry Allegedly Stolen Blocks From Times Square Ball Drop Morales \"may have suffered significant lacerations during his escape,\" according to Massachusetts State Police. Authorities noted that he was last seen wearing \"gray sweatpants, a gray sweatshirt and black sneakers,\" and \"had a beard at the time of the escape and has balding/shaved brown hair.\" Morales also has a \"large tattoo of an eagle on the left side of his neck\" and \"additional tattoos on his chest, arms and hands,\" Massachusetts State Police added. Google James Morales, 35, was discovered missing from the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Center Falls, Rhode Island, on Dec. 31, 2016, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Jamie Hainsworth, U.S. Marshal for the district of Rhode Island, said at a news conference this afternoon that law enforcement at the federal, state and local levels were working \"around the clock\" to catch Morales. \"Mr. Morales has the potential to be dangerous and could be armed,\" Hainsworth said. He urged anyone who encounters Morales not to approach him and to instead call 911. Hainsworth also asked anyone with information to please call a hotline established by the U.S. Marshals Service at 1-800-336-0102. While Hainsworth repeatedly said at the news conference today that authorities' current priority is to catch Morales, he noted that they would also take a \"hard look\" at the procedures of the prison Morales escaped from and investigate whether the community of Center Falls was properly and timely notified of the escape. According to Hainsworth, Morales was only discovered missing by prison staff at 10 p.m. on Dec. 31 -- about three hours after he escaped. Hainsworth declined to talk about specific details of Morales' escape and the evidence collected in the manhunt and investigation so far. When asked by reporters what he wanted to say to Morales, Hainsworth said, \"Turn yourself in.\" 0 Shares ",

Miller, a doctor and triple amputee, used his own experience to pioneer a new model of palliative care at a small, quirky hospice in San Francisco. By JON MOOALLEM Continue reading the main story First, the back story, because, B.J. Miller has found, the back story is unavoidable when you are missing three limbs. Miller was a sophomore at Princeton when, one Monday night in November 1990, he and two friends went out for drinks and, at around 4 a.m., found themselves ambling toward a convenience store for sandwiches. They decided to climb a commuter train parked at the adjacent rail station, for fun. Miller scaled it first. When he got to the top, electrical current arced out of a piece of equipment into the watch on his wrist. Eleven-thousand volts shot through his left arm and down his legs. When his friends reached him on the roof of the train, smoke was rising from his feet. Miller remembers none of this. His memories don\u2019t kick in until several days later, when he woke up in the burn unit of St. Barnabas Medical Center, in Livingston, N.J. Thinking he\u2019d resurfaced from a terrible dream, he tried to shamble across his hospital room on the charred crusts of his legs until he used up the slack of his catheter tube and the device tore out of his body. Then, all the pain hit him at once. Doctors took each leg just below the knee, one at a time. Then they turned to his arm, which triggered in Miller an even deeper grief. (\u201cHands do stuff,\u201d he explains. \u201cYour foot is just a stinky, clunky little platform.\u201d) For weeks, the hospital staff considered him close to death. But Miller, in a devastated haze, didn\u2019t know that. He only worried about who he would be when he survived. Continue reading the main story For a long time, no visitors were allowed in his hospital room; the burn unit was a sterile environment. But on the morning Miller\u2019s arm was going to be amputated, just below the elbow, a dozen friends and family members packed into a 10-foot-long corridor between the burn unit and the elevator, just to catch a glimpse of him as he was rolled to surgery. \u201cThey all dared to show up,\u201d Miller remembers thinking. \u201cThey all dared to look at me. They were proving that I was lovable even when I couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d This reassured Miller, as did the example of his mother, Susan, a polio survivor who has used a wheelchair since Miller was a child: She had never seemed diminished. After the operation, when Miller was rolled through the hallway again, he opened his eyes as he passed her and said: \u201cMom, Mom. Now you and me have more in common.\u201d Photo A room at the Zen Hospice Guest House in San Francisco. Credit Todd Hido for The New York Times It wasn\u2019t that Miller was suddenly enlightened; internally, he was in turmoil. But in retrospect, he credits himself with doing one thing right: He saw a good way to look at his situation and committed to faking that perspective, hoping that his genuine self might eventually catch up. Miller refused, for example, to let himself believe that his life was extra difficult now, only uniquely difficult, as all lives are. He resolved to think of his suffering as simply a \u201cvariation on a theme we all deal with \u2014 to be human is really hard,\u201d he says. His life had never felt easy, even as a privileged, able-bodied suburban boy with two adoring parents, but he never felt entitled to any angst; he saw unhappiness as an illegitimate intrusion into the carefree reality he was supposed to inhabit. And don\u2019t we all do that, he realized. Don\u2019t we all treat suffering as a disruption to existence, instead of an inevitable part of it? He wondered what would happen if you could \u201creincorporate your version of reality, of normalcy, to accommodate suffering.\u201d As a disabled person, he was getting all kinds of signals that he was different and separated from everyone else. But he worked hard to see himself as merely sitting somewhere on a continuum between the man on his deathbed and the woman who misplaced her car keys, to let his accident heighten his connectedness to others, instead of isolating him. This was the only way, he thought, to keep from hating his injuries and, by extension, himself. Miller returned to Princeton the following year. He had three prosthetics and rode around campus in a golf cart with a rambunctious service dog named Vermont who, in truth, was too much of a misfit to perform any concrete service. Miller had wanted to work in foreign relations, in China; now he started studying art history. He found it to be a good lens through which to keep making sense of his injuries. Advertisement Continue reading the main story First, there was the discipline\u2019s implicit conviction that every work is shaped by the viewer\u2019s perspective. He remembers looking at slides of ancient sculptures in a dark lecture hall, all of them missing arms or noses or ears, and suddenly recognizing them for what they were: fellow amputees. \u201cWe were, as a class, all calling these works monumental, beautiful and important, but we\u2019d never seen them whole,\u201d he says. Time\u2019s effect on these marble bodies \u2014 their suffering, really \u2014 was understood as part of the art. Medicine didn\u2019t think about bodies this way, Miller realized. Embedded in words like \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d was a less generous view: \u201cThere was an aberrant moment in your life and, with some help, you could get back to what you were, or approximate it.\u201d So, instead of regarding his injuries as something to get over, Miller tried to get into them, to see his new life as its own novel challenge, like traveling through a country whose language he didn\u2019t speak. This positivity was still mostly aspirational. Miller spent years repulsed by the \u201cchopped meat\u201d where his arm ended and crushed with shame when he noticed people wince or look away. But he slowly became more confident and playful. He replaced the sock-like covering many amputees wear over their arm stumps with an actual sock: first a plain sock, then stripes and argyles. Then, one day he forgot to put on any sock and \u2014 just like that \u2014 \u201cI was done with it. I was no longer ashamed of my arm.\u201d He became fascinated by architects like Louis Sullivan, who stripped the veneer off their buildings and let the strength of their construction shine through. And suddenly, the standard-issue foam covers he\u2019d been wearing over his prosthetics seemed like a clunky charade \u2014 Potemkin legs. The exquisitely engineered artificial limbs they hid were actually pretty interesting, even sexy, made of the same carbon fiber used as a finish on expensive sports cars. \u201cWhy not tear that stuff off and delight in what actually is?\u201d Miller recalled thinking. So he did. For years Miller collected small, half-formed insights like these. Then, he entered medical school and discovered palliative care, an approach to medicine rooted in similar ideas. He now talks about his recovery as a creative act, \u201ca transformation,\u201d and argues that all suffering offers the same opportunity, even at the end of life, which gradually became his professional focus. \u201cParts of me died early on,\u201d he said in a recent talk. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something, one way or another, we can all say. I got to redesign my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left.\u201d One morning in July 2015, Miller took his seat at a regular meeting of palliative-care doctors at the University of California San Francisco\u2019s cancer center. The head of the team, Dr. Michael Rabow, started with a poem. It was a tradition, he later told me, meant to remind everyone that this was a different sort of hour in their schedule, and that, as palliative-care physicians, they were seeking different outcomes for their patients: things like comfort, beauty and meaning. The poem was called \u201cSinkhole,\u201d and it seemed to offer some sneaky, syntactically muddled wisdom about letting go. When it was over, there was a beat of silence. (It was kind of a confusing poem.) Then Rabow encouraged everyone to remember any patients who had died since their last meeting. Miller was the first to speak up. Miller, now 45, with deep brown eyes and a scruffy, silver-threaded beard, saw patients one day a week at the hospital. He was also entering his fifth year as executive director of a small, pioneering hospice in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, which originated as a kind of compassionate improvisation at the height of the AIDS crisis in San Francisco, when members of the San Francisco Zen Center began taking in sick, often stigmatized young men and doing what they could to help them die comfortably. It is now an independent nonprofit group that trains volunteers for San Francisco\u2019s Laguna Honda public hospital as well as for its own revered, small-scale residential operation. (Two of the facility\u2019s six beds are reserved for U.C.S.F., which sends patients there; the rest are funded through sliding-scale fees and private donations.) Once an outlier, Zen Hospice has come to embody a growing nationwide effort to reclaim the end of life as a human experience instead of primarily a medical one. The goal, as Miller likes to put it, is to \u201cde-pathologize death.\u201d Around the table at U.C.S.F., Miller stood out. The other doctors wore dress pants and button-downs \u2014 physician-casual \u2014 while he wore a sky blue corduroy shirt with a tear in the sleeve and a pair of rumpled khakis; he could have come straight from camping or Bonnaroo. Even just sitting there, he transmitted a strange charisma \u2014 a magnetism, people kept telling me, that was hard to explain but also necessary to explain, because the rapport Miller seems to instantly establish with everyone is a part of his gift as a clinician. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to say that it\u2019s impossible to describe what it feels like to be with him,\u201d Rabow told me. \u201cPeople feel accepted. I think they feel loved.\u201d It\u2019s in the way Miller seems to swaddle you in his attention, the way his goofiness punctures any pretensions. (Miller, who has an unrepentant knucklehead side, habitually addresses other men as \u201cBrother man\u201d or \u201cMon\u201d and insisted to me many times that he hasn\u2019t finished a book in 20 years.) For people who know him, his magic has almost become an exasperating joke. When I spoke to Miller\u2019s childhood friend Justin Burke, he told me a story about Miller running around on a beach with his dog in San Francisco years ago. A man came hobbling over and explained that he was about to have his own leg amputated and that just watching Miller run around like this, on two prosthetics, had instantaneously reassured him that he was going to be O.K. I told Burke to hang on: Someone at Zen Hospice had already told me this story, except that in her version, Miller was running on a trail in Texas. \u201cAsk him how many times it\u2019s happened,\u201d Burke deadpanned. Now Miller also seemed to be on the cusp of modest celebrity. He\u2019d started speaking about death and dying at medical schools and conferences around the country and will soon surface in Oprah\u2019s living room, chatting about palliative care on her \u201cSuper Soul Sunday\u201d TV show. Several of Miller\u2019s colleagues described him to me as exactly the kind of public ambassador their field needed. \u201cWhat B.J. accomplishes is to talk about death without making it sound scary and horrible,\u201d Rita Charon, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical School, says. \u201cWe know from seeing him standing in front of us that he has suffered. We know that he has been at the brink of the abyss that he\u2019s talking about. That gives him an authority that others may not have.\u201d Vicki Jackson, the chief of palliative care at Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed. Nobody welcomes conversations about dying, she said, not even about making the experience less miserable. \u201cBut people will listen to B.J.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Jackson pointed to the talk Miller gave to close the TED conference in 2015. Miller described languishing in a windowless, antiseptic burn unit after his amputations. He heard there was a blizzard outside but couldn\u2019t see it himself. Then a nurse smuggled him a snowball and allowed him to hold it. This was against hospital regulations, and this was Miller\u2019s point: There are parts of ourselves that the conventional health care system isn\u2019t equipped to heal or nourish, adding to our suffering. He described holding that snowball as \u201ca stolen moment,\u201d and said, \u201cBut I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin, the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water. In that moment, just being any part of this planet, in this universe, mattered more to me than whether I lived or died.\u201d Miller\u2019s talk has been watched more than five million times. And yet, Jackson told me: \u201cIf I said all that \u2014 \u2018Oh, I could feel the coldness of the snowball ...\u2019 \u2014 you\u2019d be like: \u2018Shut. Up. Shut up!\u2019 But no one is going to question B.J.\u201d Now, at the morning meeting, Miller began describing the case of a young man named Randy Sloan, a patient at U.C.S.F. who died of an aggressive cancer a few weeks earlier at Zen Hospice. In a way, Sloan\u2019s case was typical. It passed through all the same medical decision points and existential themes the doctors knew from working with their own terminal patients. But here, the timeline was so compressed that those themes felt distilled and heightened. And then there was the bracing idiosyncrasy of everything Miller\u2019s staff had been able to do for Sloan at Zen Hospice. Rabow told me that all palliative-care departments and home-hospice agencies believe patients\u2019 wishes should be honored, but Zen Hospice\u2019s small size allows it to \u201cactualize\u201d these ideals more fully. When Miller relayed one detail about Sloan\u2019s stay at the hospice \u2014 it was either the part about the sailing trip or the wedding \u2014 one doctor across the conference table expelled what seemed to be an involuntary, admiring, \u201cWhat?\u201d Everything Miller was saying had a way of sharpening an essential set of questions: What is a good death? How do you judge? In the end, what matters? You got the sense that looking closely at Sloan\u2019s case might even get you close to some answers or, at least, less hopelessly far away. This is the story he told. It started with an email late one night, in April 2015. \u201cI\u2019m the mother of Randy Sloan,\u201d a woman named Melany Baldwin wrote to Miller. She reminded Miller how he met her son the previous year. And then: \u201cAnyway, last week my dear son was diagnosed with mesothelioma,\u201d a rare, terminal cancer. \u201cWe are devastated. He is only 27 years old.\u201d Miller got emails, texts and calls like this almost daily from friends, friends of friends or total strangers. And he put pressure on himself to help as much as he could. But it was also exhausting, and he put equal and opposing pressure on himself to live his own life fully \u2014 a byproduct of his extreme intimacy with mortality. \u201cThe lessons I get from my patients and their families, and from this work,\u201d Miller said, \u201cis to enjoy this big, huge, mystical, crazy, beautiful, wacky world. And I\u2019m too often not doing that. That can feel distressing to me.\u201d A few months earlier, Miller had another brush with death \u2014 a pancreatic-cancer scare that turned out to be nothing \u2014 and he told me that \u201cit was interesting to watch myself play with that thought. Where my mind went was: \u2018Cool. Now I get to quit all this work.\u2019 \u201d Maybe he would just disappear, get weird, grow weed. And so, as it happens, Miller didn\u2019t get Baldwin\u2019s email for several days, because he\u2019d decided to experiment with going off the grid. He went on a weeklong, aimless road trip around the West with his mutt, Maysie, riding shotgun, and he rode his treasured motorcycle \u2014 a sleek, black, heavily customized Aprilia \u2014 up to Sonoma for a weekend with old friends. He was pulled over for speeding on the bike twice. The first cop approached a little freaked out; unable to compute a one-limbed man riding a motorcycle, he mistook Miller\u2019s prosthetic arm for a weapon. \u201cI love bikes,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cI love gyroscopic, two-wheel action!\u201d Mountain biking had become his way of releasing pressure in the turbulent decade after his accident. (Miller sued Princeton and New Jersey Transit, which operated the train, charging that they failed to make safety upgrades after similar accidents in the past. He won settlements totaling nearly $6 million, but was blindsided when some in the press excoriated him as a symbol of America\u2019s binge-drinking youth and their lack of personal responsibility.) He had returned to cycling quickly, tooling around trails with a specialized arm clipped to the handlebar and two prosthetics pedaling. It allowed him to be alone without being lonely, to remind himself that his life still allowed for adventure and risk. Soon, he was wandering into motorcycle dealerships, explaining how badly he wanted to get back on a motorcycle too, asking if anyone could build him one. But for years, none of the mechanics Miller approached would touch the idea: Engineering a machine for a triple-amputee seemed nearly impossible, the potential liability too great. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Then, in late 2013, Miller checked out Scuderia West, a boutique motorcycle shop not far from Zen Hospice, in the Mission District. Scuderia was staffed by a crew of young, wisecracking gear-heads, who, after finishing their shifts, stayed late drinking beer and rehabilitating decrepit old bikes for fun. Right away, Miller noticed a different vibe. They were excited by the challenge of retrofitting a bike for him. This was especially true of the young tech who ultimately volunteered to take the project: Melany Baldwin\u2019s son, Randy Sloan. Sloan grew up in Texas. He was bald, with a bushy, reddish beard and a disarming, contented smile. His social life in San Francisco revolved around Scuderia, and he was the baby of the group: not just younger, but more sensitive and trusting. \u201cHe was way too nice to work here,\u201d his friend and co-worker Katie Putman told me. Sloan\u2019s closest relationship may have been with his dog, a husky named Desmo, whom he rescued from a disreputable breeder. The dog was weird-looking: It had one blue eye and one eye that was half-brown and half-blue. (\u201cHe would always select the misfit,\u201d Baldwin said.) Sloan threw himself into overhauling a bike for Miller. For six months, he confronted a cascade of problems \u2014 like how to run all the controls to a single handlebar so Miller could accelerate and brake with one hand \u2014 while Miller made excuses to check in on his progress. \u201cIt was just an immediate man crush,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThe guy was helping me build this dream.\u201d Sloan was feeling it, too. Everyone at Scuderia was. They stalked Miller online, learning about his career at Zen Hospice. His work with the dying impressed them as fearless, just as his conviction to ride a motorcycle again did. Sloan never carried on about people or even talked that much, but he frequently referred to Miller as \u201ca legend,\u201d and those close to him knew what that meant. \u201cThere were not many \u2018legends\u2019 in Randy\u2019s eyes,\u201d Putman said. Sloan finished Miller\u2019s motorcycle in April 2014. A crowd gathered at Scuderia to watch Miller take possession. Sloan had him climb on, then clambered around and under the bike, making final adjustments. Then he stepped back and started, quietly, to cry. Miller was tearing up under his helmet, too. But he didn\u2019t drag things out. He started the engine, said thank you, then streaked down the alleyway at the back of the shop. Everyone hollered and applauded as they watched him disappear down Valencia Street \u2014 very fast, but with a pronounced, unsettling wobble. Miller had been lying. He\u2019d never ridden a motorcycle before. A year later, Miller got Melany Baldwin\u2019s email. Once he was back from his road trip, he contacted Sloan\u2019s doctors at U.C.S.F. to learn more about his case. Sloan was walking Desmo up a hill a few weeks earlier, in April, and found he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He was rushed into surgery, to fix an apparent collapsed lung. But the surgeon discovered a raft of tumors spread across his lung, diaphragm and heart: mesothelioma. The diagnosis alone was improbable. Mesothelioma is typically seen in older people, after long-term asbestos or radiation exposure. And the way the cancer was moving through Sloan\u2019s body was shocking. A subsequent PET scan revealed it had already spread to his pancreas and brain. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His doctors at U.C.S.F. believed the tumor on his brainstem would paralyze him within weeks. And so, Sloan underwent whole-brain radiation to shrink it before attacking everything else. He didn\u2019t want to be cut off from his body \u2014 he wanted to be as much like his old self as possible. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being sick, and I\u2019m sick of talking about being sick,\u201d he kept telling his mother. He insisted that she go back home to Illinois while he returned to the small apartment he shared with two roommates, waiting to start chemo. The next two weeks were grim. Tumors crusted over Sloan\u2019s heart, hindering it from pumping blood through his body. His capillaries began seeping water into his tissues. Soon, his feet were literally leaking, and the retained water cracked his skin from the shins down, mashing him with pain. Sloan\u2019s ankles grew as wide as logs. He started walking with a cane. And because the pain in his torso kept him from lying down or even sitting comfortably, one night he fell asleep standing up and cut his head open when he collapsed. Photo Randy Sloan Credit From Melany Baldwin Putman, Sloan\u2019s friend from Scuderia, had swept in to take care of Desmo, the husky. Now she transitioned into Sloan\u2019s de facto nurse. But Sloan was a bad patient. He played down his condition and seemed to resent Putman\u2019s help, out of shame or guilt. Several times, Putman told me, she had to race to his apartment and take him to the emergency room: \u201cI started calling it our date night.\u201d Finally, she asked Sloan if she should just sleep over. Sloan accepted her offer this way: \u201cI think Desmo would like that.\u201d Early in June, Sloan was readmitted to U.C.S.F., and Baldwin, his mother, returned to San Francisco to be with him. Miller saw both of them for an appointment that morning, and when he walked in, it hit him how quickly Sloan\u2019s body was failing: In roughly six weeks, Sloan had gone from a functioning, happy 27-year-old, walking his dog up a hill, to very clearly dying. His decline was relentless, by any standard. At no point had any doctor been able to give him a single bit of good news. Even now, Sloan\u2019s oncologist was reporting that after the first dose of chemotherapy, his heart was likely too frail to take more. Still, Sloan talked to Miller about \u201cdoing battle\u201d with the cancer and \u201cwinning this thing\u201d; about getting back to work at Scuderia and flying to Illinois, where Baldwin would remarry later that summer. He also wanted to go to Tokyo Disneyland, he said. Miller looked at Sloan, then looked at Baldwin, trying to intuit who knew what and who might have been pretending not to know and how best to gently reconcile everyone\u2019s hopes with the merciless reality. Good palliative-care doctors recognize there\u2019s an art to navigating clinical interactions like this, and Miller seems particularly sensitive to its subtleties. In this case, Miller realized, his job was to \u201cdisillusion\u201d Sloan without devastating him. Hope is a tricky thing, Miller told me. Some terminal patients keep chasing hope through round after round of chemo. But it\u2019s amazing how easily others \u201cre-proportion,\u201d or recalibrate, their expectations: how the hope of making it to a grandchild\u2019s birthday or finishing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d becomes sufficiently meaningful. \u201cThe question becomes,\u201d Miller says, \u201chow do you incorporate those hard facts into your moment-by-moment life instead of trying to run away from them?\u201d At an initial appointment with Sloan, two weeks earlier, Miller made the calculation not to steer Sloan toward any crushing realizations. He worried that if he pushed too hard, Sloan might feel alienated and shut down. (\u201cI needed his allegiance,\u201d Miller later explained; it was more important, in the long term, that Sloan see him as an advocate.) At the second meeting, Miller remembered, \u201cI felt the need to be more brutal.\u201d And, he imagined, by now Sloan would have started to suspect that the story he\u2019d been telling himself didn\u2019t fit the reality. \u201cI just said, \u2018Randy, this is not going like any of us want for you,\u2019 \u201d and Miller began, calmly, to level with him. Traveling was out of the question, Miller explained; best guess, Sloan had a few months to live. \u201cYou could just watch his world collapse,\u201d Miller recalled. \u201cWith each sentence, you\u2019re taking another possibility away.\u201d Sloan started crying. And yet, Baldwin also knew that her son had been waiting for his doctors to say this out loud. Sloan couldn\u2019t understand why, if he had Stage 4 of an incurable cancer, he was still taking 70 pills every day, with the doses laid out in a dizzying flowchart. And as Miller went on, he was stunned by how well Sloan seemed to be absorbing this new information, without buckling under its weight. \u201cHe was actually kind of keeping up with his grief, reconciling the facts of his life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a moving target, and he kept hitting it.\u201d Baldwin told me: \u201cRandy was a simple guy. He would say to me, \u2018Mom, all I want is one ordinary day.\u2019 \u201d He was sick of being sick \u2014 just like he\u2019d been saying. He wanted to go back to living, as best he could. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Quickly the conversation turned to what was next. A standard question in palliative care is \u201cWhat\u2019s important to you now?\u201d But Sloan didn\u2019t muster much of a response, so Miller retooled the question. He told Sloan that nothing about his life was going the way he expected, and his body was only going to keep breaking down. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your favorite part of yourself? What character trait do we want to make sure to protect as everything else falls apart?\u201d Sloan had an immediate answer for this one. \u201cI love everybody I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he said. Baldwin had heard her son say this before, with total earnestness. And he said it with such conviction now that Miller immediately believed it, too. Besides, Miller had already felt it to be true, a year earlier, when he drove his motorcycle away from Sloan at Scuderia. \u201cHe was an amazing person that way,\u201d Miller told me. Sloan got apprehensive when Miller started telling him about Zen Hospice\u2019s residential facility, known as the Guest House; it sounded as if it was for old people. But Miller explained that it was probably the best chance he had for living the last act of his life the way he wanted. His other options were to tough it out at home with two weekly visits from a home hospice nurse or go to a nursing home. At Zen Hospice, Sloan\u2019s friends would always be welcome, and Sloan could come and go as he pleased as long as someone went with him. He could eat what he wanted. He could step out for a cigarette. He could even walk up the street and smoke on his own stoop \u2014 the Guest House was just two blocks from Sloan\u2019s apartment. Besides, Miller told him: \u201cIt\u2019s where I work. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Sloan agreed but didn\u2019t seem entirely comfortable with the idea. He told one of his friends from Scuderia: \u201cI\u2019m moving in with B.J.\u201d Sloan arrived at the Guest House with his mother five days later, on the morning of June 9. He insisted on walking there, trundling the two blocks from his apartment with his cane. The Guest House is a calm, unpretentious space: a large Victorian home with six beds in five bedrooms, vaulted ceilings, slightly shabby furniture and warm, Oriental rugs. There is a large wooden Buddha in the dining room. The kitchen is light-filled and bursting with flowers. There\u2019s always a pot of tea and often freshly baked cookies. And while Zen Hospice has a rotating, 24-hour nursing staff, the tiny nursing station is literally tucked into a kind of cabinet in the hall upstairs; the house, in other words, feels very much like a house, not a hospital. You don\u2019t have to spend much time there to realize that the most crucial, and distinctive, piece of the operation is its staff of volunteers. Freed of most medical duties by the nursing staff, the volunteers act almost as existential nurses. They sit with residents and chat, offering their full attention, unencumbered by the turmoil a family member might feel. The volunteers are ordinary people: retired Macy\u2019s executives, social workers, bakers, underemployed millennials or kibitzing empty-nesters. Many are practicing Buddhists. Many are not. (Miller isn\u2019t.) But Buddhism informs their training. There\u2019s an emphasis on accepting suffering, on not getting tripped up by one\u2019s own discomfort around it. \u201cYou train people not to run away from hard things, not to run away from the suffering of others,\u201d Miller explained. This liberates residents to feel whatever they\u2019re going to feel in their final days, even to fall apart. At first, many volunteers experience a confused apprehension. They arrive expecting nonstop, penetrating metaphysical conversations with wise elderly people and instead just wind up plying them for recipes or knitting advice or watching \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d with them or restocking latex gloves for the Guest House nurses. But one especially well-liked volunteer, Josh Kornbluth, told me that, after a year working at the Guest House, he understood that the value of Zen Hospice is actually \u201cin the quotidian \u2014 the holding of someone\u2019s hand, bringing them food that\u2019s been beautifully arranged on the plate, all the small ways of showing respect to that person as a living person and not as \u2018predeceased.\u2019 Those are actually deep things. And I say that as the least Zen person!\u201d In fact, Kornbluth was raised by Jewish Communists in New York City, and once, after a woman died at the Guest House and no more-senior volunteer was on hand to take charge, I watched him \u2014 adrenalized, uneasy, perspiring \u2014 fumble around on his iPhone for something to say over the body before they wheeled it away, then mangle the pronunciation of Thich Nhat Hanh.

Got it House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) addresses the House on Tuesday, the first day of the 115th Congress. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Robert Costa , Mike DeBonis and Philip Rucker January 3 at 6:52 PM Follow @costareports Follow @mikedebonis Follow @PhilipRucker A day of pageantry to open the 115th Congress and usher in a new period of Republican governance was overtaken Tuesday by an embarrassing reversal on ethics oversight, with the GOP gripped by internal division and many lawmakers seeking to shield themselves from extensive scrutiny. The 19 hours of tumult was set in motion the night before behind closed doors at the Longworth House Office Building, where Republican lawmakers decided over the objections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to amend House rules to effectively gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. They awoke Tuesday to an intense public outcry. Social media lit up with criticism of representatives trying to rein in the ethics office created a decade ago in the aftermath of scandals. Angry constituents inundated their representatives\u2019 offices with calls of protest. Journalists peppered lawmakers with questions. The halls of the Capitol felt chaotic. Then, at 10:30 a.m., came the loudest objection of all: A pair of tweets from President-elect Donald Trump scolding Congress for making the weakening of the ethics watchdog its \u201cnumber one act and priority.\u201d He punctuated his second tweet with the hashtag \u201cDTS\u201d \u2014 shorthand for \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d one of his campaign-trail mantras. With Washington\u2019s latest power dynamics in their nascent state, Tuesday\u2019s events illustrated the weight of Trump\u2019s voice in discussions on Capitol Hill. The president-elect\u2019s tweets hovered over everything and helped turn what might otherwise have been an insider-driven rule change into a national ruckus over government ethics. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) greets people in the House chambers at the Capitol on Tuesday, the first day of the 115th Congress. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) [ House Republicans vote to rein in independent ethics office ] The events were fast-moving Tuesday morning. As Trump was using his political capital on Congress, Republican House leaders were meeting in Ryan\u2019s office contemplating just how the day had gotten away from them \u2014 and what they might do to salvage it. Ryan would soon be sworn in for another term as speaker, and his wife and children, dressed up for the occasion, lingered outside. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told the leaders that the rules legislation with the ethics amendment would have trouble getting the 218 votes needed to pass \u2014 and they decided it must be scrapped. The leaders called an emergency meeting of Republican House members in the Capitol basement. McCarthy pointedly asked the members whether they had campaigned last fall on decimating the ethics office \u2014 or on repealing President Obama\u2019s health-care law and changing the tax code. The windowless room fell silent, according to several lawmakers in attendance. McCarthy gave them an ultimatum: Reverse course now, among fellow Republicans, or take a public floor vote. He asked for unanimous consent to remove the rules change \u2014 and shortly after noon, he got it. The push to amend ethics rules was now dead, or at least fast asleep. \u201cI can tell you the calls we\u2019ve gotten in my district office and here in Washington surprised me, meaning the numbers of calls. People are just sick and tired,\u201d Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.) said of the simmering outrage over the proposed change. \u201cPeople are just losing confidence in the lack of ethics and honesty in Washington.\u201d For the lawmakers who had supported the rules change, the OCE had become an unaccountable office with little transparency. Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.), who was the subject of an OCE referral over a 2011 trip he took with his wife to Taiwan, likened the office to Old English royal courts that dictated harsh and arbitrary sentences to powerful figures. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) \u201cIt\u2019s a star chamber,\u201d said Roskam, who was cleared by the Ethics Committee in 2013. \u201cIt needs to be reformed.\u201d House Republicans have not abandoned an OCE overhaul entirely, but any changes are being put off until later in the year. Tuesday\u2019s actions disrupted a day of ceremonial rituals, as Ryan was easily reelected as speaker with the support of all but one Republican \u2014 far fewer defectors than when he first won the speakership in 2015. Most Democrats voted for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who will remain the minority leader. Members of the new House and Senate were sworn in throughout the afternoon. Republicans will hold a 52-48 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, and 241-194 in the House. Delivering his inaugural floor speech as Senate minority leader, Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed to fight Trump on issues where Democrats disagree. \u201cIt is not our job to be a rubber stamp,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt is our job to do what\u2019s best for the American people, the middle class and those struggling to get there.\u201d But in a sign of his party\u2019s diminished influence, Schumer spoke to a mostly empty chamber save for several dozen of his Democratic colleagues. Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) stood on the floor whispering to each other, ignoring Schumer. [ Here are the eight Trump Cabinet picks Democrats plan to target ] The House rules package that ultimately passed Tuesday contained a controversial provision that will impose fines on members using electronic devices to take photographs, record audio or video or conduct live streams on the House floor. The provision came in response to House Democrats staging a sit-in last summer aimed at forcing votes on gun-control legislation. At issue earlier in the day were changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was created in 2008 after the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal to address concerns that members of the House Ethics Committee had been too timid in pursuing allegations of wrongdoing by fellow lawmakers. The amendment, proposed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), would have renamed the office as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review and prevented it from investigating anonymous tips or referring criminal wrongdoing to prosecutors without the express consent of the Ethics Committee. It also would have prohibited the office from employing staff to communicate with the public or the media. House leaders knew days in advance of Monday night\u2019s meeting of Republican lawmakers to finalize the House rules package that Goodlatte would seek to undermine the independent ethics office. The leadership made an effort to head off the proposal before the meeting, but Goodlatte refused to budge. As the meeting started at 5:30 p.m., aides were confident that members would reject Goodlatte\u2019s proposal once Ryan and McCarthy weighed in against it. That did not happen. Goodlatte was backed by a chorus of rank-and-file lawmakers \u2014 many of whom had been targeted by OCE probes or feared they might be next \u2014 who were emboldened to make changes. The measure passed handily, 119 to 74. Dozens of other members were absent because they were not yet in Washington. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) echoed the views of many colleagues in saying changes to the OCE were long overdue. \u201cThere\u2019s no due process,\u201d he said. \u201cAn anonymous source can destroy your life, put you on the front page of the newspaper \u2014 and when it\u2019s too late, you\u2019re completely exonerated. I\u2019ve watched that happen to close friends who were straight as an arrow.\u201d [ Donald Trump, meet your toughest hurdle: the U.S. Senate ] Others foresaw the political toll that could be exacted for a decision to make gutting ethics oversight the first act of the new Congress. \u201cI had cautioned some of my colleagues last night that that one provision would create quite a public stir \u2014 and it did,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said with a slight chuckle. Ryan and McCarthy initially seemed resigned to accepting the will of their members, even though they understood the less-than-optimal message it sent to voters nationally, especially after a campaign during which Washington was vilified. Before GOP members could meet to change course, McCarthy had to face a conference room full of skeptical reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re a collective group of individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\u201d The development blindsided Trump transition officials, prompting Ryan staffers to explain to Trump aides late Monday night and into Tuesday morning what exactly House members had voted on and why they did it. Early Tuesday, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, partially defended the proposed changes to the ethics office in an appearance on MSNBC. But that was before she discussed the matter with the president-elect, and a few hours later it became clear he disagreed with what House Republicans had done. \u201cWith all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it . . . may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, health care and so many other things of far greater importance!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect was not taking a position on the merits of the ethics rules changes, only on the prioritization. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of strengthening or weakening,\u201d Spicer told reporters . \u201cI think it\u2019s a question of priorities and the president\u2019s belief that with all that this country wants and needs to have happen, this really shouldn\u2019t be the priority.\u201d Ryan and Trump eventually spoke by phone following the conference meeting and during the vote for speaker, per aides. But earlier, as Trump was firing off tweets, McCarthy reflected on the discord that had engulfed Congress\u2019s first day. During the morning news conference, McCarthy was flung questions from journalists \u2014 including one about whether the day\u2019s events signaled weakness on the part of House leaders. \u201cMan,\u201d McCarthy replied, \u201cwelcome back.\u201d Sean Sullivan, Paul Kane, Ed O\u2019Keefe, David Weigel, Kelsey Snell, Scott Higham and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report. powerpost ",

They have said many of more than 120 pieces of debris found are consistent with that type of aircraft and a bag from the plane was found.

Manigault, who serves on the transition team's executive committee, was an early supporter of her mentor, appearing regularly with him on the campaign trail and serving as a part of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, an independent organization. She proved instrumental in negotiating Trump's limited in-person outreach to African-Americans while he was a candidate, coordinating and appearing with him at Great Faith International Ministries in Detroit, his first visit to an African-American church. This won't be her first time in the White House; she previously served in the office of Vice President Al Gore during Bill Clinton 's administration. Her position with Trump was not her first choice, however. According to a transition official, Manigault expressed a desire to be the ambassador to Haiti, where she has done missionary and service work. 0 Shares ",

Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2003 The closed Sears store in Ravenswood has been purchased by Springbank Capital Advisors and will be turned into an apartment-retail complex. The closed Sears store in Ravenswood has been purchased by Springbank Capital Advisors and will be turned into an apartment-retail complex. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune 2003) Gail MarksJarvis Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago developer Springbank Capital Advisors has purchased the old Sears store in Ravenswood and plans to turn it into a $30 million apartment and retail complex, said David Trandel, chairman and chief executive of Springbank. The building at 1900 W. Lawrence Avenue was closed last summer by Hoffman Estates -based Sears Holdings as the retail firm shuttered dozens of Sears and Kmart stores. The 40,434-square-foot store had been operated as a Sears store since November 1928. Trandel said he was drawn to the building's history and proximity to public transportation. Trandel said a Springbank entity called SB 1900 West Lawrence LLC paid almost $10 million for the former Sears building and will spend about $20 million redeveloping it. The longest-standing store in Sears ' chain will close in August after 90 years in operation. A liquidation sale at the store, 1900 W. Lawrence Ave., in Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood, will start May 19, said Sears Holdings spokesman Howard Riefs. The Lawrence Avenue Sears opened in November... The longest-standing store in Sears ' chain will close in August after 90 years in operation. A liquidation sale at the store, 1900 W. Lawrence Ave., in Chicago's Ravenswood neighborhood, will start May 19, said Sears Holdings spokesman Howard Riefs. The Lawrence Avenue Sears opened in November... (Lauren Zumbach) The building is to include a bottom floor of retail, 50 apartments on two floors, and parking for 80 cars, he said. Binny's Beverage Depot has agreed to occupy the full bottom floor, but a deal is contingent upon approval from the neighborhood and nearby McPherson Elementary School, said Trandel. Under state law, any liquor facility within 100 feet of a school must get approval from the state legislature. If Binny's is not approved, the developer would seek a grocery store or superstore to fill the full 34,000 square feet at street level, but Trandel said attracting a tenant to fill such a large space is difficult given the current retail environment, which led to Sears closing stores. The full development of apartments and retail will be 105,000 square feet. The $30 million in financing is provided by UC Funds of Boston, Trandel said. The developer plans to start removing asbestos this month, and begin construction in May with a summer 2018 completion. The site is one of many being developed currently for retail and residential projects by Springbank. The developer has also received preliminary approval for an $80 million development of retail, condos and luxury apartments in Winnetka. ",

    "text": "Privacy Policy The \u201cpack of cigarettes\u201d reference, according to people who served with the general, reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable, and that rapport-building can go a long way. \u201cI\u2019m not in his head, but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture,\u201d Colonel Taylor said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, declined requests for more detail on the president-elect\u2019s discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis\u2019s beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration\u2019s departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques \u2014 government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture, and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions \u2014 tainted the United States\u2019 reputation while not yielding results. \u201cIneffective, war crime, against our values, moral high ground, et cetera,\u201d Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law, said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. \u201cA very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured, and we have no basis to object. If we torture, we\u2019ve lost who we are.\u201d The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example, the Army field manual\u2019s section on intelligence collection states : \u201cUse of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results.\u201d The manual adds, \u201cCruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited.\u201d Lasting Scars Articles in this series examine the American legacy of brutal interrogations. As a commander in Iraq, General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq, christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty, stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the American-led invasion. The prisoner who died, Nagem Sadoon Hatab , had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a 19-year-old private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an M-16 rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to so-called 50-10 treatment \u2014 forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour, for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired, stressed and submissive for interrogators, witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center, Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and strip-searches. He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling, screaming and banging from the interrogation room, a converted bathroom. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After midnight on June 6, 2003, Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours, his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck, the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes, including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis, Col. William B. Gallo, later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab, if any, might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo\u2019s opinion, the 50-10 treatment did not amount to torture, but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence, including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent, had been lost or destroyed, complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines, a major and a sergeant, were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab\u2019s death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time, he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners, which resulted in a ban of sleep-deprivation tactics, including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training, and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still, there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later, aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended, General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: \u201cNo better friend, no worse enemy.\u201d The addition was, \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

    "text": "Congress opens with a Republican stumble, showing battles ahead between Trump and GOP Congress J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter The new Congress opened with a stumble Tuesday after the Republican majority\u2019s plan for gutting an independent ethics office drew a firestorm of criticism \u2014 including tweets of displeasure from President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 that forced lawmakers to reverse course in a sign of battles to come. The messy debut of what was supposed to be a celebratory start on Capitol Hill foreshadowed roadblocks ahead as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan tries to lead his often willful GOP majority while maneuvering unexpected outbursts from the party\u2019s new leader in the White House . Trump\u2019s early-morning tweet storm against surprise\u00a0GOP plans for a watered-down ethics watchdog showcased a president-elect who has no qualms about publicly opposing and embarrassing members of his own party, even lawmakers he will rely on to implement much of his agenda. And the instant course correction by the House to suit Trump\u2019s preference showed he may not pay much of a political price for intervening. He may even draw praise. \u201cMr. Trump has shown a penchant for being effective with Twitter,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks , an Alabama Republican. \u201cI am glad Donald Trump intervened because a change of this magnitude needs to be done more publicly and with more lead time.\u201d Despite the dramatic turn of events, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded upbeat Tuesday as they opened the 115th Congress, welcoming new lawmakers who arrived with families and friends to be sworn in to office and snap official photos. The unforced error\u00a0did not appear to harm Ryan\u2019s reelection as speaker, nor did his fraught on-again, off-again relationship with Trump. House Republicans overwhelmingly chose the Wisconsin Republican for another term, avoiding the tumult of past leadership elections, including in 2015 when he took over after former House Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s abrupt retirement. Just one Republican dissented on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense of foreboding today,\u201d Ryan said after taking the gavel. \u201cThere\u2019s only a sense of potential.\u201d The speaker reminded his colleagues of their vast responsibilities now that Republicans control the House, Senate and soon the White House. It\u2019s \u201cthe kind of thing that most of us only dream about.\u00a0I know \u2014 because I used to dream about it, a lot,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cThe people have given us unified government.\u00a0And it wasn\u2019t because they were feeling generous.\u00a0It\u2019s because they wanted results.\u00a0How could we live with ourselves if we let them down?\u201d Republicans have unfurled an ambitious conservative agenda, including repealing the Affordable Care Act, lowering tax rates, boosting economic growth and tightening immigration rules. Many are in sync with Trump\u2019s campaign promises. But despite their unified front, Republicans have yet to produce the kind of detailed first-100-days plan that often comes with a new session of Congress or a new president. \u201cWe know that the coming days are going to require hard work,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cBut if we work together, we\u2019ll be able to continue a record of achievement.\u201d Senate Republicans quickly introduced legislation to begin the painstaking process for repealing Obamacare, with mostly symbolic votes likely to begin next week. The thorny details will not come until later, and because\u00a0 parts of the bill are popular even with Republicans, full repeal may never pass. Democrats vowed to fight Trump on some issues \u2014 including efforts to deport immigrants here illegally \u2014 but said they will work with him when they can. As Tuesday showed, Democrats may be able to find daylight between the White House and Republicans in Congress. Many Democrats were officially aghast at the last-minute Republican push to weaken the ethnics panel. But Democrats also see possible coalitions with Trump on his calls to rebuild roads and bridges and to expand child care. Those issues have drawn a cool reception from conservatives on the Hill, but Trump\u2019s team has signaled he wants to pursue them. \u201cWe\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not going to just oppose things to oppose them,\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), told CNN after he was sworn in as the Senate minority leader. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to work with [Trump] is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues.\u00a0That\u2019s not going to happen very often.\u201d The ethics controversy was not the way Republican leaders had planned to showcase the new Congress when they convened GOP lawmakers for a private meeting late Monday night. But the proposal from Rep. Robert W.\u00a0Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to rein in the Office of Congressional Ethics struck a nerve with rank-and-file lawmakers. Many have chafed at the watchdog panel, which was set up in 2008 after high-profile corruption scandals sent several members to prison. Under Goodlatte\u2019s plan, the independent office would be put under jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee, which is made up of lawmakers, and barred from investigating anonymous tips or releasing any details of its work to the public. Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield)\u00a0warned lawmakers that opening day was not the time to make such controversial changes. They argued the proposal would carry more weight if it had bipartisan support from Democrats. The leaders\u2019 advice was ignored. Late Monday, House Republicans voted to tuck the proposal into a\u00a0 broader rules package set for a vote on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cSometimes you win, sometimes you lose,\u201d McCarthy told reporters Tuesday morning as he struggled to explain the changes amid an onslaught of questions. Then Trump tweeted his point of view. \u201cWith all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it........may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!\u201d He closed with \u201c#DTS\u201d \u2014 a reference to one of his campaign slogans, \u201cDrain the swamp.\u201d Office telephone lines on Capitol Hill were already ringing by that time, and social media accounts filled with howls of protest. Republicans said they had little choice but to back down. Ryan convened a quick meeting behind closed doors in the Capitol basement, where GOP lawmakers were told the provision might tank the broader rules package that was set for a vote in several hours \u2014 a potentially embarrassing setback on opening day. They agreed to shelve the issue \u2014 for now. \u201cThe feeling was, it was the right thing to do, but the wrong time to do it,\u201d said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.). \u201cIt was better to delay it.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss The deadliest fire in a decade has focused new attention on Ghost Ship warehouse owner Chor Ng , Congress is holding its first hearing today on the Russian\u00a0cyberattacks during the presidential election , Aerospace firms are stepping up competition with Silicon Valley for young engineers \u00a0and\u00a0 if Amazon\u2019s Alexa is always listening, can she incriminate you in a crime?

The body has not yet been identified. After David Puckett, 6, was reported missing from his home on New Year's Eve, police initiated an \"intensive search\" and investigation, Aurora Police Chief Nick Metz said at a news conference today. The Aurora police, the FBI and the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children were among those involved in the search, including more than 200 volunteer citizens, Metz said. The search zeroed in on the lake after clues from a search dog; divers later pulled the body to the surface. KMGH A body found under an icy pond in Aurora, Colorado, may be a 6-year-old boy who went missing days ago, authorities said. \"I had the unfortunate experience of having to inform David's family of what we found,\" Metz said. \"We informed the family of where ... we found the individual. And we did let the family know it was going to take some before we could have a positive identification.\" The Puckett family is \"devastated,\" Metz added. \"Please respect their privacy as they're going through trying to process all this.\" The area near the pond has been designated a crime scene, according to Metz. \"Our officers are going to continue in this investigation ... until we have definitive word on the final outcome,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

He says a dark patch on the Titanic\u2019s hull shows the coal was burning even as the ship was being launched. \u201cThe intensity of the fire not only weakened a forward bulkhead, but also may have caused a serious deformity to the hull,\u201d Malony said. \u201cThe ship was put to sea with an out of control fire that required 12 men to try to tackle it for most of her maiden voyage.\u201d The dark patch on the hull was weakened by coal fires, according to a new report Close CBS News The coal fire was known about at the time and was dismissed as a cause of the disaster by the official inquiry that followed it. The smoldering fuel was dug out and burned in the ships boilers. But Molony says the need to get rid of that burning coal quickly may have been one of the reasons Titanic kept going at top speed, despite knowing there were icebergs around.

Robert Bentley said in a statement on social media that the Houston County sheriff had told him about the deaths and he offered \u201cprayers for those impacted.\u201d CBS Mobile affiliate WKRG-TV reported \u00a0that the Gulf Shores area was hit with severe winds and rain, but no deaths were reported there. The local zoo is reported to have rescued cages of Lemurs and birds who were blown into a pond on the property. In Mossy Head, Florida, a 70-year-old man drowned Monday, apparently accidentally, the Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office says, adding that deputies found his car partially submerged \u201cand his body floating face-down\u201d near his trailer. Teams of surveyors were headed out Tuesday to assess apparent tornado damage at three sites in southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, said Mark Wool, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida. State emergency officials reported no injuries or deaths in Louisiana and Mississippi, but a trip to Walmart was memorable for some shoppers in Marksville, Louisiana, as severe weather blew out skylights in the store, sending water and glass cascading onto shoppers. Marksville Fire Chief Jerry Bordelon said a fireworks stand in the Walmart parking lot was tossed 30 or 40 yards and mangled. The storm also knocked over 18-wheel truck trailers and punched holes in the Walmart\u2019s roof. The fire department ordered shoppers to leave the store, but some didn\u2019t want to leave even as managers closed it. \u201cBelieve it or not, we had some people in there who were still trying to shop,\u201d Bordelon said. Walmart spokeswoman Erica Jones said the Arkansas-based company hopes to reopen the store Tuesday, but isn\u2019t sure that will happen, citing needed repairs to a natural gas line. Storms in central Mississippi near Mendenhall and Mount Olive were preliminarily identified as tornadoes by the National Weather Service, based in part on radar signatures. Both storms damaged farm buildings and homes. Other possible tornadoes will be surveyed later. ",

Former presidents from both parties typically attend inaugurations, but her presence takes on added meaning given that the former first lady was President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s main opponent in the 2016 race. Democrat Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.9 million votes, but Republican Trump won the Electoral College, securing him the presidency. The last time Clinton and Trump were in the same room together was at the October Al Smith Dinner in New York after the third presidential debate. A similar situation unfolded in 2000 when outgoing Vice President Al Gore attended the inauguration of George W. Bush, who had defeated Gore in a contentious election. 0 Shares ",

GALLAGHER Jan 3, 2017, 5:49 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Manhunt Intensifies for Turkey Nightclub Terrorist 0 Shares Email Turkish police have released chilling new details in the New Year's massacre at a nightclub in Istanbul that killed 39 and injured dozens more. The suspected shooter is believed to be from the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan , Turkish police sources tell ABC News. The man, whose name is known to authorities but has not been revealed, arrived in Istanbul on Nov. 20 with his wife and kids and traveled to Konya, a city in Anatolia province, two days later. The suspect returned to Istanbul on Dec. 27, most likely by bus, before allegedly perpetrating an attack that Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu condemned as \"truly inhuman savagery.\" The gunman, believed to be acting alone, fired 180 rounds of 7.62 mm bullets that are commonly used in AK-47 assault rifles. He also used flares to illuminate the inside of the nightclub, police said. Police say they don't believe the weapon used in the attack came from inside Turkey, adding that the serial number had been defaced. At least a dozen people have been arrested, including the suspect's wife, who police say claims not to have known about her husband's plans. The gunman allegedly killed a policeman and a civilian outside of the club before \"[raining] bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people\" inside the club, according to Visip Sahin, the governor of Istanbul. Most of the victims in the massacre were shot at close range or took bullets directly to the head, an official morgue report said. ISIS propaganda channels published a statement Monday claiming that the attack was a response to Turkey's military operations against the Islamic State group. The statement suggests that the nightclub was targets because it is where \"Christians celebrate their apostate holiday\" although many of the 39 victims may have been Muslim. Fifteen of those killed were Turkish, and the other 24 hailed from a diverse array of countries including Belgium, France, India, Israel , Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, according to Turkish media. The Reina club had attracted a diverse crowd of between 400 and 500 patrons from foreign countries as well as Turkey to ring in the new year. Among the nearly 70 people injured was a small business owner from Greenville, Delaware, Jake Raak, who was shot in the leg, family members told ABC station WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. Raak's brother, Michael, told WPVI-TV the bullet may have struck his cellphone, which may have prevented him from being injured more seriously. ABC News' Michael Edison Hayden contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

By Perry Stein and Sandhya Somashekhar January 3 at 7:41 PM Follow perrystein Follow @sandhyawp Teresa Shook never considered herself much of an activist, or someone particularly versed in feminist theory. But when the results of the presidential election became clear, the retired attorney in Hawaii turned to Facebook and asked: What if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse? She asked her online friends how to create an event page, and then started one for the march she was hoping would happen. By the time she went to bed, 40 women responded that they were in. When she woke up, that number had exploded to 10,000. Now, more than 100,000 people have registered their plans to attend the Women\u2019s March on Washington in what is expected to be the largest demonstration linked to Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and a focal point for activists on the left who have been energized in opposing his agenda. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) [ Women\u2019s March on Washington officially has a permit for Jan. 21 ] Planning for the Jan.\u00a021 march got off to a rocky start. Controversy initially flared over the name of the march, and whether it was inclusive enough of minorities, particularly African Americans, who have felt excluded from many mainstream feminist movements. Organizers say plans are on track, after securing a permit from D.C. police to gather 200,000 people near the Capitol at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW on the morning after Inauguration Day. Exactly how big the march will be has yet to be determined, with organizers scrambling to pull together the rest of the necessary permits and raise the $1\u00a0million to $2\u00a0million necessary to pull off a march triggered by Shook\u2019s Facebook venting. The march has become a catch-all for a host of liberal causes, from immigrant rights to police killings of African Americans. But at its heart is the demand for equal rights for women after an election that saw the defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, the first female presidential nominee of a major party. \u201cWe plan to make a bold and clear statement to this country on the national and local level that we will not be silent and we will not let anyone roll back the rights we have fought and struggled to get,\u201d said Tamika Mallory, a veteran organizer and gun-control advocate who is one of the march\u2019s main organizers. More than 150,000 women and men have responded on the march\u2019s Facebook page that they plan on attending. At least 1,000 buses are headed to Washington for the march through Rally, a website that organizes buses to protests . Dozens of groups, including Planned Parenthood and the antiwar CodePink, have signed on as partners . Organizers insist the march is not anti-Trump, even as many of the groups that have latched on to it fiercely oppose his agenda. Thousands rally in Washington in 2000 for the Million Mom March in support of tighter gun control laws. (Gerald Martineau/The Washington Post) \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s election has triggered a lot of women to be more involved than they ordinarily would have been, which is ironic, because a lot of us thought a Hillary presidency would motivate women,\u201d said Dana Brown, executive director of the Pennsylvania Center for Women and Politics at Chatham University in Pittsburgh. \u201cA lot of women seem to be saying, \u2018This is my time. I\u2019m not going to be silent anymore.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Trump Inaugural Committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn defended the president-elect\u2019s popularity among women in an interview on CNN. While Trump did not receive the majority of women\u2019s votes, he got an \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of them, Epshteyn said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to hear their concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cWe welcome them to our side as well.\u201d That all this could grow out of a dashed-off post from her perch nearly 5,000 miles from Washington is amazing to Shook, who has booked her ticket and plans to be in the capital on Jan. 21. \u201cI guess in my heart of hearts I wanted it to happen, but I didn\u2019t really think it would\u2019ve ever gone viral,\u201d said Shook, who is in her 60s. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to go viral.\u201d Unsure of how to proceed in those initial few days, she said she enlisted the help of the first few women who messaged her to volunteer, some of whom independently also had an idea for a march. But as the march grew in prominence, it got caught up in a broader conversation in liberal circles about race and leadership, with activists and others criticizing that initial planning group for its racial makeup: Shook and all the women she tapped to help in the march\u2019s nascent stages are white, she said. Some also took issue with the name Shook had proposed, the Million Woman March, which was the name of a 1997 gathering of hundreds of thousands of black women in Philadelphia. The racial concerns set off a heated conversation on the group\u2019s main Facebook page, with some African American women especially taking umbrage. For her part, Shook said her aim was not to co-opt any other movement. It was just an idea that took hold after the victory of a president-elect caught on tape boasting of grabbing women\u2019s private parts and the defeat of a woman who seemed to her much more qualified for the job. She said she had no idea of the race of the women she first contacted; in fact, she said, most had an image of Clinton as their Facebook profile photo. Complicating matters, it became apparent that the march probably could not start at the Lincoln Memorial as Shook had proposed, since the inaugural committee has dibs on that space. Overwhelmed and under pressure, the original organizers eventually handed the reins to a diverse group of veteran female activists from New York: Mallory, the gun-control activist; Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York; Carmen Perez, head of the Gathering for Justice, a criminal-justice-reform group; and Bob Bland, a fashion entrepreneur. Together, they settled on a new name: The Women\u2019s March on Washington, a nod to the 1963 demonstration that was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement. They even received the blessing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s youngest daughter, Bernice King. In the District, Janaye Ingram, the former executive director of Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, has been working to secure permits and hash out logistics for the march, including ensuring there is a proper sound equipment and sufficient portable toilets. People traveling to attend the march seem less concerned with behind-the-scenes politics than the chance to call for more family-friendly government policies, equal pay for women or reproductive rights. Some say they simply want to stand against the crass way Trump has spoken about women. Lindsey Shriver, a 27-year-old former pastry chef who is an at-home mom in Ohio, said she was offended this election cycle by Trump\u2019s rhetoric, which she characterized as \u201chateful and misogynistic.\u201d She also wants to highlight the need for paid family leave and affordable child care. \u201cI realized that being a feminist in my own personal life wasn\u2019t going to be enough for my daughters,\u201d Shriver said. Caroline Rule, 57, a lawyer living in Manhattan, says she will attend with her 15-year-old daughter. While she agrees with the pro-women message behind the march, she said she would probably participate in any march that pushed against Trump\u2019s messages. \u201cI absolutely despise Donald Trump and everything he stands for,\u201d she said. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem has recently signed on as a march co-sponsor, and celebrities including Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain say they plan to attend. Feminist scholars say the march reflects an emerging view of feminism: one that is less defined by reproductive issues, such as birth control and abortion, and more by how the challenges faced by women intersect with those encountered by African Americans, the LGBT community and immigrants. [ None of the inauguration protests have their proper permits yet. Here\u2019s why. ] Still, reproductive rights will be a large part of the march, with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America as key partners. Hahrie Han, a political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara specializing in political organizations and political engagement, said it\u2019s not all that surprising that individual women instead of an established organization founded this march. Established organizations all come with at least some political baggage. \u201cThe challenge with having one organization brand it as its own is that each organization has its own image that draws some people and pushes others back away,\u201d she said. local News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

(Photo: Eugene Gologursky, Getty Images for Toshiba) It seems we are never going to hear the end of Mariah Carey's botched Times Square New Year's Eve performance, and Carey herself is helping keep the story around\u00a0to chew on for another day. Carey spoke to a reporter for Entertainment Weekly late Tuesday, three days after the fiasco and only one day after Carey's team, including her manager, exchanged fire with Dick Clark Productions, which produces New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u00a0in Times Square, over who was to blame for the technical glitches that led the diva of divas to quit the stage in frustration and disgust. Among other embarrassments, the shortened performance exposed Carey's lip-syncing on her hits\u00a0and her inability to hit some high notes when she tried to sing because, she said, her earpieces weren't functioning. So, she was asked, now that you've had a few days to think about it, \"What are your feelings\" about the mess seen live on TV by millions, and the over-the-top reaction on social media and regular media ever since? Mariah Carey says that she was \"mortified\" by her New Year's Eve performance: https://t.co/VdD0KL5uvT \u2014 Entertainment Weekly (@EW) January 3, 2017 Carey's response: An artful dodge that nevertheless mentioned the word \"mortified.\" \"All I can say is Dick Clark was an incredible person and I was lucky enough to work with him when I first started in the music business,\" she said. \"I\u2019m of the opinion that Dick Clark would not have let an artist go through that and he would have been as mortified as I was in real time.\" This was a shift from Carey's early shrug-it-off attitude, expressed in a tweet she posted early Sunday morning, blithely dismissing the debacle as \"(stuff) happens.\" Mariah Carey botches NYE performance, leaves stage This was followed on Monday and Tuesday by anonymous and then on-the-record sniping by Team Carey and Team DCP. Carey manager Stella\u00a0Bulochnikov insisted the producers purposely allowed Carey to go on stage with defective equipment to pump up the ratings with \"a viral moment at any expense.\" The producers issued a statement saying any suggestion they would \"intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd.\" Mariah Carey's manager on NYE fiasco: 'They wanted a viral moment' Meanwhile, mocking tweets and comments continued to rain\u00a0down on her. Carey preferred to focus on the supportive messages. \"My true fans have been so supportive and I am so appreciative of them and everybody in the media that came out to support me after the fact because it really was an incredible holiday season that turned into a horrible New Year\u2019s Eve,\" she told EW.\u00a0 The lesson learned, according to Carey? \"It\u2019s not going to stop me from doing a live event in the future,\" she said. \"But it will make me less trusting of using anyone outside of my own team.\" So why, after staying silent for three days, was Carey suddenly chatty? It might have something to do with her desire to publicize her reality series on E!, Mariah\u2019s World, not to mention her upcoming All the Hits\u00a0tour with Lionel Richie starting in March, her first North American tour in seven years. That's how a savvy self-promoter salvages some measure of victory from humiliating defeat. 12887 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 74 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2j2jiCX NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

Cliff Owen/AP hide caption toggle caption Cliff Owen/AP House Speaker Paul Ryan and the House GOP backed away from a proposal to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics after a backlash, including from President-elect Trump. Cliff Owen/AP After a storm of criticism, including from President-elect Donald Trump, House Republicans have reversed themselves and restored the current rules of the Office of Congressional Ethics. GOP members met Tuesday afternoon and agreed by unanimous consent to withdraw a change to House rules approved late Monday evening, before the new Congress was sworn in, that would have weakened the ethics office, an independent watchdog first established in 2008 under House Democrats. According to lawmakers in the room, GOP leaders said the change was a distraction from their agenda and that the issue needed further vetting. Public outcry, opposition from ethics watchdog groups, a divided GOP, and two tweets from Trump critical of the rules change prompted a swift reversal of the proposal authored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. Trump questioned, via Tweet, Congress' priorities. He tweeted a pair of posts saying that while the OCE was \"unfair,\" Congress had more important issues to take up, including tax reform and health care. With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 ........may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Inclusion of the ethics measure threatened to bring down the entire rules package \u2014 the governing rules of the chamber \u2014 that is headed for a vote later Tuesday. The majority party traditionally passes the rules package on its votes alone, and a defeat would have been an embarrassing start for Republicans in the new Congress. Article continues after sponsorship House Ethics Chairwoman Susan Brooks, R-Ind., said that the ethics panel will review the proposal and come back to the conference with any recommendations by late summer or early fall. Republicans said they would like to have Democratic buy-in to any proposed changes to the OCE. Several Democrats in recent years have also voiced criticism of the OCE, but Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who played a critical role in establishing the office, has fought back any efforts to reduce its role. Pelosi said in a statement that \"House Republicans showed their true colors last night\" and decried \"the toxic dysfunction of a Republican House that will do anything to further their special interest agenda, thwart transparency and undermine the public trust.\" Democrats did not immediately comment on whether they would take part in an Ethics Committee review. Opposition to the gutting of the office was swift and came from some unexpected sources in addition to Trump. Exhibit A: Jack Abramoff, the former lobbyist, whose conviction on influence-peddling charges helped lead to the creation of the OCE, told Politico the Republicans' action was \"exactly the opposite of what Congress should be doing.\" Former Rep. Bob Ney, who also served time after being convicted as part of the same scandal, said, \"House Republicans should not have done this and also the way they did it without announcing it is not a public policy to be proud of.\" Judicial Watch, the conservative group that has led efforts to release former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, called the House rules change \"shady and corrupt\" and a \"drive by effort\" to eliminate the OCE, as well as \"a poor way for the Republican majority to begin 'draining the swamp.' \" House Speaker Paul Ryan had issued a statement saying many members feel that after eight years, the office \"is in need of reform.\" Ryan argued the office would continue to operate independently and still take complaints from members of the public. He said the House Ethics Committee would merely provide oversight of the complaints office but insisted that the office \"is not controlled by the committee.\" The Project on Government Oversight also chimed in, saying ethics watchdogs like the OCE \"need to be strengthened and expanded \u2014 not taken out back and shot in the middle of the night.\" ",

    "text": "By Chris Cillizza January 3 at 12:10 PM Follow @thefix House Republicans suddenly reversed a plan to gut a House ethics watchdog panel on Jan. 3. The Fix's Amber Phillips explains what happened. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Update: As of noon on Tuesday, House Republicans have reversed course -- dropping the amendment that would have gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics from the overall rules package. NEW: House Republicans withdraw ethics changes for now, postpone to future date. \u2014 Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) January 3, 2017 ORIGINAL POST On Monday night, House Republicans \u2014 as their first major act of the 115th Congress, which officially convenes today \u2014 gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics . Er, what? Remember that little campaign we had for, oh, the past two years or so? The one in which a businessman with no experience in elective office ran \u2014 and won \u2014 on a message that Washington and its denizens are corrupt and that the swamp needs to be drained? Because this move seemed so totally tone deaf for that political environment, I reached out to a prominent Republican member of Congress seeking some explanation. Here's what he told me: It is tough to vote to retain the OCE as currently structured when five members get up and recount instances in which they have been falsely accused of wrongdoing, publicly dragged through the mud, forced to spend $100 to $200k to defend themselves and then get a letter of exoneration from the OCE that no one in the media bothers to cover. Frankly if you check with the Democrats you will find many of them have experienced the same fate and feel the same way. This was a flawed creation from the outset that [Nancy] Pelosi strong-armed through Congress by a single vote over bipartisan opposition. That argument is consistent with how Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the decision this morning on TV . Kellyanne Conway on gutting ethics watchdog on @GMA : \"There's been an overzealousness in some of the processes over the years.\" \u2014 Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) January 3, 2017 The member of Congress, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter candidly, cited Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) as a case study on why the OCE needed to be overhauled. In 2009, the OCE began investigating an allegation that Graves had invited a witness who was friends with his wife to testify about renewable fuels in front of a House committee. OCE eventually cleared him of wrongdoing . (The Ethics Committee, which oversees the OCE, said at the time that the group may have acted improperly.) Fair enough. Members of Congress, according to this member, believe the OCE was an out-of-control institution, making baseless, costly and damaging allegations against elected officials. Putting aside the fact that no one likes to have their every action scrutinized \u2014 hall monitors aren't exactly the most popular kids at school \u2014 let's take that assessment at face value for a moment: OCE was bad and something needed to be done about it. How House Republicans decided to do something about it is still colossally dumb, politically speaking. First of all, they gutted the OCE in a private conference vote \u2014 meaning that no Democrats were involved or forced to vote. (The measure will be rolled into a broader rules package governing the 115th Congress that almost certainly will pass on the floor later Tuesday.) If this frustration with the OCE was indeed bipartisan, why not get Democrats on board to support a proposal to change it? Why hold a private, internal vote before Congress is even fully back in Washington? In so doing, you hand Democrats \u2014 even those who might privately be supportive of the move to sideline the OCE \u2014 a chance to bash you as enemies of transparency. Second, if the OCE is truly a rogue organization, why not make that case in public before, out of the blue, demolishing it on a Monday night in January? If OCE was/is truly as bad as members of Congress seem to believe, then couldn't the public have been convinced of why these changes were absolutely necessary? Or at least apprised of why these changes were being made? \u201cThere was clearly a lot of rank-and-file frustration with OCE,\u201d said one senior Republican member of Congress who opposed the move. \u201cMany of the changes, like adding due process, are very positive; however, enacting the reforms in what looks like a partisan way was not the smartest way to make these changes.\u201d ",

    "text": "Golf Club Shows Pitfalls of Trump Presidency By jon gambrell, associated press DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u0097 Jan 3, 2017, 10:02 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump Tweets About Nuclear Weapons, Chicago Violence 0 Shares Email The decorative clock bearing the name of America's incoming 45th president has yet to start at the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai, but the developers behind the project already are counting the money they've made. The 18-hole course is likely to be the first Trump-connected property to open after his Jan. 20 inauguration as president, joining his organization's projects stretching from Bali to Panama. It also encapsulates the host of worries of possible conflicts of interest circulating around a president who is very different from America's past leaders. While the Oval Office has always been home to the wealthy, Donald Trump represents the first franchise president. Could foreign governments pressure or please Trump through his international businesses? Should projects bearing his name receive additional security? And how close should his ties remain to business executives operating in areas with far different opinions about human rights and justice? \"There has never been anything remotely like this \u2014 not even close,\" said Robert W. Gordon, a legal historian and ethics expert who teaches at Stanford University. \"Trump himself tends to treat his businesses and his public policy as sort of extensions of himself. He seems to be completely unembarrassed about scrambling up and conflating his business enterprise and the actions and policies of the U.S. government.\" The Trump International Golf Club in Dubai \u2014 the sheikhdom in the United Arab Emirates home to a futuristic skyline crowned by the world's tallest building \u2014 is due to open in February and be managed by Trump Organization employees. The course sits along a road that begins near the sail-shaped Burj al-Arab luxury hotel and passes by a mall with its own artificial ski slope. The luxury continues onto the par-71 Trump course, designed by American golf architect Gil Hanse, where wrinkled fairways lead to putting greens made smooth with silica sand brushed in between micro-blades of grass. It is set inside Akoya, a massive housing development of 2,600 villas and 7,000 apartments developed by Dubai-based luxury real estate DAMAC Properties. Another Trump-managed golf course is planned for another even larger DAMAC project under development further down the road. Billionaire Hussain Sajwani, who founded DAMAC Properties in 2002, met Trump some 10 years ago and the two men hit it off over their real estate experiences, said Niall McLoughlin, a senior vice president for communications and marketing at the firm. \"When we approached them in 2013 about the golf course, he of course knew who DAMAC was,\" McLoughlin told The Associated Press on a recent trip to the golf course. \"They subsequently cemented the family relationship as well. ... A lot of our dealings have been with Eric, a lot of our dealings have been with Ivanka. They have traveled here \u2014 and Donald Jr.\" Sajwani and his family also attended a New Year's Eve party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, with the incoming president describing them from on stage as \"the most beautiful people from Dubai.\" Trump received between $1 million to $5 million from DAMAC, according to a Federal Election Committee report submitted in May. It's unclear how much the contract will be worth once the golf course opens and starts operating. McLoughlin declined to offer specific figures. It is the first Trump venture in the Arab world. His first proposed project in Dubai, a 62-story tower with state-backed developer Nakheel, became a victim of the sheikhdom's 2009 financial crisis. By 2014, Trump knocked a golf ball down the fairway of what would become the golf course at Akoya. Sajwani called Trump a \"great man\" during the tour, and DAMAC later designed some 100 Trump-branded villas at the property, selling from 5 million dirhams ($1.3 million) to over 15 million dirhams ($4 million). With Trump set to be sworn in as president, security analysts have suggested properties bearing his name could be targets. His campaign pledge calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the U.S., followed by his proposal to conduct \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants, also sparked regional anger . The Trump logos on the golf course even came down for a short time . Still, the United Arab Emirates, a staunch U.S. ally in the war against the Islamic State group and host to some 5,000 American military personnel, remains a peaceful corner of the Middle East . \"Dubai is one of the safest cities in the world,\" McLoughlin said. \"Dubai has proved itself to be safe. We have no extra concerns about this golf course.\" Dubai police did not respond to a request for comment about security at the property. Financial matters raise other questions. DAMAC, a private company, purchased the property for Akoya from Dubai's government in 2012 for around $350 million. Dubai's government ultimately answers to the emirate's hereditary ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who also is the UAE's vice president and prime minister. All services to the property \u2014 electricity, water, roads \u2014 come at the discretion of the government. The club's bar will need government approvals to serve alcohol, not to mention other regulatory issues. That could raise concerns about the so-called \"emoluments clause\" of the U.S. constitution, which bars public officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments and companies controlled by them without the consent of Congress. Any negotiations involving the Trump brand at the least could create the appearance of impropriety, legal experts warn. \"He has so many properties that his business interests become an obvious target for both bribes and threats,\" said Gordon, the Stanford law professor. \"The dangers really come in two directions: One is that foreign powers will try to use Trump's interests as a way of bribing him into public policies in a way that are friendly to them or use them put pressure on him.\" Trump has said he will step away from managing his business empire while in office, but has offered few details other than to say his executives \"will run it with my children.\" Erik Jensen, a law professor emeritus at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said that alone could pose problems. \"Turning over control to the kids just doesn't do it. They clearly are going to be having holiday meals together, talking on the telephone,\" Jensen said. \"There's going to be a lot of contact there.\" Even putting assets in a blind trust, like other presidents have, likely wouldn't work since, for example, he would know the trust holds a golf course in Dubai. \"You can put it in the trust, but the adjective 'blind' wouldn't apply in that situation,\" Jensen said. Also, DAMAC's Sajwani has had dealings with the U.S. government. He credits some of his fortune to contracting work his companies did in supplying U.S. forces during the 1991 Gulf War that expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Over the past decade, his companies have been awarded at least $1 million in contracting work, according to U.S. government records reviewed by the AP. McLoughlin did not respond to a query regarding whether DAMAC would continue to seek U.S. government contracts. DAMAC stock traded after the election at near a yearlong low of 2.02 dirhams (55 cents) a share, in part due to the company announcing an 11.7 percent fall in third-quarter profits as Dubai's housing market has slowed in 2016. Stock then rebounded, reaching 2.53 dirhams (69 cents) just before New Year's Eve, as the company began handing over properties at Akoya. Sajwani's business dealings have drawn international scrutiny in the past. After Egypt's 2011 Arab Spring protests, a local court sentenced him to five years in prison and a $40.5 million fine over a 2006 land deal. Egypt and DAMAC later reached an undisclosed settlement in international arbitration and Sajwani never served prison time. DAMAC, which competes against largely state-backed developers in Dubai, focuses on flashy projects, like offering homes built around luxury Bugatti sports cars . But when it comes to building the projects, it like other companies relies heavily on subcontractors who largely employ low-paid laborers from Asian countries like India and Pakistan. There have been no formal complaints by workers alleging the Trump golf course or the larger DAMAC project mistreats laborers. However, that alone shouldn't be taken as a sign that everything is fine, said James Lynch, who focuses on Gulf labor issues for Amnesty International. The Emirati government and local businesses remain sensitive about their image in regards to the millions of workers employed in the country, something Lynch knows all too well as he was barred from entering the UAE in 2015 to discuss laborers' rights. \"Under international standards, construction companies in the Gulf are not only responsible for how they treat their direct employees,\" Lynch said. \"They have a responsibility to put in place measures to ensure that their subcontractors do not abuse the rights of people working for them.\" The Trump Organization and his transition team did not respond to AP requests for comment. McLoughlin of DAMAC did not respond to a request for comment regarding labor issues. For now, workers manicure the golf course's empty greens. Others put the finishing touches on a clubhouse that will feature a bar, a water-pipe tobacco lounge and restaurants for those paying the course's dues, which start at around $10,000 a year. While DAMAC's contract with Trump allows them to use his image in advertising the course, McLoughlin said the company would be \"tasteful\" in its promotions. However, he said at least some of Trump's children likely would be on hand for the opening of the course. \"It's their baby,\" McLoughlin said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Vivian Salama in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

The decision to scrap changes to the ethics office came during an emergency GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning. Just hours earlier, Trump fired off a pair of tweets criticizing the timing of the Monday-night vote by House Republicans to place the Office of Congressional Ethics, known as OCE, under the jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee. With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 ........may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 It was a notably tepid response from a president-elect who ran on a campaign platform of ethics reform, pledging to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, but a signal of how the issue was becoming a political distraction. The scramble by House Republicans over the rules change marred an otherwise successful first day back that saw Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan win reelection as Speaker of the House with just one Republican defection. That vote was a show of strength for the Speaker, who faced questions over his leadership after sparring with President-Elect Donald Trump during the campaign cycle \u2014 questions that were compounded by the Monday-night vote to gut the OCE. Ryan opposed the rule change and spoke out against it, so its initial inclusion signaled both a rebuke to the Speaker and a failure of his whip operation.

Democrats seized on the Monday night vote as evidence Republicans plan to \"engage in the same corrosive and unethical behavior that led to the creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics in the first place,\" as a spokesman for the House Democrats' campaign arm put it in a statement. \"This is a shameless way to start the new Congress and every House Republican should immediately voice public opposition - and ultimately vote against - these shady rule changes,\" said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Spokesman Tyler Law. Indeed, one of the figures that inspired the creation of the OCE \u2014 Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was indicted for his role at the center of a massive political corruption scandal in 2005 \u2014 said the timing of the move was \"incredibly unwise.\" \"I think unfortunately, it was incredibly unwise politically to make that one of the lead things that they were doing as a new Congress,\" he said. Abramoff said there was \"some justification\" behind the criticism of the OCE for conducting its investigations in such a public way, that sometimes hurt lawmakers without ultimately finding any wrongdoing. But he noted that voters went to the polls in part fueled by frustration with the way Washington works \u2014 and an effort to undermine government oversight seemed to ignore that. \"Don't they realize what the election was about in November? It was about that Americans are sick and tired of what goes on in Washington. So, this should not have been the first thing that people hear about,\" he said. The Abramoff scandal was just one of a rash of ethics scandals that plagued the GOP-led Congress at the time and helped deliver the House to Democrats during the 2006 elections. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the OCE in 2008 as a response to what she characterized at the time as a \"culture of corruption\" that had taken over Washington If passed, the measure would've given the ethics oversight and investigative role to the lawmakers themselves and prevented information about investigations from being released to the public. Members of both parties have privately criticized the OCE as overly aggressive and at times unfair, subjecting them to public complaints (and eventually expensive legal bills) that often came to nothing. That was the case made by a number of Republican lawmakers at Monday night's Republican caucus meeting, where a majority of members in attendance voted to adopt the amendment. Rep. Bob Goodlatte's office said the amendment, which he introduced, was intended to increase protection of due process rights for House representatives or staffers under investigation and grant them more access to basic \"evidentiary standards.\" But even those who agreed with the substance of the amendment acknowledged it was \"very bad optics\" for House Republicans to be seen as gutting an ethics watchdog on their first day back at work, as former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis put it. \"No member likes this thing,\" he said, but \"the optics are terrible.\" Davis, who was on Capitol Hill Tuesday conferring with members of both parties about legislative priorities ahead, said to get beyond the negative headlines of the day Republicans \"need to move forward with their agenda immediately\u2026do what they were elected to do.\" Alexandra Jaffe ",

Officials say the girl was skiing ahead of the class when it appears she lost control and struck a tree. She was wearing a helmet. The girl was transported to a Grand Rapids hospital, where she died of her injuries Monday. Her name has not been released. The girl was visiting from Illinois with her family. The\u00a0 Traverse City Record Eagle reported that the girl is from the Chicago area. Associated Press ",

Mark Wahlberg in \u201cBoogie Nights.\u201dNew Line Cinema Movies New to Netflix If you had a bad New Year\u2019s Eve, watch this movie \u2014 which depicts an almost certainly worse New Year\u2019s Eve (poor Little Bill) \u2014 and feel slightly better. \u2018Miss Sharon Jones!\u2019 (Jan. 7) Director Barbara Kopple (\u201cHarlan County, U.S.A.\u201d) captures the unstoppable energy of Sharon Jones, the frontwoman for the funk and soul band the Dap-Kings, who died in November at age 60.

Also of Interest New Netflix Original TV Series \u2018One Day at a Time\u2019 (Jan. 6) This modern version of the Norman Lear sitcom, which ran from 1975 to 1984, is set among a Cuban-American family living in Los Angeles. A military veteran-single mother (Justina Machado) tries to raise her two kids with the help of her mother, played by Rita Moreno. Apparently, new shows with laugh tracks can still be pretty good. \u2018A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2019 (Jan. 13) Three newly orphaned children are forced to live with their dastardly relative in this adaptation of the beloved children\u2019s novels by Lemony Snicket.

From left, Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin in \u201cThe Piano.\u201dMiramax Films New on Amazon Prime and Hulu \u2018Happy Feet\u2019 (Amazon Prime) Director George Miller takes a departure from his water-starved \u201cMad Max\u201d series in this animated film, which imagines an Antarctic colony of tap-dancing penguins. The voice cast includes Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman. \u2018 Am\u00e9lie \u2019 (Hulu) Full of whimsy and good feelings, this French romantic comedy is a fitting cure for a dreary day. Putting her own feelings of loneliness aside, a do-gooder waitress named Am\u00e9lie (Audrey Tautou), decides to improve the lives of those around her. Those allergic to all things twee may not enjoy this sugar-sweet Parisian fantasy. \u2018Cruel Intentions\u2019 (Hulu) A meanspirited game among rich New York City teens makes for a steamy time in this modern version of \u201cLes Liaisons Dangereuses.\u201d The film stars three young and beautiful stars \u2014 Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. \u2018 The Piano\u2019 (Hulu) Jane Campion\u2019s moving period drama features a mute pianist (Holly Hunter) who, along with her feisty child (Anna Paquin), is stuck in a stifling New Zealand home with her cold new husband (Sam Neill).

(The character names are amazing.) This movie will feed your need for death-defying fight scenes, cars barreling through the desert and explosions. \u2018The Visit\u2019 (Jan. 13) Every child knows that old people are kind of scary. And in M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s latest, a visit to grandma\u2019s house gets the horror movie treatment. Two kids travel deep into the woods to visit the grandparents they haven\u2019t seen in years. But there\u2019s something strange about their behavior. Like, very strange. It\u2019s Shyamalan\u2019s strongest film in years.

The reason? They were told to kill, they said, by a tall and faceless being named Slenderman, an internet meme. \u2018Becoming Warren Buffett\u2019 (Jan. 30) One of the richest men in the world gets the full documentary treatment. New on Showtime \u2018Coffee and Cigarettes\u2019 Director Jim Jarmusch\u2019s chill compilation of black-and-white shorts meanders through various conversations without forsaking its titular substances as both conversation aids and topics. And with cast members as varied as Iggy Pop, Tom Waits, RZA, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina, you\u2019re bound to find at least one pairing that captures your attention. \u2018 Bridge of Spies \u2019 (Jan. 14) Steven Spielberg\u2019s not done with period movies yet. This Cold War drama tells the story of a determined lawyer (Tom Hanks) and the spy exchange he shepherds along, trading a Russian for an American pilot. Mark Rylance, who portrays the slippery Russian spy, won an Oscar for his performance. Movies Also of Interest From left, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones in \u201cGhostbusters.\u201dSony Pictures Entertainment New on Starz Sergio Leone\u2019s \u2018Dollars\u2019 Trilogy If one of your New Year\u2019s resolutions is to catch up on more classic movies, this is now an easy batch to cross off your list. Sergio Leone\u2019s \u201cDollars\u201d trilogy follows the violent saga of the Man with no Name (Clint Eastwood). These three films \u2014 \u201cA Fistful of Dollars,\u201d \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d and \u201c The Good, the Bad and the Ugly \u201d \u2014 are among the most praised Westerns in cinema history. \u2018 Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb \u2019 (Jan. 6) Funny how this political satire from director Stanley Kubrick never grows old. At the height of the Cold War, a high-ranking general snaps and sends a warhead to Russia, inciting chaos among American and Russian leaders. Peter Sellers plays three roles in the movie, but none as memorable as his recovering Nazi, Dr. Strangelove. \u2018Ghostbusters\u2019 (Jan. 28) As a nostalgic tribute to the original film with its own quirky underdog story, 2016\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d had a lot of expectations to live up to. Good thing it had the talented comedians Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon to help it along. Also of Interest \u201cChinatown,\u201d \u201cGalaxy Quest,\u201d \u201cGrindhouse,\u201d \u201cHow to Steal a Million,\u201d \u201cKill Bill\u201d Vols. 1 and 2, \u201c Jerry Maguire ,\u201d \u201c Lawrence of Arabia ,\u201d \u201cSpaceballs,\u201d \u201cStarship Troopers,\u201d \u201cBad Lieutenant\u201d (Jan. 6), \u201cBarton Fink\u201d (Jan. 6) \u201c Three Days of the Condor \u201d (Jan. 6), \u201cExistenz\u201d (Jan. 20), \u201cPineapple Express\u201d (Jan. 21). From left, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave and Luke Wilson in \u201cBottle Rocket.\u201dColumbia Pictures New on Sundance Now \u2018Bottle Rocket\u2019 (Jan. 16) Wes Anderson\u2019s impressive first feature helped the director establish his signature style. In it, three misfit friends (Luke and Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave) embark on a crime spree without knowing much about robbery. Like many of Anderson\u2019s subsequent films, this one is bittersweet and oddly sentimental. \u2018Los Angeles Plays Itself\u2019 (Jan. 16) Thom Andersen\u2019s sprawling found-footage documentary about the City of Angels feels almost as big as Los Angeles itself. Using footage from dozens and dozens of Hollywood movies, he painstakingly reconstructs the city\u2019s fractured onscreen legacy. Also of Interest \u201cThe Professional\u201d (Jan. 3), \u201cEl Mariachi\u201d (Jan. 9), \u201cPersepolis\u201d (Jan. 16), \u201cPutney Swope\u201d (Jan. 16), \u201cThe Triplets of Belleville\u201d (Jan. 16), \u201cSafe\u201d (Jan. 23), \u201cTalk to Her\u201d (Jan. 23), \u201cCity of Lost Children\u201d (Jan. 30), \u201cSynecdoche, New York\u201d (Jan. 30).

Carol (Julianne Moore) should feel right at home with her posh life but is forced to retreat when severe allergies force her to withdraw from everyone around her. Terry Gilliam Collection (Jan. 6) Sample a bit of the imaginative worlds of the animator, director and Monty Python member Terry Gilliam. You can try the heartbreaking drama of \u201cThe Fisher King,\u201d starring Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges, or embark on a fantastical voyage with \u201cTime Bandits\u201d or \u201cThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen.\u201d Also of Interest \u201c2 Days in Paris\u201d (Jan. 6), \u201c Am\u00e9lie \u201d (Jan. 6), \u201cThe Kid with a Bike\u201d (Jan. 6 on the Criterion Channel), \u201cCertified Copy\u201d (Jan. 11 on the Criterion Channel), \u201cPersepolis\u201d (Jan. 20), \u201cWendy and Lucy\u201d (Jan. 20).

Republicans are quickly discovering that repeal is easier said than done. Healthcare workers, patients, seniors and others rally in Los Angeles against GOP plans to repeal Obamacare. Republicans are quickly discovering that repeal is easier said than done. (Los Angeles Times) Noam N. Levey Contact Reporter Congressional Republicans , despite pledging to quickly repeal the Affordable Care Act , are struggling with\u00a0what parts of the law to roll back\u00a0and how to lock up the votes they will need, particularly in the Senate ,\u00a0to push their ambitious plans. Settling these questions may delay any major repeal vote for months. Just as importantly, a protracted debate could force President-elect Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers to preserve parts of the healthcare law they once swore to eliminate. And this\u00a0all must be resolved before they even turn to the question of how to replace the law. \u201cRepeal is not going to be as simple as some people might have thought,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, a former Senate GOP\u00a0budget official who is now senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\u00a0 \u201cThere are a number of Republicans, particularly in the Senate, who are going to be very nervous about voting to repeal something without knowing what this process may ultimately produce. \u2026 It could get a lot messier than people appreciate.\u201d Amid the simmering internal GOP discussions, Trump has said very little about how he wants to approach repealing and replacing the healthcare law, though he has kept up his criticism. He called the law \u201clousy healthcare\u201d on Tuesday. Trump\u00a0is sending Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a former member of Congress , to Capitol Hill on Wednesday\u00a0to meet with House Republicans to discuss the planned repeal push. Among other things, Republicans are still debating whether to scrap hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes that have helped extend health insurance to more than 20 million previously uncovered Americans, driving the nation\u2019s uninsured rate to historic lows.\u00a0 That money is viewed as critical to paying for any replacement that Republicans ultimately may develop and has already prompted several GOP lawmakers to voice misgivings about eliminating the tax revenues. Some in the GOP, particularly in state governments around the country, also are deeply concerned about rolling back federal aid that has allowed states to cover more low-income Americans through Medicaid . Thirty-one states, including many with Republican governors, have expanded Medicaid through Obamacare and could lose billions of dollars if the law is cut back. And in recent weeks, several state Republican leaders, including Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Montana House speaker Austin Knudsen, have voiced concerns about the loss of Medicaid coverage in their states. Adding to the uncertainty, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members, urged Congress on Monday \u00a0not to repeal Obamacare without first developing a replacement. In Washington, Republicans are also struggling to figure out what to do with Obamacare insurance marketplaces that Republicans worked for years to dismantle. In a reversal, GOP leaders now\u00a0are trying to figure out how to prevent their collapse, which would jeopardize coverage for millions more Americans. Insurance experts, including leading industry officials, have repeatedly warned Republicans over the past several months that repealing the health law without a replacement risks destabilizing insurance markets and will push many insurers to simply stop selling health plans. On top of the uncertainty over repeal is the absence of a plan to actually replace Obamacare, a policy challenge that has stumped the GOP for more than six years and which Republicans now say will take years more to resolve. That has made even many conservative health policy experts increasingly critical of the GOP legislative plan to repeal large parts of the law now while delaying a replacement. \u201cWe do not support this approach to repealing and replacing the ACA because it carries too much risk of unnecessary disruption to the existing insurance arrangements upon which many people are now relying to finance their health services, and because it is unlikely to produce a coherent reform of healthcare in the United States,\u201d\u00a0 Joseph Antos \u00a0and\u00a0 James Capretta \u00a0of the American Enterprise Institute wrote in the journal Health Affairs. Not long ago, GOP leaders were trumpeting their readiness to rapidly sweep the health law from the books.\u00a0\u00a0 \"With a Republican president, there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said last January after congressional Republicans sent President Obama legislation that eliminated many of the healthcare law\u2019s key pillars. That bill, which was crafted using budget rules that allow Republicans to circumvent filibusters in the Senate, was supposed to be the template for repeal. It removed the unpopular insurance mandates in the law that require Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine, rolled back federal aid for Medicaid,\u00a0scrapped federal insurance subsidies for low- and moderate-income consumers and eliminated a\u00a0Medicare surtax on high-income households and other taxes on medical device makers and health insurance companies that fund the law.\u00a0 To allow Republicans time to develop an alternative, the bill delayed implementation of the repeal for two years. (Obama vetoed the bill.) Senior Republicans on Capitol Hill have said they still hope to send Trump a repeal bill early this year that largely parallels this approach. Under the strategy being discussed,\u00a0the House and Senate over the next couple weeks will pass what is known as a budget resolution that will direct Congress to develop a repeal bill through a process called budget reconciliation. The House would then craft the repeal legislation, pass it and send it to the Senate. Under budget rules, Republicans, who have a 52-48 edge in the Senate, would need only a simple majority to pass the bill and send it to Trump. But this approach is fueling an escalating criticism from healthcare groups representing doctors, hospitals and patients, including the American Diabetes Assn. and the advocacy arms of the American Cancer Society, which have warned that the GOP repeal strategy threatens insurance protections for tens of millions of Americans, beyond just those covered through Obamacare. This week, four more leading physician groups \u2014\u00a0the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u00a0\u2014\u00a0urged congressional leaders not to repeal the law without first developing a replacement. \u201cEnactment of such a \u2018repeal, delay and replace\u2019 bill \u2026 would create chaos in insurance markets, causing plans to pull out of the markets, with more than 7 million losing coverage in 2017 alone,\u201d Dr. Nitin S. Damle, president of the American College of Physicians, wrote in a letter to Senate leaders . \u201cOur commitment to ensuring that patients have access to affordable coverage and medical care obligates us to urge the Senate to vote no on the budget resolution,\u201d Damle wrote.

    "text": "CBS/AP January 3, 2017, 5:46 PM Criminal investigation underway into accidental poisoning that killed 4 kids Email DALLAS -- A criminal investigation is underway into an apparent accidental poisoning involving a professional-grade pesticide that left four children dead and an Amarillo woman in critical condition, police said Tuesday. Authorities are looking into why the family had the pesticide pellets, called Weevil-cide, which is only supposed to be sold to people with professional licenses or certification. The product\u2019s manual, available online, outlines stringent guidelines for using the product including having two trained individuals apply it. Figures from the American Association of Poison Control Centers show that deaths from the pesticide are rare. The father of the children who died told first responders through a Spanish language interpreter that he had spread the pellets under the family\u2019s mobile home after obtaining the product from a friend, Amarillo Fire Capt. Larry Davis said. Davis said the product is not available for sale to the general public. The product\u2019s manual says it\u2019s intended for use in pest control in commercial transport or storage of commodities and animal feed.\u00a0 An investigation is underway into a deadly leak of highly poisonous gas in a Texas home. Four children were killed and six other family members w... Davis said the father does not have professional certification as far as he knows. He did not know whether the friend who gave him the product had a certification. Amarillo police spokesman Officer Jeb Hilton says the department\u2019s special crimes unit is investigating because of the child deaths. Once completed, the investigation will be turned over to the district attorney to determine whether charges will be filed. Hilton said other federal and state environmental regulation agencies may also investigate the use and storage of the chemical.\u00a0 Fire officials said the children who died were three boys -- ages 7, 9 and 11 -- and a 17-year-old girl. Officials have said all four children lived at the home in Amarillo, which is about 350 miles northwest of Dallas.\u00a0 Four children died from gas poisoning believed to have been caused by a pesticide sprayed under their Amarillo home, officials said. CBS News The children\u2019s mother, Martha Balderas, 45, was in critical condition Tuesday at University Medical Center in Lubbock, according to a hospital spokesman. Five other family members, including the father and four other children, were being treated at BSA Health System in Amarillo and were in stable condition, hospital and fire officials said early Tuesday. Crews who responded to a 5 a.m. call to the home on Monday originally thought it was related to carbon monoxide poisoning. Authorities later determined that phosphine gas was likely released when the father took a garden hose at some point Sunday and tried to rinse away some of the pellets because family members had complained of the smell.\u00a0 Toxic Phosphine gas is produced when aluminum phosphide is mixed with water or moisture,\u00a0 CBS Amarillo affiliate KFDA reported. The water started the chemical reaction that released the phosphine gas. A visitor arrived early Monday, found everyone sick and called 911. Phosphine gas can cause respiratory failure and in severe cases can cause a pulmonary edema, which fills the lungs full of fluid. The American Association of Poison Control Centers, which compiles data on poisoning, shows nine deaths from ingesting or breathing in aluminum phosphide between 2010 and 2015. Two of those deaths happened in Utah in 2010, when two young children died after a pest control company spread vole pesticide pellets that released phosphine gas. Authorities believe the gas seeped into the home through cracks in the foundation. Cynthia Aaron, the medical director for the Michigan Regional Poison Control Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan, said doctors there more often treated adult patients for exposure to phosphine gas from aluminum phosphide because the pesticide is often used in industrial shipping. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rare exposure, but deaths like this are rare,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see mostly the overdoses. For example, they used to use this in ship holds when they ship grain. So if they are de-mousing the big ship hold and someone doesn\u2019t realize the pesticide has been activated or they haven\u2019t yet been aired out properly, they might enter and pass out or die.\u201d Chip Orton, emergency management coordinator for the city of Amarillo and Potter and Randall counties, says his staff was working with a number of state and federal agencies to decontaminate the Amarillo home. He did not know when it would be safe for the family to return. About 10 police, fire and medical personnel who first responded to the home were taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, Davis said. Two were kept overnight for observation because of headache and nausea but were in good condition Tuesday, he said. Davis said the home was far enough away from neighbors that no other evacuations or treatments were necessary. Neighbors\u00a0 told KFDA \u00a0that the Balderas family was well known and liked in the community. \u201cThere was a lot of love in that family and still is,\u201d said Nichole Wells, a teacher at Travis Middle School who taught 3 of the 8 Balderas children. \u201cThey\u2019ll wave, they\u2019re polite, they\u2019re respectful. They were just such a great family, and they really knew what it was to be a family. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d \u00a0 Many said the family is going to struggle with the costs associated with the tragedy. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to have to change, and they\u2019re going to need a lot of help with four funerals simultaneously,\u201d said Wells. \u201cSo they\u2019re going to need the love and support from the community and even surrounding areas to really make this happen, and at least give them some sense of normalcy.\u201d \u00a0 A GoFundMe page has been set up \u00a0in the family\u2019s name, and surpassed its goal of $25,000.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

That puts guns ahead of HIV, Parkinson's disease, malnutrition, hypertension, intestinal infection, peptic ulcer, anemia, viral hepatitis, biliary tract disease, atherosclerosis and fires. Yet, the funding for research on gun violence lags far behind other leading causes of death, according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Researchers evaluated the leading causes of death in the U.S. and plotted them against the funding and publication of research dedicated to to them. Mortality Rate vs. Funding Journal of the American Medical Association hide caption toggle caption Journal of the American Medical Association Mortality Rate vs. Funding Journal of the American Medical Association The researchers wrote: \"Gun violence had 1.6% of the funding predicted ($1.4 billion predicted, $22 million observed) and had 4.5% of the volume of publications predicted (38,897 predicted, 1738 observed) from the regression analyses. Gun violence killed about as many individuals as sepsis. However, funding for gun violence research was about 0.7% of that for sepsis and publication volume about 4%. In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least funded cause of death after falls.\" NPR's Cheryl Corley reported that \"the researchers studied gun violence in Chicago over an eight-year period to explain how gun violence can spread like an infectious disease.\" She said medical advocates have long argued that gun violence is a public health crisis, and that the researchers say their study helps prove this point. Cheryl reports: \"Yale University sociologist Andrew Papachristos said researchers treated the idea of gun violence literally and created a network from more than 100,000 individuals at risk of getting shot. \" 'These gunshot victims \u2014 they're in very small social networks. They tend to cluster together in these networks. And really what our study shows is that gun violence cascades over time,' Papachristos said.\" Article continues after sponsorship Papachristos said the study helps show there must be a more coordinated approach to drive gun violence down, one that treats it as a public health epidemic and not just a policing problem.

Peter DeFazio. \u201cWe are going to give very strong support for rewriting NAFTA. The momentum for a new direction is very, very clear and growing.\u201d The Oregon congressman was joined by several other House Democrats and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka in arguing that decades of unfair trade deals have eliminated millions of U.S. jobs. The press conference on Capitol Hill, held at the start of the 115th Congress, offered a glimpse at an area where Trump and Democrats could find common ground. Trump won the presidency in large part by appealing to disaffected Americans, including many across the Midwest who have lost good-paying manufacturing jobs and have been marginalized in the workforce. The Republican threatened to scrap NAFTA if Canada and Mexico do not come to the negotiating table.\u00a0 Expand / Contract Jan. 3, 2017: Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, left, and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, center, speak on Capitol Hill. (FoxNews.com) Trumka -- leader of the country\u2019s largest trade union group -- said Tuesday he told Trump after his upset victory in November that he\u2019d be willing to work with him. \u201cEntire communities have lost their purpose and identity. And we have to fix that,\u201d said Trumka, whose union backed failed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cWorking people are looking for a new way forward on trade ... and we have to begin today.\u201d Trumka outlined what he called several \u201cbroad\u201d changes to NAFTA that include tougher trade enforcement and reworking labor agreements but later acknowledged, \u201cFrankly, every chapter should be improved.\u201d At the same time, the House Democrats rolled out their 21 Century Bill of Rights, which they called \u201ckey principles\u201d for rewriting a host of international trade deals including NAFTA, which Clinton\u2019s husband, President Bill Clinton, signed into law in the early-1990s. Trumka and House Democrats also boasted that they have essentially defeated the Obama administration-driven Trans Pacific Partnership pact and called for Trump to put an official end to the deal, along with reworking NAFTA with Canada and Mexico in his first 100 days in office. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTPP is dead,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut. However, she and others expressed concerns about working with Trump and about what he might do as president -- including whether he could get the GOP-controlled Congress and the so-called \u201cfree traders\u201d among his Cabinet picks to go along with trade reform. And they raised concerns about whether his reworked deals would further protect U.S. workers and the environment. \u201cIf he makes the workers\u2019 lives or the environment worse, he will have a serious price to pay,\u201d said DeLauro, who joined her fellow Democrats in calls to hold Trump \u201caccountable.\u201d Advertisement ",

Prosecutors said Manson and his followers were trying to incite a race war that he believed was prophesied in the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter.\" Mass murderer Charles Manson was taken from a Central Valley prison to a hospital for an undisclosed medical issue, two sources familiar with the situation said. One of the sources said Manson was seriously ill but could not provide specific information. Officials with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \u00a0declined to comment,\u00a0citing federal and state laws and saying inmates' medical information is private. \"We do not disclose inmate movements for safety and security reasons,\" said Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\u00a0 However, she said: \"He is alive.\" Manson\u00a0and other members of his so-called family were convicted of killing actress Sharon Tate and six other people during a bloody rampage in the Los Angeles area during two August nights in 1969. Prosecutors said that\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers were trying to incite a race war that he believed was in the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter.\" Tate, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was 8 1/2 months pregnant when she was killed at her hilltop home in Benedict Canyon on Aug. 9, 1969. Besides Tate, four others were stabbed and shot to death: Jay Sebring, 35; Voytek Frykowski, 32; Abigail Folger, 25, a coffee heiress; and Steven Parent, 18, a friend of Tate's caretaker. The word \"Pig\" was written on the front door in blood. The next night,\u00a0Manson\u00a0rode along with his followers to the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, then left three members\u00a0to kill the couple. Manson, now 82,\u00a0has had \"hundreds\" of rules violations, prison officials say, and has been in trouble for having a cellphone and a homemade weapon while incarcerated.\u00a0 Manson has been denied parole 12 times . His next parole hearing is scheduled for 2027, when he will be 92. He has been in prison since 1971 and is serving his time at Corcoran State Prison. In 2014, Manson and Afton Elaine Burton, a 26-year-old\u00a0Manson devotee,\u00a0 were granted a marriage license , but it expired before the two could marry. Last week,\u00a0state parole officials postponed a decision on setting free\u00a0Patricia Krenwinkel, a Manson follower and convicted killer, after the woman\u2019s attorney made new claims that she had been abused by Manson or another person. Krenwinkel was sent\u00a0to death row in 1971 after a Los Angeles jury convicted her of killing Tate and six others in a two-day rampage.\u00a0 ",

What to expect at CES 2017 'Deadpool' was one of the top-selling 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc titles in 2016. (Photo: 20th Century Fox) 8106 CONNECT TWEET 20 LINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE LAS VEGAS \u2014 4K TVs had a\u00a0coming-out party here five years ago. Now, the ultra high-definition format is hitting its stride. 4K Ultra HD televisions have experienced a successful slow burn since the first units\u00a0went on sale in October 2012. Then last year, consumers embraced the TVs, which display four times the resolution of standard HDTVs. As prices fell, they bought about 10 million 4K LCD TVs, according to the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the Consumer Electronics Show that\u00a0runs here through Sunday. CTA anticipates another 15 million 4K LCD TVs will be sold this year, driving the installed base of 4K TVs to 34 million or more, meaning as many as one in four\u00a0U.S. households potentially could own one by the end of 2017. FULL COVERAGE: CES 2017 Helping drive the uptick: more content to watch and lower prices for TVs. DirecTV, Amazon, Netflix and other streaming services have increased the amount of\u00a04K video content they deliver. Plus, consumers are shelling out for a surprisingly \u00a0resilient source of movies \u2014 super high definition movie discs. Best movies, TV shows you can watch in 4K That's why, along with a wave of new 4K TVs set to debut\u00a0at CES, there will also be new 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc players. \"It\u2019s not surprising that some consumers remain interested in physical media and disc players,\" said Mike Fasulo, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics, which will introduce its first 4K Blu-ray player expected to hit stores early this year (no price yet). \"For true connoisseurs, physical media still offers the best quality video,\" he said.\u00a0With a disc player, \"you can watch\u00a0a 4K HDR video\u00a0in your cabin in the woods, without worrying about a reliable Internet connection or bandwidth limitations.\" Samsung and Panasonic announced\u00a04K Ultra HD\u00a0Blu-ray Disc players last year here\u00a0at CES and brought their first models to market in 2016 (Samsung's currently sells for $350, Panasonic's for $700).\u00a0Microsoft's Xbox One S system, released this summer (starting at $250), also plays 4K Blu-rays. And Oppo, which brought out its first player in December for $549, has a higher-end model (no price yet) due in stores early this year. One of the first to deliver TVs with HDR (high dynamic range), many of Sony\u2019s 4K TVs offer better brightness, contrast. \u00a0(Photo: Sony) Six out of 10 4K TV buyers at Video & Audio Center stores also buy a 4K Blu-ray player, says Tom Campbell, chief technologist for the L.A.-area retailer, which sold the first 4K TV in 2012. \"People love the picture quality,\" Campbell\u00a0said. Prices of 4K TVs should continue to decline, making them increasingly attractive to consumers. The average price for a 4K set\u00a0in North America dipped below\u00a0$1,000\u00a0for the first time last year, according to IHS Markit Technology. This year, the average should fall to about $830, IHS estimates. \"A\u00a0lot of shoppers jumped into the market in 2016 as prices fell sharply,\" said Paul Gagnon, the\u00a0firm's director of TV sets research. TV makers will emphasize 4K this year, too, with 4K TVs making up more than 40% of TVs shipped in North America this year, he estimates. In 2016, 4K accounted for 27% of TVs shipped. 4K \"is definitely going mainstream by the end of\u00a02017,\" says Mike Dunn, president of product\u00a0strategy and consumer business development at\u00a020th Century Fox. \"Pretty soon, if you are going to buy a television for your living room I don't think you'd buy anything other than a 4K TV with HDR.\" Hollywood is hopeful that 4K can sustain physical movie discs as a medium of delivery. To help entice consumers to purchase the higher-priced discs \u2014 a 4K Blu-ray may cost $25-$30, compared to a standard Blu-ray at $15-$20 \u2014 studios have packed most releases with a 4K disc and standard HD disc, as well as a downloadable copy for watching on portable devices and computers. Even though players only became readily available mid-year, more than 1.8 million 4K movie discs were sold in 2016, according to DEG: The Digital Entertainment Group, a home entertainment industry trade association. So far, 4K discs are outpacing by three times the sales of the original Blu-ray Discs. Studios expect to release 250 movies on 4K in 2017, adding to the 110 titles out already. Biggest seller so far? Deadpool. 4K Blu-rays are \"really the best way of watching a movie in the home,\" says DEG president Amy Jo Smith. \"People are going to see the difference, akin to the transition from the tape to the DVD.\" Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider .

    "text": "Hot neighborhoods poised to see growth among modest home price forecast Home sales Gail MarksJarvis Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago homeowners who have been waiting for real estate values to bounce back to the levels they were at before the housing crash probably will continue to be frustrated in 2017, although a couple of hot neighborhoods are poised to see appreciation. On average, home prices in the Chicago area will climb just 1.95 percent this year, according to economists with Realtor.com, the official website of the National Association of Realtors . That contrasts with a projected national average of 3.9 percent, and leaves Chicago far behind cities like Seattle and Denver, where home prices have recovered completely and hit new highs last year. Nationally, home prices returned to 2006 levels in 2016, meaning the country's housing market is back to its pre-crash health. But home values in the Chicago area remain about 19 percent below where they were before the crash, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index. Chicago's housing market will be the weakest of the country's 100 largest metro areas in 2017, said economist Jonathan Smoke of Realtor.com. Further, the Chicago area is one of the nation's worst for homeowners in serious financial pain. About 12.2 percent of homeowners are underwater on their mortgages, meaning they owe more on the mortgage than the house is worth, according to CoreLogic. Among the nation's largest cities, Chicago is less troubled than only Miami and Las Vegas, which were hotbeds of investor speculation in the housing mania that preceded the crash. (Gail MarksJarvis) The cure is rising prices, but the Chicago area's prices are moving so slowly the wait is long. People are holding on to their homes, waiting for a better day to sell if they have the luxury of waiting, according to real estate agents. If they must move for a job or sell due to an issue like a divorce, they must swallow hard and take what the depressed market will give them. Based on recent trends, Geoffrey Hewings predicts it will take 1.2 to 2 more years for Chicago-area homes to reach their peak 2006 values again. As the director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois, he analyzes the area's home sales and prices each month. The problem, he and other analysts say, is the sluggish local economy. Unemployment is higher in Illinois than in the nation and with limited job growth, new residents aren't moving into the Chicago area and buying homes, Smoke said. There is also angst about the inability of the state and some local governments to deal with pension problems and gloomy long-term budget projections. The uncertainty holding back homebuyers is especially evident in the luxury market and suburbs, said Jim Kinney, a real estate agent with Baird & Warner. \"People are concerned about the state not being able to solve its problems, and they figure it will lead to higher state taxes and property taxes too,\" he said. Still, there are pockets where prices have rebounded, and then some. Homes on Chicago's historically stable North Side are now 3 percent above their peak, but aren't likely to appreciate sharply from current levels, said Geoffrey Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. The Loop generally is doing well too, and the West Loop around Fulton Market has been on a tear. Average home prices in Lincoln Park, one of the stable areas north of the Loop, didn't decline as much after the crash, and then climbed 30 percent \u2014 bringing the median price of a single-family home up to $1.9 million in the third quarter, according to data from the Chicago Association of Realtors. That compared with a pre-crash 2006 peak of $1.4 million. But home price gains among Lincoln Park's single-family homes and condominiums have slowed. In 2016 they climbed just 2.5 percent, and Smith expects slow, steady growth in Lincoln Park and other North Side neighborhoods, among them Lakeview, North Center, Logan Square and Avondale. ",

    "text": "S. Korean President Refuses to Testify in Impeachment Trial By kim tong-hyung, associated press SEOUL, South Korea \u0097 Jan 3, 2017, 7:51 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH South Korean Lawmakers Vote to Impeach President Park Geun-hye 0 Shares Email South Korean President Park Geun-hye refused to testify Tuesday in the impeachment trial that will decide her future, prompting the prosecutors to question why she has publicly denied the charges of corruption but will not do so before the court. After Park's refusal, the Constitutional Court delayed the start of oral arguments and asked her to testify on Thursday, when some of her current and former aides are also scheduled to testify. The court cannot force her to appear but can proceed without her if she refuses twice to appear at the hearings. Lawmaker Kweon Seong Dong, the chief prosecutor in the trial, questioned why Park (pronounced Bahk) cannot defend herself in court when just two days ago she vehemently rejected the accusations of corruption in a hastily arranged meeting with reporters at Seoul's presidential Blue House. \"It's not good etiquette to the justices and also inappropriate for the president, as the defendant of the impeachment trial, to say this and that to the media outside of court,\" Kweon told reporters. Lee Joong-hwan, Park's lawyer, said she does not plan to appear Thursday and will probably not testify during the impeachment trial. The trial in the Constitutional Court must decide within six months of her Dec. 9 impeachment whether Park should permanently step down or should be reinstated to office. If the court formally removes Park from office, a presidential election will be held within 60 days. Park has been accused of colluding with confidante Choi (pronounced Chwey) Soon-sil to extort money and favors from companies and allowing the friend to manipulate government affairs. Choi, Choi's niece, and several former government and presidential officials have been indicted, and a special prosecution team has been investigating bribery suspicions between Park and business giant Samsung. The investigators want to bring home Choi's daughter, Yoora Chung, who was arrested in Denmark on an international warrant, as they look into the suspicions that Samsung sponsored Choi in exchange for government favors. Cho June-hyuck, Seoul's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that the ministry is preparing for the extradition of Chung, and that her passport will be invalidated if she doesn't hand it in by next Monday. Speaking to Korean reporters in Denmark, Chung said she's willing to return to South Korea if she could continue to be with her 19-month-old-son. She also said Samsung took back a horse and car it had provided her. Her Danish lawyer, Jan Schneider, said Chung denied any wrongdoing and that an appeal of her four-week detention had been filed. Prosecutor Mohammad Ahsan told The Associated Press that Denmark had not received yet a formal request from South Korea, adding it \"will be treated with thoroughness like any other similar case,\" adding \"any extradition will be assessed on what Danish law says.\" \"A decision would be made a few weeks after we have received a formal South Korean request,\" Ashan said. \"After that a decision will be sent to a court of law and can be appealed.\" The country's former health minister was arrested on allegations he forced the National Pension Service to support a merger between two Samsung affiliates last year. The deal shaved the fund's stake in one of the companies by an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars, but allowed Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong to promote a father-to-son succession of leadership and boost corporate wealth at the group. Lee has apologized for the use of corporate funds to buy a horse for Chung, an equestrian athlete, but denied that Samsung sought favors from Choi or Park's administration. There are also questions as to why Samsung financially supported a winter sports center run by Choi's niece and a sports management firm Choi established in Germany. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark, contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",
