    "text": "Continue reading the main story The court has never before ousted a president, though seven of the last eight have left office tainted by allegations of corruption. Whatever the court decides, the Park scandal has already put recurring collusion between big business and government in South Korea under intense scrutiny and could reshape the nation\u2019s flawed, young democracy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe created a miracle on the streets,\u201d said You Jong-il, a professor of macroeconomics and development policy in Sejong City, referring to huge, peaceful street protests demanding Ms. Park\u2019s resignation. \u201cBut we are still very worried about whether we will really be able to change Korean society and Korean politics.\u201d Public outrage \u2014 initially aimed at the influence that Ms. Choi, the daughter of a religious sect leader, appeared to exercise over the Park administration \u2014 has turned to broader concerns about the political system: the power of the presidency, and its symbiotic relationship with the chaebol , the family-controlled conglomerates like Samsung that dominate the economy. \u201cChaebol are accomplices!\u201d protesters have chanted, carrying effigies of their leaders dressed in blue prison uniforms. Damning new details emerge with every week. Prosecutors allege that Ms. Choi conspired with Ms. Park to force 53 companies to donate more than $69 million to the two foundations under Ms. Choi\u2019s control. The National Assembly went further in its impeachment motion, describing the donations as bribes personally benefiting Ms. Choi and paid in return for favors for the companies, ranging from lucrative licenses to presidential pardons. Photo Jay Y. Lee, front row, fourth from right, the heir apparent to the Samsung empire, and other executives of chaebol, or conglomerates, at a parliamentary hearing last month. Credit Pool photo by Jeon Heon-Kyun Ms. Park has denied the charges. At an extraordinary parliamentary hearing, Mr. Lee and eight other chaebol leaders also denied receiving or seeking special treatment for the donations. But they appeared to acknowledge that the payments were not entirely voluntary. \u201cIt was difficult to go against the government\u2019s wishes,\u201d testified Koo Bon-moo, the chairman of LG, the multinational electronics company. Mr. Lee called Samsung\u2019s contribution \u201cnot voluntary\u201d but \u201cinevitable.\u201d A History of Favors The meeting with Mr. Lee was one of eight that Ms. Park held with top chaebol executives in July 2015. Her lawyers have acknowledged that she asked for contributions to the two foundations in these meetings but deny that she promised any favors. Little is known about what else was discussed in these one-on-one sessions. The impeachment motion alleges that Ms. Park prepared for the meetings by asking her chief economic adviser, Ahn Chong-bum, for a memo outlining the issues that the chaebol needed help with. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But there is no doubt the chaebol have benefited from government support for decades. Ms. Park\u2019s father, Park Chung-hee, the country\u2019s first military dictator, pioneered the economic model before his assassination in 1979 . He showered a handful of businesses with favors such as tax benefits, cheap electricity, a buy-Korea policy and the suppression of organized labor. These companies eventually grew into industrial conglomerates, fueling the export-driven growth that lifted South Korea out of postwar poverty and made it one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies. Some of the firms, like Samsung, Hyundai and LG, are now global brands with publicly listed shares. But the founding families still dominate almost all the conglomerates, in part, critics say, because of lax enforcement of corporate governance and tax laws. In return for their support, Park and many of his successors as president expected the chaebol to contribute to government projects. And the chaebol did more than that, sometimes channeling money to the presidents\u2019 personal coffers or those of their relatives and associates. South Koreans are increasingly skeptical of the chaebol and the economic model they represent. The country\u2019s largest shipping line, Hanjin, recently filed for bankruptcy . Samsung, the icon of South Korean technological prowess, suffered global humiliation with its recent recall of exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones . The chaebol also face competition from China, which has begun producing many of the same goods, like petrochemicals, more cheaply. Some have angered the public by shifting manufacturing abroad even as their tentacle-like grip on the economy at home is blamed for squeezing start-ups and stifling innovation. Photo Choi Soon-sil at a court hearing in Seoul in December. Prosecutors say she conspired with Ms. Park to force 53 companies to donate more than $69 million to two foundations under Ms. Choi\u2019s control. Credit Pool photo, via Reuters Yet the conglomerates still enjoy some of the benefits that Park Chung-hee conferred on them more than four decades ago. They are taxed at lower effective rates than most companies or individuals, and receive more tax breaks. Businesses also pay lower electricity rates than individual consumers in South Korea. The benefits of such policies, Professor You said, \u201cis a very different order of magnitude compared to the sums of money that were donated to the foundations.\u201d Advertisement \u201cAll decisions are made with the interests of the chaebol in mind,\u201d he added of policy-making in recent decades. Politicians and the chaebol, he said, \u201chave been relying on each other to maintain their power.\u201d \u2018The President Is Interested in This\u2019 Few South Koreans believe the chaebol are innocent victims in the unfolding case. But while Ms. Choi and Mr. Ahn, the president\u2019s economic adviser, have been arrested, the authorities have not taken action against executives at any of the businesses. Historically, the chaebol titans have not been immune from prosecution. On the contrary, several have been convicted of bribery, tax evasion and embezzlement \u2014 yet remained at the helm of their businesses. That is because they are often granted suspended sentences or presidential pardons. At least six of the nation\u2019s top 10 chaebol, which generate revenue equivalent to more than 80 percent of gross domestic product, are led by men with criminal records. Since taking office in 2013, Ms. Park has granted two such pardons. Choi Tae-won, chairman of the SK Group, which spans chemicals, petroleum, telecommunications and semiconductors, received one in the summer of 2015. The other went this past summer to Lee Jae-hyun, the chairman of the CJ Group, which comprises businesses in foods, pharmaceuticals, entertainment and media. Both men had been imprisoned on corruption charges. Representatives of both men met with Ms. Park in 2015. And both the SK Group and the CJ Group made donations to Ms. Choi\u2019s foundations at the president\u2019s request, prosecutors said. The impeachment motion cites the pardons in accusing Ms. Park of selling favors. Lawmakers have also noted that the money for the foundations was collected through the Federation of Korean Industries, which lobbies on behalf of the chaebol. A special prosecutor is also examining the donation of $6.2 million by Samsung to support young equestrians, particularly Ms. Choi\u2019s daughter , Chung Yoo-ra, who trained in Germany using a thoroughbred purchased for $830,000. Photo Protesters in Seoul last month demanding Ms. Park\u2019s resignation. Credit Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters Ms. Chung, 20, has been living in hiding in Europe, ignoring repeated calls from South Korean investigators to return home to face criminal charges. Acting on a tip, the Danish police found her in the northern city of Aalborg and detained her Sunday evening . Advertisement Continue reading the main story The prosecutor is investigating reports that Ms. Choi used funds donated by Samsung to buy a house and motel in Germany, as well as to cover her daughter\u2019s personal expenses, including accessories for her pet dogs. Some of the payments made by the chaebol occurred while the government was weighing important decisions concerning the companies. For example, the SK Group and the retail conglomerate Lotte had lost valuable licenses to run duty-free shops in 2015 and lobbied to regain them last year. Lotte won back its license in December. At the same time, Lotte\u2019s top executives were under investigation on tax evasion and embezzlement charges. In October, prosecutors indicted Lotte\u2019s chairman, Shin Dong-bin, but did not arrest him, allowing him to continue running the business empire. While Mr. Shin was under investigation, prosecutors say, Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn pressured Lotte into donating $6 million for a sports complex to be built and managed by a company founded by Ms. Choi. The money was later returned. Prosecutors say other chaebol, including Hyundai, directed millions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts at Mr. Ahn\u2019s request to companies owned by Ms. Choi and her associates. The chaebol all wrote checks, prosecutors say, usually after Mr. Ahn uttered the magic words: \u201cThe president is interested in this.\u201d \u201cWhat we need is a great national cleanup,\u201d said Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who is the leading candidate to succeed Ms. Park. \u201cWe must sternly punish politics-business collusion, a legacy of the dictatorial era, and take this as an opportunity to reform chaebol.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Concentrated Power This is a recurring promise among presidential aspirants in South Korea. Almost every candidate in recent elections \u2014 including Ms. Park \u2014 has vowed to end government collusion with the chaebol. But the culture remains entrenched. The problem is exacerbated by how much power is concentrated in the presidency , relative to the legislature or to the judiciary. The president enjoys considerable influence over prosecutors, tax collectors and state security agents, whose careers are largely determined by political loyalty rather than merit. Photo The presidential Blue House in Seoul, where Ms. Park met with top chaebol executives and asked for contributions to the two foundations. Credit Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters Some lawmakers are calling for constitutional revisions to shift some of the president\u2019s authority to the prime minister, or even to abolish the presidency and introduce a parliamentary government. Another problem is the news media, which can be hesitant to confront the government and the chaebol, who are major advertisers. The president effectively handpicks the heads of the two biggest television stations, and the government can revoke the licenses of cable news channels. Journalists who tried to investigate Ms. Choi suffered a vicious official backlash. As early as 2014, the Segye Ilbo newspaper reported on an intelligence document alleging influence-peddling by Ms. Choi\u2019s family. Ms. Park attacked the leak, and her office pressed the newspaper to fire its president, according to the impeachment motion. Instead of investigating the allegations in the document, prosecutors interrogated Segye journalists on possible defamation charges, and reporters at the newspaper said the tax authorities had begun investigating businesses owned by the paper\u2019s parent company. A police officer accused of leaking the document killed himself. \u201cListen, journalists!\u201d Lt. Choi Kyong-rak wrote in his suicide note. \u201cThe people\u2019s right to know is what you live and exist for. Please do your job.\u201d Given the authority of the presidency, relatives and close friends often operate as rainmakers. In the past, the presidents\u2019 siblings and sons, while holding no official titles, often wielded enormous power as \u201cjunior presidents.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Park is unmarried, childless and estranged from her siblings, a status that she said would free her from nepotism and break the pattern. But she had Ms. Choi, whose family befriended her after the assassination of her mother in 1974. Prosecutors did not aggressively investigate the allegations against Ms. Choi until after Ms. Park delivered her first televised apology in October, a day after a local cable channel reported that Ms. Choi had edited the president\u2019s speeches. The story emboldened the press, prompting a flood of other damaging disclosures and then the huge street protests that eventually led prosecutors to conclude it was no longer politically tenable to do nothing. Cho Eung-cheon, a former prosecutor who is now an opposition lawmaker, said the authorities had moved too late. \u201cThe prosecutors we see now,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page, \u201care nothing more or less than a pack of hyenas attacking a crippled lion.\u201d ",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) Investors that want to cover all the bases when it comes to market risk might want to consider\u00a0the very worst-case \u2013 and best-case \u2013 scenarios for stocks in 2017. Wall Street\u2019s predictions for the new year are out.\u00a0The \u201cbase case\u201d is for a gain of around 5% for the stock market in 2017.\u00a0But a deeper dive into stock strategists\u2019 2017 outlook reports unearthed\u00a0bearish scenarios that envision the U.S. stock market potentially declining between 10% and 30%. There\u2019s also a bullish vision that sees stocks streaking 20% higher in the new year. Year-end 2017 price targets for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index from strategists at 15 Wall Street firms see the large-cap stock gauge\u00a0climbing to 2363, on average. That\u00a0equates to a 5.5% gain from Friday\u2019s 2016 year-end close of 2239. This middling mid-single digit call is built on the premise that the economic recovery and corporate profit growth will gain speed, helped\u00a0by renewed investor optimism after\u00a0the election of Donald Trump and high expectations for the president elect\u2019s growth-friendly platform. Trump\u2019s call for lower corporate taxes, less regulation of businesses and sizable spending on infrastructure has spurred a positive upturn in investor sentiment. But the \u201cbear case\u201d \u2013 or worst-case scenario \u2013 laid out by a handful of strategists suggest the S&P 500 could end 2017 down as much as 10%, which adds up to a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Or perhaps plunge as much as 30%, which would put it\u00a0well into bear-market territory, defined as a 20%-plus drop. Trump, turmoil: The top 10 business stories of 2016 In its \u201cYear Ahead Report,\u201d UBS Wealth Management Americas, highlighted a key lesson from 2016: \u201cDon\u2019t confuse a base case with a done deal. The past year has been ignominious for base-case forecasts. Donald Trump won the U.S. election. The UK voted to leave the EU. And central banks were forced to ease policy more than previously thought necessary.\u201d Here\u2019s how the \"bear\" case and \"bull\" case of Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, differ from her \"base\" case of the S&P 500 finishing 2017 at 2300, or about 3% higher than 2016\u2019s close. Her base case is dependent on policymakers ability to \u201cdeliver growth next year.\u201d But if that doesn\u2019t happen, look out below, warns Subramanian. In her \u201cbear case,\u201d she won\u2019t rule out a drop to 1600 for the S&P 500, which equates to a selloff of nearly 30%, or what she calls a \u201ctypical bear market decline.\u201d If policy makers \u201ccannot deliver a pick-up in growth,\u201d Subramanian\u00a0wrote, investors could be disappointed. If the economic backdrop gets worse instead of better as forecasters expect, \u201cmarkets would likely begin to price in an imminent recession,\u201d she warns, adding that stimulus from the Trump administration could push out the next recession by 12 to 18 months. The stock decline in 2017 could rival the downdraft at the start of 2016, when the S&P 500 fell\u00a010.5%, or be \u201ceven more severe,\u201d she warns. In search of potential trouble, Subramanian\u00a0will be closely monitoring Trump\u2019s comments related to trade, House Republicans\u2019 comments on deficits and spending, as well as the health of credit markets. Stock pros: Own these stocks in 2017 In sharp contrast, Subramanian\u2019s \"bull case\" is built on the assumption that everything goes right. If that occurs, the S&P 500 can climb another 21% to 2700, she says. \u201cIt would not take much to see a year of broad-based healing with no major shock,\u201d Subramanian, outlining her best-case scenario, wrote. \u201cThe most vaunted growth catalyst is the possibility of a significant stimulus package from the Trump administration next year. Instead of trade wars, we may get across-the-board tax cuts, a repatriation (tax) holiday and infrastructure spending. This could be the catalyst for a traditional euphoria-driven end-of-bull-market rally that could generate 20%-plus returns.\u201d None of the other 14 strategists comes close to Subramanian\u2019s best-case call. But many warn the stock market can go down if reality doesn\u2019t match investors\u2019 high expectations. The \u201cdownside shock\u201d scenario outlined by investment firm Strategas Research Partners is built on\u00a0an economy that doesn\u2019t rebound, but instead falls into recession, causing corporate profit growth to fall shy of market expectations. This \u201cbear case,\u201d which the firm places 20% odds on, would cause the S&P 500 to retreat to around 1790, or 20% lower than current levels. Jonathan Glionna, U.S. equity strategy at Barclays, also offers up\u00a0a \u201cbear case.\u201d The S&P 500 could tumble to 2000 \u2013 a 11% drop \u2013 if the U.S. dollar strengthens and interest rates climb a lot higher, causing corporate profits\u00a0to be less robust. Those twin\u00a0headwinds could cause \u201cinvestors to reassess risky assets,\" he wrote in his report. Glionna, though, doesn\u2019t see a recession on the horizon, citing the strong labor market as a sign of U.S. economic vitality. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, sees the S&P 500 rising 5% in his base case for 2017. But he won\u2019t rule out a 15% fall to 1900 if corporate earnings growth stalls and Trump\u2019s fiscal spending plans don\u2019t come to fruition or if people question their feasibility. The risk is if \u201cthe economy and earnings momentum stall,\u201d says Belski. 17 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iX0jtx NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Usha Boinavad, a  farmworker in western India who underwent a heart operation as a teenager, began suffering from chest pains last month. A doctor advised the 26-year-old to seek heart valve surgery in the nearest major city, 200 miles away. She immediately ran into another problem: cash. India has been in the grip of a severe currency shortage since early November, when the government banned 500 and 1,000 rupee bills \u2014 amounting to 86% of the cash in circulation \u2014 in an effort to fight corruption and tax evasion by forcing so-called black money into the formal economy and the banking system. Indians had until Dec. 30 to deposit the old notes at their banks. In the farming region where Boinavad and her husband live, banks have been slow to receive the new replacement bills, leaving most customers to wait. And like most rural Indians, the couple did not have a checkbook or debit card. Not that they even had the $1,500 or more that the operation would cost. But amid the currency crisis, they couldn\u2019t even scrape together $100 for transportation to the hospital. To raise cash, Boinavad\u2019s father decided to sell his two buffaloes. But the buyer asked him to wait a few days because he couldn\u2019t find cash either. It didn\u2019t come in time. Boinavad\u2019s pain worsened for several days until she died at her parents\u2019 home Dec. 13 in Nanded, 300 miles east of Mumbai. \u201cIf not for demonetization\u201d \u2014 the name for the government\u2019s policy \u2014 \u201cshe would still be with us,\u201d said Boinavad\u2019s cousin, Sanjeev Halde. Few peacetime episodes in India\u2019s 70-year history have proved as contentious or chaotic as the currency ban , which has unleashed tragic consequences across this cash-dependent economy and stained Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2019s reputation as a capable administrator. Nearly two months after Modi canceled the value of the two biggest bills in circulation \u2014 worth about $7.50 and $15 \u2014 cash remains scarce and \u00a0Indian news reports have attributed scores of deaths to the stress of not having access to cash, with some people collapsing after hours in the line at the ATM. Others have reportedly died after being refused treatment at hospitals because they couldn\u2019t pay cash. Bank employees have been said to have died of overwork. Reports of suicides and even a killing have been linked to the new policy. Modi had said the \u201cpain\u201d\u00a0would be over by now, but fewer than half\u00a0of the country\u2019s 200,000 cash machines are working\u00a0and strict limits remain on how much currency can be withdrawn from bank accounts. The misery has also taken subtler forms: migrant workers unable to send money home to their families, small businesses forced to close , a slowdown in sales of everything from SUVs to spinach. Foreign banks have slashed their 2017 growth forecasts for India, which has been the world\u2019s fastest-expanding major economy. Modi\u2019s government has struggled to explain why the policy, crafted in near-total secrecy, has been implemented in such a disorganized way. The central bank \u2014 the Reserve Bank of India, whose well-regarded Gov. Raghuram Rajan resigned amid disagreements with Modi\u2019s government in June \u2014\u00a0 has found itself becoming a national punchline as it issues rule upon rule on deposits and withdrawal limits, some conflicting with one another. \u201cIt is unfathomable why some of the smartest minds and most competent officials were unable to see that the currency transfusion will be a complex, difficult, painful process full of unintended consequences,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder of the Takshashila Institution, an independent policy research organization. Modi has offered alternating explanations for why he took such drastic action. He initially said his target was tax evaders who had supposedly stashed away large hoards of undeclared wealth \u2014 giving them until Dec. 30  to deposit it in banks, where it could be audited, or watch its value evaporate. But 80% of the canceled bills were deposited in the first three weeks. Some experts said that indicated there was less black money in the market than the government expected \u2014 or that much of it had effectively been laundered into legitimate accounts and would escape scrutiny from India\u2019s much-maligned tax authority. More recently, Modi has emphasized the need to reduce India\u2019s reliance on cash, encourage more people to use bank accounts and electronic payment methods\u00a0and modernize the economy. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has struggled to defend his chaotic demonetization policy, although opinion polls show he retains support.

(Prakash Singh / AFP/Getty Images) In that case, analysts said an overnight currency swap was too extreme. \u201cThe shifting goal posts are a sign that the authorities are desperately clutching at straws to justify their terribly flawed decision on demonetization,\u201d said Meera Sanyal, an opposition politician and former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland in India. Meanwhile, Indians have been outraged by stories of law enforcement agencies uncovering huge quantities of the otherwise scarce new bills. Tax inspectors in the eastern city of Chennai\u00a0reportedly seized more than $5 million in\u00a0new notes in a series of raids on well-connected businessmen, including $45,000 found at properties used by the state\u2019s top-ranking civil servant.\u00a0 Modi has expressed regret for the inconvenience but cast the policy as a nation-building project. One of the government\u2019s top economic advisors compared the disruption to Hurricane Katrina\u2019s effect on New Orleans, saying the economy would eventually rebuild. \"We cannot allow this fight against black money and corruption to stop or slow down,\" Modi said in a nationally televised speech New Year's Eve. \"Firmness in truth is a guarantee for success.\" Modi, elected in 2014 on promises to boost economic growth, remains popular, partly because of the shambolic performance of the political opposition. His Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, performed well in a pair of local elections in northern India last month, suggesting that many citizens are willing to tolerate the turmoil if it results in reforms. \u201cI think [Modi] must have thought it through,\u201d said Sayyad Jamal, a Mumbai furniture seller who pleads with customers to pay cash but ultimately supports the policy \u201cif black money is being eradicated.\u201d Experts say there is a powerful\u00a0feeling of schadenfreude\u00a0among the general public: a hope that India\u2019s highflying, tax-dodging one-percenters will suffer more if the economy is cleaned up. But that could have limits. ATMs in Mumbai and across India frequently run out of cash nearly two months after the government banned the two largest bills in an anti-corruption policy. Divyakant Solanki / European Pressphoto Agency ATMs in Mumbai and across India frequently run out of cash nearly two months after the government banned the two largest bills in an anti-corruption policy.

(Divyakant Solanki / European Pressphoto Agency) \u201cIf their inconvenience does not diminish faster than their schadenfreude, the mood will turn against Mr. Modi,\u201d Pai said. \u201cIt all depends on how quickly the [cash] transfusion can be completed.\u201d An analysis by IndiaSpend, a news site, suggested that the earliest that government printing presses could replace all $210 billion that was withdrawn from circulation is April 2017 \u2014 five months after the policy was introduced. It could take even longer for sufficient quantities of bills to reach the two-thirds of Indians who live in rural areas and remain tethered to cash. Only 2.5 million rural Indians had enrolled in cashless systems in the six weeks after the announcement, according to a government task force assigned to increase the use of electronic payments. \u00a0 Raghunath Kasbe, who works for a local council in Nanded, recalled how his father, a farmer, lined up outside the bank near his village for two straight days in mid-November, yet failed to obtain cash. On the third day he returned and joined the line before 8 a.m. Around noon, Kasbe got a call saying his father had collapsed while waiting. Digambar Kasbe, 60, died of a heart attack, doctors said. His son said he had been worried about paying for seeds and the wages of laborers who work on their 3-acre farm. \u201cHe was desperate because even my salary had been delayed \u2026 and it wasn\u2019t going to come any time soon,\u201d Raghunath Kasbe said. \u201cThere is no way we can do without cash.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

Mui December 30, 2016 Follow @ylanmui Lindsay Weekes, sits near\u00a0her 2-year-old son, Quinlan Weekes, who was born severely disabled because of an extremely rare genetic mutation diagnosed by WuXi NextCODE, through analysis of his genome. (Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) BOSTON \u2014 Lindsay Weekes knew something was wrong as soon as her son was born. Her pregnancy had been easy. The baby was a strapping 6 pounds, 12 ounces, with thick, curly black hair like his father\u2019s. But from the first moment Quinlan drew air, Lindsey could see he was tense, his muscles rigid. Within 24 hours, Quinlan was whisked away from their hospital to an intensive care unit at a nearby medical university. There he began a battery of tests in hopes of diagnosing his disorder, the start of a tortuous journey that has thrust the family into the center of a global economic race to push the limits of medicine. The search for an answer has taken Quinlan to the cutting edge of the emerging field: the use of genomics, the study of our DNA, to tailor health care. The United States has long been the industry\u2019s undisputed leader, performing much of the research that first decoded our DNA about 15 years ago. But now China is emerging as America\u2019s fiercest competitor, and it is sinking billions of dollars into research and funding promising new companies both at home and abroad \u2014 including a laboratory that handles some of the toughest cases at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, where Quinlan has become a favorite of the staff. Finding an answer for Quinlan and children like him relies as much on Chinese expertise as it does American ingenuity. One of the founders of the lab was born and trained in China before immigrating to the United States. Chinese company WuXi NextCODE is one of its chief investors, and researchers there use WuXi\u2019s programs to analyze the reams of data inside our DNA. [ Why treating diabetes keeps getting more expensive ] Under President-elect Donald Trump, America\u2019s relationship with China has been defined by frustration over the loss of factory jobs in the nation\u2019s industrial heartland to the assembly lines of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. But experts say it is the battle for dominance in innovation and science that is more likely to determine the economy of the future. \u201cI\u2019m very frustrated at how aggressively China is investing in this space while the U.S. is not moving with the same kind of purpose,\u201d said Eric Schadt, director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mount Sinai. \u201cChina has established themselves as a really competitive force.\u201d For the Weekes family, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. \u201cThere\u2019s some missing piece of the puzzle that we need to find right now,\u201d Lindsay Weekes said. Lindsay Weekes holds Quinlan as home care nurse Barbara Jean Otterson looks on. (Photo by Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) \u2018Did you see that?\u2019 Two years ago, on New Year\u2019s Eve, Weekes and her husband were squirreled away in their tidy split-level home in the suburbs of Boston. Quinlan had spent four days in the hospital after his birth and then was sent home when doctors couldn\u2019t pinpoint the problem. Now he was about 4 months old. Weekes looked down at Quinlan cradled in her arms and realized his lips were blue, his eyes staring blankly back at her. He was having a seizure. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d she called to her husband, Jaunel, who goes by the nickname \u201cBear.\u201d By the time he walked over, Quinlan\u2019s lips were once again a healthy pink. But then it happened twice more, and Weekes and Bear were riding in an ambulance with Quinlan on their way to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when the clock struck midnight. He didn\u2019t leave the hospital for another month. The seizures weren\u2019t the only problem. Quinlan had difficulty following objects with his eyes. He wasn\u2019t rolling over. And his doctors still didn\u2019t know why. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the diagnosis, so it was just treat the symptoms,\u201d Weekes said. The family hoped genetic testing would provide an answer. The cost of sequencing DNA has dropped dramatically since researchers unraveled our biological building blocks for the first time in 2001. Estimates of the pricetag for that initial discovery range from several hundred to a few billion dollars. Decoding a genome now runs between a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, spawning a flurry of potential new applications. Juanel \"Bear\" Weekes makes dinner beside a schedule of medical care for his 2-year-old son, Quinlan. (Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) Experts say the technology could prove as transformational as the Internet. Pharmaceutical companies want genetic information to concoct powerful new drugs. Hospitals hope to analyze genes to personalize medical care. And doctors believe genetic data could provide the keys to understanding rare and mysterious diseases like Quinlan\u2019s \u2014 and maybe one day even develop a cure. For China, the genomics revolution has been a chance to showcase its technical prowess as well as cultivate homegrown innovation. Over the past two decades, China transformed itself into an economic superpower through massive industrialization. But the country is now facing the limits of that model amid slowing growth, toxic pollution and the shift of manufacturing work to less-developed nations. To succeed over the next generation, China hopes to emulate Western-style entrepreneurship to transform its economy. \u201cWhen they looked out on the horizon, they saw that those who defined the cutting edge of the global economy are innovation leaders,\u201d said Denis Simon, executive vice chancellor of Duke Kunshan University in China. \u201cFor China to play a central role in world affairs, as well as to have a very competitive economy, it would have to step up its innovation game.\u201d [ To sway drug approval, patients with rare diseases turn up the heat on the FDA ] What China cannot create, it appears more than willing to buy. Chinese investors \u2014 both private and government-supported \u2014 are backing American start-ups in hopes of capturing the entrepreneurial spirit. China has sunk more than $3.6 billion into the U.S. health and biotechnology sector over the past 16 years, according to an analysis by Rhodium Group, a consulting firm. Scientist and entrepreneur Ge Li is a poster child for China\u2019s new model. Trained at Columbia University, Li was working as a laboratory scientist in Philadelphia in 2000 when he realized he could replicate his job in his home country for a fraction of the cost. His company, WuXi AppTec, which includes WuXi NextCODE, is now estimated to be worth more than $3.3 billion. Roughly 14,000 people carry out the company\u2019s research and product development around the world. In the United States, the company has helped finance an array of biotech start-ups, including the home DNA testing company 23andMe. It tests medical devices in St. Paul, Minn., and develops biologic drugs in Atlanta. In Philadelphia, it is one of the anchors of a technology hub in the city\u2019s Navy Yard, opening its third biomanufacturing facility there this fall. Until last year, WuXi\u2019s largest division was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is now privately owned, but speculation abounds that it will eventually go public again \u2014 on a Chinese exchange. \u201cWe\u2019re a U.S. company in the U.S., but we\u2019re a Chinese company in China,\u201d said Hannes Smarason, chief operating officer at WuXi NextCODE. \u201cWe\u2019re local in every market.\u201d Hannes Smarason, co-founder and chief operating officer\u00a0for WuXi NextCODE, sits in the company's offices in Cambridge, Mass. WuXi NextCODE and partner company Claritas have found previously unknown causes for rare congenital illnesses through their ability to search a patient's entire genome for disease causing mutations. (Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) The Quinlan genome project By about six months old, most babies are sitting up and smiling, laughing and clapping. Quinlan came down with a severe respiratory virus that sent him back to the hospital, then to a nearby rehabilitation center. His seizures became more severe, and he underwent a tracheotomy to help him breathe. \u201cYou pull your hair out,\u201d Weekes said. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor by any means, and I\u2019m sitting there trying to figure out, \u2018Why is my baby doing these things?\u2019 \u201d Sequencing is only the first step in what doctors call the \u201cdiagnostic odyssey.\u201d Making sense of the resulting mountain of data is its own challenge. Unspooling just one human genome takes up roughly 150 gigabytes, the equivalent of roughly 32 DVDs. The gene responsible for Quinlan\u2019s disorder could be hidden in any one of them. Geneticist Tim Yu is one of the founders of Claritas, the sequencing lab that handled Quinlan\u2019s case, and he hunted through the entire library of the boy\u2019s DNA for clues. A few years ago, a project this complex would have required getting bulky hard drives of genomic databases through the mail. WuXi NextCODE\u2019s big breakthrough was to speed up the process by introducing the medical equivalent of an Internet search engine, able to scour roughly two dozen reference databases over the Internet to find similar mutations. The creation of vast warehouses of genetic information has raised concerns about privacy, however. Critics have questioned drug companies\u2019 access to the databases, and there have been several well-publicized cases of researchers connecting people to DNA samples that were submitted anonymously. Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the advocacy group Center for Genetics and Society, said that China provides few safeguards for those who face discrimination based on what may be uncovered within their DNA. \u201cTechnically it can\u2019t be 100 percent assured that your data will remain anonymous,\u201d she said. Timothy Yu, co-founder and principal consultant to Claritas Genomics, stands amid an array of genomic sequencers that\u00a0is the largest of it's kind in North America. The machines can perform 185 million sequencing reactions in parallel, allowing Claritas and partner company WuXi NextCODE, to search a patient's entire genome for disease causing mutations. (Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) Smarason called WuXi\u2019s systems \u201cironclad,\u201d arguing that the data is not identifiable and is encrypted to defend against hackers. Consent is required from every person who is part of the database. \u201cMany patients with diseases for which there is no treatment and many with rare disorders want their data shared, in order to contribute to a better understanding of their condition and to develop better drugs,\u201d Smarason said. [ To bring a divided country together, start with a little spit ] Indeed, the larger the database, the better Yu\u2019s chances of finding the gene responsible for Quinlan\u2019s disorder. Yu looked for genes associated with Quinlan\u2019s unique symptoms: a small head, seizures, involuntary movements and rigid muscles. WuXi NextCODE\u2019s system found 120 that could have caused one of the symptoms. Nearly half of those genes were strong matches on both of the systems the lab uses to sequence patients\u2019 DNA. But WuXi\u2019s program found only six could have been passed down from parents who showed no sign of the disorder. One stood out to Yu, a clipped segment on chromosome 7, resulting in a mutation of the BRAT1 gene. \u201cThey are almost invariably bad,\u201d Yu said. At the time, only a handful similar cases had been documented in medical literature. In all of them, the babies died within months. Two-year-old Quinlan Weekes\u00a0was born severely disabled because of an extremely rare genetic mutation diagnosed by WuXi NextCODE, through analysis of his genome. (Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) Racing and waiting Quinlan\u2019s disorder now has a name: RMFSL, or rigidity and multifocal seizure syndrome, lethal neonate. But the description is no longer accurate: He has already survived much longer than the diagnosis would have predicted. Quinlan celebrated his second birthday at his grandparents\u2019 house. He wore a T-shirt with the Sesame Street character Grover on it, and his birthday cupcakes were decorated with blue icing and the Superman logo, a Q replacing the S. \u201cWhen we finally got the diagnosis, it was like a sigh of relief,\u201d Weekes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold, but at least we know why.\u201d Gene mutations similar to Quinlan\u2019s have recently been found in a handful of other children, suggesting a broader spectrum of symptoms and offering some hope for Quinlan\u2019s progress. One is 10 years old with only mild mental disabilities. Others are more severely compromised than he is. Yu and Quinlan\u2019s neurologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, Heather Olson, recently published a paper expanding the definition of the disorder. Medically, the diagnosis has helped in small ways. Children with his mutation often have trouble breathing, so Quinlan is on an oxygen monitor to guard against sleep apnea. Common colds get immediate and aggressive treatment. His parents and nurses pound on his chest to help him clear his lungs several times a day. There is no cure for Quinlan. But this past spring, Chinese officials launched a $9 billion investment in precision medicine, a wide-ranging initiative to not only sequence genes, but also develop customized new drugs using that data. The funding dwarfs a similar effort announced by President Obama a year ago that has an uncertain future in Trump\u2019s new administration. \u201cThe U.S. system has more dexterity and agility than the Chinese system,\u201d said Simon, of Duke Kunshan University. \u201cBut the learning curve in China is very powerful, and the Chinese are moving fast. The question is not if. The question is when.\u201d Quinlan and his family are waiting for the answers. More from Wonkblog: ",

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were helping search for David Puckett on Monday by going door-to-door within 2.5 miles of his home. Bloodhounds are also searching for him.\u00a0 Police say foul play isn\u2019t suspected, but they\u2019ve asked for help to find David as quickly as possible partly because of coming cold weather. His mother says he was only wearing a light jacket. On Sunday night, she issued a tearful appeal for people to help find him. Previous searches aided by a bloodhound and a helicopter didn\u2019t turn up any clues. Puckett, a student at Dartmouth Elementary School, has a slight learning disability. He wandered off from school once, and police are investigating this case under the assumption that he wandered off from home, CBS Denver reported.\u00a0 On Monday afternoon, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert in the case, something that was delayed initially part because there was no immediate evidence that there was an abduction. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously very concerned. We\u2019re all cold standing here bundled up, so the weather and the amount of time is increasingly concerning to us and that is why the CBI has issued this Amber Alert for us today,\u201d Aurora police spokeswoman Crystal McCoy said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Amber Phillips January 2 at 7:30 AM Follow byamberphillips By most measures, 2016 was the Republicans\u2019 year. They\u2019ll enter 2017 with near-historic majorities in Congress, governors\u2019 mansions and state legislatures, and as attorneys general, secretaries of state \u2014\u00a0you get the point. But Democrats and liberal advocates had some surprisingly major victories\u00a0in 2016, especially on state\u00a0referendums dealing with drugs, the minimum wage and guns. Here are the nine biggest state political and policy battles, divided into categories by which side won. Let\u2019s start with the Republicans first. Conservative/Republican wins 1. Republicans vs. Democrats Let\u2019s start with the most obvious battle line. Democrats lost so many state legislative seats during the Obama era \u2014\u00a0more than 900 \u2014 that prognosticators figured they had nowhere to go but up in the 2016 elections. Louis Jacobson with Governing Magazine said a really great election night for Democrats would be netting seven to eight state legislative chambers. That did not happen. Democrats picked up\u00a0three chambers (perhaps most impressively, they flipped both chambers in Nevada) but Republicans picked up enough chambers to offset those wins. Which means Republicans will\u00a0start 2017 pretty much the way they started 2016: With a 2-to-1 advantage over Democrats in state legislative chambers, essentially controlling 68 of 99 chambers. Pile on their victories at the gubernatorial level, and more than 25 states will be entirely controlled by Republicans . 2. Change vs. status quo At the presidential level, 2016 was one of the most significant change elections in recent history. But that spirit of change did not filter down\u00a0the ballot. Of the 7,383 lawmaker\u00a0positions, just 1,277 will be new lawmakers in 2017, said William Pound, the executive director of the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures, in a post-election webinar . Pound said that\u2019s a 17 percent turnover rate \u2014\u00a0\u201ca tad on the low side\u201d for the average. We\u2019re giving this one to Republicans, since they control a strong majority of state legislative seats, and the status quo is pretty great for them. If 2016 was a \u201cchange election,\u201d Democrats weren\u2019t able to make change work for them. 3. Political alignment of the South Kentucky Democrats spent much of 2016 trying to fight off the post-civil-rights-era realignment of the South from Democratic to Republican. They made a valiant effort. After Kentucky Democrats lost the governor\u2019s mansion and several statewide races in 2015, some of their members in the state House defected to the Republican Party. Democrats still managed to win a handful of special elections to keep the state House in Democratic hands. But it didn\u2019t last long. On election night, Kentucky Democrats lost control of the state House they had held on to for nearly a century \u2014\u00a0and with it, the party\u2019s last Southern legislative chamber . Democratic/liberal wins 1. Marijuana Marijuana legalization was on the line in a big way this election year. Voters in nine states were\u00a0deciding whether to legalize marijuana for medical or\u00a0recreational uses \u2014 the most ballot initiatives on a single issue since 2004, when 11 states had ballot initiatives to ban same-sex marriage. The result was overwhelming. Voters in eight of the nine states voted to ease restrictions on marijuana, meaning\u00a0some form of marijuana usage will soon be legal in 29 states and the District of Columbia (eight states will soon allow recreational marijuana). It was legalization proponents\u2019 biggest victory since 2012, when Colorado and Washington became the first U.S. states to legalize recreational marijuana. 2. Gun control (Rich Pedroncelli/AP) Before Election Day, universal background check proposals were 1 for 1 when put to the voters: In 2014, Washington became the first state in recent history to expand background checks. And gun-control advocates faced a defining test in\u00a0November when a record three states were deciding on whether to expand background checks. They passed \u2014 though not in every case. Background check proposals are now 3 for 4: Maine voters didn\u2019t approve criminal background checks, but Nevada voters did. And California, which already had background checks on the books to buy guns, voted to require people to pass background checks before they buy ammunition. Washington voters gave courts the authority to temporarily take away firearms from people thought to be at risk to themselves or others. 3. Minimum wage Minimum wage raises have a solid\u00a0track record when put to the voters. Over the past 20 years, every statewide minimum wage ballot measure save\u00a0two has passed. That record largely held in 2016. Of the four states considering raising the minimum wage, all four did. In addition, South Dakota voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure to reduce the state minimum wage for workers under 18. ",

The new launch date was included in a report SpaceX released on the explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 1. Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 1, 2016 The \"anomaly\" \u2014 SpaceX's word \u2014 was caused when supercold helium led carbon fibers and aluminum to cool at different rates on the second of the rocket's two stages, the company said. That opened gaps between two layers of overwrap, where liquid oxygen escaped and got trapped, it said. That, in turn, caused one of the protective layers to \"buckle,\" or fail. Static ignited the trapped oxygen, setting off a chain of catastrophic explosions, SpaceX said. Related: Blasting Into 2017: What's in the Stars For Space Travel The Falcon rocket was to have launched an AMOS-6 communications satellite for a Facebook-Eutelsat joint venture to extend Internet access to underserved parts of the world. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the loss but promised that \"we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.\" Post by NBC News . SpaceX, a private space venture run by billionaire inventor Elon Musk, said Monday that its engineers have managed to rejigger the configuration of the rocket's helium containers, moderating the temperature of the helium and presumably eliminating buckling in the overwrap layer. If it's successful, the next launch, tentatively schedule for Sunday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, will put 10 satellites into orbit to upgrade and replace some of the units in the Iridium Communications satellite constellation, a system of 66 satellites that provide voice and data coverage around the world. Targeting return to flight from Vandenberg with the @IridiumComm NEXT launch on January 8. Update: https://t.co/15yMaiobpX ",

By MARK LANDLER JAN. 1, 2017 WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama \u2019s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama\u2019s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. \u201cThe fever in this room has finally broken,\u201d the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer in nation-building mode.\u201d What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States \u2014 after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2,000 American lives lost \u2014 would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, \u201cthe counterterrorism challenges are real.\u201d As bleak as Afghanistan\u2019s prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan \u2014 the \u201cgood war\u201d to George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cbad war\u201d in Iraq \u2014 had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. Video A Developing Stance on the Afghan War President Obama's shifting approach to the conflict is a lens through which to judge his legacy as a wartime leader. By A.J. CHAVAR on Publish Date January 1, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,\u201d the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech , \u201cthat war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly.\u201d More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama\u2019s thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. \u201cWhen it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,\u201d he said in the interview, \u201cthat this is a long slog.\u201d \u2018A War That We Have to Win\u2019 Continue reading the main story Photo Two Marines on a mountain ridge overlooking the Pakistani border near Kamu, Afghanistan, in 2008.

Credit Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a \u201cdumb war.\u201d But in the same speech he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t oppose all wars.\u201d He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \u201cI would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,\u201d he told the crowd that day in Chicago\u2019s Federal Plaza. Advertisement Continue reading the main story By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq \u2014 the \u201cgood war,\u201d in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration\u2019s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. \u201cThis is a war that we have to win,\u201d he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10,000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50,000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country \u201cprecarious and urgent.\u201d More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year.

Credit Peter Schumacher/The Burlington Times-News, via Associated Press When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70,000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obama\u2019s military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq \u2014 a troop-heavy, time-consuming, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a well-functioning government. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40,000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. \u201cThere was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview.\u201d \u201cIn many ways, I think, he deferred,\u201d said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice.

Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number \u2014 20,000, for example \u2014 look like a path to certain defeat. \u201cPresident Obama was asking the military for broad options,\u201d said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only \u201cvariations\u201d on \u201cthe more robust counterinsurgency model.\u201d Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? \u201cWhen he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more,\u201d Mr. Eikenberry said. \u201cBut what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define.\u201d Given Mr. Obama\u2019s innate wariness of nation-building, it didn\u2019t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,\u201d he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. \u201cObama believes the military can do enormous things,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. \u201cIt can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can\u2019t create a political culture or build a society.\u201d \u2018Afghan Good Enough\u2019 Continue reading the main story Photo Mr. Obama and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement in Kabul in May 2012. The two had long had a rocky relationship. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept \u201cAfghan good enough.\u201d The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from nation-building to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100,000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, \u201cWow, this place looks great!\u201d The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama\u2019s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan\u2019s security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an \u201cenduring partnership\u201d between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that America\u2019s experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. \u201cOne year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal I set \u2014 to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild \u2014 is now within our reach.\u201d Earlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship \u2014 on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government \u2014 and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was \u201cvery aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because I\u2019d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us.\u201d Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a long-term security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. \u201cThe most underappreciated part of foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, \u201cis dealing with flawed partners.\u201d ISIS, a New, Radiating Threat Photo A bomb blast targeted NATO forces in Kabul in July 2015. Credit Shah Marai/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. \u201cThe mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,\u201d said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. \u201cISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The American-trained Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama\u2019s war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now,\u201d he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a \u201cbroken record\u201d on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10,000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend \u201cwell beyond your presidency,\u201d according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the front-line fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. \u201cThis goes to the politics of what I\u2019m leaving for the next president,\u201d he told the group , according to one of the participants. \u201cMy interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X,\u201d he added, referring to troop numbers, \u201cbut to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision.\u201d Photo President Obama addressed graduates at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., in May 2014. In his speech, he said the United States would train and equip foreign armies but leave the front-line fighting to them. Credit Gabriella Demczuk/The New York Times Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10,000 from more than 100,000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. \u201cAfghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The country \u201cwas riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It\u2019s still there.\u201d In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare \u2014 a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,\u201d he said. \u201cAs commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,\u201d he went on, \u201cI spend a lot of time brooding over these issues.

A federal judge ruled that Bernards Township discriminated against the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge by requiring it to provide more parking spots for their proposed mosque than other places of worship in the town. It was the latest development in a multi-year battle that has involved dozens of public hearings as well as allegations of anti-Muslim animus . A rendering of the proposed mosque taken from court documents. \"This brings the local community one step closer to have a place of their own in this township,\" Adeel Abdullah Mangi, an attorney representing the society, told NBC News on Monday.\"That means everything to the local Muslims.\" RELATED: Islamic Group Files Lawsuit Over Denied Mosque After Years-Long Planning Battle, Vandalism But Bernards Township Mayor Carol Bianchi refused to wave the white flag Monday. She said the township is weighing its next legal move and referred a reporter to her earlier statement criticizing U.S. District Court Judge Michael A. Shipp's ruling. \"This is a landmark ruling interpreting the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act that will have national impact in reaffirming that townships cannot treat applicants differently based on their religion.\" \"This decision has major implications for municipal land use boards and their ability to determine the actual off-street parking needs of proposed projects without fear of alleged (religious land-use) violations,\" Bianchi's statement read. \"The Township vehemently disagrees with the Court's decision and awaits a full analysis of the 57 page decision by its attorneys, who only learned of the decision on New Year's Day.\" Under township rules, churches are required to provide one parking spot for every three pew seats. Shipp,in his ruling Saturday, concluded the township treated the Muslim group differently from other religious groups by insisting that it provide even more parking. He wrote the three-to-one parking ratio for churches applies equally to mosques and synagogues. \"Viewing the pleadings in the light most favorable to defendants, the court finds that defendants discriminatorily applied the parking ordinance on the basis of religion,\" Shipp wrote. An excerpt of court documents detailing the battle over a proposed mosque in New Jersey. In oral arguments on Dec. 20, township attorney Howard Mankoff denied the board applied different standards based on religion. He insisted that a mosque is not considered a church under the township definition, adding that \"they're different because they have different needs.\" RELATED: Justice Department Sues New Jersey Township Over Years-Denied Mosque Mosque worshipers, Mankoff said, would likely be arriving one per car, straight from work, for the most well-attended religious services on Friday afternoons. He argued that the planning board should be allowed some discretion in applying the township parking ordinance. \"This decision has major implications for municipal land use boards and their ability to determine the actual off-street parking needs of proposed projects without fear of alleged (religious land-use) violations.\" In its 2012 application to build the 4,252-square-foot mosque, the society asked for 50 parking spots, based on a maximum attendance of 150 worshipers over the next five to 10 years. The board, which leaned heavily on the findings of a traffic engineer hired by a group opposed to the mosque, insisted the mosque provide 107 parking spaces. The New Year's Eve decision is the latest development in a case that has drawn national attention and prompted the Justice Department to file its own federal suit against Bernards Township in November. The Islamic society, which has accused the township of bowing to anti-Muslim activists in the community, claimed in its March lawsuit that the stricter parking requirement \"laid the groundwork for each of the board's bases for denying (the society's) preliminary and final site plan approval.\" Play ",

Citizen-Times 6:42 p.m. EST January 2, 2017 x Share The accused Charleston church shooter had a troubled past even before he was arrested for killing nine people at Emanuel AME Church in June 2015. USA TODAY NETWORK In a self-portrait taken shortly before his June 2015 attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., Dylann Roof poses in front of the Angel Oak near Charleston, a tree believed to be hundreds of years old.

(Photo: Courtesy of U.S. District Court of South Carolina) CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014\u00a0The federal judge overseeing the death penalty trial of Dylann Roof, convicted in the June 2015 attack on a Charleston church, ruled Monday that he can serve as his own attorney before a jury who will consider a sentence of life in prison or execution. In his order, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel wrote that Dr. James Ballenger, a forensic psychiatrist based in Charleston and former chair of the Medical University of South Carolina's Department of Psychiatry, met with Roof twice over the New Year\u2019s holiday weekend, \u201cconcluding that Defendant remained competent to stand trial and to self-represent.\u201d Gergel\u2019s decision came after a full day of testimony in a hearing that was closed to the public. Roof\u2019s defense team had sought to have the defendant declared incompetent to represent himself after he told the court last week that he planned to offer no witnesses or evidence in the shooting deaths of nine African American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. In Roof's self-defense, a constitutional quandary The sentencing phase of the case, originally expected to begin Tuesday, has been pushed to Wednesday at Roof\u2019s request, after he told the judge he had devoted much of the last several days to the competency hearing. A jury of 10 women and two men will hear opening statements. Roof has said in court that he plans to deliver an opening. In opting to serve as his own lawyer, the 22-year-old has blocked his defense team from offering psychologists and psychiatrists in the sentencing phase of the trial. A jury on Dec. 15 found Roof guilty of 33 federal counts, and the next day, a U.S. marshal delivered a court notice to the defendant, one that informed him a hearing would be held in coming days regarding any mental health evidence he might present in his defense. Roof told the marshal to wait, and immediately penned a response on notebook paper. \u201cI, Dylann Roof, withdraw the notice to present mental health mitigation through expert testimony,\u201d he wrote, reversing a strategy laid out months earlier by his defense attorneys. \u201cI will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence.\u201d As sentencing resumes, prosecutors anticipate calling nearly 40 people to the stand, most of them family members of the victims, though the lead FBI agent in the case is expected to again testify as prosecutors seek a death sentence. In a handwritten note penned on Dec. 16, 2016, one day after he was convicted of shooting to death nine parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Dylann Roof informed the court he would not offer a mental health defense in his death penalty case. \u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of U.S. District Court of South Carolina) Based on Roof\u2019s plans to proceed without a defense, his standby counselors asked the court to review if he is competent, the second time they have done so since proceedings began. In November, Gergel found Roof was fit to self-represent following two days of in-person and written testimony from eight people. Ballenger was appointed by the court to evaluate Roof ahead of both competency hearings, and over the New Year\u2019s holiday weekend saw Roof for about five hours, Gergel said. Dr. Rachel Loftin, a clinical psychologist based at Chicago\u2019s Rush University Medical Center, and an Orthodox priest also appeared at the hearing. What those witnesses told the court is unknown, but transcripts of the competency hearings will be released after jurors reach a sentencing verdict, Gergel said, adding he anticipates that will occur in about 10 days.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare , that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved \u2014 the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. \u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. \u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201d The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats \u2014 including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, President-elect Trump\u2019s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he\u2019s sworn in,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating middle-class families and the economy.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many business-related, that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. \u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201d In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster . But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him \u2014 want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party\u2019s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. \u201cThis is no time for hubris,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou have to perform.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline:  G.O.P.

USA TODAY Network investigation. (Photo: Ramon Padilla, USA TODAY) After high school football coach Kip McFarlin was accused of using sexually suggestive language to students and telling one he\u2019d date her if he were younger, the Orangefield Independent School District in Texas wanted McFarlin gone.\u00a0But the district didn\u2019t fire him. Or report him to police. Or inform teacher licensing officials, despite a state law requiring a report. In 2005, district officials found a way to give him \u201ca graceful exit,\u201d and send him off with a clean record, which he used to get another teaching job.\u00a0Six years later, at a school in Port Arthur, Texas,\u00a0he had sex with a 16-year-old student and was later convicted of\u00a0sexual assault. A USA TODAY Network investigation found dozens of teachers with\u00a0hidden histories of sexual misconduct working at schools or in other jobs with access to children, where supervisors knew nothing of their pasts.\u00a0In several cases, there were tragic results.\u00a0Illinois elementary school students were forced to eat off a teacher\u2019s crotch. Five\u00a0elementary school students were sexually molested in New Jersey. Hiding sexual misconduct, enabling perpetrators to move on, is so common among school systems that\u00a0there\u2019s a name for it: \u201cpassing the trash.\u201d And yet even though educators and child advocates have long known about the problem, existing laws have failed to end the practice. Efforts to pass new laws have been thwarted, at times by teachers\u2019 unions\u00a0or have missed the crux of the problem. For instance, some congressional lawmakers have pressed for a federal government database of school personnel fired for sexual misconduct to prevent them from getting new jobs. Such a database \u2014 which could also be maintained by a private group, such as the one for school superintendents \u2014 would help. But it\u00a0\u00a0would work only if other underlying problems are addressed first. Among the most basic: Some schools fail to make even the most rudimentary pre-hiring checks. A private Louisiana high school hired a teacher who was a registered sex offender in neighboring Texas. Students looking on the Internet stumbled upon the listing. Even so, the school did not report him\u00a0and gave him a positive recommendation. He went on to teach at a public school until a parent accused him of sending sexually inappropriate emails to a student. While more than 40\u00a0states have laws requiring school personnel to report sexual abuse, district and school officials either flout them or find ways to sneak through loopholes. That\u2019s what happened with McFarlin after the school district\u2019s lawyer advised officials not to report to the licensing agency because he \u201cis not guilty of abuse or an unlawful act, just inappropriate and stupid remarks.\"\u00a0 School districts sometimes go further than just passing the trash,\u00a0sending predators along with neutral or good recommendations, or signing agreements to hide files alleging misconduct. One reason? To avoid the hassle of trying to fire union-protected teachers, which can cost more than $100,000, even with a \u201cslam-dunk case,\u201d as one administrator told the Government Accountability Office in 2010. What\u2019s to be done? States need to broaden definitions of what must be reported to include sexual misconduct, not just alleged criminal acts. And while more than 40 states provide penalties for failure to report, the laws are seldom enforced.\u00a0They should be. A federal law, passed a year ago, requires states to pass a law or regulation to prohibit allowing educators accused of sexual misconduct to leave without a record of the allegations.\u00a0Three states already had such laws, but only two \u2014\u00a0Texas and Connecticut \u2014\u00a0have passed new laws this year.\u00a0In Connecticut, the effort\u00a0met with resistance from teachers\u2019 unions.\u00a0 The Connecticut chapter of the American Federation of Teachers argued that the proposal\u00a0\"overreached\" and could \u00a0prevent \u201cnegotiating separation agreements and could potentially result in a flood of teacher termination hearings.\u201d Certainly, teachers accused of misconduct deserve due process, but no public employee deserves a free pass on sexual misconduct, much less the opportunity to strike again. Every state should comply with\u00a0the federal law. Finally, laws and regulations aside, nothing will improve until every educator decides that where sexual misconduct is suspected, failure to report or keeping secrets is morally unacceptable. Until that happens, laws will not prevent more children from being hurt. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its\u00a0 Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.

    "text": "Titanic doomed by ice -- and fire? Published               January 02, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 A deadly combination of ice \u2013 and fire \u2013 share collective blame for the sinking of the Titanic, according to a group of experts who believe a massive below-decks blaze weakened the hull so massively that an iceberg had no problem cutting a gaping hole through it. Journalist Senan Molony studied rarely-seen photographs of the doomed luxury liner before it left Belfast shipyard and, along with several experts, identified 30-foot-long black marks along the hull likely caused by the massive on-board coal fire, The Independent reported. The black marks are located just behind where an iceberg penetrated the Titanic late at night on April 14, 1912. \u201cWe are looking at the exact area where the iceberg stuck, and we appear to have a weakness or damage to the hull in that specific place, before she even left Belfast,\u201d Molony said in a documentary broadcast on Britain\u2019s Channel 4 on New Year\u2019s Day. TITANIC ARTIFACTS REVEAL GRUESOME DISCOVERY OF LAST LIFEBOAT Though the fire \u2013 which raged at 1000 degrees and resisted attempts by a 12-man crew to extinguish it \u2013 was previously known about, the black marks that likely resulted from it were only recently uncovered. Researcher Ray Boston in 2008 said the Titanic was probably traveling so fast on the night it sank because of the fire. Though the fire started about 10 days before the ship departed, it continued to burn in coal bunker six of the ship throughout the ill-fated voyage, according to testimony from a stoker who survived the sinking. The stoker told an inquiry that many workers believed fireboats in New York harbor would eventually need to be called upon to help extinguish the fire. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t need such help,\u201d he said, according to The Independent . \u201cIt was right under bunker number six that the iceberg tore the biggest hole in the Titanic.\u201d Boston said \u201cinevitable explosions\u201d would have resulted from the fire and the owner of the ship hoped to reach New York and unload the passengers before they occurred. So the ship sailed speedily through icy waters with lookouts posted in a single location \u2013 and struck an iceberg. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a simple story of colliding with an iceberg and sinking,\u201d Molony said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence.\u201d Trending in Science ",

Back Story Photo Credit Larry Mayer/Associated Press \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55,\u201d the rocker Sammy Hagar once famously wailed , but 43 years ago this week, he and every other American driver were faced with obeying the first federal speed limit. Setting speed limits had been the states\u2019 responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act , lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more fuel-efficient vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan . The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m.p.h. That\u2019s the fastest in the country, though it\u2019s slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany\u2019s autobahn have no maximum limit. It\u2019s a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901, Connecticut limited some drivers to 12 miles per hour .

The fire department said the case appears to be an \"accidental poisoning with no criminal intent.\" The victims were found after the fire department responded to a medical call around 5 a.m. today, the fire department said. Besides the four fatalities, several people were hospitalized, the fire department said. Family members told the fire department the pesticide contained the chemical aluminum phosphide, officials said. \"At some point, a family member tried washing the chemical from underneath the house with water,\" the fire department said. \"When this chemical comes in contact with water, it creates Phosphine gas, which is highly poisonous and can cause pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.\" The fire department said it's unclear how long the family was exposed. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Getty Images.) The oldest Baby Boomers are now in retirement age, while the youngest are in their 50s. Considering that many Baby Boomers don't have substantial retirement savings, Social Security is set to remain a critically important source of income for millions of that generation as they retire over the next couple of decades. Here's a closer look at three important facts that play a big role in how well Social Security will work for you and how much income you'll get. Whether you're ready to retire soon or still a decade or more away, these three facts about Social Security will affect you. Full retirement age is set to change soon Once you turn 62, you become eligible for Social Security retirement, but at a reduction to your full benefit, which you become eligible for at \"full retirement age.\" For anyone born in 1943-1954, the full retirement age is 66. But for anyone born in 1955 or later, you should know that full retirement age is set to increase. Starting in 2020, anyone born in 1955 will reach full retirement age at 66 years, two months. For those born in 1956, they'll have to wait another two months, to 66 years, four months. This two-month increase will continue until people born in 1960 or later reach the new full retirement age of 67 in 2027. Why does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. For instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for Social Security at a reduced level. Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62. \u00a0(Photo: Getty Images.) But someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. It may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments. In other words, it's very important to know what your full retirement age is, no matter what age you plan to retire. A few months' difference could make thousands of dollars in difference in how much money you get. This affects your spouse, too Whether your spouse plans to retire on their own work record or on yours, the rules still apply when it comes to full retirement age and what their benefit will be. In other words, if your spouse is younger than you, it may be necessary for them to continue to work \u2013 or at least delay filing for Social Security if they don't work \u2013 in order to make sure the monthly benefit will be sufficient to cover your expenses. When you take Social Security, it has repercussions for your spouse, maybe even after you die. \u00a0(Photo: Getty Images) This is particularly important to consider if your spouse will file on your work record, and is likely to outlive you. Here's what the Social Security Administration says about the survivor's benefit and how it could be lower if you retire before full retirement age. If your spouse started receiving retirement benefits before their full retirement age, we cannot pay you the full retirement age benefit amount from their record. The maximum survivors benefit is limited to what they would receive if they were still alive. In other words, before you decide to take Social Security early, you may want to consider how it would impact your surviving spouse's income if they are likely to outlive you and would receive the survivor's benefit. If you're likely to live very long or die very early, it may affect when you should take Social Security Social Security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. And while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different. But if you're an outlier with a significant chance of either living much longer than average or dying younger, that could affect what makes the most sense for you. Here's a table that breaks down where you would maximize your total benefit, based on filing age and age of death: \u00a0(Photo: Data source: Social Security Administration. Chart by author.) This table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited. Take a balanced approach and consider all the repercussions The facts above are largely about the financial impact of when you take Social Security. And while the financial part should play a primary role in when you file, it's not the only thing that matters. We must each also consider what kind of retirement we want, the value of other retirement assets\u00a0and what we want to do with the time we have before we die. And the more you understand about Social Security before you retire, the more time you'll have to plan and prepare.

By Tom Hamburger January 2 at 6:01 PM Follow @thamburger A bipartisan group of ethics advocates lobbed a second\u00a0letter\u00a0to President-elect Donald Trump on Monday evening\u00a0warning him that he needs to do more to separate himself from his family business interests. The letter comes after Trump announced some changes in his business empire, with more expected before Inauguration Day. The letter signers\u00a0include\u00a0two conservative allies of Trump senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 Peter Schweizer, the author of the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d which outlined possible conflicts of interest posed by\u00a0Hillary Clinton because of donations to her husband's charitable foundation, as well as John Pudner, who went to high school with Bannon and now runs\u00a0the advocacy group Take Back Our Republic. Monday's letter urged the incoming president \u201cto divest your business enterprises into a true blind trust managed by an independent trustee having no family relationship with you, or the equivalent, in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics in Government Act.\u201d The letter expressed appreciation for the steps that have been taken by Trump to address his conflicts of interest problems, including\u00a0terminating or limiting plans for Trump projects in\u00a0Brazil, Azerbaijan, Georgia and elsewhere and shutting the president-elect's charitable foundation. But the ethics experts\u00a0said more action is required: \u201cAs long as you continue to maintain ownership of The Trump Organization, no other steps that you take will prevent the serious conflicts of interest, appearance of conflicts, and Emoluments Clause problems that will exist throughout your presidency.\u00a0In these circumstances, you cannot separate the presidency\u00a0 from your business enterprises.\u201d As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, questions and concerns have been raised over how his business interests may interfere with the business of running the country. The Washington Post spoke to Public Citizen to untangle and unpack the potential consequences of Trump's conflicts. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) The 29 signers to the letter included Republicans and Democrats, and liberal and conservative groups. In addition to Schweizer and Pudner, signers include\u00a0Norm Eisen, President Obama\u2019s chief ethics lawyer, and Richard Painter, former president George W. Bush\u2019s chief ethics lawyer. They also include two former\u00a0Republican governors\u00a0and five former Republican House members. The signers conclude with a tough warning: \u201cRespectfully, you cannot serve the country as president and also own a world-wide business enterprise, without seriously damaging the presidency.\u201d --Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

GALLAGHER Jan 2, 2017, 12:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH 12 Killings in Chicago Over Christmas Weekend 0 Shares Email A long and violent year in Chicago ended with 762 homicides, police say. That's more than twice the number in New York City, where police said 335 were killed. Last year marked Chicago's worst homicide rate in two decades, according to The Associated Press. The deceased were among 4,331 shooting victims during the year, accounting for 17.5 percent. The stories of violence are unrelenting: Nykea Aldridge, a mother of four, was shot dead in August after being caught in crossfire while pushing her baby in a stroller on Chicago's South Side. In November, the 15-year-old grandson of U.S. Rep. Danny Davis , D-Ill., was shot dead over a pair of gym shoes. 'Spiraling Out of Control' ABC News contributor John Cohen, a law enforcement and homeland security expert whose roles have included counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, described the violence in Chicago as \"spiraling out of control.\" Beyond Chicago, he said, \u201ca growing number of major cities are receiving a significant increase in robberies, homicides and aggravated assaults.\u201d He cited three factors he believes may be behind the uptick in violence: 1. An increase in gang activity and violent behavior by career criminals. 2. An increase in the availability of illegal guns, coupled with an increase in criminals' willingness to use them. 3. And an increase in the reluctance by law enforcement to engage in proactive, violence prevention policies. Such hesitancy, Cohen said, is because \"officers of various ranks are worried they will respond to a split-second decision and end up being the next person blasted all over the media and will lose their job.\" Officers respond to their calls for service and do what they can, Cohen said, but they are \"hesitant to be proactive\" and \"target violent criminals.\" Criminals sense any hesitancy, Cohen said, and believe they are less likely to be stopped. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson told the AP recently that officers have become more careful, partly because they're concerned about viral videos. Johnson added at a news conference last week that police officers are not the reason for the heightened violence in Chicago; he said over 8,000 guns were recovered in 2016 and all those encounters put cops at risk. Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images A member of the Chicago Police Department collects bullet casings at the scene of a shooting near the intersection of South Morgan Street and West 97th Street in Chicago on July 3, 2016. How Violence in Chicago Compares to Other Cities 'Empowered' Gang Members There is no simple explanation for why the violence is so extreme, Johnson told reporters last week, but he pointed to the prevalence of gang activity. He also noted that the \"the anti-police rhetoric\" in Chicago and across the country \"has emboldened and actually empowered these gang members to do what they do.\" Gang members may believe community residents will take their side instead of the police's, he added. Johnson said the violence in Chicago is mostly on the city's south and west sides, in areas with a history of gang conflicts. Of the 12 killings in Chicago over Christmas weekend, he said, 90 percent of the victims had gang affiliations, criminal histories and were pre-identified by the department's \"strategic subject algorithm\" as being a potential offender or victim of gun violence. The majority of the 27 shootings Christmas weekend were \"targeted attacks\" by gangs against potential rival gang members at holiday gatherings, Johnson said. Cohen, the ABC News contributor, said the concentration of violence in specific neighborhoods can be explained by social issues, like a lack of education or employment, which he said can create a feeling of hopelessness for young people and may contribute to why they gravitate toward the violent gang lifestyle. Gangs not only provide income, Cohen said, but give young people a familial connection and sense of protection. \"If we don't get a handle on this problem,\" Cohen said, \"law enforcement officials that I've been speaking to are saying ... we'll see continuing increases.\" Scott Olson/Getty Images Police investigate the scene of a quadruple homicide on the city's Southside, Dec. 17, 2016 in Chicago. Targeting Gang Violence Cohen suggested several steps for Chicago to get a handle on the gang violence: First, he said, the police must identify and aggressively target violent gang members and other violent repeat offenders. \"The overwhelming majority of violent crime is committed by people who have engaged in violent criminal activity,\" he said. Second, police \"have to work to prevent illegal guns from getting into the hands of people who cannot legally possess them,\" Cohen said. \"There's nobody on either side of the gun-control issue who thinks career repeat offenders ... should be able to possess a gun,\" he said. \"And there are policing strategies that are directly focused on preventing stolen weapons from falling into the hands of violent gang members and repeat violent offenders. \"Third, you have to address the underlying issues,\" Cohen said. Citing Los Angeles\u2019 efforts in the 1980s and early-1990s, Cohen said that city successfully worked to address underlying issues in neighborhoods that contributed to a sense of hopelessness. As in Chicago now, L.A. crime then was spiraling out of control, driven by violent gang activity, he said. First, L.A. police initiated dramatic uniformed and undercover police presences; Cohen said he and other law enforcement officers zeroed in on South Central Los Angeles communities to find the most violent, repeat offenders and target them with federal prosecution. Also, authorities in L.A. worked with local government and community groups to address some of the underlying issues, like poor education opportunities, Cohen added. The aggressive enforcement, coupled with addressing the underlying issues, brought significant decreases in gang activity, and violent crime more broadly, in South Central Los Angeles, he said. Without addressing the underlying issues, Cohen said, \"there will be a revolving door\" of people who will engage in violent behavior. Joshua Lott/Getty Images Sheila Jones looks to the sky during a vigil for her daughter who was killed as she walked through her apartment complex July 27, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. The Community-Police Relationship Cohen also cited trust between communities and police as something that\u2019s missing nowadays in cities including Chicago, where he said law enforcement officers need to engage proactively with residents, understand what's important to communities and work with them. Cohen complimented New York City's police officers, saying they go to community meetings and ask what issues are important to the community, which \"changes the dynamic\" of the conversation. In return, people are willing to talk to officers about problems, he said, which creates personal relationships. A Call for Legislative Change Johnson, the Chicago police superintendent who called the level of violence in his city \"unacceptable,\" is pushing for a legislative change to help curb the \"reckless gun culture\" in Chicago. Johnson said he hopes a new law will give judges autonomy to sentence repeat gun offenders to the middle- or high-end of the range, because he says repeat offenders are not willing to \"play by society's rules.\" \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that we hold repeat gun offenders accountable for their actions,\" he told reporters Dec. 26, adding that the city must change the narrative so offenders don\u2019t want to pick up a gun. Johnson hopes the legislation will give cops \"a fighting chance\" to hold offenders accountable to begin to change the narrative in the city. \"We all have a vested interest in reducing this gun violence,\" he said. \"It's not OK and it's not normal. When I go home and my neighbors see me, they are constantly asking what can we do to reduce this gun violence? \"We know that the long-term solutions [are] to invest in these impoverished areas, provide more jobs, better education,\" Johnson said, adding, \"The urgent solution right now is for state legislatures to help us with this gun bill. \"If you pick up a gun and shoot somebody you should go to prison, period,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t get a pass from me.\" 0 Shares ",

Schaben / Los Angeles Times Protesters against the development of Newport Banning Ranch celebrate in September after the Coastal Commission rejected a large development project proposed for the property. Protesters against the development of Newport Banning Ranch celebrate in September after the Coastal Commission rejected a large development project proposed for the property. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Bradley Zint The California Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in San Francisco on a preservation group's lawsuit challenging the Newport Beach City Council's approval of a proposed development at Banning Ranch. The Banning Ranch Conservancy, which seeks to preserve the sprawling coastal property in West Newport as open space, is accusing the city of violating  its own general plan when, in 2012,\u00a0 the council approved \u00a0a large residential and commercial development for the area. The group contends the general plan prioritizes open space in West Newport and that city officials failed to work with the California Coastal Commission to prioritize sensitive habitat areas. The conservancy also says the project's environmental impact report was inadequate. At the time, developer Newport Banning Ranch sought to build 1,375 homes, a 75-room hotel and a commercial area on about 95 acres of the 401-acre property, which has been an active oil field since the 1940s. Newport Banning Ranch's plans were downgraded by September this year, when it looked to build 895 homes as well as the 75-room hotel, a 20-bed hostel and 45,100 square feet of retail space on 62 acres. The Coastal Commission\u00a0 rejected that plan , and in November the developer\u00a0 sued in Orange County Superior Court , challenging the denial and requesting damages of at least $490 million. The Banning Ranch Conservancy lawsuit was filed in Superior Court soon after the council's decision in 2012. The following year, a county judge ruled in the conservancy's favor. City officials challenged that ruling, which sent the matter to state appeals court. The conservancy then appealed to the state Supreme Court, which\u00a0 agreed to review the case . Banning Ranch Conservancy Executive Director Steve Ray said his group was always prepared for the lawsuit to reach the state's highest court. \"That was truly the only place where we could hope to win,\" Ray said. \"We built our case upon arguments that will resonate in the Supreme Court.\" He said the conservancy's ultimate plan is to acquire the property \u2014 whose market value is a matter of dispute \u2014 and manage it for public use. Newport Beach City Atty. Aaron Harp contended that the city did an \"exhaustive\" environmental analysis of the property and that the court should defer to the city to interpret its own general plan. A spokesman for Newport Banning Ranch declined to comment. Each side will receive 30 minutes  Wednesday to speak to the court's seven justices. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. It will be broadcast live on the court's website,\u00a0 courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm . Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

Prosecutors say the center used expired ingredients and failed to follow cleanliness standards , resulting in tainted steroid injections.\u00a0 The 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak killed 64 people and sickened over 750. People in 20 states were affected; Indiana, Michigan, and Tennessee were the hardest hit. About half developed a rare fungal form of meningitis. The rest suffered joint or spinal infections. A \u201c60 Minutes\u201d investigation \u00a0in 2013 found that the New England Compounding Center was manufacturing large quantities of steroids without FDA approval, rather than preparing individual prescriptions. A whistleblower who worked at the center said mold was repeatedly found in the \u201cclean room,\u201d a supposedly sterile environment where drugs were prepared. Cadden pleaded not guilty and is free on bail. His lawyer has said that federal prosecutors overreached in charging him with murder. The outbreak prompted new federal and state laws to better regulate compounding pharmacies, which custom-mix medications and supply them directly to hospitals and doctors. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

By David Weigel January 1 at 7:46 PM Follow daveweigel For six years, since they took back the House of Representatives, Republicans have added to a pile of legislation that moldered outside the White House. In their thwarted agenda, financial regulations were to be unspooled. Business taxes were to be slashed. Planned Parenthood would be stripped of federal funds. The \u00adAffordable Care Act was teed up for repeal \u2014 dozens of times. When the 115th Congress begins this week, with Republicans firmly in charge of the House and Senate, much of that legislation will form the basis of the most ambitious conservative policy agenda since the 1920s. And rather than a Democratic president standing in the way, a soon-to-be-inaugurated Donald Trump seems ready to sign much of it into law. The dynamic reflects just how ready Congress is to push through a conservative makeover of government, and how little Trump\u2019s unpredictable, attention-grabbing style matters to the Republican game plan. That plan was long in the making. Almost the entire agenda has already been vetted, promoted and worked over by Republicans and think tanks that look at the White House less for leadership and more for signing ceremonies. (Peter Stevenson,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) In 2012, Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s Grover Norquist described the ideal president as \u201ca Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen\u201d and \u201csign the legislation that has already been prepared.\u201d In 2015, when Senate Republicans used procedural maneuvers to undermine a potential Democratic filibuster and vote to repeal the health-care law, it did not matter that President Obama\u2019s White House stopped them: As the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action put it, the process was \u201ca trial run for 2017, when we will hopefully have a President willing to sign a full repeal bill.\u201d \u201cWhat I told our committees a year ago was: Assume you get the White House and Congress,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told CNBC in a post-election interview last month. \u201cCome 2018, what do you want to have accomplished?\u201d Negotiations with the incoming Trump administration, he said, were mostly \u201con timeline, on an execution strategy.\u201d Few presidential candidates have dominated the coverage of an election like Trump did in 2016. In the campaign\u2019s final stretch, Republican candidates often got less attention for their records in Congress than for their positions on Trump\u2019s controversial statements. The irony, as Democrats realized after the election, was that congressional Republicans were poised to have more influence over the national agenda in 2017 than congressional Democrats did after the 2008 election that put Obama in the White House with his party in control on Capitol Hill. While the Democratic majority in 2009 was larger than the GOP advantage this year, the Democrats were hamstrung in ways they came to regret. Responding to the Great Recession, they spent the transition and first month of 2009 on a $831\u00a0billion stimulus package, with Obama aides openly hoping that they could pass it with bipartisan supermajorities. Every House Republican and all but three Senate Republicans opposed it, and within 20 days of inauguration, the first tea party protests had broken out against it. Protesters twinned their opposition to the stimulus with opposition to the bank bailouts, which had bipartisan backing. Since November, Republicans have preempted any problems like this by making no attempt to frame their agenda as bipartisan. 1 of 55 Here\u2019s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. Caption He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House. \u00a0Dec. 31, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania, answers questions from reporters at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. In his first news conference after the election, Ryan said that voters had delivered a mandate for \u201cunified Republican government.\u201d Eight years earlier, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had said only that Americans \u201cvoted in large numbers for change\u201d and said the White House would be driving the agenda. This year\u2019s agenda from House and Senate Republicans has clarity that was often lacking from Trump\u2019s own campaign. Senate Republicans favor using a procedure known as \u201cbudget reconciliation,\u201d in which measures can be passed with a simple 51-vote majority rather than a filibuster-proof 60 votes, to tackle the ACA and to undo much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform. As part of undoing the financial overhaul law, some GOP leaders have begun planning strategies for how to effectively kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whether by giving Congress control over its budget or finding cause to replace its director, Richard Cordray, with a weaker board. \u201cI\u2019d like to repeal the whole thing, period,\u201d Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby said of Dodd-Frank in a December interview with the Wall Street Journal. The reconciliation process is also likely to be used to pass tax changes, which both Trump and congressional Republicans want to use to lower rates and end the estate tax. Republicans also are examining ways to undo many of the regulations and other orders enacted by Obama and his administration, including ones issued in the weeks since Trump\u2019s victory and designed to solidify the Democratic president\u2019s environmental legacy. GOP leaders have cited the 21-year old Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to cast simple majority votes of disapproval for regulations, as a way to block anything the administration has ordered since June 2016. Since its passage, the CRA has been used only once. But in December, the conservative House Freedom Caucus began compiling a list of more than 200 regulations it views as vulnerable to a disapproval vote. They include \u201cburdensome\u201d school lunch standards, tobacco regulations, laws that set higher wages for contractors and elements of the Paris climate-change agreement. \u201cTalking to some individuals with the Trump transition team, they are taking this extremely serious[ly],\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told the Heritage Foundation last month. Republicans intend to supplement the CRA by enacting a law that would subject any regulation with an economic impact greater than $100\u00a0million to a vote of Congress, a change that would have prevented nearly every climate or employment rule change of the Obama years. The measure, called the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, or Reins, is a conservative priority that passed the Republican House in 2011, 2013 and 2015 with backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Republican aides now hope for a vote on Reins in the coming days so it can be sent for Trump\u2019s signature immediately after he is sworn in on Jan. 20. Some Republican lawmakers also want legislation that would stop courts from deferring to federal agencies\u2019 interpretations of statutes \u2014 a practice known as \u201cChevron deference,\u201d after the 1984 Supreme Court case that went against the energy company \u2014 and have them instead defer to Congress. Little of this was discussed during the presidential campaign, and none has much buy-in from Democrats. Just one rural Democrat in the 115th Congress, Rep. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, voted for Reins. But Democrats do not see the next few months playing out for them the way the first half of 2009 played out for Republicans. \u201cI think there was a unique benefit to Republicans in obstructing the Obama agenda,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who served in the House in Obama\u2019s first term and arrived in the Senate in 2013. \u201cIn 2008, Obama\u2019s entire premise was built on fixing Washington by ending partisanship. It was dependent on getting two parties to work together. Mitch McConnell figured out quickly that he alone held the keys to success or lack of success.\u201d Democrats, said Murphy, would oppose Republicans where they can. But they are not in a position to block everything. \u201cTrump pays lip service to bringing people together, but his theme is that \u2018only he can fix it,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about results, not whether Washington is \u2018working,\u2019 so there\u2019s not the same political benefit to pure obstruction.\u201d Instead, Democrats see opportunities on issues on which Trump clashed with his party or where Republicans themselves worry that the party\u2019s position is unpopular. One of them is the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which sailed through the House in 2015. Last month, when Obama issued an order halting state efforts to defund the group, the legislation\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), said new \u201cpro-life majorities in Congress\u201d would \u201cnot only roll back this latest overreach but also enact new legal protections for these most vulnerable members of our society.\u201d Trump, who became antiabortion late in life, sent mixed messages about Planned Parenthood, praising its non-abortion work in televised debates. That, say Democrats and abortion rights advocates, suggests a wedge can be shoved between the Republican Congress and the president. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t run on, nor was he elected to act on, attacking reproductive health care,\u201d said Ericka Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. There\u2019s less clarity about how to respond on other Republican priorities. Legislation to allow concealed weapons to be carried across state lines, a major goal of the National Rifle Association, was endorsed by Trump and may be hard for red-state Democrats to oppose. A possible Trump-backed stimulus package intrigued even blue-state Democrats when it was floated in November. Interest waned when, in lieu of detailed spending plans, Trump allies suggested the stimulus would consist of tax breaks. In the short term, Democrats are focused more on Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and the looming Supreme Court nomination. In 2009, 59 Democratic senators were occasionally bogged down in getting the 60th vote to confirm lower-level Obama appointees such as Tom Perez as an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and Harold Koh as a legal adviser at State. In 2017, thanks to Democrats\u2019 change of the filibuster, Republicans no longer need to get 60 votes for cloture on nominees; they need a simple majority for any administration position or any judicial opening lower than the Supreme Court. This, Democrats admit, will give Republicans more running room and more floor time to pass bills. Shellshocked after being defeated in an election few people expected they could lose, some concede that Trump\u2019s ability to command media attention will make it harder to turn their losing congressional battles into headlines. They will try. On Jan. 15, Democrats will organize rallies in several states to draw attention to Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to leave Social Security and Medicare untouched \u2014 a difference with Republicans like Ryan. And the party\u2019s concurrent fight over who will head the Democratic National Committee has focused, in large part, on how the party can draw attention to the fast-moving Republican Congress and promote its own work, something Hillary Clinton failed to do in the campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019ll see a greater number of people who are uninsured, more people who are unemployed and more kids getting low test scores,\u201d said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leading candidate for DNC chairman. \u201cBut if we think Trump will create bad conditions and that\u2019ll be enough for Democrats to win, we are absolutely wrong.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu Questioned in Israel Graft Inquiry By ISABEL KERSHNER Continue reading the main story Photo Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday. \u201cThis will all come to nothing, because there is nothing,\u201d he has said repeatedly of recent accusations of impropriety against him. Credit Gali Tibbon/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned \u201cunder caution,\u201d the police said in a statement, implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. \u201cNo further details can be given at this stage,\u201d the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433, a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit, with the authorization of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement, the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses, some abroad, and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes, the statement said, other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Continue reading the main story Mr. Netanyahu, who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges, has vehemently denied any impropriety. \u201cThis will all come to nothing, because there is nothing,\u201d he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases, one more serious than the other, but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one, according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets, concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu, and possibly for members of his family, given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder , a conservative American businessman and philanthropist, and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s, when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres , the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. Lauder\u2019s arrival in Israel, he was asked to meet with the Israeli police \u201cand respond to questions related to an investigation, to which Mr. Lauder is not a party,\u201d Helena Beilin, a Tel Aviv-based lawyer representing Mr. Lauder, said in a statement. \u201cAfter a short meeting the following day, he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office, suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt, issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. \u201cTry to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes, as is accepted in democracies,\u201d it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament, \u201cWe hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition.\u201d \u201cHold off the celebrations; don\u2019t rush,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before and will tell you again \u2014 this will come to nothing, because there is nothing.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately, lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him, talking up Israel\u2019s diplomatic and economic achievements, and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu, generally a popular prime minister, has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration, he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s opponents, the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope, even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. \u201cThis creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics,\u201d said Nahum Barnea, a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand, Mr. Barnea said, there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other, he said, the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu, who has no natural heir in his party, was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament, said it was \u201ca tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are not expressing satisfaction at another\u2019s misfortune.\u201d Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, which has challenged Likud in recent polls, said, \u201cThe presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli, including the prime minister.\u201d He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country, saying, \u201cA person who is being investigated is a person under pressure.\u201d Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation, unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless, the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s standing. His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption, although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February, Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison . He is serving a 19-month term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a \u201cprime minister up to his neck in investigations\u201d and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since the 1990s, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct, and that of people around him, though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture \u2014 the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister\u2019s official residence with an identical, old set in their private home in Caesarea \u2014 to a more recent one involving a billion-dollar deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines . That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines, and other naval equipment purchased by Israel, giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode, too, Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer, David Shimron, have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s relationship with Arnaud Mimran, a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year, and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign, has also prompted suspicions of impropriety.

    "text": "By Mike DeBonis January 1 at 7:29 PM Follow @mikedebonis President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether critical computer networks can ever be protected from intruders, alarming cybersecurity experts who say his comments could upend more than a decade of national cybersecurity policy and put both government and private data at risk. Asked late Saturday about Russian hacking allegations and his cybersecurity plans, Trump told reporters that \u201cno computer is safe\u201d and that, for intelligence officials, \u201chacking is a very hard thing to prove.\u201d \u201cYou want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier,\u201d he said as he entered a New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. [ Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election ] \u201cI think that computers have complicated lives very greatly,\u201d Trump said earlier last week. He tweets prolifically but says he rarely uses any other communications technology more advanced than the telephone. \u201cThe whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I\u2019m not sure you have the kind of security that you need.\u201d (Reuters) Since President George W. Bush moved to develop a comprehensive national cybersecurity policy after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government has made a top priority of preserving the integrity of the public- and private-sector computer networks that enable modern commerce and society. Trump delivered a campaign address in October that deemed cybersecurity \u201ca major priority for both the government and the private sector\u201d and said that cyberattacks from both state and non-state actors \u201cconstitute one of our most critical national security concerns.\u201d But the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s determination that Russia engaged in a state-sponsored hacking effort aimed at electing Trump has prompted the president-elect to openly question the reliability of that assessment while simultaneously taking aim at the broader notion of cybersecurity. [ FBI in agreement with CIA that Russia aimed to help Trump win White House ] Experts said Sunday that Trump\u2019s comments and his handling of the Russian hacking allegations could embolden foreign hackers and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s ability to respond to them. Michael Sulmeyer, a former Defense Department policy adviser who directs the cybersecurity project for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, referred to one of Trump\u2019s earliest efforts \u2014 during a presidential debate in September \u2014 to cast doubt on allegations of Russian interference on his behalf. \u201cThis is not some issue about a 400-pound hacker in a bedroom who might be mischievous,\u201d Sulmeyer said. \u201cThese are real threats to our country, and the concerning part for me is to see how this issue has become politicized and made partisan.\u201d Although some Republicans have pushed for a sharper response to the Russian hacking \u2014 notably Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) \u2014 many others have joined Trump in playing down the intense coverage and debate. \u201cRussia spying on the U.S. is not news,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a top Trump ally. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do. A lot is being made about something that\u2019s already known. To all the people acting shocked, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re shocked there is gambling going on in a casino.\u201d Transition spokesman Sean Spicer, slated to become White House communications director upon Trump\u2019s inauguration, said Sunday that intelligence officials will brief Trump this week on the election-related hacking. He suggested on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the retaliatory sanctions President Obama imposed against Russia last week \u2014 which included the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence agents \u2014 may not have been justified. \u201cThe question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken?\u201d Spicer said. \u201cMaybe it was, maybe it wasn\u2019t, but you have to think about that.\u201d Spicer compared the Obama administration\u2019s sharp response to the recent Russian hacking with its reaction to last year\u2019s revelation that hackers linked to the Chinese government stole the personal data of millions of federal employees. \u201cNot one thing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there is a question about whether there\u2019s a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response.\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, drew a sharp distinction between the two cases and called on Trump \u201cto stop denigrating the intelligence community.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t just steal data; they weaponized it,\u201d he said of Russia, also on the ABC program. \u201cThey dumped it during an election with the specific intent of influencing the outcomes of that election and sowing discord in the United States. That is not something China has ever done.\u201d Ari Schwartz, who served as the top cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council in 2015, said in an interview that Spicer misjudged the Obama administration\u2019s response to the employee data hack. Private talks with the Chinese government, he said, resulted in a demonstrable decline in state-sponsored hacking. \u201cWe came up with ways of dealing with them and working with them,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cIt proves that the sanctions work. Even the threat of the sanctions have changed Chinese behavior.\u201d Trump\u2019s recent comments, Schwartz said, point to a possible recalibration of cybersecurity policy \u2014 one that could shift the careful balance of innovation and security embraced by both Bush and Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to the world of couriers and letter-writing; we\u2019re going to continue to do things online,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are ways to do it where you can manage risk, and that\u2019s really what the goal should be here \u2014 to get to the point where we can have the efficiencies and the benefits and still be secure.\u201d What remains unclear is to what degree Trump\u2019s views on cybersecurity will remain filtered through the prism of the Russian hacking affair. In his October campaign speech, he pledged to undertake a comprehensive review of national cybersecurity systems, create law enforcement task forces to combat cybercriminals and strengthen the military\u2019s Cyber Command. In a sign that he plans to follow through on those plans, last week he chose Thomas P. Bossert, a Bush administration official who played a central role in cybersecurity planning, as his top White House assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. On the Russian hacking, Trump said Saturday that he knows \u201cthings that other people don\u2019t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to his upcoming intelligence briefings. As long as Trump openly doubts the intelligence community\u2019s ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks, he could find it difficult to identify, fend off and retaliate against cyberattackers. He has publicly compared the intelligence community\u2019s Russian hacking assessment to its erroneous determination that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction \u2014 a comparison Spicer repeated Sunday. Said Sulmeyer: \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to make a full-fledged apology or correction about Russian hacking, okay, but at some point, they\u2019re going to have to come out and explain their understanding of the threat and what they want to do about it. If we see that soon, I think that\u2019s a good sign. If that slips, I think that will be an indicator that they are not prioritizing it and they are leaving the American people at greater risk.\u201d Robert Costa and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Hamill wrote about Fisher's onset antics as she would\u00a0bring laughter to a sometimes tense creation of the three-film initial mega-franchse \"The lengths I would go to hear her laugh \u2014 there were no limits. I loved her and loved making her laugh. She would do these crazy things and make me do these crazy things,\" wrote Hamill, who showed a sometimes rocky relationship with Fisher. \"We ran the gamut over the years, where we were in love with each other, where we hated each other\u2019s guts...We went through it all. It\u2019s like we were a family,\" wrote Hamill. \"My life would have been so much drabber and less interesting if she hadn\u2019t been the friend that she was.\" Posted!

But the shooting came just days after a pro-Islamic State group, the Nashir Media Foundation, published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs, markets and movie theaters. The Islamic State\u2019s claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State, but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November, when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey, trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For years, Turkey looked the other way, according to analysts and regional diplomats, as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border, establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. Photo The funeral in Istanbul on Monday of another victim, 23-year-old Yunus Gormek. Credit Bulent Kilic/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images But that policy ultimately changed, as Turkey worked to secure its borders, under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey, prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria, killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey, warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were \u201ccontinuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout Turkey\u201d in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman, described by Turkish officials as a 22-year-old off-duty police officer, assassinated Andrey G. Karlov , the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at an art gallery in the capital, Ankara. The gunman shouted \u201cGod is great!\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t forget Aleppo, don\u2019t forget Syria !\u201d during the attack, which was captured on video. The state-run Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified, The Associated Press reported. According to the Anadolu report, which cited an unidentified Justice Ministry official, 27 of the victims were foreigners, 11 were Turkish and one had dual Turkish and Belgian citizenship. Advertisement Seven victims came from Saudi Arabia; Iraq and Lebanon each had three citizens among the dead; India, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia each had two; and Canada, Israel, Kuwait, Russia and Syria each had one.

Amarillo Fire Department officials say other people who were in the home are \u201cnot out of the woods\u201d yet.\u00a0 Fire officials say a chemical reaction occurred when one person tried to wash off a pesticide that had been sprayed under the house. Poisonous Phosphine gas was released.\u00a0 Capt. Larry Davis said in a statement Monday that crews responded to a medical call at the home about 5 a.m. One child died at the scene and three others died at a hospital. Officials didn\u2019t release any identifying information, including the children\u2019s ages. Other family members and first responders are being treated.\u00a0 Toxic Phosphine gas is produced when aluminum phosphide is mixed with water or moisture, CBS Amarillo affiliate KFDA reports . Aluminum phosphide is a dangerous \u201crestricted-use pesticide,\u201d and it\u2019s used to kill mice, prairie dogs and gophers. A license is needed to buy it. The Amarillo Fire Department said in this case it was clearly purchased from an unlicensed dealer, since the person who used it didn\u2019t know that mixing it with water could be damaging, KFDA reported. Once inhaled or ingested, the respiratory system is attacked and it only takes a few PPM (parts per million) to cause death. \u201cThis is known, this happens across the United States and it\u2019s when people get a hold of stuff they don\u2019t know how to use and they don\u2019t do enough research and figure out that water is bad for it,\u201d said Lieutenant Josh Whitney. \u201cAnd then with the moisture that we have in our air and the moisture that he applied to it, it was just a recipe for a bad situation.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP President Barack Obama waves at the conclusion of his news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington on Dec. 16, 2016. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Since George Washington penned his farewell address in 1796, announcing he would not seek reelection and laying out his hopes and fears for the nascent country, presidential farewell speeches have become an enshrined tradition in the peaceful and democratic transfer of power. President Obama announced Monday that his farewell speech will be Tuesday, Jan. 10 in Chicago. It will be held at McCormack Place, the venue for Obama's 2012 Election Night celebration. In announcing the speech, Obama said he's just starting to write his remarks but he's \"thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.\" Presidential farewell speeches have historically been a chance for presidents to defend their accomplishments and lay out their hopes for the future. In some cases, the speeches have included pointed warnings that reverberate long after the speech has ended. For example, in his farewell address on Jan. 17, 1961, President Dwight Eisenhower warned the country about the growing might of the military, and in doing so, coined the term \"military-industrial complex,\" the relationship between the U.S. armed forces and defense contractors. NPR's Tom Bowman reported on the lasting impact of this speech in 2011, noting that it \"has become a rallying cry for opponents of military expansion.\" Bowman said: Eisenhower was worried about the costs of an arms race with the Soviet Union, and the resources it would take from other areas \u2014 such as building hospitals and schools. Bowman says that in the speech, Eisenhower also spoke as someone who had seen the horror and lingering sadness of war, saying that \"we must learn how to compose differences not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose.\" Another concern, Bowman says, was the possibility that as the military and the arms industry gained power, they would be a threat to democracy, with civilians losing control of the military-industrial complex. Article continues after sponsorship In his farewell address on Jan. 15, 1953, President Harry Truman reflected on and defended his decision to drop the atomic bomb in Japan and mused about the start of the Cold War era. He said : I suppose that history will remember my term in office as the years when the \"cold war\" began to overshadow our lives. I have had hardly a day in office that has not been dominated by this all\u2014embracing struggle\u2014this conflict between those who love freedom and those who would lead the world back into slavery and darkness. And always in the background there has been the atomic bomb. President Ronald Reagan named the deficit as one of his regrets in his address to the nation on Jan. 11, 1989. He called out \"popular culture\" saying : For those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style. Our spirit is back, but we haven't reinstitutionalized it. We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom. ... And freedom is special and rare. It's fragile. It needs production. So we've got to teach history based not on what is in fashion, but what is important. In President Bill Clinton's speech on January 18, 2001, Clinton hailed the economic progress under his administration and called for the U.S. to be a beacon of freedom and peace in the world. He also saluted America's diversity, saying : In our hearts and in our laws, we must treat all our people with fairness and dignity, regardless of their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation and regardless of when they arrived in our country, always moving toward the more perfect union of our founders' dreams. George W. Bush delivered his farewell address on Jan. 15, 2009. Despite his dismal approval ratings and a limping economy, he said , \"You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made, but I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.\" He also called Obama's election \"a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation.\" Obama leaves office with his approval rating at a seven-year high, according to Gallup . Despite Obama's conciliatory post-election speech about president-elect Donald Trump, and his administration's ongoing transition work, Trump tweeted on Dec. 28: \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!\" With the country fiercely divided after the election, Obama is expected to continue to strike a hopeful tone about the incoming Trump administration. And with much of his policy legacy \u2014 including his executive actions on immigration and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 at stake, it's likely Obama will use his address to defend his actions. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Top House Democrats gave more clues Monday about how they\u2019ll fight GOP efforts to repeal ObamaCare, sharing enrollment figures and stories about Americans saved by the health care law, ahead of President Obama\u2019s visit Wednesday. Obama makes the trip to Capitol Hill in his final weeks of office and as the Republican-controlled Congress plans to start repealing ObamaCare the day GOP President-elect Donald Trump takes office. \u201cWhatever the circumstance, health wise you are financially better off\u201d with ObamaCare, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Monday on a conference call with reporters. She was joined on the call by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and other top Democrats on key committees to tout ObamaCare\u2019s successes in reducing Americans\u2019 health costs and increasing their access to better care -- while sending warning shots about the perils of dismantling the 2010 law. Pelosi and Hoyer argued that at least 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance, in part subsidized by the federal government, and chided Republicans for having no immediate plan to replace the law, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUnderstand, repeal and delay is an act of cowardice,\u201d said Pelosi, D-Calif. Said Hoyer: \u201cRepublicans\u2019 repeal and delay plan is code for repeal without an alternative. \u2026 The truth is they have no alternative to replace it. \u2026 Their plan is to turn back the clock, make Americans unhealthy again, perhaps.\u201d In a sign of things to come, the lawmakers talked about Americans who were financially saved by ObamaCare, include a man who developed heart problems upon starting his own business and a woman who needed the insurance while helping put her husband through college. Obama will hold a closed-door meeting with congressional Democrats about his signature plan, created to lower health care costs for all Americans by trying to cut down on emergency care and other uninsured medical expenses. However, insurance premiums continue to increase for many on ObamaCare, in large part the result of fewer-than-expected healthy people enrolling and insurance companies dropping out. Pelosi spoke by phone last week with fellow House Democrats about plans to defend ObamaCare and raised concerns about Republicans\u2019 plans to change entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. She encouraged members to hold events to talk with voters about the kind of statistics and anecdotes discussed Monday. Also on Wednesday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence will rally with House Republicans about their plans to dismantle ObamaCare, a GOP leadership aide told Fox News on Monday. With Trump coming in as president, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to begin the repeal effort this week through a process known as budget reconciliation. Democrats now have little chance of stopping the process with Obama heading out of office. But Republicans, after years of putting repeal legislation on Obama\u2019s desk, must now come up with a better, substitute plan. They acknowledge needing two to perhaps four years to complete the process. Trump and fellow Republicans say they want to keep the good parts of ObamaCare, like allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 plan. But Democrats are already warning about potential chaos in the health care system if the law is repealed and not immediately replaced. Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and Joseph Weber contributed to this report. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Mike Emanuel currently serves as chief congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined FNC in 1997 as a Los Angeles-based correspondent. Advertisement ",

Try on anything you haven\u2019t worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently. Clothes you have forgotten about could be \u201cyour new favorite thing,\u201d she said, while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired. (If you subscribe to the Marie Kondo method of decluttering, ask yourself, \u201cDoes it \u2018spark joy?\u2019\u201d) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Sort clothes by type, grouping pants together, then shirts or blouses, jackets or dresses. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, you won\u2019t wear it,\u201d said Sharon Lowenheim, an organizer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the founder of the Organizing Goddess . \u201cSo remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger.\u201d Arranging shirts by sleeve length, with the shortest at the front, makes them easier to find, said Ms. Lowenheim, who also subscribes to a rotation method: selecting garments to wear from the front of each section, then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned. \u201cIf you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front, that is a signal to you that you just don\u2019t like that item,\u201d she said. \u201cGet rid of it.\u201d Another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store off-season clothes out of sight, said Faith Roberson , an organizer in Manhattan and the founder of Organize With Faith. When clothes have been put away for half the year and you\u2019ve done fine without them, \u201cit changes your perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can honestly ask yourself, \u2018Do I actually love this piece? And if I don\u2019t, why am I holding onto it?\u2019\u201d TACKLE THE TOYS Organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate. \u201cFinding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child,\u201d said Ms. Lowenheim, whose 19-year-old daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday, starting when she was a toddler. Before that, Ms. Lowenheim said, she would sneak into her daughter\u2019s room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with. \u201cWhen she was around 3, she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it,\u201d Ms. Lowenheim said. \u201cAt that point, I realized that I had to involve her in the process.\u201d If they cooperate, be sure to respect their decision, Ms. Roberson said, even if they choose something you wouldn\u2019t have. \u201cParents think about the money they\u2019ve spent,\u201d she said, or the sentimental value, which can make them reluctant to let go of that American Girl doll or the train set from Aunt Joan. Another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with, either online or at a garage sale, and keep the proceeds for themselves. Once the toys have been pared down, Ms. Roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage. \u201cThey are stackable, they have dividers, are easy to clean, easy to label, and they come in four different sizes,\u201d she said. To help maintain order, \u201clabel where each toy goes,\u201d said Ms. Lowenheim, who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints, jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf. If your child is too young to read, label the containers with stickers or pictures. If everything has \u201ca home\u201d to return to at the end of the day, she said, cleanup will be easier. AND THAT JUNK DRAWER ... \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece,\u201d Ms. Roberson said. Dump everything onto the floor or countertop, divide it into piles and then ask yourself: Do I want it? Does it work? Does it need to be in the junk drawer? If not, where else could it go? \u201cTake it easy, and go pile by pile,\u201d she said. Put things where they belong (like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag) and discard things you don\u2019t need, like old keys and expired batteries and coupons. To ward off atrophy, buy a drawer organizer, suggested Ms. Lowenheim, who uses expandable drawer organizers from Staples in her own home. \u201cThe key thing is to measure the drawer, then find the organizer that best fits the space,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s too small, it won\u2019t help.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story The reward? \u201cKeeping everything sorted by type,\u201d she said, \u201cwill make it easier for you to find something when you need it.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on December 25, 2016, on Page RE6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Post-Holiday Clutter Purge.

    "text": "Jan 2 2017, 8:33 am ET Pets on the Fly? Why Are There So Many Animals in the Skies and at Airports? by Harriet Baskas advertisement If it seems there are a lot more animals in airports \u2014 and on airplanes \u2014 these days, you're not imagining it. More than 30 airports around the country now have regular programs that bring certified pet therapy dogs and their handlers into the terminals to mingle with passengers and help ease the stress of traveling. At both Mineta San Jose International Airport (the first airport to have an official pet therapy program) and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, they're called the K9 crew . At Los Angeles International Airport the PUP (Pets Unstressing Passengers) team roams the concourses. And at Denver International Airport it's the Canine Airport Therapy Squad (CATS) that welcomes passengers to hug, hang out and get their pictures taken with dogs wearing \"Pet Me\" vests. During 2016, some airport pet therapy teams broadened their membership beyond dogs. Last summer, when passengers were encountering excessively long lines at security checkpoints at many airports around the country, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport began welcoming miniature therapy horses and their handlers to visit several times a month. And as the winter holiday travel season went into high gear, two airports announced that pigs were joining their pet therapy teams. LiLou, a Juliana-breed pig, joined San Francisco International Airport's Wag Brigade to add \"more moments of surprise and delight for guests at our airport,\" said Christopher Birch, SFO's Director-Guest Experience, on LiLou's first day on the job. Lilou, the pig will be at #sfo on 12/26/16 at 12 pm in T3. Please be patient, give her space, and always ask her mom before touching LiLou. pic.twitter.com/nekpaxYxXh And a pot-bellied pig named Bacon Bits is now part of Albany International Airport's Canine Ambassador program. More animals in the air Of course, not all the animals you see in airport terminals these days are just there to be petted. According to the American Pet Products Association , there are around 77 million pet dogs and 85 million pet cats in the United States \u2014 and a growing number of their owners take them along when they travel by air. And when they fly as carry-on passengers in the cabin, those pets need to have tickets. On Alaska Airlines and JetBlue, the domestic fee for a pet in the cabin is $100 each way. On American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, its $125 each way. Frontier Airlines charges $75 each way, and on Southwest the fee is $95 each way. In some cases, more than one small pet can travel in a pet carrier (and avoid an extra fee), but some airlines will tack on an extra fee if there's a stopover of more than four hours. Snakes on a plane? The costs to take a pet on a plane can add up, which may be part of the reason an increasing number of passengers are claiming that their animals aren't just pets but official service or \"emotional support\" animals which, by law, get to fly for free. Like Frontier Airlines, which had an issue earlier this year with a passenger's emotional support marmoset, each airline website lists very specific conditions under which they will accept service animals or therapeutic/emotional support animals on their plane. An official identification card and/or a written statement from a mental health professional is usually required, but many websites make it easy for pet owners to acquire 'fake' documentation \u2014 for a fee. \"It doesn't matter if it's a duck or a mini horse, as long as a passenger has the correct paperwork, they're allowed to fly with an emotional support animal and nobody can say anything about it,\" said veteran flight attendant Heather Poole, author of Cruising Attitude. Poole says it's not a flight attendant's job to determine which passengers are flying with true support animals or which ones have simply secured paperwork to avoid paying a fee for their pet to fly, but \"I can spot a fake emotional support animal a mile away,\" said Poole. \"It's usually growling or barking at other support animals. That, or it's dressed nicer than its owner.\" 2017 may bring changes \u2014 or at least some clarification \u2014 in how airlines and passengers define service or emotional support animals. While noting that its ACCESS Advisory Committee was unable to reach agreement on updated rules regarding service animals, the U.S. Department of Transportation recently said it intends to draft its own rules. \"The guide dog and animal training groups all agree this is a problem, so does the community,\" said Eric Lipp of the Open Doors Organization . \"One solution floated is to have a national registry and certification for service animals so they are given ID. The DOT could also fine a passenger and make big news. That would help, but who wants to do that?\" Harriet Baskas ",

    "text": "'Bathroom Bill' Fight Brewing In Texas 'Bathroom Bill' Fight Brewing In Texas Embed Embed The dome of the Texas State Capital. Eric Gay/AP hide caption toggle caption The dome of the Texas State Capital. Eric Gay/AP Texas could soon follow in the footsteps of Indiana and North Carolina and pass its own \"bathroom bill\" in the upcoming legislative session. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has made passage of such a bill, which could require transgender Texans to use the restroom which corresponds to the gender on their birth certificate, a priority. The proposal threatens to split the Texas Republican Party, which controls all three branches of government in Austin. Proponents include the lieutenant governor and the Senate he leads, while the Texas House of Representatives is more sympathetic to the state's business community. The politically powerful chamber of commerce and the Texas Association of Business both strongly oppose any bathroom bill. North Carolina's bathroom bill nullified legislation passed by the city of Charlotte that expanded protections to LGBT North Carolinians. The state's bathroom bill also prohibited transgender people from using public restrooms that align with their gender identity. It provoked a widespread backlash from businesses, entertainers, sports organizations and the movie industry. The NBA pulled its All-Star Game out of North Carolina, the NCAA moved March Madness regional games out of the state, and PayPal and Deutsche Bank suspended planned expansions there. Forbes estimated that North Carolina lost more than $600 million in the six months after Gov. Pat McCrory signed the legislation into a law. McCrory was subsequently defeated in his bid for re-election in November by Democrat Roy Cooper, who made the bathroom bill a cornerstone of his campaign. Article continues after sponsorship None of these economic and political ramifications have deterred the Texas lieutenant governor. In fact, when the North Carolina legislature failed an attempt to reverse itself and pass legislation that would have nullified its bathroom bill just before Christmas, Patrick sent a note applauding the collapse of the effort. \"Legislation to protect women's privacy and business is essential to assure that sexual predators ... will not be able to freely enter women's restrooms, locker rooms or showers ... \" Patrick's note said. However, many of the Texas GOP's most lucrative donors have indicated they're going to the mat to stop bathroom legislation from passing in Texas. The Texas Association of Business held a press conference last month to announce results of a study, commissioned by the TAB and conducted by researchers at St. Edwards University in Austin, which estimated a Lone Star bathroom bill could cost the state upwards of $8 billion in economic impact and 100,000 jobs. \"The message from the Texas business community is loud and clear,\" Chris Wallace, president of the TAB, said in front of the Texas Capitol. \"Protecting Texas from billions of dollars in losses is simple: Don't pass unnecessary laws that discriminate against Texans and our visitors.\" While Texas's lieutenant governor is hot for a bathroom bill, his counterpart in the Texas House, Speaker Joe Strauss, is not \"This isn't the most urgent concern of mine,\" Strauss said. Strauss is expected to be the business community's political backstop, and he's got the clout in the House to ensure that any bathroom legislation languishes and dies in committee. Not only would that please many influential donors, it would spare Republican House members from having to make a politically tricky vote. And where is Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on the subject? He's currently sitting atop the fence. Abbott says a wait-and-see approach is prudent until an actual bill is produced and the details \u2014 and political and economic ramifications \u2014 can be carefully scrutinized. ",

    "text": "Season over for Bears: Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery & more on frustrating year Kevin White: 'Didn't think I would be out this year' Bears wide receiver Kevin White speaks on Jan. 2, 2017. (Rich Campbell/Chicago Tribune) Bears wide receiver Kevin White speaks on Jan. 2, 2017. (Rich Campbell/Chicago Tribune) Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A day after finishing a 3-13 season with a 28-point road loss to the Vikings , the Bears held their final team meetings at Halas Hall on Monday. Players then cleaned out their lockers and headed into the offseason, vowing to turn the page and vocalizing their hopes for a more successful 2017. Here are the biggest highlights from Monday\u2019s player interviews. Photos of the Chicago Bears' first-round draft pick in 2013. On his recovery from surgery to repair a broken right ankle I'm good. I have a good support system. First time really being out like this. Initially I was like, \u2018Ooh, I kind of like the break.' I don't have to hit anything. And then it\u2019s a week into it, and you\u2019re going stir crazy and you realize how important the team is to your health, mentally and emotionally. We have a great group of guys, regardless of record. The men in this room are guys that I love and that I really do enjoy playing with. And I\u2019m hoping this will be the same group of guys that can get it turned around. On a second layer to his recovery because of his upcoming shoulder surgery This is my first time with surgery, really or anything like anesthesia, so that sucked. I did not like that. Lost a bunch of weight (down to 280 pounds). Now I know this shoulder (surgery) will be a lot less invasive, and also it won\u2019t be something that I\u2019m walking on or trying to walk on. So being able to walk here in the next few weeks will be nice, and then to training and just trying to build the tank. On if the team can do anything to prevent such a rash of injuries in the future I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year. I\u2019m going to look like the Christmas Story kid. It\u2019ll be summer months, I\u2019ll be in like three North Face (jackets). But, yeah, honestly, it\u2019s football. It\u2019s a tortured existence from a physical standpoint. You\u2019re never going to be healthy. Nobody\u2019s healthy. Nobody\u2019s 100 percent. You show up to camp 100 percent \u2014 you do the conditioning test, you\u2019re at 98 percent, and then you try to hover in the 80s to 90s the whole year. So when you get guys who are getting dinged, guys who are on scooters, casts, surgical procedures, it takes a toll. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not able to be around as much as I\u2019d like to. A lot of those guys aren\u2019t able to be around as much as they\u2019d like to. But there\u2019s a plan in place to get healthy. And hopefully we\u2019ll get the better luck of the die next year. On what is his greatest source of optimism about the Bears' future I don\u2019t necessarily know if I would say it\u2019s the greatest source of optimism, but I just know what this city is like when the Bears win. And I had a taste of it my rookie year, and I sniffed the playoffs and we lost by a close margin there. I want to get back to that. I want to go to the playoffs. I want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. A frickin\u2019 playoff game in Chicago \u2014 can you imagine that? Right now I know it\u2019s not something that\u2019s realistic, being 3-13 and we\u2019re in the offseason. But these are things than when I lay my head on the pillow at night I think about and it keeps me up pretty late. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to get me through this process, because I know I\u2019ll be able to run out that tunnel again. Receiver Kevin White Photos of the Bears wide receiver Kevin White, the No. 7 overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft. On missing most of his second season with a broken left leg after missing his entire rookie season with a stress fracture in the leg It\u2019s frustrating. Didn\u2019t think I would be out this year, obviously. Did everything I could in the offseason. Stayed here, trained, worked my butt off, did everything I thought I could. It\u2019s just unfortunate, but it\u2019s the name of the game. Just got to fight back and stay patient and mentally stay tough. On whether he\u2019s been given assurance that his left leg won\u2019t be a chronic problem for him to deal with Oh yeah. I\u2019ll be just fine. Just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back. After that, I\u2019ll be just fine. Receiver Alshon Jeffery Photos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery. On whether he stood behind his assertion Sunday that the Bears would win the Super Bowl next season Damn right. On whether the Bears have enough talent and depth to join mentioned alongside the Patriots We\u2019re the Chicago Bears. We\u2019re just like them. The only difference is just a few plays here and there. We went to New England and practiced (in August). They know. If you were there and watched the practices, they know. Unfortunately, in New England they\u2019re doing a great job. I give them all the credit. Coach Belichick\u2019s is doing a great job and Tom Brady is a hell of a quarterback.

The pair had been lighting illegal fireworks at the gathering when the explosion happened, police said. Emergency personnel arrived just after midnight Sunday at the Campbell Industrial Park in Kapolei to find the two victims injured. The 38-year-old woman was taken to a hospital in critical condition and died from her injuries. The 36-year-old man remains in critical condition. Police have opened an unattended death and prohibited explosive device investigation, but no one has been arrested or cited. Honolulu Police Department spokeswoman Sarah Yoro said Monday no further information was being released at this time. Honolulu's Emergency Medical Services said the woman's death was among dozens of other fireworks-related incidents over the weekend. The agency responded to 28 calls within the first hour of 2017. Many people in Hawaii celebrate the new year by setting off fireworks. Firecrackers may be bought and used with a permit on Oahu, but many other types of fireworks that people set off are illegal. The Honolulu Fire Department also had a busy weekend, Fire Capt. Kevin Mokulehua said. \"The Honolulu Fire Department responded to 19 fireworks-related incidents which doubled last year's incident totals,\" Mokulehua said. \"Most of the incidents were wildland fires, some structure fires and other miscellaneous fires.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "WATCH Pope Francis Addresses United Nations 0 Shares Email Pope Francis has exhorted Catholic bishops worldwide to do what's needed to ensure children are protected from sexual abuse by clergy. The Vatican on Monday released the text of a Dec. 28 letter Francis sent to bishops about injustices to children. They included slave labor, malnutrition, lack of education and sexual exploitation, including abuse by priests. In the letter, Francis decried \"the sufferings, the experiences and pain of minors who were abused sexually by priests.\" \"It is a sin that shames us,\" the pope wrote. \"Persons responsible for the protection of those children destroyed their dignity.\" The church's reputation has been stained in several countries during the last few decades as people have come forward to report that parish priests or other Catholic clergy raped or molested them as minors. The allegations showed that local bishops sometimes knew about and covered up child sex abuse involving problem priests and triggered multi-million-dollar lawsuits, as well as several criminal prosecutions. Expressing the church's regret, and begging forgiveness, the pope denounced the \"sin of what happened, the sin of failing to help, the sin of covering up and denial, the sin of the abuse of power.\" Francis also asked bishops for \"complete commitment to ensuring that these atrocities will no longer take place in our midst.\" \"Let us find the courage needed to take all necessary measures and to protect in every way the lives of our children, so that such crimes may never be repeated,\" the pope said. \"In this area, let us adhere, clearly and faithfully, to 'zero tolerance.'\" The pontiff himself has received mixed reviews on how the Vatican handles sex abuse. Francis has laid out procedures to oust bishops for negligence, if they mishandle investigations into alleged abuse. But he dismayed advocates for abuse survivors by appointing a Chilean bishop accused of covering up for a notorious pedophile. The Vatican also took no immediate action after deaf students from Italy , in a 2014 letter to the pope, said a priest sexually abused them for years in Italy and now was working at a school in Francis' native Argentina . The priest was arrested last year and charged with raping deaf students at a school in Argentina. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "advertisement RENO, Nev. \u2014 Madeleine Pickens wanted the African-American chef she recruited from the country club she owns in Southern California to cook \"black people food\" \u2014 not \"white people food\" \u2014 at her rural Nevada dude ranch and wild horse sanctuary, according to a federal lawsuit accusing her of racial discrimination. Armand Appling says the wealthy philanthropist and ex-wife of Oklahoma energy tycoon T. Boone Pickens told him fried chicken, BBQ ribs and corn bread would be perfect for the tourists who pay nearly $2,000 a night to stay in plush cottages, ride horses and take Wild West \"safaris\" on ATVs at her Mustang Monument Wild Horse Eco-Resort. Appling alleges he was fired 2014 in retaliation for complaining about a hostile work environment. He says Pickens' stereotypical references were commonplace at the Elko County ranch stretching across 900 square miles on the edge of the Ruby Mountains about 50 miles west of the Utah line. Related: T. Boone Pickens Discusses Proposed Solution to Nation's Energy Woes Among other things, he says Pickens, who is white, instructed him to terminate two other black kitchen staffers \u2014 one she referred to as her \"bull\" or \"ox\" and another who had \"too much personality.\" He says she told him they didn't \"look like people we have working at the country club\" and didn't \"fit the image\" of the staff she wanted at the ranch. Pickens' lawyers argue that even if all the allegations are true, none of her comments were racially motivated. At worst, Pickens' remarks \"reflect a non-racial personality conflict and amount to discourtesy, rudeness or lack of sensitivity,\" they wrote in recent court filings. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du said during a hearing in Reno last week that Appling's lawyers have failed so far to prove the sort of racial hostility needed to win such a civil rights claim. She dismissed the original lawsuit that was filed in February but gave them until Jan. 13 to refile an amended complaint seeking unspecified damages from Pickens' nonprofit, Save America's Mustangs. \"It takes a lot to prove these allegations,\" Du told California attorney Willie Williams on Thursday. Related: Trump Ally Carl Paladino Slammed for 'Racist' Wish List for Obamas Du agreed with Pickens' lawyer, Dora Lane of Reno, that the only comment that specifically referred to race was the reference to \"black people food.\" Lane said categorizing foods by ethnicity is commonplace in the restaurant industry. Some restaurants serve Mexican food, others Chinese or Thai food, she said. \"The suggestion that such categorizations are inherently offensive is nonsense,\" Lane argued in earlier court documents. \"This is especially true here, given that Pickens' alleged comments actually reflect a preference for 'black people food' rather than a racial animas against 'black people' or 'black people food.'\" Williams said Pickens' comments about the fired employees \"not fitting in\" reinforces a long history of African-Americans not being allowed into elite, private-club settings. Pickens owns the exclusive Del Mar Country Club north of San Diego where Appling worked before she hired him for a 5-month stint in Nevada. Related: Civil Rights Groups Criticize Fox News for 'Racist and Offensive' Chinatown Segment \"In many cases, the people fighting to keep African-Americans out of these private clubs would use code phrases like 'they do not fit the image,'\" Williams said in court documents. He added the use of the words \"ox\" and \"bull\" implies ownership of property, given \"America's long history of slavery where they were considered personal property of their owners.\" Lane argued it was a complimentary reference to physical strength and \"was not accompanied by any overtly racial slurs.\" \"Indeed, Appling does not allege that he ever heard any overtly racial epithets, such as the 'N-word,'\" she wrote in court documents. But Williams told the judge last week the comments must be viewed in the context of racial stereotypes. Du agreed that Lane's arguments focus on the \"plain meaning of words\" while seemingly ignoring the context of comments made about \"African-Americans in history and stereotypes that could give rise to racial animas.\" \"If the alleged comments were not directed at him, but others who look like him, it may affect his work environment,\" the judge said.

Zach Gibson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump meets with House Speaker Paul Ryan at the U.S. Capitol for a meeting in November just after Election Day. Zach Gibson/Getty Images As the 115th Congress is sworn in Tuesday, Republicans will be poised to control Washington with a stronger hand than they have in a decade \u2014 with the Senate, House and the White House in GOP hands, once President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. This past November, Republicans held their congressional losses to a minimum, helped by an unexpectedly strong GOP wave behind Trump. After losing just two Senate seats, they'll hold a 52-48 edge (two independents caucus with Democrats. In the House, Republicans lost six seats, giving them a 241-194 majority. 'Dawn Of A New Unified Republican Government' Coming In 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted shortly after Election Day that the \"new unified Republican government\" would be \"focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people.\" And as NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis explained, there is precedent for a unified government pushing through sweeping changes early on: When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping \u2014 albeit politically polarizing \u2014 legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. In particular, the first two-year congressional session of a new administration \u2014 when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president \u2014 has produced some recent presidents' most memorable legislative imprints. GOP congressional leaders and Trump agree on many things \u2014 tantamount among them their best chance ever to repeal and replace Obamacare, in addition to rolling back federal regulations and increasing infrastructure projects. But there are some looming showdowns between the incoming president and members of his own party on Capitol Hill \u2014 many of whom were less than supportive of Trump in the primaries and lukewarm on his prospects in the general election. Article continues after sponsorship Top Republicans have already signaled their break with Trump over alleged Russian cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U.S. elections. After President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against the country last week, Ryan called the response \"overdue\" but \"appropriate.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the sanctions were a \"a good initial step\" and reiterated his support for a congressional investigation into the supposed interference. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is planning a hearing for Thursday into the breach, with three top intelligence officials set to testify. Trump, however, has said the country should \"move on\" from the cyberattacks. During the campaign he repeatedly praised Russia and its president Vladimir Putin during the campaign, casting doubt that they were behind the intrusion. He even praised Putin as \"very smart!\" after his muted response to sanctions from the Obama administration. Trump has, however, acquiesced to meeting with U.S. intelligence regarding the cyber breaches this week. Deal Or Disrupt? Congressional Democrats Weigh 2017 Choices Congress is prepared to get a jumpstart on confirming Trump's cabinet nominees as well, with hearings on some top appointees beginning next week. But many of his most important picks are controversial, particularly Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. The Exxon Mobil CEO's ties to Russia and Putin have already raised concern, and he's sure to be pressed about the new sanctions as well. Is Sessions, Trump's Attorney General Pick, Trying to Paper Over His Record? Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions's nomination for attorney general could be contentious too. While sitting members typically receive deference from their peers, Democrats will draw attention to Sessions's past failure to get confirmation as a federal judge after he had allegedly made racist remarks in the past. Another looming fight will be when Trump makes his pick for the Supreme Court to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland languished last year as Republicans refused to take up his nomination. The process of repealing the Affordable Care Act is expected to get started this week as the Senate is expected to take up a budget measure to begin the process of dismantling President Obama's signature domestic achievement. But it won't come quickly. Without a replacement plan on the table, some Republicans are weary of moving too quickly to dismantle the healthcare law for fear it would roil insurance markets if no fix is ready to be implemented. Soon after the member of the 115th Congress are sworn in on Tuesday, their next task will be to officially re-elect Ryan as speaker. And while there's little drama expected for him to secure the votes he needs after being unanimously renominated by the GOP conference in November, there could still be defections once the voice vote is held on the House floor, particularly from hardline Trump supporters. Two years ago, then-beleaguered Speaker John Boehner had 25 member of his own party vote against him . When Boehner stepped down in October 2015, only nine other Republicans voted for someone other than Ryan. Ryan distanced himself from Trump just before Election Day after damaging audio emerged of Trump bragging about groping women. The two have since reconciled, but there have been signs of discord among the base. At a rally last month in Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, the speaker was booed. And while Trump quieted the dissenters, he did caution that if Ryan ever opposed him their relationship might not be so rosy any longer. \"Honestly, he's like a fine wine: Every day goes by, I get to appreciate his genius more and more,\" Trump told the Wisconsin crowd on Dec. 13. \"Now, if he ever goes against me, I'm not going to say that, OK?\" It may have been a joke, but speaks to the strain in the most powerful relationship in Washington.

Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. Roof\u2019s offer, through Mr. Bruck, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. Roof\u2019s conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager, the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds, like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby, a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. \u201cThat could very well be the end of the death penalty in America, because if there was ever justification for killing anybody, this is the case,\u201d Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victims\u2019 families about Mr. Roof\u2019s fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty, it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law, those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely emotional, powerful testimony,\u201d said John H. Blume, a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School, \u201cand that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when it\u2019s not the case.\u201d If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death, it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law , according to experts on capital cases. That statute, which was broadened in 2009, does not carry a potential death sentence, but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury, given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected; the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors; and Mr. Roof\u2019s competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are \u201ccompetent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\u201d Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof, a ninth-grade dropout, \u201chas no right to represent himself in a capital trial, and even less so at the penalty phase.\u201d But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of self-representation for criminal defendants, in Faretta v. California , the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials, despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. Roof\u2019s defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. \u201cWhether or not they\u2019re legally insane, there\u2019s certainly something mentally wrong with them,\u201d said Peter D. Greenspun, a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant, John A. Muhammad, for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added, \u201cTo have a person like that make this kind of decision, it really calls into question, from a philosophical point of view, whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties.\u201d Mr. Muhammad, who ultimately reinstated Mr. Greenspun, was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later. \u201cIt\u2019s something that Roof will likely regret,\u201d Mr. Greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself. \u201cAt some point down the road, he\u2019s going to say, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 And there\u2019s no going back.\u201d Follow Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder on Twitter.

Karim Kadim/AP hide caption toggle caption Karim Kadim/AP Bystanders inspect the scene after a car bomb explosion at a crowded outdoor market in the Iraqi capital's eastern district of Sadr City on Monday. Karim Kadim/AP Dozens are dead in Baghdad after bombs were detonated across the city on Monday. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the bombings. The death toll from the attacks is still climbing. NPR's Alice Fordham reported on the bombings, telling our Newscast Unit: The first attack came in Sadr City on the edge of Baghdad, still reeling from a bombing on Saturday. The bomber pretended to be recruiting casual laborers for the day, so those killed were mainly poor manual workers. The next ones came at roughly the same time near two hospitals in the city, followed by three bombs in the poor Shaab area of the city. The BBC reported that at least 35 people were killed and at least 61 injured by the blast in Sadr City, which is a \"predominantly Shia Muslim\" neighborhood. The BBC wrote: \"The Sunni jihadist group Islamic State said it had carried out the attack, which 'targeted a gathering of Shia.' \" Reuters reported that \"nine of the victims were women in a passing minibus.\" The news service wrote: \"Their charred bodies were visible inside the burnt-out remains of the vehicle. Blood stained the ground nearby.\" Article continues after sponsorship The attacks followed other bombings in the city on Saturday, which killed 28 people, according to the BBC. Reuters wrote also wrote that \"an attack near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday left seven policemen dead.\" Monday's attacks coincide with an Iraq visit by French President Francois Hollande. Hollande gave a press conference with Iraqi prime minister Haider al Abadi, vowing to defeat ISIS. \"The terrorists will attempt to attack civilians in order to make up for their losses, but we assure the Iraqi people and the world that we are able to end terrorism and shorten its life,\" Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said, according to the BBC. The ISIS bombings come as Iraqi security forces continue their offensive to push the self-proclaimed caliphate from the country. The U.S.-supported offensive was launched in mid-October , as the Two-Way reported, and has recaptured part of the city of Mosul, the terrorist group's last major stronghold in Iraq. According to Reuters, \"Abadi has said the group will be driven out of the country by April.\" ",

The two real estate titans have already collaborated on the Trump International Golf Club, where luxury villas have racked up almost $2 billion in sales. Amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest, Trump has promised he won't be making any new business deals while in office. But Sajwani said his ties to the Trumps extend beyond the president-elect \u2014 to daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr. \"All his three children are very much involved, and I think under their leadership we will have no issue in expanding and growing and maintaining our business relation,\" Sajwani said. \"They are very much involved with the details,\" Sajwani said. \"They're very protective of their brand.\" Donald and Ivanka Trump with Dubai developer Hussein Sajwani.

Ivanka has posted on social media about business meetings in at least 13 countries since 2010. Sajwani recalled that Ivanka was pregnant when she was working on the project and \"quite involved until almost a few days before delivery.\" He happened to be in New York three days after she gave birth, and he marveled that Ivanka got on the phone to talk business with him and was back in the office a couple of days after that. He said he met then-candidate Trump before the election for the opening of his Washington hotel. Over dinner, he said, it became clear that if Trump won, he would need to hand over the reins of the business to the younger generation. Sajwani was back in the United States after the election and met with Ivanka, who is now exploring a possible move to Washington to be closer to the White House. Play ",

    "text": "Hall of Fame Voters Soften Stance on Stars of Steroids Era By DAVID WALDSTEIN Continue reading the main story Photo Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner during the steroids era, was voted into the Hall of Fame last month by the Today\u2019s Game Era Committee. Credit Jonathan Fickies/Getty Images Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens , two of the most successful players in baseball history, are among the former stars who were essentially blacklisted from the Hall of Fame because of their reputations as doping cheats. But now, because of a sudden and surprising shift of voter sentiment, players who thrived during baseball\u2019s so-called steroids era might be enshrined in Cooperstown after all. The baseball writers who vote to decide which players are allowed into the Hall of Fame appear to be backing away from their punitive approach to players linked to doping because of what they perceive as hypocrisy. Bud Selig , who served as commissioner of baseball as the record books were being obliterated by bulked-up players, was recently granted entry into the Hall of Fame by a separate voting body. Selig has been widely criticized for failing to combat the doping scourge soon enough. The former manager Tony La Russa, who was inducted in 2014, benefited from steroids users on some of his successful teams. No Hall of Fame for American sports carries as much prestige as baseball\u2019s, and no team sport in the country has been as vexed by doping. Baseball officials refused to confront the problem for years, then became more aggressive than other pro leagues in policing the use of illicit drugs. In what would be a dramatic change for the sport and its fans, the penalty phase \u2014 for former players, at least \u2014 may be over. \u201cIt just kind of struck a nerve with me,\u201d said Kevin Cooney, a voter from The Courier Times in Bucks County, Pa. Photo Roger Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards as a pitcher but has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Credit Barton Silverman/The New York Times \u201cTo me, it would be hypocritical to put the commissioner of the steroid era and a manager who had connections with the steroid era in and leave out the greatest pitcher and the greatest hitter of that time,\u201d Cooney said. After Selig was voted into the Hall, Susan Slusser posted a pointed message on social media. In it, Slusser, a former president of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, said that Selig\u2019s election had now compelled her to reconsider how she would vote on this year\u2019s ballot for the Hall. Advertisement Continue reading the main story She argued that if Selig was being inducted, it was \u201csenseless\u2019\u2019 to keep out players who were accused of using drugs. As a longtime beat writer for The San Francisco Chronicle, Slusser is well respected by her fellow writers. Her statement got their attention, and while she may not have directly influenced any of them to alter his or her thinking on how to vote, she at least changed the conversation. \u201cThere is nothing good about the whole era,\u201d Slusser said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd I just decided that if you honor the central figures of the era \u2014 the execs and managers and players and media people are all going in \u2014 then it\u2019s putting the entire wrongs of that era on two guys.\u201d Photo Baseball\u2019s home run king, Barry Bonds, like Clemens, is among the former stars who were essentially blacklisted from the Hall of Fame because of their reputations as doping cheats. Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press Other voters share Slusser and Cooney\u2019s thinking, according to Ryan Thibodaux\u2019s BBHOF ballot tracker , which lists Hall of Fame ballots that have been made public. Of the more than 150 voters who have taken the public route \u2014 representing a little over a third of the electorate \u2014 21 voted for Bonds for the first time after previously declining to do so and 22 did the same for Clemens. That growing support has left Bonds, baseball\u2019s career leader in home runs, and Clemens, a pitcher who won more Cy Young Awards \u2014 seven \u2014 than anyone else, closing in on the 75 percent threshold needed for induction. Each has now has been named on 110 of the 156 ballots on Thibodaux\u2019s site, or 70.5 percent. Based on previous voting patterns, the percentages for Bonds and Clemens are expected to come down a bit \u2014 perhaps to about 65 percent \u2014 when the final vote totals are announced later this month. Still, a pathway to induction has come into focus for the two men midway through their 10 years of ballot eligibility. In comparison, Clemens received 45.2 percent of the vote last year and Bonds 44.3. Even those vote totals, while modest, pushed them over the 40 percent mark for the first time and reflected a changing voter constituency that is now younger and seemingly less inclined to take a hard line against suspected steroid cheats. Photo The former manager Tony La Russa, second from left, benefited from having steroids users on some of his teams. La Russa was pictured with the Hall of Fame president, Jeff Idelson, left; its chairwoman, Jane Forbes Clark; and Selig at his induction ceremony in 2014. Credit Mike Groll/Associated Press And now that trend is amplified by other developments, including a reassessment of the whole issue brought on by the Selig vote in particular. Advertisement Continue reading the main story To date, no former player with a positive test for a performance-enhancing drug or who was otherwise directly linked to such substances has won election into the Hall. And if Bonds and Clemens do ultimately gain entry, it could finally shatter the steroid wall and allow other players under a cloud of suspicion to gain entry to Cooperstown. Bernie Wilson, a voter in San Diego who covers baseball for The Associated Press, said that even before Slusser spoke out, he had planned to vote for Bonds and Clemens this time after five or six years of leaving them off. He said he wanted to allow time for the issue to simmer. He reasoned that if Bonds and Clemens had to wait a couple of years to get in based just on his vote, then they would survive the delay. \u201cAs a practicing Catholic, and I know I\u2019m going to get ridiculed for this, but there is the concept of purgatory,\u201d he said. He added that he always felt Bonds and Clemens would eventually get in and that the Selig induction had \u201cforced the issue.\u201d Steve Buckley of The Boston Herald called the entire process flawed. His decision not to vote for Bonds and Clemens in the past was flawed, he said, and his decision to vote for them now is hardly airtight, either.

Trump has made eight of 17 Cabinet picks, with four remaining. The primary targets include Rex Tillerson for secretary of state; Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general; South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney for the Office of Management and Budget; Betsy DeVos as the new education secretary and Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive nominated to be treasury secretary. \u201cPresident-elect Trump is attempting to fill his rigged Cabinet with nominees that \u2026 have made billions off the industries they\u2019d been tasked with regulating,\u201d incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. \u201cIf Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d Republicans who control the Senate and House plan to begin the confirmation hearings on Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. Republicans have a 52-to-48 majority over Democrats in the Senate. The nominees will get enough votes in the GOP-run Senate committees but would run into delays when both parties cast final votes on the chamber floor, despite needing only 51 \u201cyeahs.\u201d Democrats could use procedural moves to extend the debate on each of the nominees. But they don\u2019t have the power to use the filibuster to block the nominations, because in the last Congress they changed the threshold on such filibusters from 60 to 51 votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and fellow Republicans don\u2019t like the Democrats\u2019 plan and argue they didn\u2019t oppose outgoing Democratic President Obama\u2019s nominations when he took office in 2008. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats worked together and expeditiously to carefully consider his nominees,\u201d McConnell spokesman David Popp told Fox News on Monday. Popp points out that the Senate held hearings on multiple nominees before Obama was even sworn in, confirmed seven of them on Day One and that nearly all of them were confirmed within two weeks.\u00a0 \u201cSen. Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time,\u201d Popp continued. \u201cSo surely they won\u2019t object to treating the incoming president\u2019s nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness.\u201d The others on the purported list of eight are Georgia GOP Rep. Tom Price, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services; Andrew Puzder for labor secretary; and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to run the EPA. Those not on the purported list are Marine Gen. James N. Mattis for defense secretary; South Carolina GOP Gov. Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and former Marine Gen. John Kelly run the Department of Homeland Security. Fox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel contributed to this report. \u00a0 ",

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/Staff Photographer) ORCHARD PARK - Buffalo Bills general manager Doug Whaley said the team's 7-9 record this season was \"not good enough\" and that \"it starts with me\"\u00a0in a Monday news conference. Whaley, who was alone at the podium, said he was representing owners Kim and Terry Pegula, team president Russ Brandon and the football department. \"You are what your record says you are and we are 7-9,\" Whaley said. \"We have to get better in every aspect.\" If this is truly an open coach search, then it\u2019s my opinion that Lynn shouldn\u2019t get job. There are other more qualified candidates \u2014 Sal Maiorana (@salmaiorana) January 2, 2017 Whaley said the team's search for a head coach will be different than the previous two that he has been involved with, as he will lead the search. Whaley was an assistant general manager when Doug Marrone was hired in 2013 and the team used a committee approach when Rex Ryan was hired in 2015. \"I have full confidence in myself and the process that we have in place,\" Whaley said. Despite reports that interim coach Anthony Lynn has the inside track to secure the job permanently, Whaley insisted \"it will be an open search\" for the Bills' next head coach. Whaley confirmed that the Bills have reached out and requested an interview with Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Harold Goodwin . Whaley said there is not a timetable for hiring the head coach. \"You don't want to rush to make a decision like this, you want to make the right decision,\" Whaley said. He also said that Ryan spoke to team owner Terry Pegula on the phone privately last Tuesday before the team made the decision to part ways with Ryan. I can\u2019t count high enough to determine how many questions Whaley failed to answer coherently. Dumpster fire? It\u2019s a 3-alarm warehouse blaze \u2014 Sal Maiorana (@salmaiorana) January 2, 2017 \"I wasn't privy to the conversation (between Pegula and Ryan), so I cannot get into the details,\" Whaley said. Whaley later said that he had no input into the decision to fire Ryan. Whaley also said that he did not speak after Ryan's firing last week because the team has a policy during the season to have a \"singular voice\" during the regular season and that voice is the head coach. He said that he and Lynn have spoken about the team's decision to bench Taylor for the season finale and that \"Anthony and I have talked, and we are fine.\" He also said he understands why Taylor was unhappy with the team's decision to rest him on Sunday. \"I would be upset if he wasn't upset,\" Whaley said. Whaley also said that he has often leaned on Brandon for administrative advice, but with Brandon taking on expanded responsibilities with the Buffalo Sabres and Pegula Sports Entertainment (his official title is managing partner and president), their relationship is likely to change. \"With his duties taking him away, (Brandon's involvement in football decisions) will probably be less and less,\" Whaley said. After starting the season 4-2, the Bills lost four of their last five games to finish 7-9 and miss the NFL playoffs for the 17th straight season. The Bills finished their season with a disappointing 30-10 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. Whaley said the team was \"highly competitive\" for much of the season. \"If you look at the season in totality, we did some good things,\" Whaley said. \"We just weren't consistent. \"We're not that far away, we believe.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.

The Bears are done embarrassing themselves this season \u2014 John Fox \u2019s \u201ctry hard\u201d clown act capped the embarrassment with a 38-10 loss Sunday in Minnesota \u2014 which means they now can become relevant. To become relevant beyond next season\u2019s opener, however, they will need a new quarterback. They also... (Steve Rosenbloom) \u201cJonathan Allen, the defensive lineman from Alabama, isn\u2019t really truly an edge guy for the Bears. Is he J.J. Watt ? No, he\u2019s not. Is he going to be an edge rusher in a 3-4? No, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s really a good 3-4 defensive end. They\u2019d be thrilled to have him but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s No. 3. I think they need a cornerback but I think they draft the quarterback first and in the second round I think they are still going to get a quality cornerback. \u201cIf I was the general manager and I knew that my ass was on the line next year with the head coach, what do we truly need? Jay Cutler hasn\u2019t worked. Let\u2019s get rid of him. Matt Barkley is a good little backup. They need a good quarterback. They\u2019re not going to wait until the third round to take one. They can\u2019t. \u201cThe LSU safety Jamal Adams? He\u2019s a good player. But how much of an impact can he be? He\u2019s a safety. How many Troy Polamalus do you know? This kid is a really good player. But I think there will be two really quality corners left for the Bears at the top of the second round. \u201cThe first guy has gotta be a sexy pick. It\u2019s gotta be a pass rusher. It\u2019s gotta be a big-time corner but I don\u2019t think there is a big-time corner that\u2019s going No. 3. There\u2019s probably not a pass rusher that is going No. 3. Tim Williams, the kid from Alabama, he\u2019s got a lot of baggage. He\u2019s gonna tumble a little bit. \u201cThe other thing they can do if they take a quarterback early, maybe they can buy a little more time with the understanding he\u2019s going to struggle a little at first like rookie quarterbacks tend to do. They\u2019ve got to take a quarterback. You said you were looking for five names. Five names really isn\u2019t what it\u2019s about.\u201d 4. The Bears will likely find out in the next week or so if they have a chance to coach one of the teams in the Senior Bowl later this month in Mobile, Ala. The Browns , who will own the No. 1 overall pick, will almost certainly be offered one of the slots. The 49ers , who pick No. 2, will not be in play if they blow up their power structure and fire the general manager and head coach, as has been speculated. That would make the Bears the logical next pick but nothing is decided at this point. The team could turn down the chance. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never done it in 27 years,\u201d coach John Fox said when I asked if he\u2019d considered the possibility. \u201cI really can\u2019t comment other than you get a chance to watch guys and work with the guys almost like you have them in your training camp. So, I see the benefits but I really can\u2019t speak too much to that because I haven\u2019t done it before.\u201d It\u2019s hardly a foolproof draft aid though. The Jaguars staff coached at the Senior Bowl in 2014 when it had Derek Carr and Jimmy Garoppolo on its roster. Jacksonville turned around and used the No. 3 pick in the draft that year on Blake Bortles , one of the reasons that coaching staff has been fired. So stay tuned on this situation. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like there will be a Carr on either Senior Bowl roster this year.\u00a0 5. Any other year and Jordan Howard\u2019s 1,313-yard rookie season probably isn\u2019t checking in at No. 5 in the season-ending 10 Thoughts but, well, it\u2019s been that kind of year. Howard\u2019s 135-yard effort vaulted him to No. 2 in the league for the season. While Howard has no shot at NFL offensive rookie of the year honors with the Cowboys \u2019 Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott having huge seasons, Howard would be a good bet most other seasons.\u00a0 Photos of Bears running back Jordan Howard. Howard finished averaging 5.2 yards per game, the best by a primary Bears\u2019 running back since Walter Payton averaged 5.5 in his 1,852-yard season of 1977. That\u2019s what was really impressive. For some perspective on Howard, I turned to tight end Logan Paulsen , a seven-year veteran who has made a living in the NFL primarily blocking for running backs. I thought he had some really interesting stuff to say that\u2019s worth taking a look at. My question was simple: Does Howard remind him of any other backs? \u201cNot particularly,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very unique running style. He\u2019s got amazing vision and he\u2019s kind of got a sense how the run should hit. It\u2019s very unique, very special. He\u2019s got great acceleration. Not super top end (speed) but his zero to 10 is good and that helps him hit the hole real hard. I\u2019m trying to think if there is anyone that comes to mind. \u201cI would compare him to Alfred (Morris), but I think Jordan\u2019s vision is way better. They run hard. They kind of run physically. But he sees the cut way better, understands the scheme way better. I\u2019m trying to think of big backs but he\u2019s got a little more (stuff) to him than like Eddie George, for example. He\u2019s a unique fella. \u201cI got here late (signed Sept. 4) so I saw him and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a fifth-round draft pick.\u2019 His demeanor is so quiet. He is not very boisterous. And seemingly he\u2019s just average in all areas but then once he gets the ball in his hands and he\u2019s behind the line, the cuts that he sees are next level. One that comes to mind for me is at Indianapolis. I got short-necked on the edge, you know, and the lane was collapsing. Most backs, they see that, and they kind of abort the front-side read and they try to just cram it backside. He stuck it front side, he crammed it between me and the tackle and I swear to god the thing was about this big (holds up hands about 18 inches apart) and he got a 5-yard gain. There is a maturity there and an understanding to what we\u2019re trying to do in the run game that very few backs have. It takes a special guy. Obviously, he had the big run that game (57 yards). It was blocked really well. To me, it\u2019s that run I described to you, that\u2019s what makes Jordan special.\u201d Photos of all the touchdowns the Bears have scored this season. 6. Congratulations to former Bears linebacker Tim Shaw , whose book \u201cBlitz Your Life: Stories from an NFL and ALS Warrior\u201d is being released Tuesday. The book isn\u2019t about Shaw\u2019s life story going from setting a single-season prep rushing record in Michigan to Penn State and then to the NFL as one of the best special teams players in the league. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in April 2014 and he\u2019s seeking to share some life lessons he\u2019s picked up as he tackles the debilitating disease at full speed. He\u2019s traveling to Israel this coming Sunday to undergo stem-cell treatment and is planning to visit South Africa in March to check off a bucket list item by visiting Victoria Falls. Shaw was at Soldier Field when the Bears hosted the Titans in November and was made a consultant for lack of a better term by Tennessee coach Mike Mularkey this season. Shaw would complete scouting reports for the special teams unit and meet with the players on a regular basis. \u201cI always thought I would write a book,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked to write. But really I was waiting for that superstar moment or that championship win or that MVP situation, right? I thought, \u2018Man, I better be ready to have a book when that moment comes.\u2019 Really, I found myself in a situation where what I am going through is bigger than anything I ever could have imagined and no, it\u2019s not what I wanted, but it is an opportunity to impact lives. So for me that was the motivation, to reach as many people as I can with the message. \u201cThe book is about knowing who you are, embracing who you are and with that pursuing a life of purpose, becoming your best self and living a life that means something. That means eliminating the things that aren\u2019t important and emphasizing and focusing on the things that are the upmost importance.\u201d Shaw can still walk and while his speech his slowed, he\u2019s easy to understand. Those are obviously huge changes in his life and factors that are forcing him to adjust as he battles the disease. But the physical challenges are not the first things that he focuses on. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very obvious change in me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most obvious change I\u2019ve seen is my lack of time for things that are insignificant. Anything from complaining about something minute or even just wasting time. I just don\u2019t have any tolerance for it, the things that are just not of significance. I have made a big shift of everything I do, I want to matter. I want it to be something. I want it to be important. Also, embracing who I am. I have had to ask myself some really tough questions about who I am? What I am doing and why? It\u2019s forced me to say alright, \u2018Take away football. Take away money. Take away your body. Take away your voice. Who are you?\u2019 It is a really difficult question to ask yourself and I think when you do that, you have the freedom to be yourself and the freedom to improve and the freedom to be real with people. Those are huge, huge things that have changed in my life.\u201d ",

Ryan (R-Wis.) on Capitol Hill in Washington. President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Alex Brandon / Associated Press) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter A Republican-controlled Congress opens Tuesday with the most sweeping conservative agenda in decades, providing Donald Trump ample room to gut the Affordable Care Act, slash corporate tax rates and undo Obama -era environmental regulations. The House is almost certain to reelect Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) as its first order of business, dispensing with the messy political infighting that has hobbled Republicans in the past. And the Senate will swiftly begin vetting the president-elect\u2019s most controversial Cabinet picks, ready to confirm some when Trump is inaugurated as president on Jan. 20. Yet Republicans remain at odds on some high-profile issues \u2014 such as how aggressively to investigate Russian hacking in the 2016 election \u2014 and how to fulfill other big-ticket promises, such as replacing Obamacare. Despite firm Republican control of both the White House and Congress, the internal disputes have left them without a clear plan yet for Trump\u2019s first 100 days, or an endgame for the two years of the 115th Congress. Trump\u2019s often shifting views on major issues will test relations with GOP\u2019s leaders on Capitol Hill, and his willingness to skirt ideological rigidity gives\u00a0incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco an opening to influence and shape the president\u2019s evolving agenda. Janet L. Yellen and the Federal Reserve should be looking at easier days ahead. Yellen, in what will probably be her last full year as Fed chair, may\u00a0finally get help from somewhere else in Washington. Tax cuts and... After three years of almost single-handedly juicing up the slow-growing economy, Janet L. Yellen and the Federal Reserve should be looking at easier days ahead. Yellen, in what will probably be her last full year as Fed chair, may\u00a0finally get help from somewhere else in Washington. Tax cuts and... (Don Lee and Jim Puzzanghera) President Obama will visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Democrats bracing for their new role, not just as the minority party, but as the main roadblock preventing Trump from dismantling the healthcare law and other parts of the Obama agenda. Republicans will also assemble behind closed doors. Vice President-elect Mike Pence , who was a popular conservative congressman before he was elected governor of Indiana, is likely to serve as a crucial link between the Trump administration and its allies in Congress. Given Trump\u2019s inexperience in government, Pence is expected to play an enhanced role, perhaps like the one former Vice President Richard Cheney held under President George W. Bush. At a minimum, Pence could provide a vital conduit between the untested new president and his more ideological party members in Congress, especially as Ryan\u2019s own relationship with Trump has been strained. Ryan flip-flopped over Trump \u2014 first withholding his endorsement, then ultimately campaigning for him \u2014\u00a0but the speaker insists he and the president-elect have let bygones pass as they talk almost daily on their plans for fulfilling Republican promises to voters. \u00a0\u201cVery soon after the race, Donald and I said:\u00a0\u2018Look, this is fantastic. We have so much to do. Let's forget about, you know, any differences in the past and let's get working on this agenda,\u2019\u201d Ryan said recently on Fox News. \u201cAnd that's exactly what we've been doing from -- that day on.\u201d Once Trump takes office, Republicans will face\u00a0enormous pressure to score some legislative wins after six years of trying to block most of Obama\u2019s initiatives. Lawmakers will vote this week on low-hanging fruit -- a popular GOP measure to rein in the executive branch by requiring congressional approval for new federal regulations with an economic impact of more than $100 million. The measure, which passed the Republican House three times since 2011, is a GOP priority. Its supporters say it would have prevented nearly all the climate and employment rule changes of the Obama era. Republicans are also expected to punish Democrats for last year\u2019s gun control sit-in, led by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), by imposing new rules that would slap up to $2,500\u00a0fines on lawmakers who film such floor protests from smartphones or other devices. Whether that would pass judicial review is less clear. Opponents say the proposed ban is clearly unconstitutional. But the GOP\u2019s top promise \u2014 to end Obamacare \u2014 remains a tough haul. Votes are expected in coming days on legislation to begin repealing the Affordable Care Act. But these first steps will be largely symbolic while lawmakers debate the details of dismantling the healthcare law. With 20 million Americans now benefiting from Obamacare, the GOP\u2019s gutting of it comes with an asterisk. Republicans are also likely to postpone fully dismantling the healthcare law until they can sort out their own ideas for a yet-to-be-determined\u00a0alternative.\u00a0 That could push a full Obamacare repeal and replace until 2018 or 2019, after the midterm elections. \u201cRepeal and delay, it doesn\u2019t even have alliteration,\u201d Pelosi scoffed on a conference call Monday with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an admission that it\u2019s a lot for them to lose politically.\u201d Throughout his campaign for president, Donald Trump painted a gloomy picture of the American economy, scoffing at employment data that he said masked the truth. \u201cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,\u201d the Republican said at an election-day\u00a0rally\u00a0in Michigan, lamenting how he saw global... Throughout his campaign for president, Donald Trump painted a gloomy picture of the American economy, scoffing at employment data that he said masked the truth. \u201cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,\u201d the Republican said at an election-day\u00a0rally\u00a0in Michigan, lamenting how he saw global... (Michael A. Memoli) Similarly, Republicans are still working out the details of tax reform beyond the lower rates proposed in the House\u00a0GOP\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d blueprint agenda for the new year.\u00a0 Ryan will almost certainly re-emerge as speaker in Tuesday\u2019s floor vote. But his leadership remains constrained by the same internal party divisions that hobbled his predecessor, John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), and that have prevented Republicans from making gains on a cohesive agenda. Democrats, despite being in the minority in both the House and Senate, will be more than bit players in the new Washington environment. Senate Democrats are planning a robust grilling of Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices, particularly Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the conservative orthopedic doctor who has been tapped to helm the Health and Human Services Department and the Obamacare unraveling. Democrats are also lining up against Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general, and have raised questions about ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, who has substantial ties with Russia, as secretary of State. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) intends to have several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks \u2013 likely the national security team -- cleared for quick confirmation after Trump takes office. But McConnell faces his own difficulty as several top Republicans, including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are pushing for an aggressive investigation in Congress of Russian cyber-attacks during the presidential race. McCain plans to hold his first hearing on the issue Thursday. McConnell has resisted calls by a bipartisan group, led by McCain and Schumer, for creation of a separate special committee \u2013 or an independent panel like the bipartisan commission that investigated the terrorist attacks after Sept. 11, 2001. Many Republicans are optimistic for the days ahead, ready to \u201chit the ground running,\u201d Ryan\u00a0has said. Congress adjusted its calendar to work more, with several five-day work weeks in the House as it\u00a0races to deliver on election promises. Normally the House is in session only four\u00a0days a week. Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Steph Solis , USA TODAY 7:03 p.m. EST January 2, 2017 521 Shares President-elect Donald Trump responded to North Korea's latest nuclear threat delivered in a New Year's Day speech. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) North Korea kicked off 2017 with Kim Jong Un suggesting the country is nearly ready to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. But President-elect Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem convinced, saying \u201cit won\u2019t happen.\u201d North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Trump responded to Kim's annual New Year's address on Sunday, in which he said that plans for launching a missile have\u00a0\u201creached the final stage,\" though he did not explicitly say it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. The test would come a year after\u00a0testing what the North claims was its first hydrogen bomb. During his speech, Kim said he would bolster his country's military capabilities unless the U.S. stopped\u00a0war games with South Korea. He stopped short of threatening a war with the South, arguing that the country had to avoid another Korean war. Instead, he said, the country should focus on building its economy under a five-year plan announced in May. South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said in a statement that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Kim\u2019s threat to proceed with a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile and strengthen North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapon capabilities. Trump has said in the past that he would work with China to \u201cclose down\u201d North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, but that strategy may have changed. During the general election he said it was up to China to deal with the threat North Korea posed in the region. China, North Korea's biggest ally, signed on to international sanctions imposed by the\u00a0United Nations Security Council\u00a0in response to\u00a0North\u00a0Korea's nuclear weapons tests, but one expert told USA TODAY it could walk away from them. Trump followed up with a swipe at China and its relationship with North Korea. China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! \u2014 Donald J.

Jose Sepulveda (@josesepulveda87) has more. Buzz60 Mariah Carey performs in Times Square on New Year's Eve in New York. (Photo: Theo Wargo, Getty Images) Oh, the drama. 2017 is definitely starting off with fireworks for Mariah Carey and Dick Clark Productions. And not the good kind. After Carey's camp came to her defense early Sunday, blaming technical difficulties on producers, the production company issued its own statement: \"As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years, we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists. To suggest that dcp (Dick Clark Productions), as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards, Billboard \u00a0Music Awards, New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards, would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd,\" the statement said. \"In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, however, an initial investigation has indicated that dcp had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve performance. We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry.\" The New Year's Eve Rockin' Eve performance rocked social media when Carey couldn't seem to keep up with a prerecorded track. After stumbling through one song, the show's\u00a0headliner stopped singing We Belong Together after another mishap when she lowered the microphone from her mouth, but vocals kept playing. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d she told\u00a0the crowd\u00a0and left the stage. Her publicist, Nicole Perna, \u00a0told the Associated Press: \u00a0\"Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance, given the circumstances.\" According to AP, Perna said that Carey's earpiece wasn't working and she flagged the issue to the production team but was told it would be OK when she got onstage. \"However, that was not the case, and they were again told that her earpiece was not working,\" Perna said. \"Instead of endeavoring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.\" Mariah Carey doesn't know Demi Lovato or Ariana Grande, either Carey herself tweeted sad and happy emojis and a clip of herself shrugging. Her message read in part: \"Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here's to making more headlines in 2017.\" The AP also reported that a person familiar with the production of the show who asked for anonymity to speak about the incident said all of the other performers, including Gloria Estefan, rehearsed onsite for their sets but Carey had a stand-in for her rehearsal even though she was there, atypical for the show's performers. 5117 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 64 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iWZfpr NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

The world's most populous nation has the second-largest economy, one of the highest savings rates and mushrooming wealth. Yet virtually no one has a will to pass on an estate. (Photo: Andy Wong, AP) BEIJING \u2014 The world's most populous nation has the second-largest economy, one of the highest savings rates and mushrooming wealth. Yet virtually no one has a will to pass on an\u00a0estate. And now it's become a huge problem. Thirty years after communist China\u00a0embarked on a course that allowed individuals to accumulate wealth,\u00a0members of\u00a0the first generation to benefit are starting to die, creating a spike in inheritance disputes that are\u00a0clogging up the courts and turning families against each other. The problem has gotten so bad that even the ruling Communist Party \u2014\u00a0previously no fan of inherited wealth \u2014\u00a0is concerned. \u201cWhen people die without a will their children scramble for their property, damaging family ties and having a negative effect on society,\u201d the state-run Xinhua News Agency\u00a0has warned. Only 1% of China\u2019s 220 million seniors have drawn up inheritance plans, according to the best estimates.\u00a0The reason\u00a0is cultural: talking about death is taboo and writing a will is akin to putting a curse on yourself. A group of senior citizens write their wills at a free legal center in Beijing. \u00a0(Photo: Hannah Gardner) Even the rich and educated often don\u2019t write them. Consider the publicized case of\u00a0Yan Jiying, a coal baron from the northern province of Shanxi.\u00a0He died in 2015\u00a0at the age of 71, leaving his estranged wife, long-term mistress and six children\u00a0to fight over his assets. At one point the conflict was so bad that his company, Sanjia, stopped paying wages.\u00a0Local officials tried to broker a peace but to no avail. \u201cChina is entering a crucial period. If we don\u2019t find a way to transfer wealth responsibly it will affect social stability,\u201d said\u00a0Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology. To remedy the problem,\u00a0the government is calling on local authorities around the country to establish free legal centers for those over 60.\u00a0One charity doing that since 2013 is the China Will Registration Center, founded by Chen Kai, a young lawyer with a passion to\u00a0protect\u00a0seniors.\u00a0His offices in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Nanjing have\u00a0processed 40,000 wills at no charge\u00a0since it was established and is the largest\u00a0provider of probate services in China. The waiting list for appointments at his first Beijing center now stretches into September, proof that people will write a will if they can find support they trust, Chen\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cWe want to teach old people that they are the masters of their fortune, that they have the right to decide what happens to their hard-earned money, \u201d he said. On a recent morning around a dozen seniors were squeezed around a communal table at the center, diligently transcribing the final copy of their will. They begin by dictating\u00a0their wishes to a lawyer, who types up a draft. The clients\u00a0are\u00a0then evaluated by a visiting psychiatrist to establish clarity of mind, they record video testimony of their wishes in the presence of two independent witnesses, and finally copy the final document by hand. People walk past motorists stuck on a traffic jam during the morning rush hour in Beijing, Dec. 15, 2016. \u00a0(Photo: Andy Wong, AP) For many, the last step is the hardest. Most are over 70\u00a0and have shaky hands or poor eyesight.\u00a0Transcribing a page of formal Chinese characters mistake-free is no easy task. But Chen is adamant that they do it this\u00a0way, saying he has seen too many badly written wills challenged. He wants his clients to be sure their wishes will be respected even if some family members\u00a0do not like them. According to a recent article in the People\u2019s Daily, 70%\u00a0of inheritance cases in Beijing courts stem from the lack of a will. In\u00a0the cases where a\u00a0will is challenged, 60%\u00a0are found to be invalid. Chinese television is\u00a0highlighting the issue in shows like Third Mediation Room, China\u2019s answer to Jerry Springer, and Family Property, a drama about three brothers who fight over the family business after their father dies without a will. At the will registration center in Beijing, many said they had come after discussing their wishes with family members.\u00a0Liu Maolin, 74, said he had decided to write a\u00a0will because he wanted to be sure his daughter, who cares for him, gets his apartment, not his son, a businessman\u00a0who lives in Japan. His family agreed this was a fair arrangement, but he conceded there is always a risk of a later dispute. \"I didn\u2019t want them to end up like the people on television. This way they can\u2019t argue after I am gone.\u201d 16 CONNECT TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iWY5dv NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Bradford sheepishly acknowledged the applause for setting an NFL single-season accuracy record by completing 71.6 percent of his passes. Acquired from the Eagles in the preseason for first- and fourth-round draft picks after starter Teddy Bridgewater went down with an injury, Bradford made an immediate impact. The 8-8 Vikings didn't miss the playoffs because of Bradford. Good luck finding folks in Minnesota convinced the Vikings gave up too much. Sometimes gambles pay off in the NFL, and in Bradford's case, a season that started with a bold risk ended with a video tribute. You wonder what was going through Bears general manager Ryan Pace 's head as he watched from his seat in the press box. A Bears fan can hope the message resonated. It will take the same kind of daring creativity by Pace to address football's most important position in a defining offseason that began Monday. Pace can start by thinking big, pursuing a quarterback with Pro Bowl potential and treating the decision as if his job depends on it. It does, or at least it will dictate how we evaluate Pace next winter after his third season. The Bears have pressing needs at cornerback, safety and offensive tackle, but every potential upgrade will be enhanced if they get it right at quarterback, the player who affects everything about an organization. A team such as the Bears, with a quarterback tradition no franchise wants, needs unprecedented boldness to change course. Now that the Cubs have won the World Series, the Bears' search for a bona fide franchise quarterback represents Chicago's longest drought. Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler. All three avenues appear open to Pace: the draft, free agency and a trade. Before choosing which path to follow, Pace must make the easiest call of the offseason: Move on from Jay Cutler . From a football perspective, the Bears could argue that bringing back Cutler for a ninth season offers the sturdiest bridge to a quarterback drafted to be his successor. In reality, football reasons alone cannot influence every move by NFL teams. If the Bears tried selling Cutler as their 2017 starter to a fan base already fed up enough to ignore the team, Soldier Field's empty-seat epidemic would start spreading by October. Thank Cutler for being a tough son of a gun who dealt with more abuse than he often deserved and wish him well on whatever team he will start next. But he is in the way in Chicago. It must be someone else's time to take snaps. Whose? That depends on which of the three methods Pace selects to find the answer. He can begin by exploring the trade availability of Jimmy Garoppolo, the Patriots backup expected to be on the market with Tom Brady looking as young as ever. And if Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels becomes a head coach again, his new team likely will pursue a Garoppolo deal as aggressively as the Bears should. Speculation suggests trade discussions with the Patriots will open with teams offering first- and fourth-round draft picks \u2014 the price the Vikings paid for Bradford. Given the iffy quarterbacks in the 2017 draft, Pace could justify sacrificing the picks for a quarterback of the future who's ready now. Jimmy Garoppolo Acquiring New England Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo might be an option for the Bears.\u00a0 Acquiring New England Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo might be an option for the Bears.\u00a0 (Elise Amendola / AP) A football executive can talk himself out of anything in a conservative league. Or the NFL's youngest general manager can commit to a deal that will define his tenure and put his team in position to compete for a playoff spot again sooner rather than later. Garoppolo has only two NFL starts in three seasons, and becoming a No. 1 quarterback might expose him as the next Brock Osweiler . But what if it reveals Garoppolo as one of the league's best young quarterbacks who learned well from a legend? Too much is made of the Arlington Heights native's local ties and his Eastern Illinois connection to Pace; he could be a West Coast kid who went to college in the South and be worthy of the Bears' pursuit because of talent and intangibles. If the Bears swing and miss on Garoppolo by the time free agency begins March 7, they can explore other veteran options. But unless the Redskins unexpectedly allow Kirk Cousins to hit the market, no free-agent possibilities make more sense than a potential draft pick. Mike Glennon ? Case Keenum ? Exactly. If Cousins remains a Redskin and a Garoppolo trade falls through, the Bears will head into the April 27-29 draft in the dangerous position of drafting for need with the No. 3 pick. Or, put more accurately, overdrafting for need. In that case, the Bears should consider re-signing Brian Hoyer to be the 2017 transitional starter for the rookie-to-be-named-later taken third. The next few months will determine how high Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer, North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky and Clemson's Deshaun Watson \u2014 in alphabetical order only, at this point \u2014 deserve to go. Drafting a quarterback in the first round represents the safest way for Pace to address the longtime problem. That doesn't necessarily make it the smartest for a GM who not only must be fixated on the position this offseason, but also must do what so many of his predecessors didn't: Fix it. ",

    "text": "GOP Congress Feels It Has Mandate to Undo Obama's Agenda By mary clare jalonick, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 2, 2017, 3:23 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH Schiff Warns of 'Vigorous' Response by Congress If Trump Reverses Russia Sanctions 0 Shares Email Republicans' grip on all levers of power stands as a mandate to the GOP-led Congress, which will move swiftly to try to undo eight years of outgoing President Barack Obama's agenda. With Republican President-elect Donald Trump just weeks away from assuming office, GOP lawmakers plan to open the 115th Congress on Tuesday and immediately take steps to repeal Obama's health care law. Beyond that, they'll look at a tax overhaul, reversing Obama-era environmental regulations and other conservative priorities. Republicans will face some obstacles. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Democrats \"stand ready to fight vigorously\" to protect health care and other priorities, and Republicans will have to compromise with Senate Democrats to move major legislation through that chamber. A look at what the 115th Congress will be up to in 2017: \u2014\u2014\u2014 NEW MEMBERS New members of the House and Senate will be sworn in on Tuesday, the first day of the new Congress. In the Senate, five Democrats and two Republicans will be sworn in for the first time, joined by returning members who won re-election in 2016. After those members are sworn in, there will be 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. The House will have 52 new members \u2014 27 Republicans and 25 Democrats. There will be 241 Republicans in the House and 194 Democrats. \u2014\u2014\u2014 CONFIRMING A NEW CABINET Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, and Republicans in the Senate will spend the first days and weeks of his presidency pushing to confirm his Cabinet picks. Democrats changed the rules and curbed the filibuster in 2013, making it easier for Republicans to move nominations. But even though they won't be able to block Trump's nominees, Democrats have pledged to fight many of them anyway, highlighting what they say is the hypocrisy of Trump's populist message and his wealthy, corporate-favoring nominees for several posts. \u2014\u2014\u2014 REPEALING OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE LAW The Senate plans to begin repealing Obama's health care law on Tuesday, Congress' very first day, with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield the initiative from Democratic filibusters. Lawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Likely to go are its mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. Some elements of the repeal likely wouldn't go into effect for two to four years. Republicans will then begin the more complicated task of building a new system. The GOP will have to craft new programs for the nation's $3 trillion health care system and make sure insurance markets don't collapse while the transition is under way. \u2014\u2014\u2014 TAX OVERHAUL Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis., want a massive overhaul of the tax system with the goal of simplifying a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants as well as corporations that can easily shift profits and jobs overseas. It would be the first major tax overhaul in 30 years. Trump has also advocated a tax overhaul, but with fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SUPREME COURT Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 11 months ago, but the Senate still hasn't considered a replacement. That's because McConnell blocked consideration of Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, saying the next president should make the pick. The strategy paid off, and the Republican Senate will consider whomever Trump nominates. \u2014\u2014\u2014 MEDICARE CHANGES Ryan is the most powerful advocate in Washington for an overhaul of Medicare and a premium-support approach that would, over time, remake it into a voucher-like program that could force some seniors entering the program to buy health insurance on the open market instead of getting coverage through the traditional open-ended program. But his ideas likely will run into a political reality. Trump said on the campaign trail that he wouldn't cut the program, and Senate Republicans haven't been as enthusiastic either. Candidate Trump also initially promised not to cut Medicaid \u2014 the federal-state health insurance program for low-income and severely disabled people. During the campaign, Trump seemed to shift, backing \"block grants\" that limit federal funding. \u2014\u2014\u2014 SOCIAL SECURITY Like Medicare, some House conservatives have said they want to overhaul Social Security and slow the program's growth to curb spending. But Trump has said he doesn't want to touch those programs, and Ryan told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in December that he has no plans to change Social Security. \u2014\u2014\u2014 REVERSING REGULATIONS Republican leaders have complained throughout Obama's presidency about burdensome regulations, a theme Trump used frequently during the campaign as well. GOP lawmakers now want to undo some of Obama's regulations and executive orders, using the Congressional Review Act, a rarely invoked procedure. Many of the regulations they are targeting are rules put in place by the Environmental Protection Agency, including the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, a clean water rule that has drawn the ire of farmers and another rule imposed in December to protect nearby streams from coal-mining debris. \u2014\u2014\u2014 INFRASTRUCTURE Trump made rebuilding the nation's aging roads, bridges and airports a major part of his job-creation strategy in the presidential race. But those plans appear to have fizzled, somewhat, as GOP leaders have questioned the spending. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Matthew Daly and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "advertisement A Texas state representative is lucky to be alive after a stray bullet hit him in the back of the head while he and his family celebrated New Year's Eve. It came within millimeters from piercing his brain. Rep. Armando Martinez , a Democrat who is in his seventh term serving District 39, was celebrating the New Year at a friend's house in Weslaco, Texas, when he got shot with the stray bullet. In a phone interview with NBC Latino, Martinez said the partygoers had huddled inside the garage when they heard celebratory gunshots ring through the lower Rio Grande Valley. State Rep. Armando Martinez, D-Weslaco, in an image taken on Feb. 2, 2005, in Austin, Texas. Deborah Cannon / AP, file \"At about 12 a.m., when the gunshots subsided, we walked outside with the kids to pop off some fireworks,\" Martinez said, while he recovered at the Valley Baptist Medical Center. \"I was telling the kids to be careful and to not get burned. My wife came over, gave me a kiss and wished me a Happy New Year.\" When she pulled away, that is when the stray bullet pierced Martinez's skull. \"I felt like I got hit by a sledgehammer,\" Martinez said. \"I ducked and then walked into the garage to get some ice. I was in a lot of pain. When my wife took a picture and said there was a hole, I knew it was a bullet.\" Martinez said he is \"incredibly grateful\" to the Weslaco firefighters and local paramedics for helping him get to a local hospital. A trauma and neurosurgeon removed a .223 caliber bullet from Martinez's head in a 45-minute medical procedure. The Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office is working on locating the source of the bullet, which could have come from a person firing a gun in the air two blocks away. RELATED: Supreme Court Upholds Wide Reach of U.S. Gun Ban for Domestic Violence \"I was extremely lucky,\" Martinez said. \"My surgeons said if it went a couple more millimeters deeper, I may not have been able to have this conversation right now.\" Martinez, who was born and raised in Weslaco, explained that hearing gunshots from surrounding ranches during celebrations was common as he grew up. Over the years Weslaco's population has grown larger and denser, which has made some people nervous about their children playing outdoors during times like New Year's. \"This whole thing is going to be a start to putting a stop to people firing their guns in celebration,\" Martinez said. \"The Valley was not as populous it is now. We have these subdivisions everywhere now. Especially after what happened on New Year's, it shows that someone can be hurt, and it can be tragic.\" In his years serving his district, Martinez has worked extensively on bills relating to education, such as his HB-44 which would help establish a law school in the Rio Grande Valley. He has not worked on any legislation that would impose restrictions on gun ownership. After the incident, however, he is looking to take steps to prevent another accident. RELATED: New Texas Law Allows College Students to Carry Guns on Campus \"It is something we are going to have to look at,\" Martinez said. \"Our county Sheriff has done an excellent job working on this, and he is in touch with the District Attorney. We are going to look at what type of legislation we are going to offer this session.\" Martinez said he expects to be going back home on Monday. He said that even though he was shot, he is thankful it did not happen to one of the children or to his wife. \"My biggest concern were the children,\" Martinez said. \"Had my wife been any closer it could have been in her face or neck. The children saw everything happen.\" \"I do believe there is a silver lining that nobody else got seriously hurt,\" Martinez continued, \"and I hope me and my family are in your prayers this year.\" Follow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "text": "advertisement Here's news to raise a glass to this year: The trend of the hipster bartender is over. We've all been there. You just want a plain Jane drink while you're hanging out with friends at the uber-cool new bar, and when you place your order \u2014 say, vodka and tonic \u2014 the leather-aproned, wax-mustached bartender looks down his nose. Embarrassed, you instead page through the tome of hand-crafted cocktails featuring house-made bitters, locally foraged herbs, distilled fog spirits infused with heritage breed berries, Nordic ice spheres personally carved by the bartender's grandmother in the ice-house constructed of reclaimed Prohibition-era schoolhouse planks, and you point at the 14-ingredient, $18 drink with one recognizable component. Whatever happened to the friendly bartender? Related: This Gene Might Affect How Much You Like to Drink Clayton Rollins, who owns Lucky Rooster in Hilton Head, told NBC, \"The bar is getting back to customer service. Craft cocktails are just the norm now.\" But how did we get from the days of bartender as friend to the opponent across the bar you have to impress with your order before waiting 15 minutes for a drink? That early, easy relationship was only natural, after all, Rollins said. \"If you look at how a restaurant is set up from a service side, it's a lot easier for a bartender to have an intimate experience with guests sitting at bar,\" he said. \"You're at eye level, only separated by two to three feet. Generally the bartender has some time to engage. There's this communal experience that doesn't necessarily happen at a restaurant table where the server is standing up.\" It's Not You, It's Them Rollins points to a lack of security as the pivotal factor in the shift away from that relationship. \"All of a sudden there are a select group of bartenders doing craft cocktails and learning about something in our history that they're trying to make new and relevant. Just like anything else good, people copy it. They're really passionate about it but customers are still drinking their vodka sodas. [The bartenders] get defensive about it. It creates insecurity.\" While the best bartenders had such superior skill sets they didn't need the guest to validate them, that attitude became the standard. \"Who doesn't like to tell the rich 55 year-old-guy when you're 25 that you know more than them? That jerk bartender mentality disseminated through a lot of levels,\" said Rollins. \"Learning this new craft, you don't know how to come across humbly,\" he told NBC. \"That insecurity breeds into 'I'm going to show you.'\" But like all trends, \"now that we've been doing craft bartending for a longer period of time it's not so crafty,\" Rollins said. \"Remember when farm to table was cool? Now it's just what you're supposed to be doing. To have a good bar program you have to be able to make a proper Negroni, Manhattan, Boulevardier, know that a martini is gin and vermouth stirred the old style. And customers are comfortable. Bartenders feel more comfortable. Everybody feels safer.\" Related: The Bourbon So Exclusive that Even Billionaires Can't Buy It Now that more bartenders have this knowledge, \"How do I differentiate myself?\" Rollins said. \"I have to blow you away with customer service. It's just evolution.\" And, back on even footing, bartenders can still introduce guests to something new. \"Once those people feel safe they're open to trying some things a little at a time outside their comfort zone.\" Like any process of evolution though, it's happening slowly, Rollins said. \"It's going to take some time to get back to service.\" Bartending Is a Career So what should a consumer do when faced with a frosty bartender? Recognize one thing, he said. \"A lot of people work in the hospitality industry because they want to serve guests. Don't assume because someone is bartending or waiting tables that this is just a job placeholder. With the people who work for me, this is their chosen career path and they make good money and they love doing it.\" \"Just show people the same respect as you'd like to be treated with,\" Rollins went on. \"We are responsible on both sides of the bar.\" And beyond that basic decency, remember, \"we're at a bar to have fun,\" he added. And if you're not being treated well? \"Just go somewhere else. It's that simple. You don't have to blow them up on social media or attack them on Yelp. When you find a place that you like, be a regular. Hang out there. Take chances.\" Dana McMahan ",

Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. Brad Biggs Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune With four quarterbacks on the roster or injured reserve that are coming out of contract and veteran Jay Cutler , the Chicago Bears have a multitude of decisions to make at the NFL \u2019s most important position. This much is certain: Veteran Brian Hoyer would embrace the opportunity to return for a second season. Hoyer started five games before suffering a fractured left (non-throwing) arm in the Oct. 20 loss at Green Bay. It would not be a surprise if there are scenarios in which general manager Ryan Pace considers Hoyer for a role next season. The 31-year-old proved to be a worthy backup option at $2 million and completed 67 percent of his passes with six touchdowns and no interceptions in 200 attempts while learning his new teammates. In contract, Matt Barkley threw 14 interceptions in 216 attempts after Hoyer\u2019s season was ended. \u201cI would love to stay here,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cI have comfortability with Dowell (Loggains) and his offense. Got an opportunity to play in the games and I think that kind of showed I know what to do and then learning my teammates. I saw what Coach (John) Fox said, we\u2019re not that far off. Everybody is going to say that. I have been on a lot of different teams, lot of different situations. I agree with him on that part. We\u2019ve got young guys that stepped up like Cam (Meredith), Jordan (Howard) and Cody (Whitehair). Those three guys right there, you mix them in with the veterans that are here \u2026 obviously injuries, not to make an excuse, had a lot to do with what happened here. A look at the Bears' quarterbacks through the years, from 1934 to present-day. Not pictured: Steve Bradley (1 game; 1987), Greg Landry (1 game; 1984), John Huarte (2 games; 1972), Kent Nix (9 games; 1970-71), Tommy O\u2019Connell (12 games; 1953), Tom Farris (20 games; 1946-47), Johnny Long (12 games; 1944-45), Bill Glenn (2 games; 1944), Charlie O\u2019Rourke (11 games; 1942), Young Bussey (10 games; 1941), Solly Sherman (14 games; 1939-40) and Bernie Masterson (72 games; 1934-40). | source: pro-football-reference.com \u201cMy comfort level here is great. I had a lot of fun when I got to play. Obviously, the results didn\u2019t always show what we wanted. I really like what they\u2019re building here and hopefully I can be a part of that.\u201d It\u2019s too early to say if Hoyer could be in the team\u2019s plans and the Bears will have much to sort through before they get to decisions like that. The elephant in the room, of course, is Cutler, who remains under contract through 2020. Cutler is due a base salary of $12.5 million with $2.5 million in per-game roster bonuses available. The team can release or trade him and take a cap hit of $2 million in 2017. Pace and Fox are scheduled to address media on Wednesday at Halas Hall but it would be surprising if they revealed much, if anything, about their plans for the position, which have probably have not been developed yet. Hoyer is the kind of veteran that could work with a draft pick in the offense and he has legitimate experience with 31 NFL starts. Barkley was somewhat intriguing in his first four games but was far too careless with the football and coupled with his relative inexperience, that could make it risky identifying him as more than potential competition for a No. 2 job at this point. Those are just some of the many issues the Bears have to tackle moving forward. Answers about the quarterback position will be fascinating in the coming months. Veteran guard Ted Larsen , who appeared in all 16 games and made eight starts, will undergo elbow surgery next week. Larsen, 29, played nearly the entire season with the injury, making him one of the injured players that fought through issues. Larsen earned $1.8 million on a one-year contract. He\u2019s interested in re-signing if the opportunity is there. ",

Security Council recently passed a resolution demanding that Israel cease settlement activity on Palestinian territory. Caption The U.N. Security Council recently passed a resolution demanding that Israel cease settlement activity on Palestinian territory. Jan. 1, 2017\u00a0 A view of the West Bank settlement of Eli as seen from the Ancient Shiloh archaeological park, south of Nablus. David Vaaknin/For The Washington Post By Griff Witte January 2 at 4:32 PM Follow @griffwitte SHILOH, West Bank \u2014 Through eight years of escalating criticism from the world\u2019s most powerful leader, Israeli construction in these sacred, militarily occupied hills never stopped.\u00a0 Thousands of homes were built. Miles of roadway. Restaurants. Shopping malls. A university. Here in Shiloh, a tourist center went up, with a\u00a0welcome video in which\u00a0the biblical figure Joshua commands\u00a0the Jewish people to settle the land promised to them by God. Israeli settlements may be illegal in the eyes of the U.N. Security Council and a major\u00a0obstacle to Middle East peace in the view of\u00a0the Obama administration.\u00a0 But every day they become a more\u00a0entrenched reality on land that Palestinians say should rightfully belong to them. As the parched beige hilltops fill with red-tiled homes, decades of international efforts to achieve a two-state solution are unraveling. And global condemnations notwithstanding, the trend is poised to accelerate.\u00a0 Already, Israel has a right-wing government that boasts it is more supportive of settlement construction than any in the country\u2019s short history. Within weeks, it will also have as an ally a U.S. president, Donald Trump, who has signaled he could make an extraordinary break with decades of U.S. policy and end American objections to the settlements. [ Trump once donated $10,000 to a West Bank Israeli settlement ] The combination has delighted settlers here and across the West Bank who express hope for an unparalleled building boom that would kill off notions of a Palestinian state once and for all.\u00a0 \u201cIf America interferes less, everything will be much easier,\u201d said Shivi Drori, 43,\u00a0who\u00a0runs a West Bank winery in a Jewish outpost that the Israeli government considers officially off-limits to building but has tacitly backed. \u201cI\u2019d like to see bigger settlements. Major cities.\u201d Trump, Drori predicts, will help make that a reality simply by looking the other way. President Obama \u201cwas very confrontational,\u201d Drori said. \u201cThe Trump administration seems much more sympathetic.\u201d\u00a0 (Griff Witte/The Washington Post) Israel\u2019s military conquered the West Bank in a matter of days 50 years ago this June in a war against neighboring Arab states. But settling the land has been the work of generations, accomplished hilltop by hilltop as temporary encampments and caravans have given way to suburban-style homes rooted firmly in the bedrock. All the while, much of the world has opposed the settlements as an illegal infringement on occupied land. U.S. governments \u2014 Democratic and Republican alike \u2014 have urged Israel to halt the project and allow negotiations to dictate control of land that Palestinians say is vital to the viability of a future state. Today, about 400,000 Israelis live in approximately 150 settlements scattered across the West Bank. That\u2019s up from fewer\u00a0than 300,000 when Barack Obama was elected. An additional\u00a0200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians want as their future capital.\u00a0 [ Even Israel says this Jewish settlement is illegal. Now comes the showdown. ] Unable to halt settlement growth, a frustrated Obama administration lashed out late last month with a twin-barreled diplomatic assault.\u00a0 First, Washington\u00a0 abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote that demanded Israel end all settlement activity \u2014 enabling the resolution\u2019s passage. Days later,\u00a0Secretary of State John F. Kerry\u00a0 delivered an impassioned speech accusing Israel of putting the two-state solution \u201cin serious jeopardy\u201d by building \u201cin the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be the future Palestinian state.\u201d Rather than be chastened by the criticism from the nation that has long been its closest ally, Israel\u2019s government was furious. Settlers, meanwhile, brush it off as an irrelevance.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no implication,\u201d said Oded Revivi, chief foreign envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents settlers.\u00a0 Kerry, Revivi said, is fixated on an idea that, because of\u00a0decades of Palestinian violence and intransigence, can never become reality \u2014 two states for two peoples between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Revivi instead has his eyes fixed on the incoming Trump administration, which has signaled it will abandon U.S. attempts at evenhandedness in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and throw its weight squarely behind Israel. \u201cStay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d\u00a0 Trump tweeted before the Kerry speech. Trump and his advisers \u201chave learned from President Obama\u2019s experience,\u201d Revivi said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to go into a swamp just for the sake of saying they\u2019re in it.\u201d Revivi, who is also mayor of Efrat,\u00a0 a settlement that is poised to grow from 10,000 to 16,000, has good reason to think so.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador to Israel, New York bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman, has expressed positions on the settlements that are further to the right even than those of Israel\u2019s hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\u00a0 Friedman, for instance, has argued in favor of Israeli annexation of the West Bank, long a fringe position in Israeli politics but one gaining currency as the political stars align against the two-state solution. \u201cEveryone who talks about a Palestinian state today knows it will not happen,\u201d said Naftali Bennett, Israel\u2019s education minister and leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party.\u00a0 [ Q&A with Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett ] Instead, Bennett argues for unilateral Israeli annexation of \u201cArea C\u201d \u2014 the 60\u00a0percent of West Bank land where Israeli settlements are concentrated. The vast majority of the West Bank\u2019s 2.5\u00a0million Palestinians live in Areas A and B, where Bennett says they should be able to have autonomy but not a state. \u201cWe have to say, \u2018This is what we want, and this is what we are going to do,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go on saying how the world is wrong, this is ours, and then at the end you forget to kick the ball into the net.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Netanyahu will be willing to go as far as his education minister, an ally at times but a fierce rival at others. Netanyahu is still on record supporting a two-state solution, albeit grudgingly. But the fact that annexation is being discussed at all shows how far Israeli public sentiment has shifted in the settlers\u2019 direction. On the fast-shrinking left of Israeli politics, such ideas are regarded as a dangerous overreach that threatens Israel\u2019s core democratic and Jewish identities as the Palestinian population grows. \u201cAs a patriotic Israeli, I think it\u2019s in the crucial interest of the state of Israel to get out of the West Bank,\u201d said Talia Sasson, president of the New Israel Fund. \u201cOtherwise we can\u2019t maintain our basic principles.\u201d\u00a0 Human rights advocates insist those principles have already been trampled by a decades-long policy designed to maximize land for Jewish settlement and make life as difficult as possible for Palestinians. Adam Aloni, a researcher for the advocacy group B\u2019Tselem, said Israel had already carried out \u201cde facto annexation\u201d in the West Bank by\u00a0building a network of roads and other barriers that isolate Palestinians in an archipelago of disconnected towns and cities. \u201cIsrael is creating Palestinian ghettos, islands of land that are doomed to failure without basic resources,\u201d he said. One such island is the poor, litter-strewn village of Salem, where residents say their water supplies have been choked off by adjacent settlements and their access to farmland severely restricted. \u201cThe settlers tell me, \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to be here,\u2019 \u201d said Shareef Shtyah, a 33-year-old shepherd who\u2019s had\u00a0to cull his herd of sheep from 400 to 15 because the Israelis bar his access to traditional grazing areas. \u201cI tell them, \u2018You\u2019re the ones who aren\u2019t allowed to be here.\u2019 \u201d The Obama administration may have been sympathetic to Shtyah\u2019s plight. But Palestinians express disappointment that Obama wasn\u2019t able to help them secure\u00a0many tangible achievements. And they have few illusions that they will get any support\u00a0from Trump.\u00a0 \u201cHe has the mentality of blindly supporting Israel,\u201d said Ghassan Daghlas, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s point person on settlements in the northern West Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a promising start.\u201d As with so many things, it looks just the opposite to the settlers. In Shiloh, a settler community of 3,200\u00a0a few miles down the road from Salem, residents mark the site\u00a0of what they believe to be an ancient Jewish capital with a newly constructed archaeology museum and visitors center. Tens of thousands of people visit annually, including tourists from the United States. Freshly built homes and restaurants dot thriving new neighborhoods catering to Israelis seeking to connect with the biblical lands of their ancestors \u2014 or maybe to just get a better quality of life at a cut-rate price.\u00a0 Even the developments that are not entirely legal by Israeli standards, much less international ones, boast finely paved roads, soaring electricity pylons and reliable water supplies \u2014 all courtesy of the Israeli government. And at all times, of course, Israeli soldiers stand guard. Life here is good, residents say, but it will be even better when Trump takes charge. \u201cIt could have been two or three times as much\u201d development had it not been for pressure from the Obama administration, said Eliana Passentin, who raises her eight children atop a ridge with sweeping views from the river to the sea. \u201cPeople want to come here and build homes and build companies and build schools. We\u2019ve been restricted in expanding our community. Now we\u2019ll have more freedom.\u201d\u00a0 Ruth Eglash in Shiloh and Sufian Taha in Salem contributed to this report. Read more ",

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Construction continues on the stands on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in preparation for the inaugural parade on Jan. 20. Alex Brandon/AP The organizers of President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural parade released a list of the groups who have accepted invitations to perform. Included on the list of 40 groups was the marching band from Alabama's oldest private, historically black liberal arts college, Talladega College. While officials from the college have not yet addressed the performance publicly, the band's expected participation has sparked debate on social media websites. (NPR's calls and messages to Talladega and to the chairman of the college's board went unanswered.) One user on bandhead.org wrote, \"It's a Presidential Inauguration, a high profile event. It's a great experience for the band.\" Another posted, \"All exposure isn't good exposure.\" Talladega's participation comes after other marching bands, including the band from Howard, a historically black university in Washington, D.C., did not apply to perform. Washington, D.C., high school bands are also not participating. Though Howard's band director John Newson told NBC4 that Howard's \"band had too few members and was facing budgetary constraints,\" he implied other considerations may have contributed to the decision. NBC4 reported : [Newson] said he suspects that many band directors' and school administrators' political beliefs played into whether they applied to participate in the parade. \"I think everybody knows why and no one wants to say and lose their job,\" Newson said. Article continues after sponsorship Nikky Finney, who graduated from Talladega in 1979 and is now a poet and chair in creative writing and southern studies at the University of South Carolina, condemned the band's participation in the inaugural parade. She said: The news that Talladega College has forgotten its steady and proud 150 years of history, by making the decision to not stand in solidarity with other clear-eyed and courageous people, academic institutions, and organizations, protesting the inauguration of one of the most antagonistic, hatred-spewing, unrepentant racists, has simply and unequivocally broken my heart today. Historical Black colleges are duty bound to have and keep a moral center and be of great moral consciousness while also teaching its students lessons about life that they will need going forward, mainly, that just because a billionaire \u2014 who cares nothing about their 150 years of American existence \u2014 invites them to a fancy, gold-plated, dress-up party, they have the moral right and responsibility to say \"no thank you,\" especially when the blood, sweat, and tears and bodies, of black, brown, and native people are stuffed in the envelope alongside the RSVP. This should have been a teachable moment for the President of Talladega College instead it has become a moment of divisiveness and shame. Bags of money and the promise of opportunity have always been waved in front of the faces and lives of struggling human beings, who have historically been relegated to the first-fired and the last-hired slots of life. It has been used to separate us before. It has now been used to separate us again. Other performers, including Elton John and Celine Dion, have turned down invitations to participate in inauguration ceremonies as well. Several others have said they wouldn't perfom either. The BBC reported that Grammy-winner John Legend said, \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate. We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\" On Monday, British singer Rebecca Ferguson said she was invited to sing at the inauguration. She said she would accept if she could sing \"Stange Fruit,\" the lyrics of which describe the lynchings of black people in the the U.S. Originally a poem written by Abel Meeropol, the protest song includes the line: \"Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.\" NPR's email to to the Presidential Inaugural Committee has not yet been returned.

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 3, 2017 12:49 AM EST U.S. government officials have been notified of new cases of attempted or potentially successful cyber intrusions, CBS News has learned. Officials would not go into specifics or reveal the number of new cases. But the revelation raises concerns that Russian cyberattacks have been more extensive than originally thought. Since the U.S released a report on election-related cyberattacks on Thursday, a government official said more cases have come to light, CBS News\u2019 Justice and Homeland Security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports. U.S. releases report detailing hacking allegations against Russia The intelligence information made public last week revealed some of the tools and infrastructure allegedly used by Russian hacking units. Those signatures were flagged over the weekend after officials connected with Vermont\u2019s electric grid said\u00a0 malware code used in operation \u201cGrizzly Steppe\u201d was found on a Burlington Electric Department laptop .\u00a0 A team of Department of Homeland Security analysts has been working to determine if Russian hackers successfully breached Vermont\u2019s system.  But so far, investigators have not been able to determine the intent behind the Vermont incident , and there are no indications the power grid is compromised. \u00a0 \u201cWhile our analysis continues, we currently have no information that indicates that the power grid was penetrated in this cyber incident,\u201d said Todd Breasseale, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. \u00a0 Late Monday night, The Washington Post reported that federal officials \u201care finding evidence that the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility, according to experts and officials close to the investigation.\u201d Monday\u2019s revelation about new cases of attempted or potentially successful cyber intrusions came just days after\u00a0 the Obama administration announced a series of actions in response to what the White House called \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election.\u201d In addition to sanctions announced on Thursday, 35 Russian diplomats have been expelled from the United States . While President Obama and most congressional Republicans have denounced Russia for its alleged election interference, President-elect Donald Trump has been reluctant to do so , even after FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper backed the CIA\u2019s judgment that Russia interfered. The CIA said in December it has high confidence that Russians tried to influence the election and that they favored Mr. Trump. \u201cI know a lot about hacking,\u201d\u00a0 Mr. Trump said before his New Years Eve party at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night. \u201cAnd hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And also - I know things that other people don\u2019t know - and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d Mr. Trump promised new information on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Sean Spicer, the Trump transition\u2019s spokesman, seemed to walk that back. \u201cWell it\u2019s not a question of necessarily revealing, remember the president-elect is privy to a lot of classified information, intelligence reports, he gets briefed by his national security team on a daily basis,\u201d Spicer said, speaking on CNN. It is unclear, however, where Mr. Trump or his national security team are getting their intelligence reports. All U.S. intelligence agencies are in agreement that the Russian government with the blessing of Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated \u201caggressive\u201d cyberattacks prior to and during the U.S. election. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Ed O'Keefe January 1 Follow @edatpost Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) boards an elevator after speaking to reporters at Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 17. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Democratic senators plan to aggressively target eight of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees in the coming weeks and are pushing to stretch their confirmation votes into March \u2014 an unprecedented break with Senate tradition. Such delays would upend Republican hopes of quickly holding hearings and confirming most of Trump\u2019s top picks on Inauguration Day. But Democrats, hamstrung by their minority status, are determined to slow-walk Trump\u2019s picks unless they start disclosing reams of personal financial data they\u2019ve withheld so far, according to senior aides. Despite early vows to cooperate with Trump and his new government, Democrats have been troubled by a lack of personal disclosure by Cabinet choices that they say mirrors Trump\u2019s refusal to disclose personal tax information during the presidential campaign. Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s pick to serve as secretary of state, angered Democrats when he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he stood ready to provide only \u201ctax return information\u201d for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means it\u2019s possible Tillerson isn\u2019t willing to provide complete tax returns \u2014 a break with past nominees. Other Trump nominees have just barely begun the process of undergoing required ethics reviews. President-elect Trump is nominating Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. The Washington Post's Anne Gearan explains what Tillerson brings to the table and why Congress could still reject him. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) A majority of Americans opposed Trump\u2019s refusal to disclose tax returns during the campaign, and Democrats believe they can revive the issue this year by casting congressional Republicans as supporting Trump\u2019s penchant for secrecy. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Trump of trying to seat a \u201crigged Cabinet\u201d of nominees who \u201chave made billions off the industries they\u2019d be tasked with regulating.\u201d \u201cAny attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist,\u201d Schumer added in a statement to The Washington Post confirming his caucus\u2019s plans. \u201cIf Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they\u2019re sorely mistaken.\u201d Schumer has told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that Democrats will home in especially on Tillerson; Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), his pick for attorney general; Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget; and Betsy DeVos, selected to serve as education secretary. There\u2019s also Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and oversee changes to Obamacare, who is expected to be attacked by Democrats for his support for privatizing Medicare. Andrew Puzder, a restaurant executive set to serve as labor secretary, will face scrutiny for past comments on the minimum wage, among other policies. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner set to serve as treasury secretary, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, will also be the focus of Democratic attacks, aides said. President-elect Donald Trump is nominating fast-food executive Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik,Danielle Kunitz,Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) Absent from the Democratic hit list are retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis, the pick for defense secretary; South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whom Trump has nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations; and John Kelly, a former Marine general and Trump\u2019s selection to lead the Department of Homeland Security, signaling that all three should expect little trouble from Democrats. Senate confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin next week, when the Judiciary Committee is set to hold two days of hearings with Sessions, and the Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a one-day, two-part hearing with Tillerson. But Schumer has told McConnell that he wants at least two days of hearings for each of these eight nominees, including at least one panel made up of witnesses that can speak to the pick\u2019s past record, aides said. At each hearing, members of the committee would get at least 10 minutes to ask questions, with no limits on multiple rounds of questioning, if requested. Democrats also want hearings for each of these eight nominees to be held on separate weeks, with no more than two Cabinet picks sitting for a hearing in the same week. That would mean that Tillerson\u2019s and Mattis\u2019s hearings could happen in the same week, but not the hearings for Price and Mulvaney, aides said. That\u2019s already not set to happen and Republicans have scoffed at Schumer\u2019s proposal, noting that the New York senator went along in 2009 when the Senate unanimously confirmed seven of President Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees on Inauguration Day and five more later that week. \u201cIt\u2019s curious that they\u2019d [Democrats] object to treating the incoming president\u2019s nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness with which the Senate acted on President Obama\u2019s nominees,\u201d Antonia Ferrier, a McConnell spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cOur committees and chairmen are fully capable of reviewing the incoming Cabinet nominations with the same rules and procedures as the same committees did with President Obama\u2019s nominations.\u201d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). (Gareth Smit for The Washington Post) The \u201cunprecedented\u201d personal wealth of Trump\u2019s nominees warrants the delays, one senior Democratic aide said. One other potential stumbling block: Nominees are required to obtain certification from the Office of Government Ethics before a confirmation vote, something most Obama-era picks had achieved before their confirmation hearings. So far, Democrats say, most Trump picks haven\u2019t done so. \u201cIf they want to get confirmed by Inauguration Day, that timeline doesn\u2019t work,\u201d the aide said. \u201cObviously if you\u2019re worth billions, it takes a lot longer.\u201d powerpost ",

    "text": "Democrats Extol Health Care Law in Bid to Derail GOP Repeal By richard lardner, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 2, 2017, 3:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Tom Price: Everything You Need to Know 0 Shares Email Senior House Democrats on Monday extolled the benefits of President Barack Obama's health care law in hopes of derailing Republican plans to gut the statute and over time replace it. In a conference call with reporters, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the GOP will begin its \"assault\" on the health care law when the 115th Congress convenes Tuesday. She said abolishing the law, known as the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans have promised will mean that people will pay more for their health insurance while getting much less than they do now. Undoing the law also will undermine Medicaid and Medicare, she said. Currently Republicans plan to vote quickly on repealing the health care law and delay the effective date to give them time to craft a replacement. Pelosi blasted that strategy as \"an act of cowardice.\" She urged people to \"take a second look\" at how the health care law has improved their lives. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said he believes that many people who voted for President-elect Donald Trump want the health care law preserved even though Trump made repeal of the statute a central part of his campaign. \"I think a lot of people are going to be looking at this and saying, 'Gee, I really didn't mean that,'\" Hoyer said. Republicans have opposed Obama's law since Democrats steered the law through Congress in 2010. The GOP has tried numerous times to repeal the law but failed due to internal divisions and Obama's veto power. But with the GOP in control of the House and Senate and Donald Trump set to become president in a few weeks, doing away with \"Obamacare\" is in sight for Republicans. GOP lawmakers are expected to spend the next several months working on legislation to cancel broad swaths of the law that the party's voter base staunchly opposes. Most likely to go are the law's mandate that people buy health insurance or face hefty IRS fines, and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. But several elements of the repeal likely wouldn't go into effect for two to four years. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey , the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Republicans are \"blind to the success\" of the health care law. Repealing the law is rooted in politics, he said, and will hurt middle class Americans. \"Repealing the Affordable Care Act is not logical; it's simply ideological,\" Pallone said. 0 Shares ",

The world\u2019s longest-reigning monarch has been out of public view since before Christmas. For all of 2016 Queen Elizabeth was going strong -- opening hospitals, welcoming Britain\u2019s new Prime Minister Theresa May, and starring in her own 90th birthday extravaganza. So when she didn\u2019t appear with the rest of the royal family for church on Christmas Day, it made news in the U.K. , said correspondent Elizabeth Palmer Three days before, a helicopter had flown the queen from Buckingham Palace to her home in the countryside -- a journey that in the past she\u2019s made by train. The reason: she had a cold, but it was bad enough that she, very unusually, missed church again on New Year\u2019s Day . The queen\u2019s daughter, Princess Anne, said last night that she was \u201cbetter.\u201d But loyal subjects across Britain won\u2019t relax until they see her, poised, calm, hatted and gloved, and back on duty.

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP The recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., is just one of several businesses that could pose a conflict of interest for President-elect Donald Trump as he prepares to take office. Evan Vucci/AP As Donald Trump prepares to become president, he's promising to explain how he'll deal with the many conflicts of interest posed by his businesses and charitable foundation, even as he insists they pose \"no big deal.\" But short of selling his properties and putting the proceeds in a blind trust, it's not clear that Trump can completely resolve the controversies over his many businesses. Trump's Businesses And Potential Conflicts: Sorting It Out \"There's a uniform consensus among everyone who does government ethics for a living ... those who are still in government and those who have left government, that Donald Trump must divest,\" says Norm Eisen, former ethics adviser to President Obama, and a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"He's got to sell his holdings, through using a blind trust or the equivalent of it, as every president has done for 40 years.\" Since his election, Trump has settled some outstanding legal disputes, including lawsuits over Trump University and unionization drives at hotels in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. Trump's efforts to put these issues behind him suggest he recognizes that he and his family face serious conflicts of interest, Eisen says. \"That being said, [Trump's actions] are not enough. They are baby steps, when what we need is a giant leap,\" Eisen says. Article continues after sponsorship Critics See Legal, Political Risks If Trump Keeps Ties To His Businesses Trump says he will hold a press conference soon to explain his plans for his extensive network of businesses, but hasn't said when it will take place. An earlier press conference to address the issue was canceled in December. His transition team cited the complexity of Trump's businesses and said he needed more time to decide what to do. But Trump himself suggested to reporters in Palm Beach last week that addressing the conflicts was a simple matter and said his businesses are \"no big deal.\" \"When I ran, people knew I have a very big business. So, I mean, they elected me at least partially for that reason. So I think that's going to work out very easily. It's actually a very simple situation,\" he said. One issue that Trump appears eager to put behind him involves his charity, the Trump Foundation. Trump has been accused of using money from the charity, most of which was donated by other people, to pay expenses related to his businesses. The foundation has acknowledged \"self-dealing\" on its tax returns, although it's unclear what specific violations took place. Trump announced on Christmas Eve that he would shutter the foundation, a move that makes sense, says former IRS official Philip Hackney, associate professor of law at Louisiana State University. U.S. Ethics Chief Was Behind Those Tweets About Trump, Records Show \"It begins to eliminate a minor conflict. I really think the Trump Organization is a much more significant conflict than the Trump Foundation was ever close to being,\" Hackney says. But the New York Attorney-General's office, which is investigating the charity, quickly scotched the idea of shutting it down prematurely. Closing the foundation too soon could complicate the investigation, Eisen says. \"We don't want any information to disappear into the ether when the charity closes. That's a particular problem for Donald Trump because he has a propensity for secrecy,\" he says. ",

    "text": "Email Last Updated Jan 2, 2017 4:52 PM EST RIO DE JANEIRO - Fighting among inmates touched off a riot at a prison in the northern state of Amazonas, leaving at least 56 dead, including several who were beheaded or dismembered in the worst bloodshed at a Brazilian prison since 1992. Authorities said the riot apparently grew out of a fight between two of the country\u2019s biggest crime gangs over control of prisons and drug routes in northern Brazil. Amazonas authorities initially reported 60 dead, but Monday afternoon the state public security secretary\u2019s office reduced that figure to 56. State public security secretary Sergio Fontes said some inmates escaped from the Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex in Manaus during the riot, but he did not say how many. He said 40 had been recaptured. There were 1,224 inmates in the prison, which was built to hold 592, Fontes said. The prison is run by a private company that is paid according to the number of inmates.\u00a0 Brazil\u2019s frequently overcrowded prisons\u00a0 occasionally see bloody riots featuring dismemberment . Twelve prison guards were held hostage by the inmates, though none was wounded during the riot that began Sunday afternoon and ended Monday morning. \u201cThis is the biggest prison massacre in our state\u2019s history,\u201d Fontes said at a news conference. \u201cWhat happened here is another chapter of the war that narcos are waging on this country and it shows that this problem cannot be tackled only by state governments.\u201d Fontes confirmed that many of the dead had been beheaded. Judge Luis Carlos Valois, who negotiated the end of the riot with inmates, said he saw many bodies that had been quartered. \u201cI never saw anything like that in my life. All those bodies, the blood,\u201d Valois wrote on Facebook.\u00a0 The BBC reports \u00a0the riot began when six headless bodies were tossed over the prison\u2019s walls. \u00a0 It was the largest death toll during a Brazilian prison riot since the killing of 111 inmates by police officers in the Carandiru penitentiary in Sao Paulo in 1992. Police said they acted in self-defense then. Two other prisons in Manaus also reported riots Monday. At one, 87 prisoners escaped, including an inmate who posted a picture of himself on Facebook as he left. Amazonas police were investigating whether there was a link between the violence at the three prisons. By evening, Amazonas state police said the situation was stable in all three prisons. Fontes said the inmates at Anisio Jobim made few demands to end the riot, saying that hinted at a killing spree organized by members of a local gang, the Family of the North, against those of the First Command of the Capital that is based in Sao Paulo. The secretary said officers found a hole in a prison wall through which weapons entered the building. A policeman was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with the inmates. Several firearms were found when police searched the prison after the riot. Jose Vicente da Silva, a former national public security secretary, said the incidents in Manaus were a result of Brazil\u2019s severe recession and poor management of the prison system. \u201cSince 2014 homicides in prisons of Amazonas are double the national average, and last year they cut their public security budget by 50 percent due to austerity measures. This incident is a repetition in a bigger scale,\u201d Da Silva told The Associated Press. \u201cEvery year 500 inmates die in Brazilian prisons. With the current economic crisis and the budget cuts, the gangs get even bolder.\u201d The First Command, nationally known as PCC, is the most powerful drug and prison gang in Brazil and it has been trying to extend its reach to northern prisons dominated by the Family of the North. To counter, Family of the North associated with the Red Commando of Rio de Janeiro, the second biggest crime gang in Brazil. Valois said that during the negotiations at Anisio Jobim, inmates asked only \u201cthat we did not transfer them, made sure they were not attacked and kept their visitation\u201d rights. The riot ended after the inmates freed the last of the 12 prison staffers they had held hostage, Valois said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Rasheem Green sacked Trace McSorley and\u00a0forced a fumble that Stevie Tu'ikolovatu recovered, however the call was overturned after a review. Yes, officials can somehow overturn a call when the ball was recovered at the bottom of a pile. Nevertheless, USC's defense held and Penn State punted. Jan. 2, 2017, 5:37 p.m. USC's Adoree' Jackson injured Lindsey Thiry This has gone from bad to worse for USC in the third quarter. Adoree' Jackson was injured on a kickoff return and was tended to by trainers on the field before they assisted him to the sideline. Deontay Burnett caught consecutive passes for eight and five yards before the Trojans' drive stalled.

Sam Darnold completed a 13-yard pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster for a USC touchdown and then Darnold completed a pass to Taylor McNamara for the two-point conversion. Penn State leads the Trojans, 42-35, with 6:47 remaining in the third quarter. The scoring drive covered 65 yards in 10 plays and took 3:39. USC's sideline appeared out of it, but now is jumping up and down - getting the Trojans' fans\u00a0back into the game. Seldom-used tailback Aca'Cedric Ware made the play of the drive, catching a short pass and turning it into a 20-yard gain on third down. Ronald Jones II rushed for 13 yards in three carries and Justin Davis rushed for 10 yards in two carries. Jan. 2, 2017, 4:59 p.m. Penn State leads USC, 42-27, in the third quarter Three plays in the third quarter for Penn State, three touchdowns in the third quarter for Penn State.

Then Trace McSorley rushed three yards for a touchdown Penn State leads USC, 42-27, with 10:26 to play in the third quarter. Darnold targeted\u00a0Smith-Schuster withe the pass that was intercepted. The ball bounced off Smith-Schuster's hands before the pick. What a wild turn of events in four and a half minutes. Jan. 2, 2017, 4:52 p.m. Penn State leads USC, 35-27, in the third quarter Unbelievable. Penn State has run two plays in the third quarter and has scored on both of them. Chris Godwin caught an unbelievable 72-yard pass for a touchdown over the top of Iman Marshall. How Godwin hauled in the throw, we might never know. Marshall, according to the radio broadcast, had been ruled out of the game because of vertigo, but was back on the field. Penn State leads USC, 35-27, with 11:27 remaining in the third quarter. Godwin has caught nine passes for 187 yards and two touchdowns. Jan. 2, 2017, 4:46 p.m. Penn State defense tightens up against USC James Franklin lost his mind - in excitement - over a pass breakup on third down. Sam Darnold's pass was intended for Deontay Burnett, but fell incomplete. USC is slowly starting to unravel, unable to move the ball on offense and now they have false started twice in the punt formation. Darnold attempted three passes, all three fell incomplete. Darreus Rogers was able to draw pass interference on a play, about the only\u00a0highlight of the Trojans' offense so far in the third quarter. USC injury update: Cornerback Iman Marshall has been ruled out of the game because of vertigo. Jan. 2, 2017, 4:37 p.m. Penn State leads USC, 28-27, in the third quarter Saquon Barkley is breaking ankles. Barkley broke six tackles as he ran 76 yards for a touchdown. It was incredible. Penn State leads USC, 28-27, with 13:05 remaining in the third quarter. The scoring drive - one play. All Barkley.

Jan. 2, 2017, 4:33 p.m. USC offense goes three-and-out to start second half Lindsey Thiry This is going to be a game in the second half. USC received the ball, but went three-and-out after Adoree' Jackson returned the kickoff 35 yards to the\u00a035-yard line. The Trojans also were called for a false start before Chris Tilbey punted. Jan. 2, 2017, 4:07 p.m. USC leads Penn State, 27-21, at halftime USC tried to get into position to kick a field goal with 46 seconds remaining in the half, but Matt Boermeester missed a 49-yard\u00a0attempt. USC leads Penn State, 27-21, at halftime. Boermeester also missed a 51-yard attempt on the Trojans' first possession. Jan. 2, 2017, 3:59 p.m. USC lead Penn State, 27-21, in the second quarter Lindsey Thiry This game has a little bit of everything, and a handful\u00a0of impressive touchdown receptions. Trace McSorley\u00a0completed an 11-yard pass to Mike Gesicki for a touchdown. Gesicki\u00a0left his feet to make the athletic grab and held on as he hit the turf. USC leads Penn State, 27-21, with 54 seconds remaining in the half. The scoring drive covered 75 yards in 13 plays and took 5:22. The Nittany Lions converted twice on third down when Chris Godwin caught a seven-yard and 10-yard pass. The Trojans were about to get them off the field on third-and-five at\u00a0their 24-yard line, but Stevie Tu'ikolovatu grabbed McSorley's facemask as he made a tackle. Jan. 2, 2017, 3:40 p.m. USC leads Penn State, 27-14, in the second quarter USC isn't settling for field goals any longer. The Trojans are getting into the end zone. Sam Darnold completed a three-yard pass to Darreus Rogers for a touchdown. USC leads Penn State, 27-14, with 6:16 remaining in the first half. The scoring drive covered 75 yards in six plays and took 2:23. The Trojans' receivers made great plays throughout the drive. Rogers caught an 11-yard pass. JuJu Smith-Schuster climbed to make a 36-yard reception and Adoree' Jackson caught a pass off his fingertips that he turned into a 24-yard gain -- if he could have made one more man miss he would have had a touchdown.

The nation\u2019s third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents in 2016 than it did in 2015, according to data released Sunday by the Chicago Police Department. New York, the nation\u2019s largest city, logged 334 homicides in 2016, according to the New York Daily News, while the country\u2019s second-largest city, Los Angeles, saw 294, reports the LA Times. Crisis in Chicago The Chicago statistics underline a story of bloodshed that has put the city at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The numbers are staggering, even for those who followed the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings and monthly death tolls that hadn\u2019t been seen in years. The increase in homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20 percent increase from the previous year. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference Sunday that Chicago is among many U.S. cities that have seen a spike in violence, including in attacks on police. Several of the top 10 largest U.S. cities saw a spike last year in homicides. San Antonio police say they investigated 151 homicides in 2016, marking the deadliest year in the Alamo city in more than two decades. The homicide count - up 61 percent from a year ago - is the highest since 142 homicides were reported in 1995. Last year, the tally was 94.\u00a0 In San Jose, 47 homicides were reported in 2016, a 25-year high, reports the San Jose Mercury News. San Diego and Dallas also saw upticks in murders last year, but year-end data wasn\u2019t immediately available. While New York City saw a slight decrease in homicides and Los Angeles a slight increase for 2016, both have hit historic lows in the past several years. Philadelphia, which has also seen a dip in murder rates overall, saw a small decrease for 2016. Johnson said anger at police, including in the wake of video released that showed a white Chicago officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, has left criminals \u201cemboldened\u201d to violent crimes. He also said it\u2019s becoming clearer to criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system. \u201cIn Chicago, we just don\u2019t have a deterrent to pick up a gun,\u201d he said. \u201cAny time a guy stealing a loaf of bread spends more time pre-trial in jail than a gun offender, something is wrong.\u201d Johnson, who has for months complained about Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, said he thinks more and more gang members are arming themselves because the price for being caught is small compared to other large cities. He said gang members he has spoken to consider the court system \u201ca joke.\u201d The bulk of the deaths and shooting incidents, which jumped from 2,426 in 2015 to 3,550 last year, occurred in only five of the city\u2019s 22 police districts on the city\u2019s South and West sides, all poor and predominantly black areas where gangs are most active. Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Police said the shootings in those areas generally weren\u2019t random, with more than 80 percent of the victims having previously been identified by police as more susceptible because of their gang ties or past arrests. The city has scrambled to address the violence. Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced last year that 1,000 officers would be added to the police department. At the same time, police officials have been trying to figure out why homicides and shootings - which began climbing the year before - suddenly surged. In a tweet, President-elect Donald Trump called the Chicago murder rate \u201crecord setting\u201d and said, \u201cIf Mayor can\u2019t do it he must ask for Federal help!\u201d Emanuel said in 2015 he welcomed federal help after the U.S. Justice Department announced a civil rights probe into the department.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 On Sunday, Johnson said he hoped several initiatives - including more street cameras in some of the city\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods, and the expansion of gunshot-detection systems - would lead to more arrests and drive down the violent crime rate. Johnson has said several factors have contributed to the increased violence. He noted 2016 was the first full year since the city was forced in November 2015 to release video of the fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald, the black 17-year-old boy who was shot 16 times by a white police officer. The video cost former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy his job, sparked major protests around the city, and led to federal and state investigations of the police department. It also left Johnson with the task of trying to restore public trust in what appeared to be a weakened police force, a perception that was only buttressed by a dramatic drop in the number of arrests in 2016. The police department has cited several factors for the declining numbers, including a concerted effort not to make minor drug arrests and focus on gun violence. Johnson pointed to gun arrests and gun seizures as evidence that his officers are aggressively fighting crime. Chicago's alarming gun violence But critics said they have no doubt that officers have become far more reluctant to do their jobs since the McDonald video was released and the officer who killed the teen was charged with murder. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a pull back so they (gangs) can kill each other sort of thing,\u201d said the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a prominent minister in one of Chicago\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods on the West Side. Johnson acknowledged in a recent interview with The Associated Press that officers have become more cautious - in part out of fear of becoming the next \u201cviral video.\u201d He also said a state law that took effect last January requiring officers to fill out lengthy contact cards when they stop someone has resulted in fewer stops, because the cards require more paperwork for officers and the cards are \u201cscrutinized\u201d by federal judges. He said those concerns are not lost on criminals. \u201cCriminals watch TV, pay attention to the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see an opportunity to commit nefarious activity.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

This map, generated about 5 p.m. on Jan. 1, 2017, shows the Brawley earthquake swarm that began on New Year's Eve. (U.S. Geological Survey) Rong-Gong Lin II Contact Reporter A swarm of more than 250 small earthquakes have struck since New Year\u2019s Eve near the California-Mexico border, causing\u00a0unease among residents and attention from scientists.\u00a0 The strongest earthquake in the sequence was magnitude 3.9, striking directly underneath the town of Brawley, about 170 miles southeast of Los Angeles.\u00a0 The earthquakes struck in the southern end of the Brawley Seismic Zone, a seismically active region where tectonic plates are moving away from each other\u00a0and the Earth\u2019s crust is getting stretched out\u00a0\u201cand basically adding land,\u201d said Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson. The Brawley Seismic Zone is particularly important to watch because it is the region that connects\u00a0the San Andreas and Imperial faults, both of which can produce damaging earthquakes. The seismic zone extends for about 30 miles from the city of Brawley, across the Salton Sea\u2019s southern half, and ends near Bombay Beach. The Brawley Seismic Zone, which stretches between Brawley to an area near Bombay Beach, is important to watch because it is a region that connects the San Andreas and Imperial faults, which can produce major earthquakes. Los Angeles Times The Brawley Seismic Zone, which stretches between Brawley to an area near Bombay Beach, is important to watch because it is a region that connects the San Andreas and Imperial faults, which can produce major earthquakes. The Brawley Seismic Zone, which stretches between Brawley to an area near Bombay Beach, is important to watch because it is a region that connects the San Andreas and Imperial faults, which can produce major earthquakes. (Los Angeles Times) Hauksson was closely monitoring the swarm that began Saturday, as there was a chance that an earthquake of magnitude 5 or larger could be triggered. \u201cThere\u2019s always reason to be concerned for a bigger earthquake,\u201d Hauksson said. But by Sunday night, the possibility of the swarm triggering a larger event had largely receded. The southern Brawley Seismic Zone is close in proximity to the Imperial fault. The Imperial fault has caused two major earthquakes in recent decades.\u00a0 Furrows in a plowed field were offset by 11 inches in this magnitude-6.5 earthquake in California's Imperial Valley in 1979.

Cavit / U.S. Geological Survey) In 1979, a magnitude-6.5 earthquake sent violent shaking into El Centro, injuring 91 and causing so much damage to the concrete Imperial County Services Building\u00a0that it had to be demolished. There was\u00a0major damage to the irrigation system in the Imperial Valley, a desert region that is a prolific producer of salad vegetables during the winter. Levees lining the All-American Canal, which funnels water from the Colorado River, collapsed along an eight-mile stretch.

(U.S. Geological Survey) The magnitude-7.1 earthquake that hit El Centro in 1940 claimed nine lives and swayed buildings as far away as Los Angeles.\u00a0Irrigation systems were damaged, and railroad tracks were left warped where they crossed the fault. Earthquake swarms that occur in the other end of the Brawley Seismic Zone \u2014 to the north \u2014 could trigger a major event on the San Andreas fault, one of California\u2019s most dangerous, that could send catastrophic shaking into Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties. In late September, one such swarm began in the northern Brawley Seismic Zone, with three measuring above magnitude 4. That event led the U.S. Geological Survey to warn that chances of a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake on the San Andreas fault had risen as a result of the swarm.\u00a0 Another swarm of small earthquakes, topping out at magnitude 3.5, struck the town of Niland near the eastern shore of the Salton Sea on Halloween. The last major earthquake to hit Brawley was in 2012 , registering\u00a0at magnitude 5.4. Brawley Mayor Sam Couchman said the earthquakes have placed the city of 26,000 on edge since Saturday afternoon. The combination of the earthquakes and New Year\u2019s pyrotechnics spooked some of the town\u2019s dogs,\u00a0who went\u00a0missing, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of listening to it, and when you can hear it coming, it\u2019ll rattle things,\u201d Couchman said. \u201cLast night, we had the rain, the earthquakes, and the fireworks. \u201cAll we needed were frogs and locusts.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

Parents James and Bethany Modisette are suing Apple for damages on the basis that the electronics giant failed to install and implement a \"safer, alternative design\" for FaceTime that would have helped to prevent a driver from using the app while traveling at highway speed, court documents show. The lawsuit filed Dec. 23 in California Superior Court in Santa Clara County also claims that Apple failed \"to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused\" or to instruct on its safe usage. The fatal accident occurred Christmas Eve in 2014 near Dallas, when, according to the lawsuit, the Modisette family was driving in a Toyota Camry, with daughter Moriah, 5, in a booster seat in the left rear passenger seat and her sister, Isabella, next to her in the right rear seat. The Modisettes had slowed or stopped their car due to police activity ahead of them on the highway that had caused traffic to back up, according to the suit. Another driver, Garrett Wilhelm, traveling in his Toyota 4Runner in the same direction and behind the Modisette car, allegedly had his attention diverted by his use of the FaceTime app, the suit says. \"As a result of that distraction, his Toyota 4Runner, while traveling at full highway speed (65 mph), struck the Modisette family car from behind, causing it to be propelled forward, rotate, and come to a final rest at an angle facing the wrong direction in the right lane of traffic,\" the suit says. Wilhelm's car then \"continued its trajectory by rolling up and over the driver's side of the Modisette car,\" the suit claims. The crash caused extensive damage to the driver's side of the Modisettes' car, and rescue workers had to extract both the father and 5-year-old Moriah from the car, the suit says. The father was in critical condition after the crash while the mother and daughter Isabella were taken to a regional medical center to be treated for injuries. Moriah was airlifted to the area children's hospital where she later died from her injuries, according to the suit. \"Wilhelm told police at the scene that he was using FaceTime on his iPhone at the time of the crash, and the police located his iPhone at the crash scene with the FaceTime application still active,\" the suit claims. The Modisettes contend in their suit that, \"At the time of the collision in question, the iPhone utilized by Wilhelm contained the necessary hardware (to be configured with software) to automatically disable or 'lock-out' the ability to use [FaceTime] ... However, Apple failed to configure the iPhone to automatically \u2018lock-out\u2019 the ability to utilize \u2018FaceTime\u2019 while driving at highway speeds, despite having the technical capability to do so.\u201d Wilhelm was indicted on manslaughter charges by a grand jury in Denton County, Texas, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle . He has been out of jail on bail since August, and a jury trial in the case is scheduled for Feb. 27, the Record-Chronicle reports. Wilhelm\u2019s lawyer, Ricky Perritt, issued the follow statement: \"The Wilhelm family offers their thoughts and prayers for the family of the young lady who lost her life in this tragic accident. We are confident that after all the facts are brought out in Court, it will be shown that the use of a cellular device did not contribute and Mr. Wilhelm did not commit a crime ... it was simply an accident.\" ABC News reached out to Apple but did not receive a comment on the case. 0 Shares ",
