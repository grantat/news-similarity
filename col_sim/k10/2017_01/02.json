John Sellinger, 34, of Tampa, went into \"distress\" after being detained Wednesday by deputies who sprayed him with pepper spray and shocked him with a stun gun twice, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. Sellinger died Thursday at a hospital. Autopsy results are pending. The Tampa Bay Times reported ( http://bit.ly/2iASeek ) that Sellinger was reported missing by his wife Wednesday. The sheriff's office said Sellinger then was the subject of multiple 911 calls about a reckless driver and attempts to steal a car and a motorcycle. Sellinger tried to steal the motorcycle from a 70-year-old man and was trying to choke him before bystanders intervened, authorities said. Sheriff's officials said that when deputies caught up to Sellinger, he refused to follow their commands and tried to fight them. Officials said Sellinger continued to struggle with deputies after being sprayed with pepper spray and shocked twice with the stun gun. According to the sheriff's office, Sellinger went into \"distress\" before medical assistance could arrive at the scene. Deputies attempted to revive him before paramedics took him to a hospital. The Tampa Bay Times reported that Sellinger's wife and mother declined to comment Friday. Sellinger's wife, Laura, also an Air Force veteran, posted a message Thursday to the social networking website LinkedIn that her husband had not been suicidal. Sellinger's neighbors said he had been a doting husband who was often seen pushing his 18-month-old son in a baby stroller or walking a dog. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Fla.), http://www.tampabay.com. 0 Shares ",

Time Relatives and friends mourn at the coffin during the funeral of Ayhan Arik, one of the 39 victims of the gun attack on the Reina, a popular night club in Istanbul on Jan. 1, 2017. (Photo: Sedat Suna, epa) Authorities in Turkey searched Sunday\u00a0for a gunman who opened fire at a packed Istanbul nightclub during New Year's celebrations, killing at least 39 people, most of them foreigners, and injuring 69. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned \u201cthe terror attack in Istanbul\u2019s Ortakoy neighborhood in the first hours of 2017\u201d and offered condolences for those who died, including \u201cforeign guests.\u201d Nearly two-thirds of those killed \u2014\u00a024 victims \u2014\u00a0were from other countries, Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency reported. Many were from the Middle East, including Jordan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, although countries from India to Belgium reported their citizens among the casualties, the Associated Press reported. No word yet on any American victims. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the\u00a0suspect has not been identified and remains at large. He described\u00a0the attack as a \u201cmassacre, a truly inhumane savagery.\u201d \u201cOur security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing, he will be caught in a short period of time,\u201d Soylu said. Turkey nightclub massacre: What we know now More than 500 people were inside the Reina club when the attack began about 1:15 a.m. local time. A\u00a0closed-circuit television recording of the attack showed the assailant wearing\u00a0a Santa Claus hat part of the time, according to the AP, which obtained the recording from the\u00a0Haberturk newspaper. The video\u00a0shows the attacker dressed in black and carrying a backpack as he shoots a police officer outside the club. Earlier news reports said the gunman wore a\u00a0Santa Claus outfit, but Prime Minister Binali Yildirim disputed that Sunday. \u201cHe is an armed terrorist as we know it.\u201d The attacker left a gun inside the club and escaped by \u201ctaking advantage of the chaos\u201d that ensued, Yildrim said. Turkish special force police officers and ambulances are on the nightclub attack scene, Sunday. \u00a0(Photo: Yasin Akgul, AFP/Getty Images) No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which Turkish authorities said was carried out by a lone assailant. This is the fourth major attack in Turkey in the past month, including the Dec. 19 assassination of the Russian\u00a0ambassador to Turkey during a photo exhibition in Ankara. Erdogan said his\u00a0country is \"extremely determined to do whatever it takes\" after recent terror attacks to secure the region. Turkey is a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. The\u00a0bloodiest attacks that Turkey endured in 2016 were the work of the Islamic State or Kurdish militants. Relatives mourn at the coffin during the funeral of Ayhan Arik, one of the victims. \u00a0(Photo: Sedat Suna, epa) Reina owner Mehmet Kocarslan\u00a0told the private Dogan news agency\u00a0that police had boosted security measures in the upscale neighborhood and its vicinity. The efforts included a 24-hour police presence and complementary efforts by the coast guard at sea. \u201cDespite all these precautions by police forces, unfortunately this painful event took place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at the point where all words end.\u201d State-run Anadolu news agency reported Sunday that a police officer, Burak Yildiz, 22, was shot and killed outside the nightclub. A female security guard, Hatice Karcilar, 29, was also among those killed, according to Anadolu. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Bears chairman George McCaskey, right, greets NFL commissioner Roger Goodell during the NFL PLAY 60 Clinic on Wednesday, April 27, 2016 at Grant Park in Chicago. (Anthony Souffle / Chicago Tribune) Two years later, the Bears will end another miserable season on the road against the Vikings. Everything is different yet nothing has changed since the last time that happened. During the 2014 finale at TCF Bank Stadium, four men in navy blazers guarded the door to the visiting owner's suite like the only snow blower in Minnesota was on the other side. Sunday back in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium, the McCaskeys should welcome guests to watch their team try to avoid becoming historically bad. At this point, the family's misery needs company, not privacy. Nobody believes in the Bears anymore. Worse, almost everybody in town still paying attention on Sundays doubts the ability of the McCaskey family to find solutions to familiar problems. The last Bears game of 2016 falling on the first day of 2017 offers an opportunity to start approaching things differently in the new year, beginning with introspection that often precedes transparency. What is the Bears' plan again? Does anybody in Chicago remember? Or care anymore? Bears ' season finale Sunday against the Vikings is confined to whether they can avoid the worst 16-game record in franchise history and where they land in the 2017 draft order. After that final three-hour diversion, though, all eyes will turn to the top of the organization... Whatever intrigue surrounds the Bears ' season finale Sunday against the Vikings is confined to whether they can avoid the worst 16-game record in franchise history and where they land in the 2017 draft order. After that final three-hour diversion, though, all eyes will turn to the top of the organization... (Rich Campbell) Ownership needs to give fans reasons to care like they once did. Do or say something that inspires more optimism than skepticism. Turn football season back into something more than an entertainment bridge between the Cubs' playoffs and Blackhawks' push to the postseason. Chairman George McCaskey needs to explain how, as a former ticket manager, he feels about an epidemic of apathy resulting in a troubling number of no-shows at Soldier Field \u2014 only 5,000 fans stayed for the final minute of the last home game. McCaskey needs to articulate how the Bears will strike the balance between holding people accountable \u2014 changing offensive coordinators? \u2014 and preserving continuity by giving inexperienced general manager Ryan Pace and unlikable coach John Fox one more playoffs-or-bust year. Opting to wait until after the season to answer questions, McCaskey needs to address the rumors the Bears considered hiring either a football consultant or a real football guy as team president. While McCaskey is at it, he also can clarify whatever role his 93-year-old mother, Virginia, still plays in the evaluation of personnel and planning for the future. It's a fair question, and so is this: Has the disconnect between the Bears and Chicago ever been greater? The relationship is impossible to measure but just as hard to ignore. Halas Hall Pass: Vic Fangio's future with the Bears Tribune writers Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell discuss defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's future with the Bears. Tribune writers Dan Wiederer and Rich Campbell discuss defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's future with the Bears. See more videos The Bears had at least 21,000 empty seats at kickoff for the home finale. They have lost more games since 2014 than any other team in the NFC (33) and stand one loss away from the team's worst record since the NFL expanded to a 16-game season in 1978. They now have gone six straight seasons without making the playoffs. Their Super Bowl XLI appearance seems so long ago that the highlight of Devin Hester returning the opening kickoff for a touchdown should be in black-and-white. Sadly, they have become NFL doormats and local afterthoughts. Forbes estimated the Bears' worth at $2.7 billion with $385 million in annual revenue, making them the NFL's eighth-most valuable franchise. Imagine if they actually were good. Alarmingly, since taking over as chairman in 2011, McCaskey has presided over four different general manager-coach combinations. So far McCaskey's signature moves have been firing the last general manager to assemble a Super Bowl roster and the last head coach to win 10 games. Of all the people put on notice after another dismal season, perhaps the name at the top of the list should be the first one on the organizational flow chart. ",

SLOTNIK and JONATHAN WOLFE JAN. 1, 2017 \u2022 After taking nearly a century to build , the Second Avenue subway extension in Manhattan opened on Sunday \u2014 with excitement and complaints. \u2022 Three new stations opened at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets. \u2022 The route is an extension of the Q line , which now runs from the Upper East Side in Manhattan to Coney Island in Brooklyn. Continue reading the main story Photo The 96th Street station is one of three new stations on the Q line extension. The other two are at 72nd and 86th Streets. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times \u2018I\u2019m Not Driving the Train,\u2019 Cuomo Says Shortly before noon on Sunday, a flood of New Yorkers streamed into the new 96th Street station, swiping their MetroCards and boarding the first Second Avenue subway train leaving the station. As the train pulled out, subway riders clapped and cheered. Then Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s voice came over the loudspeaker, welcoming passengers to the historic ride. Advertisement Sitting on the train with his two sons, Ian Pinto, 50, who lives on the Upper East Side, said they planned to visit all of the stations on Sunday. \u201cIn our lifetime, this is such a great event,\u201d he said. Photo Train enthusiasts of all ages came out for the opening of the Second Avenue line. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times It\u2019s Been a Long Time Coming Joe Caronetti, 68, of the Norwood neighborhood in the Bronx, had been waiting for the train since 10:15 a.m. on Sunday. \u201cNot counting the 68 years prior,\u201d he added. Mr. Caronetti, a retired banker, said it was the sixth time he had been on hand for the opening of a new train, having also gone on inaugural rides in Los Angeles and New Jersey. \u201cI\u2019m just a train buff,\u201d he said, wearing an M.T.A. cap he had gotten on Friday. Another train enthusiast at the station, Marvin Loja Espinoza, 17, a senior at Aviation High School, was waiting to get on the first train leaving there. Originally from Ecuador, he discovered his love for trains when he moved to the United States in 2005. His hometown had no trains, he said. Struggling to make friends in a new place, he spent his lunches in the library studying train maps, he said. His knowledge of the subway lines is so extensive that his friends call him \u201cM.T.A. Savage.\u201d Ian Ma, 15, said that when he was a child, he would run his toy trains back and forth across the floor of the family\u2019s home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Sunday, he couldn\u2019t stop grinning as he snapped photographs at the new station at 72nd Street. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a big train guy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for this train my whole life.\u201d Pete Cerwin, 51, has lived at 72nd Street and Second Avenue for 20 years. For him, it has been \u201ctwo decades of false starts, letdowns and construction.\u201d Mr. Cerwin, who works at a hedge fund, and his wife, Michele, 49, a management consultant, have seen favorite restaurants and shops open and close over the years, as the neighborhood struggled with the noise, dirt, detours and traffic that the Second Avenue subway extension brought to the rather unexciting section of the Upper East Side. So the two were relieved to see the escalators and the trains start rolling at the nearby station. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d live to see the day,\u201d Ms. Cerwin said. \u201cOur kids have no excuse to take a cab ever again.\u201d Photo Kitty Benton, center, is the great-granddaughter of William Benton Parsons, the chief engineer of the Interborough Rapid Transit, New York\u2019s first subway. Credit Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times A Link to New York\u2019s First Subway When she descended the escalators at 86th Street on Sunday afternoon, Kitty Benton, 81, dressed in a long dark coat and thickly framed glasses, blended in with hundreds of other subway riders who visited the station on its opening day. But Ms. Benton is subway royalty. In her black tote bag she carried a photo of her great-grandfather, William Benton Parsons, the chief engineer of the Interborough Rapid Transit, New York\u2019s first subway. Ms. Benton, who lives on the Upper East Side, beamed as she strolled through the new station. \u201cMy great-grandfather wanted the subway to be attractive,\u201d said Ms. Benton as she pointed out design elements, like the handrails on the stairs, and the mosaics by Chuck Close. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here.\u201d She surveyed the station with her daughters, Louisa Barclay Benton, 52, Emily Morgan, 54, and her grandsons, Gus Morgan, 14, and Nick Morgan, 12, and chatted about her great-grandfather and his exacting work ethic. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe would be very proud,\u201d she said. A New York Times article from Oct. 27, 1904, described Mr. Parsons as one who would weigh the opinions of those who worked for him, \u201cbut having made up his mind what to do and how it should be done, he is as inflexible as one of his own steel columns.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost teary eyed,\u201d she said, as other riders buzzed with excitement around her. \u201cMy great-grandfather\u2019s vision has been vindicated.\u201d Photo For subway conductors, it was another day at work. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times Preparing for an Opening... M.T.A. workers spent much of their time on Sunday shooing people away from the yellow line at the edge of the subway platform as trains approached and people clamored for a look or a photograph. \u201cI guess they just want a little piece of history,\u201d said Matthew Brace, 50, a platform controller who has worked for the M.T.A. for 28 years. He volunteered to work overtime on Sunday, the second time he had witnessed the opening of a new station. He was also at the opening of the Hudson Yards station on the Far West Side of Manhattan in 2015. Mr. Brace said he planned to retire in four years and seven months. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see another opening in that time,\u201d he said. A big part of the job on an opening day, Mr. Brace said, is managing expectations. \u201cYou have train buffs anxious to get a seat on the first train, to get trinkets from the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re worrying about that and asking those questions. But our main job is getting people on and off the trains safely.\u201d ...And Then the Complaints. It was only a matter of minutes before passengers began to complain on social media about the new Second Avenue line. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Emily Ngo, a politics reporter for Newsday, wrote on Twitter that her Q train was delayed at the 63rd Street station, the last stop before the new extension starts, because of signal trouble. She said riders were amused by the delay. (A train with mechanical problems at a station in Lower Manhattan had caused delays on the Q line in both directions.) I&#39;m on the 2nd Ave subway. It&#39;s stopped at Lex-63 station. Conductor says train is &quot;experiencing some signal problems.&quot; Riders laugh ... \u2014         Emily Ngo (@epngo) Jan. 1, 2017 Others vented that the recorded announcements about upcoming stations were not accurate. Demetrios Costoyiannis, 33, who lives on the Upper East Side, said that despite an erroneous station announcement, his train had reached the right destination. Despite the robot voice insisting otherwise, arrived at 96/2. #SecondAvenueSubway \u2014         Demetrios (@dcostoy) Jan. 1, 2017 The new stations were pristine on Sunday morning, but a rider noted that litter appeared quickly in a car. Ted Berg, 35, a sportswriter who lives on the Upper East Side near the 86th Street stop, wrote on Twitter that \u201cpeople have already strewn garbage about\u201d shortly after service to the new stations started at noon.

Agins/The New York Times A Broken Elevator Dampens Excitement Shortly after 2 p.m., an elevator at the 86th Street station stopped working, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. A small line of people in wheelchairs and baby carriages formed outside of the elevator above ground. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,\u201d said the younger Ms. Tallmer next to her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who was in a wheelchair. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s almost ready for us.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. They left after a few minutes. \u201cIt was a valiant effort,\u201d a stroller-pushing father said. Dave Officer, 39, a business developer who lives on the Upper East Side, had planned to see the subway with his wife and 6-month old daughter. \u201cAnother day,\u201d he said. Let\u2019s Talk About the Bathrooms The new bathrooms on the upper level of the 86th Street station were quickly put to use. Well, bathroom. The women\u2019s restroom was locked, and an M.T.A. employee had to find the key. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The reviews for the men\u2019s restroom, however, were largely positive. \u201cIt smells fresh and clean,\u201d said Jonathan Senker, 35, who had come from Philadelphia to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve and ride the subway. And \u201cthe soap and water work,\u201d said Helen Rodgers, 46, from Jamaica, Queens, who had to use the men\u2019s restroom. Not everyone would venture inside. \u201cBad things can happen behind closed doors,\u201d said David Usiak, 29, who lives on the Upper East Side. Inside the single toilet stall, a handwritten note taped to the wall read, \u201cToilet seat must be down for toilet to flush.\u201d A Jazz Musician and His Celebrity Status George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, can usually travel through the city with little fuss or fanfare. On Sunday afternoon, however, he was surrounded by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. There was good reason for Mr. Braith\u2019s newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic at the 72nd Street station. E. 125th St. The M.T.A. plans to extend the line to E. 125th St., but that proposed addition is many years away. E. 116th St. OCT. 24, 2016 By The New York Times \u201cWould you look at that guy,\u201d said Mr. Braith, 77, as dozens of onlookers snapped photos. \u201cPretty handsome fellow if you ask me.\u201d In his mosaic, Mr. Braith, clad in a slick red blazer, is carrying his signature \u201cBraithophone,\u201d an alto and soprano saxophone mended together. Unsheathing the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. \u201cAre you famous?\u201d a passer-by asked. \u201cIn the jazz world,\u201d Mr. Braith responded. The man shook his head and said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re immortalized as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Braith, of Staten Island, rarely rides the subway, but said he would be sure to visit the 72nd Street stop more often now. \u201cI think it\u2019s the greatest station in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got me on the wall!\u201d Modern Stations for the 21st Century. And No Rats Yet. Visitors arriving at the line\u2019s three new stations will find a very different \u2014 and far more pleasant \u2014 atmosphere than they do in most of the rest of the subway system. For one thing, because the stations are new, they are clean. Enjoy that while you can. There are shiny escalators and elevators. There are no crumbling tiles or unlit corners. And, perhaps best of all, there are no rats to be seen, though they are expected to appear once careless subway riders start dropping bagel crumbs on the floor. The stations are also built deeper underground than much of the existing system, evoking the feel of Washington\u2019s subway, with long (and sometimes disorienting) escalator banks. While many of the city\u2019s subway stations have vertical columns, these have an open, arched design that is column free. \u201cThis is not your grandfather\u2019s subway station,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at the New Year\u2019s Eve party. And, with works by celebrated artists mounted on the walls, the three stations could almost be art galleries . But at least one thing will be familiar: The trains will be subject to the regular delays and annoyances \u2014 like sick passengers and manspreaders \u2014 that already plague your commute.

Dozens of visitors were in front of the 12 large mosaics by Chuck Close , taking photographs, identifying the people in the portraits and discussing the work.

It\u2019s so moving.\u201d Adam Cohen, 29, a financial analyst from Long Island City in Queens, was patiently waiting for other visitors to move aside so he could take a photo of a large portrait of one of Mr. Close\u2019s subjects, Sienna Shields. For him, it was a tactile experience. \u201cI\u2019ve seen his work in museums,\u201d he said of the artist, \u201cbut this is different: You can get right in and touch it.\u201d Nearby, Adrianna Mu\u00f1et\u00f3n, 47, a law clerk from Briarwood, Queens, was doing just that. She ran her fingers over the beard of Mr. Close\u2019s self-portrait. \u201cIt is the most unbelievable experience,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at no cost.\u201d Several blocks south at the 72nd Street station, Sumana Harihareswara, a consultant from Astoria, Queens, was walking through the new station when she came across a mosaic that stopped her. There, in gleaming tiles on the wall before her, was a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was instantly overcome with emotion.

Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast, said she was struck by the diversity of the subjects depicted in the mosaics throughout the new stations, which also showcase a mural of a gay couple holding hands.

By EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS and DAPHNE RUSTOW on Publish Date January 1, 2017. Photo by Benjamin Norman for The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed A New Year\u2019s Eve Subway Ride to Remember Shortly after 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, a group of elected leaders and transit officials climbed on board a train at the new 72nd Street station for a memorable trip uptown and into the history books. \u201cWelcome on the first ride of the Second Avenue subway to 86th Street,\u201d Thomas F. Prendergast, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said over the loudspeaker. Cheers erupted. The New Year\u2019s Eve soiree and inaugural ride was an exclusive event deep underground ending with a merry countdown to midnight. There was the chairman-led tour to new stations at 86th Street and 96th Street, music by a rollicking jazz band and an array of snacks and local beers. Subway officials and their guests, dressed in bow ties and sequined dresses, toasted the hard work it took to build the huge subway tunnel below Manhattan. Nearing midnight at the 72nd Street station, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who effectively controls the authority, took the stage, telling the crowd of hundreds that the opening proved that government could do big things. He and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, had briefly greeted each other earlier in the night, despite their frosty relationship, though the mayor did not speak at the event. Charlie Feliciano, the conductor on the inaugural ride, said he had volunteered to work on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cIt was a lifetime experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it!\u201d Photo Workers dismantling a section of the elevated subway line along Third Avenue in Manhattan in 1955. The Upper East Side has had to make do with only the overflowing Lexington Avenue line in the years since. Credit Sam Falk/The New York Times The Tortured History of the Second Avenue Subway It is a story that stretches over 96 years , but we will try to keep it brief. The idea for a subway line along Second Avenue was first proposed in the 1920s but faced a series of obstacles that delayed it : the Great Depression , the city\u2019s financial crisis in the 1970s and broken promises when money that might have gone toward the project was spent elsewhere instead. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The elevated train lines that served the Upper East Side were taken down in the 1940s and 1950s, leaving the neighborhood with only one subway route: the overflowing Lexington Avenue line that was a long walk away for many people. \u201cIn many ways, the Upper East Side has kind of suffered with density without the infrastructure,\u201d said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association. \u201cThis is trying to right a historic mistake.\u201d Finally, in the 1990s, the plans were revived, though subway officials decided to start with a smaller segment of the line, from 63rd Street to 96th Street. Construction began in 2007, to the dismay of some businesses and residents who endured shaking, clanging and dust as the work proceeded. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority faced doubts about whether it would meet a deadline to open in December 2016. Under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s prodding, though, workers were able to complete the required testing so that the line could be opened for an inaugural ride on New Year\u2019s Eve and to the public on Sunday. Photo A new subway map including the extension of the Q line. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times What\u2019s Next for the Second Avenue Subway? Some longtime New Yorkers may look at a map of the new line and wonder: Is that it? The city once imagined the Second Avenue subway running nearly the length of Manhattan, and possibly even into the Bronx. But officials scaled back their ambitions, choosing to build in phases, with the first one serving the Upper East Side neighborhood known as Yorkville. Many in the area are excited about the opening, but are also concerned about the prospect of rising rents forcing out residents and businesses. The next phase calls for the transportation authority to extend the line uptown to 125th Street in East Harlem. But that leg of the project, which could cost up to $6 billion, is still in the early planning stages and may not open for another decade. And leaders in East Harlem have already had to fight to restore funding for the segment after it was removed from the authority\u2019s capital budget in 2015. Officials have said that they eventually want to extend the line south to Houston Street and then to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan for a total length of 8.5 miles. Given how long it took to build the first segment, it may be wise to tell your grandchildren not to hold their breath. While some have criticized the line as puny, Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders\u2019 advocacy group, said it was an important start. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of what could be a glorious line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has tremendous potential.\u201d Correction: January 1, 2017 An earlier version of a photo credit with the 1955 picture of the elevated subway line along Third Avenue misspelled the photographer\u2019s surname. It is Falk, not Flak. ",

Time_Sports SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 San Francisco 49ers general manager Trent Baalke says he has been fired by the team. Baalke confirmed the news on Sunday during his pregame interview with the team's flagship radio station KNBR. The 49ers had no comment on Baalke's announcement before the team's season finale against Seattle. Baalke helped build the roster that made three straight trips to the NFC title game from 2011-13 and one Super Bowl appearance. But the team has had declining win totals the past three seasons, including a record 13-game losing streak this year. \"It didn't surprise me,\" Baalke told the radio station. \"We've done some awful good things. Some very successful seasons. Unfortunately regret we weren't able to bring a championship to the Bay Area, which they so deserve. I think the faithful has been great. Wish this organization nothing, but the best moving forward. I do see a bright future for them.\" Baalke said he attended the season finale despite being fired out of respect to the organization since 2005. ESPN reported Saturday night that both Baalke and coach Chip Kelly are expected to be fired after the season. San Francisco (2-13) can tie the franchise record for losses in a season by losing to the Seahawks on Sunday. The 49ers struggled after cutting ties with Jim Harbaugh following the 2014 season. The team went 5-11 last season and fired Jim Tomsula and now appear to be moving on from Kelly as well, which would mark the first time in nearly four decades that a team fired coaches in successive years after just one-year tenures. The only other time that happened since the 1970 merger came when San Francisco fired Monte Clark after the 1976 season and Ken Meyer the following year. The Niners then fired Pete McCulley midway through the 1978 season and interim coach Fred O'Connor after the year before hiring Bill Walsh to start a dynasty that featured five Super Bowl titles. Baalke had a dramatic fall after getting credit for helping build the roster that was one of the NFL's best from 2011-13. But a string of poor drafts, a power struggle with Harbaugh and three straight years of declining win totals led to his ouster. Baalke originally joined the Niners as a scout in 2005 and quickly worked his way up to director of player personnel where he helped then-general manager Scot McCloughan put together many of the pieces of the team that would be one of the most talented in the league. Baalke replaced McCloughan as the top front office executive shortly before the 2010 draft and came away from that with a load of talent led by Anthony Davis, Mike Iupati and NaVorro Bowman. Baalke was given the title of general manager the following year when the Niners hired Harbaugh as coach and Baalke had another successful draft that featured All-Pro pass rusher Aldon Smith and quarterback Colin Kaepernick with his first two picks. The talent well went dry after that. Despite having 51 picks since 2012, Baalke has not added an impact player in any of those five drafts. Top two picks in 2012 A.J. Jenkins and LaMichael James barely played for the 49ers; 2013 first-round safety Eric Reid is a solid starter and second-round tight end Vance McDonald has contributed; running back Carlos Hyde, cornerback Jimmie Ward and Lynch are the only starters from the 2014 draft; and no one from the 2015 draft class has shined as of yet. Baalke has made a habit of drafting injured players in hopes that a year off to get healthy will turn those players into high-value picks. That strategy has not worked as only two of the seven players he drafted the past four years coming off significant knee injuries have even played a game in the NFL this season. Perhaps the biggest issue with Baalke's drafting is hesitancy to take skill position players. Since missing badly with first and second-round picks on Jenkins and James in 2012, Baalke has had 15 picks in the first three rounds and used just one \u2014 Hyde \u2014 on a quarterback, receiver or running back. ___ 47 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "(Garrett Therolf) On April 26, Arturo Miranda Martinez, the security guard at the county employment office, called 911 to report that Gabriel was bruised and burned all over his face and head. Deputy Robin Soukup screamed at Martinez that a burned child was not an emergency, the prosecutor wrote in his motion. At Gabriel\u2019s\u00a0home, Deputy Jonathon Livingston spoke to Aguirre, saw Gabriel and then wrote an entry in his computer log, according to court records. Gabriel had fallen off a bicycle, and there was no evidence of child abuse, the deputy wrote. Livingston\u2019s log entry made no mention of examining the child for physical injuries, O\u2019Quinn, the homicide detective, told the grand jury.\u00a0Like the other deputies who visited Gabriel\u2019s home, Livingston did not file a police report that would\u00a0have prompted further investigation. In his motion seeking the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s investigative records, the prosecutor\u00a0slammed the deputies\u2019 response. \u201cIt is unclear why a child being burned all over his body is not an emergency,\u201d Hatami\u00a0wrote. \u201cIt is unclear why a police report was not filed and if the security guard was interviewed by Deputy Livingston.\u201d New deputies are trained in the Sheriff\u2019s Academy to \u201cbe suspicious\u201d and to square the family\u2019s story with the injuries on the child, said Scott, the retired sheriff\u2019s sergeant. That training is carried over into the field, said Sgt. Marvin Jaramilla of the Special Victims Bureau. \u201cWe conduct a thorough investigation. We do not take the parent\u2019s statement at face value,\u201d Jaramilla said. The county blue ribbon commission saw room for improvement and recommended better training for law enforcement officers, including yearly refresher courses. ** A few days after the encounter with the security guard, Gabriel returned to school. In photos from a Mother\u2019s Day project that were shown to the grand jury, his skin was peeling off his forehead, and he had a black eye in the healing stages, along with a bruise-like mark on his neck. One eye was completely bloodshot, prompting his classmates to say he looked evil, his teacher testified. It is unclear whether the injuries were the same ones the security guard observed or whether the boy had suffered more abuse in the intervening days. It is unclear why a child being burned all over his body is not an emergency. \u2014 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Hatami Garcia called a social worker to report the latest signs, noting that Gabriel\u2019s story about falling off a dirt bike\u00a0did not seem believable, according to her grand jury testimony. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to go along with the injuries that he had and that he looked really bad,\u201d she recalled saying to the social worker. In May, Gabriel was absent from school for several days. Worried school officials assigned Jason Lee Lasley, a sheriff\u2019s deputy who worked at the school, to check on the boy and see if he was being abused. Lasley tried and failed to find the boy\u2019s house \u2014 he had the wrong address. He told the grand jury that when he spoke to Pearl Fernandez on the phone on May 16, she said the boy had moved to Texas to live with his grandmother. He tried to get a better address from Gabriel\u2019s school, then appears to have ended his investigation. He did not write a police report, he testified. On May 22, 2013, sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a call from Gabriel\u2019s mother and found that the boy was not breathing. Pearl claimed he had fallen while playing with his siblings and that the bruises on his body were self-inflicted. She said the missing skin on his neck came from vigorous scrubbing with a washcloth. The county medical examiner who performed Gabriel\u2019s autopsy said to the grand jury that\u00a0he had never seen so many skin injuries on a child. The boy\u2019s skull was fractured, his ribs were fractured and he had BB pellets in his chest and pelvic region. A burn above his groin penetrated all the way through the skin into the soft tissue. Back at Gabriel\u2019s school, his teacher was hoping he had really moved to Texas. In her gut, she knew it wasn\u2019t true, she told the grand jury. When the principal called her into a meeting with a district official she had never met, she thought maybe she was in trouble. As the principal opened his mouth to speak, his face turned white. She knew. \u201cIs it Gabriel?\u201d she asked. Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016. Hello, 2017 The end of 2016 will be a wet one \u00a0in L.A.

The Center Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats, an analytical section of the Interior Ministry, plans to rebut disinformation that could be spread with the aim of manipulating elections by what the counter-intelligence community believes are Russian-backed websites. Czechs will likely pick their lawmakers in October. The presidential election is coming up in early 2018. President Milos Zeman, known for his pro-Russian stance, likened the ministry's efforts to censorship in his annual Christmas speech. But the Interior Ministry says that its new section has neither \"a button to turn off the internet\" nor the right to remove content from the cyberspace. Zeman, 72, has yet to announce whether he plans to run for re-election. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Today, these words read more like an epitaph than a commemoration. On Dec. 22, the bank agreed to pay $7.2 billion to settle a claim with the Justice Department that it pushed toxic mortgages on investors in the years leading up to the American housing bust. The fine was one of the last \u2014 and among the stiffest \u2014 penalties imposed upon global investment banks by the Obama administration for their role in the financial crisis. And it was also a fitting coda to a turbulent 21-year run by the trading and banking unit at Deutsche that was inspired by three derivative specialists who had been poached from Wall Street years earlier. In addition to Mr. Jain, they included Edson Mitchell, a charismatic builder of businesses at Merrill Lynch who, in 1995, was given a mandate by Deutsche to create a world-class investment bank in London and spare no expense in doing so. Photo Edson Mitchell, who was given a mandate by Deutsche to create a world-class investment bank in London. Credit Via Deutsche Bank Mr. Mitchell recruited two colleagues from Merrill to help him in his task. William S. Broeksmit, a derivatives trader with a risk manager\u2019s nose for spotting financial dangers, was one. And Mr. Jain, then just coming into his own as a purveyor of the exotic to hedge funds around the world, joined him. Today, two of these three men are dead. Mr. Mitchell died in a plane crash in 2000 at age 47. Mr. Broeksmit committed suicide in 2014 at 58. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As for the 53-year-old Mr. Jain, his carefully crafted plan to finish what his mentor, Mr. Mitchell, started at Deutsche Bank has ended in disappointment. In the years since the financial crisis, many investment banks have had to pay significant amounts to atone for their various sins. And while the sum of Deutsche\u2019s fines is in the middle of the pack, the bank has been drawn into some of finance\u2019s furthest frontiers when it comes to the pursuit of profit. Deutsche has been a primary offender in two of the biggest banking scandals of the past decade: promoting toxic mortgages to unwitting investors and manipulating for profit the main lending rate for banks in London. In the process, it has agreed to pay over $9 billion in fines and consumer relief. The bank has sold tax-reduction products to hedge funds, and is alleged to have helped Russian investors illegally move money overseas. This is also a bank that marketed complex derivatives to Europe\u2019s sickliest bank, Monte dei Paschi in Italy. And it is one of the largest lenders to Donald J. Trump , having extended roughly $300 million in loans to the president-elect\u2019s businesses. Analysts calculate that of the 20 billion euros in profits that Deutsche\u2019s trading and banking unit accumulated since 1995, as much as 15 billion euros will ultimately be returned to regulators via fines and penalties. Of course, not all of this lands in the lap of Mr. Mitchell \u2014 and more recently, Mr. Jain. The investment bank they created remains a power in bond and foreign currency trading worldwide. And from the beginning, it was overseen by a strong-willed German board that knew well the risks and rewards that came with such a business. It is also the case that when Mr. Jain became co-chief executive of Deutsche in 2012, one of his first priorities was lowering the bank\u2019s risk, which he did by unloading opaque, hard-to-trade assets. In spring 2015, Mr. Jain put in place his own plan for reforming the bank, which his C.E.O. successor, John M. Cryan, has not entirely abandoned. That said, Mr. Cryan has made it clear that his Deutsche Bank will be markedly different from Mr. Jain\u2019s. Since taking over last year, Mr. Cryan has preached simplicity, less risk, better internal controls and reduced reliance on derivatives. As for the investment bank he inherited from Mr. Jain, he has said that he is committed to it but that it will be a very different institution under him. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Through spokesmen, Mr. Jain and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Following Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Deutsche\u2019s stock has been on a tear, up over 30 percent on the hope that the combination of a banking-friendly president and a more cautious leadership under Mr. Cryan will help the bank chart a new path. When an investment bank trips up in spectacular fashion, human misfortune is often a consequence. That could mean a cashiered chief executive seeing his career and reputation ruined. Or a rogue trader who loses billions of dollars and ends up in prison. But there have been few instances in which the personal toll surrounding a bank\u2019s rise and fall has been as profound as this one. Out of Chaos, Efficiency By December 2000, Mr. Mitchell seemed to have accomplished the impossible. In just five years, he had hired thousands of traders and bankers from firms all over Wall Street (an effort that got a boost by the acquisition of Bankers Trust in 1999), forging not just a strong culture but also a highly profitable business. While there were numerous deposit-driven banks in Europe that made a play for American investment banking business in the 1980s and 1990s, none did it with the zeal of Deutsche Bank under Mr. Mitchell and later Mr. Jain.

Credit Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters Even before he moved to London, Mr. Mitchell had developed a reputation for being one of Wall Street\u2019s premier recruiters, with a pied-piper-like ability to attract, and keep, the best traders and bankers around. He had a special methodology in his choosing, inclining toward those who came from big families and played team sports in college, because he felt that these traits would give him \u201cathletes\u201d capable of working well together in the large competitive grouping of a trading floor. \u201cIt was as if entropy was his vision \u2014 that out of this chaos would emerge a greater efficiency,\u201d said Kevin Ingram , a former top bond executive at Goldman Sachs whom Mr. Mitchell recruited in 1996 and who left Deutsche Bank in 1998 and later pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges. \u201cHe did an extraordinary job in managing egos.\u201d At Merrill, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Jain and Mr. Broeksmit had used their expertise in derivatives and swaps to carve out market share from established players like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. As Mr. Broeksmit would recount in an unpublished interview with a reporter for Bloomberg News, the strategy worked because of Mr. Jain\u2019s skill, while at Merrill, in enticing his hedge-fund clients into volatile yet profitable investments \u2014 such as bond futures, swaps and other derivatives. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cHe was persistent and persuasive and able to show it would make good economic sense,\u201d Mr. Broeksmit said, according to an email exchange with the reporter. Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s son, Val , provided documents and email communications from Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s files to The New York Times. A musician, the younger Mr. Broeksmit taught himself finance, and for several years he has been looking into his father\u2019s career at Deutsche in a search for answers as to why he took his life. The plan was to use a similar strategy in London with Deutsche Bank. \u201cI remember Edson called me up and said, \u2018I have just been given the keys to the kingdom at Deutsche Bank \u2014 we can do whatever we want,\u2019\u201d recalled Michael G. Philipp, one of the first Merrill executives to follow Mr. Mitchell to Deutsche; \u201c2,500 people in 18 months \u2014 it has never been done since.\u201d Mr. Mitchell\u2019s untimely death in 2000 was a devastating blow to the bank and more so to his many friends and followers. But it did not alter the bank\u2019s mission, the mantle of which was eventually taken on by Mr. Jain. By the time of the financial crisis, 90 percent of the bank\u2019s profits would come from the London-based global market\u2019s division \u2014 fueled mostly by derivatives-driven trading bets and its dominant positions as a foreign currency trader. All that changed in late 2008. With one investment bank after another going bust, Deutsche\u2019s board had become increasingly concerned as to the bank\u2019s derivatives holdings, according to documents reviewed by The Times. In October 2008 the bank\u2019s derivatives exposure, net of cash collateral, was 181 billion euros, these documents show, a sizable sum given its equity cushion of just 30 billion euros. Starting in 2007, Mr. Jain had already taken steps to materially reduce Deutsche\u2019s risk profile. However, he and his team pushed back hard against the view that the investment bank\u2019s power should be significantly curtailed. \u201cThis underlines the paradox of D.B.,\u201d read a briefing paper for Mr. Jain prepared in advance of the bank\u2019s general executive committee meeting in mid-December 2008. \u201cHowever much some at the G.E.C. would like to see D.B. return to its roots as a continental commercial bank, it is clear that international sales and trading will represent the bulk of value creation at D.B.\u201d Sales and trading would also become the focus for regulators in Germany, London and the United States who, in the wake of the crisis, cracked down severely. The $7.2 billion penalty announced in December represents, in effect, the final bill to be paid toward the Mitchell and Jain plan of paying bankers outsize sums to take outsize risks in pursuit of outsize profits.

As the fines and scandals mounted, though, especially the rigging scheme involving a key interest rate known as the London Interbank Offered Rate \u2014 in which Deutsche played a central role \u2014 even bankers who had been along for the ride wondered if it had been worth it. \u201cShame on what is happening to DBK,\u201d wrote Martin Loat, a retired Deutsche Bank executive, to Mr. Broeksmit in December 2013, using the common shorthand of Deutsche\u2019s stock ticker. \u201cI was negative on big banks and very vocal to Joe on bonuses. The then-1.6 trillion euro balance sheet on 50 billion euros of equity was plain stupid. I also disliked credit derivatives with a passion. But Libor and other thefts \u2014 that even ultra-cynic Martin never believed could happen,\u201d he wrote, referring to himself. A Man of Loyalties For many senior bankers, eye-watering losses and regulatory crackdowns are part of the cold calculation of a Wall Street career that can, quite suddenly, veer from triumph to ignominy. Photo Anshu Jain, left, and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, co-chief executives of Deutsche Bank, at a shareholder meeting in 2015. Credit Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Jain were such men \u2014 exceedingly confident risk takers with thick public skins. Bill Broeksmit, a behind-the-scenes technician with an acute sense of the rights and wrongs in finance, was not. And that is why his sad end carries a larger resonance as the business model that his two close colleagues put in place ultimately failed the institution and the many who had devoted their lives to it. He was, in many ways, the connective tissue linking Mr. Mitchell to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mr. Jain in their management of the bank. Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Broeksmit were close friends, working together for more than a decade at Merrill and bonding over a shared love of Maine, where they decamped each summer. After Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death, Mr. Broeksmit would form a bond with Mr. Jain, offering advice to him, via official and unofficial channels, as to Deutsche\u2019s fluctuating risk profile. Within Deutsche, Mr. Broeksmit was seen to be Mr. Jain\u2019s eyes and ears when it came to tracking various trading positions and risk exposures. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Broeksmit was always an ardent advocate for Mr. Jain. He was the Deutsche Bank executive who cited Mr. Jain\u2019s salesmanship abilities as a formative contributor to the bank\u2019s early success in the book that celebrated the unit\u2019s 10-year anniversary. Mr. Broeksmit had originally been persuaded by Mr. Mitchell to move to London with the first wave of Merrill Lynch defectors in 1995 and 1996. As the brains behind Mr. Mitchell\u2019s ambition for Deutsche to become a leading derivatives bank, he was what financial hands call a plumber \u2014 an expert in the piping and flow of money, largely unknown beyond the trading floor. Bookish, though not without a touch of the trader\u2019s swagger, Mr. Broeksmit was also a man of loyalties, always quick to share the burdens of a friend in need. So when Mr. Jain asked him to take on a larger risk role at Deutsche in 2007, he said yes, even though he had been enjoying his more relaxed life as private consultant after stepping down as a full-time executive. After a time, though, the drumbeat of investigations began to wear on him. There was Deutsche\u2019s role in the rate-rigging scandal, for which it paid $2.5 billion, the highest sum of the roughly $9 billion paid by major investment banks. There was a $55 million fine Deutsche had to pay for misstating its derivatives positions. And finally, there were the withering criticisms by the New York Fed regarding Deutsche\u2019s troubled American operations \u2014 where, at the behest of Mr. Jain, Mr. Broeksmit had become a member of the board. In the days after Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s death in early 2014, Mr. Jain ordered up a report, with help from outside lawyers, to determine whether the suicide had been work-related. Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s ties, direct or indirect, to Deutsche\u2019s many regulatory woes were examined in detail. In September of that year, the report concluded that there was \u201cnothing that shows a direct link between Bill\u2019s death and his work at Deutsche Bank.\u201d The executives who produced the report said that he was \u201cnot unhappy\u201d during his last days at the bank in 2013. He had officially stepped down that summer, although, in his usual style, he was not cutting ties completely, staying on as a director at Deutsche\u2019s New York Bank. \u201cHad my retirement luncheon hosted by Anshu last week,\u201d Mr. Broeksmit wrote to a friend that November. \u201cIt\u2019s the third time I have retired!\u201d A Guarded Private Life The extent to which Deutsche\u2019s legal woes played a role in Mr. Broeksmit\u2019s untimely death remains a mystery. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In mid-2013, with investigations into Deutsche\u2019s conduct mounting, Mr. Broeksmit did pay a visit to a psychiatrist in London that became part of the coroner\u2019s examination into his death. According to the doctor\u2019s diagnosis, Mr. Broeksmit had \u201cimagined being investigated, being prosecuted, losing his wealth and his reputation.\u201d But, in the same letter, the doctor said his patient recognized that these thoughts were not a \u201crealistic possibility,\u201d even if they caused him sleeplessness and anxiety. There are no records of Mr. Broeksmit paying further visits to a psychiatrist in the year before his death. Outwardly, friends and colleagues do not recall Mr. Broeksmit showing signs of stress, although they do say he had always been very private in terms of his inner life. While he peppered his lawyers for updates on various investigations, he also made plans with a group of former colleagues to take a ski trip in February. But on Jan. 26, 2014, instead of meeting his wife and son for lunch, Mr. Broeksmit slung a dog leash over a door in his London home, and hanged himself from it. Left by his side was a neat stack of company documents related to Deutsche\u2019s New York banking operations, and suicide notes addressed to relatives, as well as one to Mr. Jain. \u201cYou were good to me,\u201d Mr. Broeksmit wrote to the man he had known for over 30 years, adding, \u201cI am eternally sorry.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 1, 2017, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: The High Price of Deutsche\u2019s Fall.

The gunman remains at large, according to Turkish police. In the video, the nightclub's bouncer and a few patrons can been seen lingering near the front door as cars glide down the street.

(Jan. 1) AP FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, file photo, President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Trump\u0092s skepticism of technology marks a sharp contrast from Obama, whom he\u0092ll replace on Jan. 20. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON - As Barack Obama began preparing to leave office, the first smartphone-toting U.S. president ordered his team to upgrade the White House\u2019s aging technology for his successor. New computers were purchased and faster internet was installed. Not included in the modernization plans? A courier service. But that delivery method of a bygone era may be in for a comeback under Donald Trump. Despite his voracious use of Twitter, the president-elect appears to be leaning toward old tech to ensure the security of sensitive messages. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way because I\u2019ll tell you what, no computer is safe,\u201d Trump told reporters Saturday in response to questions about Russia\u2019s alleged hacking of Democrats during the presidential election. Trump, who doesn\u2019t email or surf the internet, said days earlier that computers \u201chave complicated lives very greatly.\u201d Russian hackers strike Burlington Electric with malware Trump\u2019s skepticism of some technology marks a sharp contrast from the president he\u2019ll replace on Jan. 20. Obama, who was a youthful 47 years old when he took office, carries a specially outfitted Blackberry, emails with a small number of friends and aides, and has received some of his daily security briefings on an iPad. He celebrated technological innovations at an annual science fair, created the job of chief technology officer in the White House and viewed technology as key to making the sprawling federal government more efficient and responsive to the public. But technology has also been a burden for Obama. Online sign-ups for his health care law were crippled by massive technical issues, resulting in one of the most embarrassing episodes of his presidency. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden stole classified information that he leaked to journalists, revealing the Obama administration\u2019s bulk collection of millions of Americans\u2019 phone records, as well as U.S. spying on some friendly foreign leaders. Trump, 70, rarely uses a computer and sifts through stacks of newspapers, magazines and printed articles to read the news. He panned candidates\u2019 reliance on data and technology in presidential campaigns, preferring to make decisions in part based on the reaction from audiences at his rallies. While Trump\u2019s tweetstorms are already legendary, he utters some of his messages out loud and leaves the actual typing to aides. Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he expects Trump to continue using Twitter and other social media sites as president, casting it as an effective way to communicate with Americans. Twitter CEO feelings on Trump tweets: 'Complicated' \u201cAbsolutely, you\u2019re going to see Twitter,\u201d Spicer said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI think it freaks the mainstream media out \u2014 that he has this following of 45-plus million people that follow him on social media\u201d and he \u201ccan have a direct conversation\u201d with them. Trump has shown some interest in technology since winning the White House. Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel has been working with Trump\u2019s transition team and could serve as an adviser to the administration. Trump met with several Silicon Valley executives last month, telling them his administration was \u201chere to help you folks do well.\u201d As Trump heads into the White House, some of the biggest questions surrounding his relationship with technology will involve security. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and a top aide to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the election, exposing the vulnerabilities of systems in Washington. Revelations that Clinton used a personal email and private internet server during her four years as Obama\u2019s secretary of state highlighted the lax practices that exist in government. As a candidate, Trump called for an immediate review of U.S. cyber defenses and vulnerabilities, though he has not detailed specific steps he plans to take to bolster cybersecurity and has not publicly accepted the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia was behind the election year hacking. Nor has Trump outlined any changes in the way he expects the White House to use technology for day-to-day work. The Russian hacking saga: How we got here Bruce Schneier, a technology security expert, said Trump was right to question the safeguards that exist for protecting his own communications as president. \u201cIf the Russian spies want to get at his data, no computer is probably safe,\u201d said Schneier, a fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cEverything is vulnerable.\u201d Of course, the courier system Trump suggests is hardly foolproof, either. After the U.S. killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, administration officials said they had gleaned crucial information on his whereabouts by tracking the al-Qaida leader\u2019s courier. 8856 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 149 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iU5N8e NEVER MISS OUT THANKS FOR SIGNING UP FOR THE  NEWSLETTER We're sorry.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story It was \u201ca glimmer of hope in the midst of a greatly traumatic year for Muslims,\u201d said Mona Haydar, an American poet and activist who appeared in a recent Microsoft commercial with a variety of community leaders, including a transgender teenager and a white policeman. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cFor me as a Muslim woman, I represent something right now in the country that for some people incites fear,\u201d said Ms. Haydar, 28, who wears a hijab and hails from Flint, Mich. \u201cThis normalizes the narrative that we are just human beings.\u201d Several advertising executives likened the movement to the decision by mass marketers to cast same-sex couples and their children in ads for the first time in 2013 and 2014, making inclusion and acceptance a priority over potential criticism from some customers. \u201cWith the kind of gay parent issue, we\u2019ve gotten a little closer to acceptance, but the Muslim issue in America is still pretty raw for a lot of people,\u201d said Kevin Brady, an executive creative director at the ad agency Droga5, which worked last year with Honey Maid on a commercial about white and Muslim-American neighbors. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be, but it\u2019s one that I think brands took an extra step of courage to really go out there with in 2016.\u201d A campaign for YouTube Music in the middle of last year highlighted five individuals, including a young woman in a hijab, rapping to a song by Blackalicious while walking through a school corridor. The inclusion of the ad, \u201cAfsa\u2019s Theme,\u201d was purposeful, said Danielle Tiedt, the chief marketing officer at YouTube, adding that highlighting diversity is \u201cmore important than ever.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think diversity is a political statement,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an issue of universal humanity.\u201d For its ad, Amazon was painstaking in its attention to detail, checking with religious groups about costuming and background imagery, and sending over final proofs of the ad for review, said Mr. Abid and Antonios Kireopoulos, an associate general secretary of the National Council of Churches, another group Amazon consulted. Ads showing any kind of racial diversity can now attract heaping amounts of vitriol online \u2014 most of it delivered anonymously \u2014 as State Farm discovered last month when it posted an ad of a black man proposing to a white woman on Twitter. Anti-Muslim remarks, like \u201cthey don\u2019t belong here,\u201d peppered the comments under Chevrolet\u2019s video in June of two twins from Los Angeles, named Ruqaya and Qassim, who were accepted into a soccer program the company sponsors. They were 8 years old when the video, which did not mention religion, was made. Mr. Brady said the agency had prepared Honey Maid for potentially hateful responses to its ad, though it fielded fewer than he feared. (On Facebook, the top comments are appreciative and heartfelt.) Nida\u2019a Moghrabi, a cheesecake seller and mother of three daughters who starred in the commercial with a neighbor she befriended a few years ago, said she had initially been irritated by some rude comments on Facebook and YouTube until she realized how ubiquitous such remarks were. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf you go to the adoption commercial from Honey Maid, you still see nasty comments,\u201d Ms. Moghrabi said, referring to an ad of a child talking about his new brother. \u201cSo I was like, if they\u2019re complaining about adopted kids, of course I\u2019m not going to worry about their comments about me.\u201d The response from her community was positive, she said. Such ads are \u201cencouraging for the younger generations, like those who are afraid to mention that they\u2019re Muslims,\u201d she added. \u201cMy daughters are more confident now, and I believe their friends who are Muslims, they know that we\u2019re accepted and we\u2019re loved.\u201d With more Americans dwelling in siloed information bubbles, commercials have the potential to reach audiences with diverse viewpoints. Amazon said its ad had aired during programs including the \u201cToday\u201d show, \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cBlue Bloods,\u201d while Microsoft said its placements had included \u201cThe Voice,\u201d \u201cPitch\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Dr. Kireopoulos said he had first seen the commercial outside work while watching a National Football League game on television, giving him hope that many different audiences will see it and consider the message, particularly as reports of hate crimes against American Muslims rise. \u201cI imagine the violence will unfortunately continue, so it will take more vigilance on the part of community leaders and everyday believers to work together,\u201d he said. Ms. Haydar is hopeful about the potential. \u201cIn 10 years, this commercial might have lived on in the heart of some young kid who saw a Muslim woman in a commercial and didn\u2019t see the boogeyman in my face, and instead saw a normal human being,\u201d she said. \u201cThen if somebody says something about Muslims that\u2019s kind of crazy, maybe that kid can say, \u2018I saw this commercial, and she actually just seemed kind of normal.\u2019 You don\u2019t know what the reverberations look like.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Year of Anti-Muslim Vitriol, Promoting Inclusion.

A handful of WNBA players, including Essence Carson, Chelsea Gray and Jantel Lavender of the Los Angeles Sparks, were next door when the attack took place. Sparks coach Brian Agler told The Associated Press that Carson texted him to say the three players were OK. About two dozen WNBA players are in Turkey during their off-season playing in a league there. The WNBA told the AP that all of the players had been accounted for. We're okay. Goodnight. \u2014 Essence T. Carson (@Pr3pE) January 1, 2017 Police guarded the scene of the attack Sunday in the Ortakoy district, close to the Bosphorus strait. Istanbul provincial Gov. Vasip Sahin said the attacker was armed with a long-barreled weapon and \"rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,\" according to the Anadolu news agency . While it had been reported that the assailant was dressed in a \"Santa Claus\" outfit, several sources, including Prime Minister Binali Yildrim, said that was incorrect. Sinem Uyanik was in the club with her husband, who she told NBC News was shot three times but is expected to survive. She said she fainted briefly after two people were shot in front. Play ",

By Erin Cunningham and Kareem Fahim January 1 at 4:05 PM Follow @erinmcunningham Follow @kfahim ISTANBUL \u2014 Leanne Nasser was a bright-eyed Arab-Israeli teenager, in Istanbul with friends for the New Year, despite her father\u2019s concerns about safety. Fatih Cakmak, who survived a bomb attack only weeks ago, was hired to work security for a popular nightclub. Both were among those who died early Sunday when a gunman, brandishing an assault rifle, stormed Istanbul\u2019s famed Reina Club on the banks of the Bosphorus, gunning down unsuspecting New Year\u2019s revelers in a rampage that was one of the city\u2019s worst mass killings in recent memory. The assailant remained at large Sunday night, and unidentified except for blurred glimpses of him in security camera footage that showed gunshots sparking off the pavement and victims crumpling to the ground. Thirty-nine people were killed, many of them foreigners, in the latest in a string of assaults that have roiled Turkey as it battles insurgents at home and across the border in war-torn Syria. At least 70 people were wounded. Among the victims of Sunday\u2019s attack, in Istanbul's Ortakoy district, were an Iraqi student, a Turkish policeman and two Lebanese fitness trainers. Authorities were working Sunday to identify the dead, and citizens of at least eight countries, including Turkey, were killed in the assault. \u201cPlease answer my comment, and tell me you have not died,\u201d one Facebook user, Sheery Rudan, posted on the profile photo of 22-year-old Mustafa Jalal, an Iraqi student from Kirkuk. The school where he studied, Kemburgaz University, announced his death on Twitter. (Haberturk Gazetesi Yildirim) Hassan Alaa, who was close to Jalal, struggled with the news of his boyhood friend\u2019s death. Jalal, who was an only child, was active, outgoing, and loved cars and swimming, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. We would have breakfast together every day,\u201d Alaa said, when reached in the Iraqi city of Erbil. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s gone. Before he left for the club, he wished me a happy birthday and we were joking around.\u201d The assault, which targeted a posh, sprawling venue popular with Istanbul\u2019s elite, recalled similar attacks on a concert hall in Paris in 2015 and nightclub in Orlando in 2016. And like the previous attacks \u2013 with their disproportianate tally of young victims, all of whom had been enjoying a night out \u2013 the carnage on the Bosphorous left Istanbul reeling from a similar sense of shock and grief. In Paris and Orlando, one or more gunmen used assault rifles to target largely cosmopolitan and international crowds. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks. The jihadist group has carried out attacks in Turkey in recent years, but there was no claim of responsibility for the massacre early Sunday. It began just after 1 a.m., when the assailant shot dead a 22-year-old police officer, Burak Yildiz, and a chaffeur for a tourism company, Ayhan Arik, on the street outside the club, according to Turkish media reports. The sound of gunshots sent panicked patrons scrambling for cover at the waterside as the gunman came inside, witnesses said. One patron, professional soccer player Sefa Boydas, described on Twitter the chaos at the club. In a series of posts that were later deleted, Boydas said he did not see who was shooting, but he noted that police arrived on the scene quickly. He carried his girlfriend, who was wearing high heels, he said, out of the club to safety. \u201cAt first we thought some men were fighting with each other,\u201d a Lebanese woman who gave her name as Hadeel told the Reuters news agency. She was in the club with her husband and a friend. \u201cWe heard the guy screaming Allahu Akbar,\u201d she said, which is Arabic for \u201cGod is great.\u201d \u201cWe heard his footsteps crushing the broken glass,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got out through the kitchen, there was blood everywhere and bodies.\u201d Others did not survive the assault. Mustafa Sezgin Seymen, 32, was at Reina Saturday night with his fiancee, Sezen Arseven. She was wounded; Seymen, a native of the Black Sea city of Trabzon, was killed. \u201cI\u2019m returning without you from the place we went together,\u201d Arseven wrote of Seymen in a public Facebook post on Sunday. \u201cI have lost my spouse, my life partner, my most beloved,\u201d she wrote. Officials on Sunday called the nightclub attack a \u201cmassacre\u201d and an act of terrorism. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack was meant to \u201ctrigger chaos.\u201d We \u201cwill never give passage to these dirty games,\u201d Erdogan said in a statement posted on the presidential website. Sunday\u2019s incident was the fourth major attack in Turkey in less than a month, including the high-profile assassination of the Russian ambassador by a Turkish policeman, and a brazen car bomb assault against riot police at a soccer stadium in Istanbul. That attack, which killed 44 policemen, was claimed by separatist Kurdish militants, who have waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. The attacks have posed a severe challenge to President Erdogan\u2019s government, which has appeared to lurch from crisis to crisis since the authorities put down an attempted coup in July. The state\u2019s resources have been stretched thinas it tries to respond to the cascading calamaties. After the coup, the government launched a withering crackdown on its perceived enemies, arresting thousands of people. At the same time, the government has deepened its involvment in the Syrian war while escalating its confrontation with Kurdish groups. Cakmak, the security guard, was working at the stadium when the car bomb detonated on Dec. 11, Turkish media reported. \u201cThey killed my brother. He died for nothing,\u201d Erhan Cakmak said outside the central morgue in Istanbul Sunday, in a video circulated by the private Dogan news agency. Fatih Cakmak's Facebook profile photo shows him with renowned French soccer player and Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane. In Istanbul Sunday, relatives and friends of one of the Lebanese victims, Haykal Moussalem, a 35-year-old fitness trainer, arrived at the morgue, saying they had not been able to locate him. Lebanon\u2019s consul general in Istanbul later confirmed that Moussalem had been killed, along with at least two other young Lebanese citizens, Elias Wardini and Rita Chami, according to a statement on the site of the country\u2019s national news agency. Pictures on social media showed Moussalem, newly married, on a trip to Italy with his wife, and supervising training sessions in a gym. Another picture that circulated showed Wardini, and Chami, smiling in the sleet on an Istanbul street. In Israel, the father of Leanne Nasser , speaking to local media , said he implored his 19-year-old daughter not to travel to Istanbul because of recent attacks. Israel's foreign ministry said one of her friends, 18-year-old Ruaa Mansour, was injured in the attack. Late Sunday, the French foreign ministry said a Franco-Tunisian woman and her Tunisian husband had been killed in the attack. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its nationals were also confirmed dead. According to Turkey's state-run news agency, Anadolu, nearly two-thirds of the victims were foreigners. The State Department Sunday warned U.S. citizens in Istanbul to limit movements \u201cto an absolute minimum\u201d while the search for the assailant continues. \u201cHe was one of the kindest people I knew. He would never hold a grudge,\u201d Alaa said of Jalal, the Iraqi student. \u201cHe loved his life [in Istanbul],\u201d he said. \u201cHe enjoyed everything in it and wanted to stay for good.\u201d Fahim reported from Cairo. Heba Habib contributed reporting from Stockholm. Read more: ",

Turkish anti-riot police officers patrol near the Reina night club, one of Istanbul's most exclusive party spots, early on Sunday after at least one gunmen went on a shooting rampage during New Year's Eve celebrations. (Yasin Akgul / AFP/Getty Images) Associated Press A manhunt is on in Turkey for an assailant who unleashed a salvo of bullets in front of and inside a crowded Istanbul nightclub during New Year's celebrations Sunday, killing at least 39 people before fleeing. Foreigners were among the fatalities, including an 18-year-old Israeli woman, three Indian citizens, a 26-year-old man from Lebanon and a Belgian national, according to the countries' respective foreign ministries and a relative. Close to 70 others were injured in what authorities described as a terrorist attack. Three of the wounded were in critical condition, Turkey's prime minister said. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vehemently condemned \u201cthe terror attack in Istanbul's Ortakoy neighborhood in the first hours of 2017\u201d and offered condolences for those who lost their lives, including \u201cforeign guests.\u201d The attacker, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the popular Reina club at about\u00a01:15 a.m. before entering and firing on people partying inside, Gov. Vasip Sahin said. \u201cUnfortunately, [he]\u00a0rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,\u201d Sahin told reporters. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, and authorities did not name any suspects. The bloodiest attacks that Turkey endured in 2016 were the work of\u00a0 Islamic State or Kurdish militants. Turkey is a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. The country is also facing renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast\u00a0and across the border in Syria and Iraq. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said no\u00a0suspect has been identified and that the gunman remains at large. Soylu, describing the attack as a \u201cmassacre, a truly inhumane savagery,\u201d said three or four of the Turkish victims may have been employees at the nightclub. \u201cOur security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing, he will be caught in a short period of time,\u201d Soylu said. Private NTV news channel said the assailant entered the upscale nightclub, on the shores of the Bosporus, on the European side of the city, dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. Security camera footage obtained by the Associated Press from Haberturk newspaper, shows the male assailant dressed in black and carrying a backpack as he shoots down a police officer outside the Reina nightclub. Footage taken by a different camera shows him inside the venue wearing different clothes and a Santa Claus hat. However, Turkey's prime minister denied that the gunman wore a Santa Claus outfit. \u201cThere is no truth to this. He is an armed terrorist as we know it,\u201d Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters. Yildirim said the attacker left a gun inside the venue and escaped by \u201ctaking advantage of the chaos\u201d that ensued. Some customers reportedly jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack. Mehmet Dag, 22, was passing by the club and saw the suspect shoot at a police officer and a bystander. He said the suspect then targeted security guards, gunning them down and entering the club. \u201cOnce he went in, we don't know what happened. There were gun sounds, and after two minutes the sound of an explosion,\u201d Dag said. Turkish media said the victims include a 22-year-old police officer and a 47-year-old travel agent, both of whom were shot outside the club. The nightclub area remained sealed off Sunday afternoon. Heavily armed police blocked the snowy street in front of the nightclub where the entrance was covered with blue plastic sheeting below a Turkish flag. Police patrolled the Asian side of the Bosporus on the other side of the club. Crime scene investigators were seen inside the club searching through piles of mingled chairs, tables and pieces of clothing left behind during the panic among the guests. And there were emotional scenes in front of a city morgue where those shot dead were brought for identification. Some relatives cried out and fell to the ground as they apparently learned the fate of their loved ones. Citizens of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon and Libya were among those hurt in the attack, according to Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, Turkey's minister of family and social policies. The U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul on Sunday warned American citizens to keep their movements in the city \u201cto an absolute minimum.\u201d A statement reminded U.S. citizens that extremists \u201care continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks in areas where U.S. citizens and expatriates reside or frequent.\u201d The United States also denied reports in Turkish new outlets and on social media that its security agencies knew in advance that the nightclub in Istanbul was at risk of a terror attack. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said in a statement issued Sunday that \u201ccontrary to rumors circulating in social media, the U.S. Government had no information about threats to specific entertainment venues, including the Reina Club.\u201d Major attacks carried out by Islamic State\u00a0or Kurdish militants killed more than 180 people in Istanbul and Ankara alone in 2016. On Dec. 10, a double bomb attack outside a soccer stadium near the Reina nightclub killed 45 people and wounded some 150 others. The attack was claimed by Turkey-based Kurdish militant group, the Kurdish Freedom Falcons. \u201cTurkey continues its combat against terror and is absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary in the region to ensure its citizens safety and peace,\u201d President Erdogan said in a written statement Sunday. Prime Minister Yildirim vowed to keep fighting terrorist organizations, but noted,\u00a0\u201cThe terror that happens here today may happen in another country in the world tomorrow.\u201d The nightclub attack drew quick condemnation from the West and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his Turkish counterpart a telegram of condolence, saying \u201cit is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations.\u201d \u201cHowever, terrorists don't share moral values. Our common duty is to combat terrorists' aggression,\u201d Putin said. The White House condemned what it called a \u201chorrific terrorist attack\u201d and offered U.S. help to Turkey. An estimated 600 people were celebrating inside the club that is often frequented by famous locals, including singers, actors and sports stars. Several shocked revelers were seen fleeing the scene after the attack, and the music fell silent. The prime minister's office issued a media blackout on the events and asked media to refrain from broadcasting and publishing anything that may cause \u201cfear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\u201d Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some disguised as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

It\u2019s easy \u2014 and comfortable \u2014 to assume that 2017 will be a return to the natural political order. Political gravity will reassert itself. The country that elected Donald Trump president will come to resemble the country that elected and reelected Barack Obama over the previous eight years. Count me skeptical. Trump\u2019s ascension to the White House feels more like the beginning of something than the end of it to me. \u00a0The instability of our long-standing institutions, coupled with the creeping anxiety caused by a steady drumbeat of terrorist attacks \u2014 the latest coming in Istanbul on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 and a sense that the American Dream is fading away, creates a political climate in which nontraditional politicians promising the world hold massive appeal. \u00a0In short: I think we\u2019ll see more Trump-like figures in politics, not less. And that a return to some sort of normal never really comes. Given that, I\u2019ve come up with three rules to govern my reporting in 2017 \u2014 hard-learned lessons from a 2016 campaign that began with me rolling my eyes about the prospect of a Trump presidency and ended with me writing the words\u00a0\u201cPresident-elect Donald Trump.\u201d 1. The old rules don\u2019t apply: Sure, this seems basic and the sort of thing they teach you in journalism school on the first day. (Having never gone to journalism school, I can\u2019t be sure.) But the truth is that after decades covering politics, there are certain rules that always hold: The candidate with more money to spend wins 99 percent of the time; the campaign that is staffed with more longtime political pros is more likely to end up on the winning side; and saying controversial things day in and day out is likely to cost you with voters. Except none of that happened in 2016. \u00a0Trump was drastically outspent. He cobbled together a political inner circle of political castoffs and people who had never worked in politics. He attacked a former Miss Universe, got in an extended fight with a Gold Star family and took swipes at Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for being a prisoner of war. Any one of those things would have doomed him if the\u00a0\u201cnormal\u201d rules applied. None doomed Trump. \u00a0Whether that means the old rules are dead or simply that Trump bucked them for one race remains to be seen. But for me, every time I find myself analyzing something based on\u00a0\u201cthe way things work,\u201d I am going to stop and think hard about, well, whether that\u2019s the way they actually work now. 2. The establishment is dead (or dying): Trump\u2019s rise to the White House is, of course, the clearest sign of the declining power of the establishment to handpick its preferred candidate for office. But it\u2019s far from the only one. That Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a reviled figure in official Republican Washington, wound up as the only person who had a realistic chance to beat Trump \u2014 and that the likes of former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker never had a chance \u2014 speaks to how out of touch the Republican establishment is from its base voters. Ditto Democrats. \u00a0The rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) in the Democratic primary fight against Hillary Clinton stunned an establishment that had lined up behind the former secretary of state years before. The ouster of Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the first day of the party\u2019s national nominating convention reaffirmed just how badly the party establishment had misread its grass roots. No one should think that the establishment can get what it wants in 2017 simply by being\u00a0\u201cthe establishment.\u201d In fact, that status hinders rather than helps any efforts by party leaders to drive their agenda. 3. Polling has (major) problems: I think pollsters \u2014 and the data they produced \u2014 got a bit of a bad rap in 2016, especially when you consider that they missed the final margin between Trump and Clinton by far less than was initially assumed . \u00a0 Still, most professional pollsters acknowledge a systemic problem in determining who will vote \u2014 particularly at the state and district level. Polling \u2014 and good pollsters admit this \u2014 has always been a combination of art and science. \u00a0The art comes on the front end \u2014 working to understand who the electorate is and what it might be in the next election. The science comes out of that art, the hard numbers produced by calculations of who will vote. \u00a0 As the 2016 election showed, pollsters\u2019 ability to accurately determine what the electorate will look like is weaker than at any time in recent memory. There are lots of technical reasons for that difficulty \u2014 and lots of smart people in the polling industry working to figure out solutions. But for now, best to proceed with caution when it comes to polls and what they do or don\u2019t tell us. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Twenty-two states, plus the District of Columbia, will see their minimum wages increase over the course of 2017, according to The Fairness Project, a nonprofit organization that supports progressive causes. In addition, dozens of cities will see similar hikes. The raises are owed in large part to a strategy adopted by the Obama administration to circumvent an obstructionist Republican Congress. Rather than give up on their domestic policy agenda, the president and his aides have aggressively used the bully pulpit to push cities and states toward adopting key proposals \u2014 including a higher minimum wage. Play Minimum wage protests erupt across nation 0:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170102012000if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/820166211954\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> The raises also reflect a galvanized grassroots effort that managed to convince an enormous number of voters of the need for higher pay. \"Seventy percent of these raises came from ballot initiatives,\" Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, told NBC News. \"So it's not so much that there's been a major shift from our elected officials\u2026 Rather, it's low-wage workers, it's their neighbors, it's folks in their communities who overwhelmingly voted to support ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage.\" States that are seeing raises due to ballot measures include: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington and the District of Columbia. Sam Petulla / NBC News Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York and Vermont, meanwhile, have their lawmakers to thank for the minimum wage hikes. Some of the increases are small, amounting to only a few cents \u2014 as in Florida, where minimum wage will go from $8.05-an-hour to $8.10 on January 1. But workers' rights advocates insist any increase, no matter how tiny, makes a difference. \"When you're talking about the types of decisions that minimum wage workers are making \u2014 trading off whether they'll pay their healthcare bill or their groceries -- any increase is significant,\" Schleifer said. The raises are especially notable when compared to the federal minimum wage, which has stayed constant at $7.25 since 2009. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for labor secretary, Andrew F. Puzder, opposed the Obama administration's efforts to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 \u2014 well below the $15 minimum wage that many advocates are calling for. \"The new labor secretary has been opposed to the interests of workers on almost every level, including expanding overtime wages and raising the minimum wage,\" said Paul Sonn, general counsel and program director at the National Employment Law Project, a workers' rights group. Even if Puzder is confirmed, the movement to raise minimum wages at the state and local level will prevail, Sonn said. \"This movement will only get stronger,\" he said. Emma Margolin ",

Off to Hawaii for Final Family Vacation as First Family Friday, Dec. 16 President Barack Obama is heading back to his home state of Hawaii for his final vacation as president. Taking off Friday evening, the first family returns to the island Obama grew up on, Oahu, for 17 days, staying near the beach town of Kailua. The final vacation will be historic in another way -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Pearl Harbor following a summit meeting with Obama in Hawaii, becoming the first Japanese leader to go to the site of the Japanese attack that propelled the United States into World War II. The announcement came after the 75th anniversary of the attack and six months after Obama visited Hiroshima, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to visit the site of the U.S. atomic bombing. Obama visited the island earlier this year as to designate Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument off the Hawaiian coast, creating the world's largest marine protected area. \"This is an area twice the size of Texas that\u2019s going to be protected, and it allows us to save and study the fragile ecosystem threatened by climate change,\" Obama said following the designation at a Conference of Leaders and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in Honolulu, Hawaii, in September. This post will be regularly updated throughout the Obama's final vacation as first family. 0 Shares ",

Karim Kadim/AP Updated at 6:25 p.m. ET Saturday A pair of bombings hit a crowded market in Baghdad on Saturday morning. Security officials say the first blast went off at around 8 a.m. local time; as people gathered to help the wounded, a man detonated a suicide vest. At least 28 people were killed and more than 50 others were wounded in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack. NPR's Alice Fordham reports: \"It is a reminder that although ISIS is under pressure from security forces in the city of Mosul, the group still has the capacity to cause havoc. More than two years after they declared a caliphate, ISIS still controls Mosul in Iraq, Raqqa in Syria and recently retook the historic Syrian city of Palmyra.\" Although most people in Baghdad are Muslim, Fordham says Christmas and New Year's Eve are still considered a popular part of the holiday season. Many people would have been celebrating on Saturday night. Article continues after sponsorship ",

    "text": "OPEN Multimedia Feature It would take only one holdout on the jury, which consists of 10 women and two men, to spare Mr. Roof from lethal injection. Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. Roof\u2019s offer, through Mr. Bruck, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. Roof\u2019s conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager, the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds, like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby, a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. \u201cThat could very well be the end of the death penalty in America, because if there was ever justification for killing anybody, this is the case,\u201d Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victims\u2019 families about Mr. Roof\u2019s fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty, it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law, those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely emotional, powerful testimony,\u201d said John H. Blume, a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School, \u201cand that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when it\u2019s not the case.\u201d If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death, it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law , according to experts on capital cases. That statute, which was broadened in 2009, does not carry a potential death sentence, but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury, given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected; the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors; and Mr. Roof\u2019s competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are \u201ccompetent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\u201d Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof, a ninth-grade dropout, \u201chas no right to represent himself in a capital trial, and even less so at the penalty phase.\u201d But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of self-representation for criminal defendants, in Faretta v. California , the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials, despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. Roof\u2019s defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. \u201cWhether or not they\u2019re legally insane, there\u2019s certainly something mentally wrong with them,\u201d said Peter D. Greenspun, a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant, John A. Muhammad, for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added, \u201cTo have a person like that make this kind of decision, it really calls into question, from a philosophical point of view, whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties.\u201d Mr. Muhammad, who ultimately reinstated Mr. Greenspun, was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later. \u201cIt\u2019s something that Roof will likely regret,\u201d Mr. Greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself. \u201cAt some point down the road, he\u2019s going to say, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 And there\u2019s no going back.\u201d Follow Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder on Twitter.

The banner, featured the word \u201cDIVEST\u201d and a hashtag: #NoDAPL, an apparent protest of the Dakota Access pipeline. SMG, the group that manages the new stadium, released the following statement during halftime: \"Two individuals appear to have climbed over a guard rail to access the ridge truss. We immediately dispatched on-site Minneapolis police and fire departments to the scene and cleared the seating section below. We are working with all stadium partners, and our primary focus is on the safety of the fans and these two individuals. Officials are actively working to get them down safety. We will continue to update media on the situation.\" One of the protesters, wearing a Brett Favre Vikings jersey, waved to fans in the crowd as police and stadium security vacated seven rows of seats behind the east end zone directly below where the protesters\u00a0were dangling. Firemen were seen scurrying through the stadium\u2019s press box as authorities searched for solutions to remove the protesters. In a press release e-mailed to the Minneapolis Star Tribune during Sunday\u2019s game , the protesters\u00a0asserted they were urging U.S. Bank to divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline.

She said he might have been saved by bodies that acted as shields against further shots. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The gunman\u2019s identity and motives remain unclear, but one witness said he had heard the man shout \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic. Even with so much uncertain, the attack on Reina, which is perhaps Istanbul\u2019s most famous nightclub, seemed to symbolize one of Turkish society\u2019s deepest divides, between the secular and the pious \u2014 a fissure that has grown deeper under Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist who has expanded religious schooling and sought to restrict alcohol sales. Some on social media were quick to point out the rhetoric against New Year\u2019s celebrations that had come from Islamist corners of Turkey. A recent Friday sermon prepared by the government\u2019s religious authority said that New Year\u2019s revelry belonged to \u201cother cultures and other worlds.\u201d Another passage of the sermon read, \u201cWe shall not forget that it is never suitable for a believer to forget himself and his aim of creation after a year passes from the stock of life, to exhibit illicit manners and behaviors that don\u2019t comply with our values.\u201d In the aftermath of the attack, Prof. Howard Eissenstat, an expert on Turkey at St. Lawrence University, wrote on Twitter : \u201cDisturbing + not very difficult line to draw between official Turkish anti New Years campaign + tonight\u2019s violence. Rhetoric has consequences.\u201d Video Seeking the Istanbul Nightclub Gunman On Sunday, Turkish officials revealed latest information about the attacker who shot scores of people at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Eve and remains on the loose, and said police were doing everything to find him. embed Emre Eytan Can, 34, an investment banker from Istanbul, said he was a regular at Reina, although he was not there on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cI guess it is a target because it\u2019s full of high-class Turks and foreigners,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a place where people let their hair down and drink, which is not in line with Islam.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Turkey\u2019s troubles had already led to a sharp decline in Western tourists, but visitors from the Middle East, perhaps because they are accustomed to terrorist threats at home, have kept coming. News of the attack quickly reverberated around the region, with citizens of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia among the victims , along with people from Belgium, France and India. By Sunday afternoon, the by-now familiar rituals of grief that follow terrorist attacks were in full swing, with consulate officials and grieving families converging at an Istanbul morgue, where local officials had set up tea stands outside in the bitter cold. A Lebanese woman, Stephanie Deek, was there with her husband to identify a friend from Lebanon, Haykal, a newlywed who had been celebrating the holiday in Istanbul with his wife. The wife was safe, but Haykal, who had jumped into the Bosporus to escape the killer, was dead. \u201cI am so sad,\u201d Ms. Deek said. \u201cI cannot describe how I feel. I did not expect to find him here.

The queen\u2019s failure to attend marked the second time she missed a major holiday service this season. She missed one on Christmas Day -- a rarity.

The flu season hit many Britons hard in recent weeks, and colds and flus were spreading as of late December. A cold can be dangerous for people in their 90s, doctors have warned. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Getty Images/Westend61 hide caption toggle caption Getty Images/Westend61 A new Illinois state law aims to take advantage of the close relationships people often have with beauty professionals, and train stylists to recognize signs of abuse. Getty Images/Westend61 In an effort to take advantage of the intimate relationships between stylists and their clients, a new law in Illinois will require salon professionals to receive training in domestic abuse-prevention as part of their licensing process. The law, which goes into effect Sunday, aims to educate beauty professionals to recognize signs of abuse. But stylists won't be required to report violence, and are protected from any liability. The legislation was introduced by state Rep. Fran Hurley, who told the Chicago Tribune , \"There's an openness, a freeness, a relationship that last years or decades between the client and the cosmetologist. They're in a position to see something that may or may not be right.\" Joan Rowan is a hair stylist who owns two salons \u2014 one on the South Side of Chicago, and the other in Oak Lawn, Ill. She says that for many years now she's been providing training for her own staff about what to do if they think someone is in trouble. Rowan says that clients do sometimes talk to her about what is going on in their lives. \"And sometimes they tell you so much they never come back again, because they're afraid, or they're embarrassed, they don't know what to do.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"I've had women, you know, when you're washing their hair, they have bumps on their head, you know, they 'ran into a door again,' \" Rowan says. \"I've been a hairdresser for 41 years. One in three women have violence in their lives. So yes, I have talked to women.\" The training that the stylists will receive is an hourlong \"awareness and education\" program called Listen. Support. Connect. It was designed by Chicago Says No More , a coalition of domestic violence advocacy groups, in partnership with Cosmetologists Chicago. Kristie Paskvan, the founder of Chicago Says No More, says she knows that an hourlong training isn't going to make anyone an expert. \"We're not asking the salon professionals to intervene. We're just asking them to have the tools in case the clients ask for information,\" she says. \"There's something like 88,000 salon professionals that will be trained in the next two years,\" Paskvan says. \"That's 88,000 more individuals that will be able to have conversations with family and friends and clients, and that raises awareness about domestic violence and sexual assault.\" ",

Eufenia Hernandez, 63, sells goods from her stall at the Sunday market in Tlacolula, Mexico. (Liliana Nieto del Rio / For The Times) Patrick J. McDonnell From her stall\u00a0featuring regional delicacies \u2014 chile-infused dried grasshoppers, juicy white worms from the maguey plant and  handmade chocolates, among other edible fare \u2014 63-year-old Eufenia Hernandez issued a challenge to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump . \u201cIf this individual came down here to Oaxaca, we would put him to work,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see if he can work as hard as the Mexicans in the north.\u201d Hernandez, a veteran border crosser, having made the journey 18 times, has a brother and son in California. \u201cWhat would the United States do without Mexicans?\u201d she posed. \u201cWho\u00a0else would pick the crops? Who would build the homes?\u201d Mexico too depends on those crops, those homes. Its citizens in the U.S. sent back nearly $25 billion last year, its second-largest source of foreign income, after manufactured goods and ahead of oil. Much of that ends up in impoverished rural communities like the ones here\u00a0in the southern state of Oaxaca, which for decades have dispatched young and old to El Norte in a deep-rooted ritual of economic betterment. The cash they send home builds homes, funds small businesses, refurbishes churches and schools, and provides sustenance for multitudes. It\u2019s evident in the expansive, half-finished homes dotting the countryside, the Mexican version of McMansions. \u201cThey are waiting for more dollars from the north to finish,\u201d people explain. Why would Mr. Trump want to make Mexico his No. 1 enemy? Don\u2019t you want your enemies far away, not next to you? \u2014 Rolando Silvaja Jarquina, retired teacher In the state\u2019s central valley region, lines form daily at banks and money-exchange outlets as people collect cash sent from loved ones. The cycle of people heading north and money flowing south is so entrenched that no one here can envision it ending. And so while the election of Trump, who has vowed to halt it with a wall along the 2,000-mile border, has spread dismay and apprehension, a\u00a0more\u00a0common reaction has been bemusement. Most everyone in the area appears to have heard of Trump and his threats \u2014 his bellicose pronouncements about Mexico have been major news south of the border. But there is a pervasive sense that Trump is bluffing \u2014 or will have little appetite to pursue his far-reaching immigration agenda once in office. Or that he will inevitably fail. \u201cIt\u2019s all campaign talk,\u201d Rolando Silvaja Jarquina, a retired teacher, said on a Sunday at a busy market in the courtyard of Tlacolula\u2019s 16th century Catholic church, the Assumption of Our Lady, known for a baroque chapel featuring likenesses of beheaded saints. Each Sunday, producers of local products, including foodstuffs and handicrafts, descend from ancient hillside settlements to sell their goods in Tlacolula, an animated market town about 20 miles southeast of Oaxaca city, the state capital. \u201cBoth countries, Mexico and the United States, benefit from trade, from immigration,\u201d Silvaja said as a band played in the plaza. \u201cWhy would Mr. Trump want to make Mexico his No. 1 enemy? Don\u2019t you want your enemies far away, not next to you?\u201d\u00a0 The flow of money and people has continued through various waves of deportations and angry vows from U.S. politicians to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cI don\u2019t think this president can stop immigration,\u201d said Liberio Hernandez, 34, a returnee from the United States who was among scores of guests attending a raucous baptism party on a recent morning in\u00a0the mountain town of San Miguel del Valle . \u201cThis has been going on too long.\u201d The picturesque village, with about 3,000 inhabitants, all of Zapotec indigenous heritage, has a long history of sending young men to the U.S. to work in restaurants as busboys, dishwashers and cooks. As in many migrant-sending communities, much of the permanent population in San Miguel del Valle consists of women, children and older men \u2014 some of whom returned home with their savings after years in the U.S. Many working-age men remain in the north. \u201cI have so many grandchildren in California \u2014 I just hope I get to see them before I die,\u201d said Arnulfo Miguel Lopez, 61, who returned from the north more than two decades ago but has several sons in the Los Angeles area. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy now for people to come back and visit.\u201d Luis Leon Monterrubio runs a company in Oaxaca, producing mescal, the signature liquor distilled from the maguey plant. Like other exporters to the U.S., he is worried about Donald Trump's threats to increase tariffs. Liliana Nieto del Rio / For The Times Luis Leon Monterrubio runs a company in Oaxaca, producing mescal, the signature liquor distilled from the maguey plant.

Luis Leon Monterrubio runs a company in Oaxaca, producing mescal, the signature liquor distilled from the maguey plant. Like other exporters to the U.S., he is worried about Donald Trump's threats to increase tariffs. (Liliana Nieto del Rio / For The Times) Some villages trace the migratory tradition to the U.S. bracero program, which sent hundreds of thousands of Mexican laborers to the U.S. as legal guest workers from 1942 to 1964. Residents recall fathers and grandfathers who headed off to a then-mysterious north, returning with stashes of dollars. In many cases, that legal traffic morphed into massive illicit immigration. But tens\u00a0of thousands of Oaxacans and other Mexican nationals ultimately gained legal status through the Reagan administration\u2019s landmark amnesty program, passed in 1986. Because of Oaxaca\u2019s longtime links with the U.S., the state has developed a strong cross-border trade in regional\u00a0products, from foodstuffs like cheese and spicy mole sauce to handicrafts and folk art, including\u00a0alebrijes, papier-mache sculptures of imaginary creatures. Word of Trump\u2019s threats to slap new tariffs on Mexican products\u00a0has filtered down to family workshops. \u201cThe tariffs on everything we ship to the north are already very high,\u201d said Luis Leon Monterrubio, who produces a line of mescal, the signature regional liquor distilled from the maguey plant, and exports a good share of it north. \u201cIf tariffs got any higher, of course it would hurt our business.\u201d \u201cWhy would the president want less trade anyway? How does that help the United States?\u201d asked Monterrubio as he dispensed\u00a0generous samples to visitors at his shop along Tlacolula\u2019s main drag. It has been getting harder to cross the border illegally as U.S. authorities have stepped up enforcement. Fewer\u00a0people make it back for the holidays, residents say. Some men interviewed said they had been expelled from the north or gave up trying to get there after being caught multiple times by the Border Patrol. Federico Lopez, 30, the father of a child being honored at a christening party, said he returned a few years ago. Lopez spoke as a\u00a0brass and woodwind band numbering more than a dozen players belted out traditional tunes to celebrate the baptism of his 3-year-old daughter, Valentina, who was decked out initially in a lacy white dress and later in a traditional Zapotec outfit. Men and women danced in the covered patio of a large home, its construction partially funded with money sent back from the United States. Rain pounded on a makeshift canvas roof. One after another, the male guests recounted their days in El Norte \u2014 and dismissed as quixotic the notion that a president could somehow shut down the historic flow of humanity. Liberio Hernandez said he had spent more than 20 years in the Los Angeles area and Milwaukee, where his brother still lives, mostly working in Japanese restaurants. He said he became an expert at preparing Japanese-style sizzling steaks at patrons\u2019 tables.

(Liliana Nieto del Rio / For The Times) Ultimately, he said, he decided to return in 2011 to be with his family. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name, Trump?\u201d asked Hernandez, sipping a beer. \u201cThere are too many people from here already in the north, too many more who want to go.\u201d Miguel Angel Lopez, 43, who said he first went to the United States in 1989, found work in California restaurants and returned here almost two decades later. \u201cPeople will always find a way to go to the north,\u201d he said. \u201cThis Trump can say what he wants, that\u2019s fine, but the reality in\u00a0 Oaxaca is what it is. The men here go to the north to better themselves, to help their families here. No wall will stop them.\u201d \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

    "text": "Istanbul New Year's attack Turkey\u2019s prime minister denied news reports claiming the gunman wore a Santa Claus outfit. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters Sunday: \u201cThere is no truth to this. He is an armed terrorist as we know it.\u201d The prime minister also said after visiting the wounded in a hospital that the assailant attacked security personnel outside the club before shooting randomly inside. Yildirim says the attacker left a gun inside the venue and escaped by \u201ctaking advantage of the chaos\u201d that ensued. He said three of the wounded remain in critical condition.\u00a0 Turkey\u2019s Anadolu Agency reported that 24 of the shooting attack\u2019s 39 victims were citizens of other countries, but didn\u2019t provide a breakdown of their nationalities. The agency quoted opposition lawmaker Ali Seker as telling reporters after visiting a forensic medicine institute that the Turkish victims of the attack included a policeman, a waiter and two security guards employed at the club. Anadolu says authorities still are trying to identify four of the victims. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told CBS News that they were not aware of any U.S. citizen deaths in the attack, despite the apparent presence of many Americans in the neighborhood, including several WNBA players . \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement that a woman with both French and Tunisian citizenship and her Tunisian husband died in the assault. Jordan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said three Jordanians were among the dead. The Lebanese Foreign Ministry said three Lebanese citizens were killed and four were wounded. The ministry reported earlier that the daughter of Parliament Member Estephan El Douaihy was among those injured. \u00a0\u00a0 A Saudi Arabia-funded satellite news channel reported that the assault left seven Saudis dead and 10 wounded. Saudi state media and its Foreign Ministry did not immediately provide their own death tolls or confirm the report Sunday night by the Dubai-based broadcaster Al Arabiya. The channel cited the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul for the information. A Turkish media report said at least seven Saudi nationals and four Iraqis were among the dead. The private Dogan news agency said the dead also included two Indians, two Tunisians and one victim each from Canada, Syria, Israel, Lebanon and Belgium.\u00a0 A Kuwaiti diplomat in Turkey said one Kuwaiti died and five were wounded. The prime minister vowed to keep fighting terror organizations, but notes that, \u201cThe terror that happens here today may happen in another country in the world tomorrow.\u201d Reina owner Mehmet Kocarslan, interviewed by the private Dogan news agency, said police had boosted security measures in the upscale neighborhood of Ortakoy and its vicinity. The measures included tents at key locations with a 24-hour police presence and complementary efforts by the coast guard at sea. \u201cDespite all these precautions by police forces, unfortunately this painful event took place. We don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are at the point where all words end.\u201d President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vehemently condemned \u201cthe terror attack in Istanbul\u2019s Ortakoy neighborhood in the first hours of 2017\u201d and offered condolences for those who lost their lives, including \u201cforeign guests.\u201d The attacker, armed with a long-barreled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside Istanbul\u2019s popular Reina club at around 1:15 a.m. before entering and firing on people partying inside, Gov. Vasip Sahin said. \u201cUnfortunately (he) rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year\u2019s and have fun,\u201d Sahin told reporters. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack and authorities did not name any suspects. The bloodiest attacks that Turkey endured in 2016 were the work of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) or Kurdish militants. Turkey is a member of NATO and a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. The country is also facing renewed conflict with Kurdish rebels in the southeast, and across the border in Syria and Iraq. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the attacker has not been identified and is still at large. \u201cOur security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time,\u201d he said. Private NTV news channel said the assailant entered the upscale nightclub, on the shores of the Bosporus, on the European side of the city, dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. The minister said the lone attacker was believed to have left the club wearing different clothing. At least 15 of the dead were foreign nationals, Soylu said, without providing information on their nationalities. Five of the victims were identified as Turkish nationals while authorities were still trying to identify the rest. At least 69 people were being treated in hospitals, four in serious condition, Soylu said. Three or four of the Turkish victims may have been employees at the nightclub, he said. \u201cThis was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery,\u201d Soylu said. Some customers jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack, the NTV report said. Mehmet Dag, 22, was passing by the club and saw the suspect shoot at a police officer and a bystander. He said the suspect then targeted security, gunning them down and entering the club. \u201cOnce he went in, we don\u2019t know what happened. There were gun sounds, and after two minutes the sound of an explosion.\u201d IPhone footage filmed by Dag and obtained by The Associated Press showed a police officer lying on the ground outside the club, and then a woman. Dag told the woman, who was lying on the floor face down in a pool of blood, \u201cmy sister, you will get better.\u201d He called for an ambulance. Footage showed ambulances and the lights of an Istanbul bridge when the sound of gunfire rang out inside the club. Sinem Uyanik was inside the club with her husband, who was wounded in the attack. \u201cBefore I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,\u201d she said outside Istanbul\u2019s Sisli Etfal Hospital. \u201cI had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out. It was frightening.\u201d Her husband was not in serious condition despite sustaining three wounds. The nightclub area remained sealed off on Sunday morning. Heavily armed police blocked the snowy street in front of the nightclub where the entrance was covered with blue plastic sheeting below a Turkish flag. Police patrolled the Asian side of the Bosporus on the other side of the club. Crime scene investigators were seen inside the club searching through piles of mingled chairs, tables and pieces of clothing left behind during the panic among the guests. And there were emotional scenes in front of a city morgue where those shot dead were brought for identification. Some relatives cried out and fell to the ground as they apparently learned the fate of their loved ones. Major attacks carried out by ISIS or Kurdish militants killed more than 180 people in Istanbul and Ankara alone in 2016. On Dec. 10, a double bomb attack outside a soccer stadium near the Reina nightclub killed 45 people and wounded some 150 others. The attack was claimed by Turkey-based Kurdish militant group, the Kurdish Freedom Falcons. Killer's family reportedly detained in Russian diplomat murder probe Nine days later, an off-duty Turkish riot policeman assassinated Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at a photo exhibition in the capital, Ankara. The government has suggested that a movement led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was behind the killing - an accusation the cleric has denied. \u201cTurkey continues its combat against terror and is absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary in the region to ensure its citizens safety and peace,\u201d said President Erdogan in a written statement Sunday. The nightclub attack drew quick condemnation from the West and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his Turkish counterpart a a telegram of condolences, saying \u201cit is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations.\u201d \u201cHowever, terrorists don\u2019t share moral values. Our common duty is to combat terrorists\u2019 aggression,\u201d Putin said. The White House condemned what it called a \u201chorrific terrorist attack\u201d and offered U.S. help to Turkey. The U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul reminded U.S. citizens \u201cthat extremist groups are continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks in areas where U.S. citizens and expatriates reside or frequent.\u201d European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini tweeted: \u201cOur thoughts are with victims and their loved ones. We continue to work to prevent these tragedies.\u201d An estimated 600 people were celebrating inside the club that is often frequented by famous locals, including singers, actors and sports stars. Several shocked revelers were seen fleeing the scene after the attack and the music fell silent. The prime minister\u2019s office issued a media blackout on the events and asked media to refrain from broadcasting and publishing anything that may cause \u201cfear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\u201d Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some disguised as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey\u2019s Anadolu news agency reported. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The two real estate titans have already collaborated on the Trump International Golf Club, where luxury villas have racked up almost $2 billion in sales. Amid concerns about potential conflicts of interest, Trump has promised he won't be making any new business deals while in office. But Sajwani said his ties to the Trumps extend beyond the president-elect \u2014 to daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr. \"All his three children are very much involved, and I think under their leadership we will have no issue in expanding and growing and maintaining our business relation,\" Sajwani said. \"They are very much involved with the details,\" Sajwani said. \"They're very protective of their brand.\" Donald and Ivanka Trump with Dubai developer Hussein Sajwani. Masala.com \"My wife and Ivanka are very good friends,\" he added. \"They send emails. She's been here to my house. We've been in New York having lunch and dinners with them regularly. And, you know, you enjoy working with somebody \u2014 it's not only cold business relation.\" Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. have all represented the brand to wealthy foreigners \u2014 who often have links to powerful politicians \u2014 from Canada and Turkey to South America and Central Asia. Ivanka has posted on social media about business meetings in at least 13 countries since 2010. Sajwani recalled that Ivanka was pregnant when she was working on the project and \"quite involved until almost a few days before delivery.\" He happened to be in New York three days after she gave birth, and he marveled that Ivanka got on the phone to talk business with him and was back in the office a couple of days after that. He said he met then-candidate Trump before the election for the opening of his Washington hotel. Over dinner, he said, it became clear that if Trump won, he would need to hand over the reins of the business to the younger generation. Sajwani was back in the United States after the election and met with Ivanka, who is now exploring a possible move to Washington to be closer to the White House. Play ",

Hu DNA double helix strand viewed with a phone Stanislaw Pytel / Getty Images Share advertisement Well before the family came in to the Batson Children's Specialty Clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, they knew something was wrong. Their child was born with multiple birth defects, and didn't look like any of its kin. A couple of tests for genetic syndromes came back negative, but Omar Abdul-Rahman, Chief of Medical Genetics at the University of Mississippi, had a strong hunch that the child had Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a rare disease associated with challenging life-long symptoms like speech impediments and seizures. So he pulled out one of his most prized physicians' tools: his cell phone. Using an app called Face2Gene, Abdul-Rahman snapped a quick photo of the child's face. Within a matter of seconds, the app generated a list of potential diagnoses \u2014 and corroborated his hunch. \"Sure enough, Mowat-Wilson syndrome came up on the list,\" Abdul-Rahman recalls. Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future Abdul-Rahman is a member of Face2Gene's scientific advisory board, and he's one of the many physicians and researchers working with its developers to identify syndromes and diseases using facial recognition software. Like many of the 7,000 known rare diseases out there, Mowat-Wilson syndrome has a specific facial signature: square face, pointed chin, widely set eyes. Face2Gene's algorithms map points on a patient's face, compare those points with a database containing points from thousands of other faces, and suggest potential diagnoses. Facial recognition app Face2Gene is being used by doctors to diagnose rare diseases. Courtesy FDNA Doing this all with a single photo is a neat trick, but the real power of the app lies in its long-term potential. Face2Gene's system uses a machine-learning algorithm, meaning it learns from every new face it scans. The more data it acquires through its use, scientists hope, the more accurate the diagnoses. This is the latest medical technology that leverages the power of big data to make better diagnoses and more accurate predictions; other artificial intelligence systems analyze patient symptoms or medical scans to predict cancers and crunch numbers to provide personalized treatments. Early diagnosis of rare diseases can help families seek specialized treatments, yet families often wait years for test results and referrals to specialists. That's because the facial signatures of some rare diseases can be subtle and difficult to diagnose, even for a trained professional. Related: Is Perfecting Artificial Intelligence This Generations Space Race? Most experienced physicians have only seen a handful of patients with a specific rare disease \u2014 hardly enough to notice distinct patterns. \"Only when you have hundreds or thousands of patients can you really say there's a pattern,\" FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman says. \"That's where the computer power comes in.\" Face2Gene is publicly available, but there's still a lot to learn, so its developers recommend only experts use it. When you download the app via the iTunes store, you're asked to certify your credentials as a healthcare professional before you complete signing up. The technology is meant to be a tool to help identify diseases and syndromes; as a result, Face2Gene isn't yet great at recognizing the faces of typically developing children. \"If you take a picture of a normal individual, it will still try to match them to the closest possible syndrome,\" Abdul-Rahman says. \"If you're inexperienced and you use it on a random individual, it will suggest a diagnosis anyway.\" Face2Gene's predictions could lead an inexperienced user to false positives; it takes an experienced professional to take the app's suggestions and interpret them in the context of other clinical symptoms, or to order genetic tests. Still, it could help a wider range of medical professionals make diagnoses. Pediatricians, nurse practioners, and physicians' assistants may all see patients with genetic disorders, and Face2Gene could help those professionals screen children, says Rich Dineen, genetic counselor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Dineen has not yet used the app himself, so he's skeptical it will replace years of medical experience \u2014 but he's hopeful it will help the field. \"Any sort of technology we can use to make our job easier is a great thing,\" he says. Related: How the Tech Industry is Tackling the Cancer Moonshot The technology certainly helped Abdul-Rahman and his patient. After getting Face2Gene's opinion, he sent in an order for a genetic test, which verified the child's diagnosis: Mowat-Wilson syndrome. That put an end to the family's long search for a formal diagnosis, he says. \"When the test came back, they were elated to finally have an answer.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

    "text": "advertisement TOKYO \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hinted Sunday that Pyongyang may ring in the new year with another bang \u2014 the test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. In his annual New Year's address, Kim said that after testing what the North claims was its first hydrogen bomb last year, preparations for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile have \"reached the final stage.\" Kim did not explicitly say an ICBM test, which if successful would be a big step forward for the North, was imminent. But he has a birthday coming up on Jan. 8, and last year Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6. A picture released by North Korean news agency, KCNA (Korean Central News Agency) on January 1, 2017 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un delivering the new year message in Pyongyang. STRINGER / AFP - Getty Images Kim threatened in the address to boost his country's military capabilities further unless the U.S. ends war games with rival South Korea. But he also said efforts must be made to defuse the possibility of another Korean war and stressed the importance of building the economy under a five-year plan announced in May. \"The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented as an invincible fortress,\" Kim said, according to an outline of the speech carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. \"We should resolutely smash the enemies' despicable and vicious moves to dampen the pure and ardent desire of the people for the party and estrange the people from it.\" Related: Here's How Trump Vowed to Deal with 'Bad Dudes' Like Kim The address was shown on television mixing video with Kim speaking and stretches of audio only, as still photos were broadcast. It was less than 30 minutes long. South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns\" Kim's threat to proceed with a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile and strengthen North Korea's nuclear-strike capabilities. It said that the international community will not tolerate North Korean efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that the North will only face tougher sanctions and pressure if it continues to go down that path. Under Kim, who rose to power following his father's death in 2011, North Korea has seen steady progress in its nuclear and missile programs, including two nuclear tests in 2016. It recently claimed a series of technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States. Related: Kim Jong Un's Nuclear Ambitions to Challenge Trump U.N. resolutions call for an end to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. Kim appears uninterested in complying. The year ahead could be a tumultuous one in north Asia, with Donald Trump set to become the new U.S. president on Jan. 20, and South Korea's politics in disarray over a scandal that brought the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. Kim indicated there will be no change in the North's nuclear policy unless Washington makes a big, conciliatory first move, which, even with the advent of Trump, would seem unlikely. Trump has somewhat offhandedly suggested he would be willing to meet with Kim \u2014 but not in North Korea \u2014 and has at the same time indicated that he wants China to exert significantly more control over Pyongyang to get it to abandon its nuclear program.

    "text": "Dec 30 2016, 11:38 am ET Can VR Make You a Better Person? by Christina Couch A man wearing headphones and VR glasses watches films at the Virtual Reality cinema in Amsterdam. Sander Koning / AFP - Getty Images Share advertisement If the world feels like a colder, meaner place these days, virtual reality may come to the rescue. Researchers across the globe are using immersive digital worlds to place users in someone else's shoes and, at least temporarily, help them become kinder, more compassionate people. Virtual reality is better known for its potential in gaming, but scientists, as well as filmmakers, writers, artists, and designers, are using VR to reduce racial bias, promote environmentalism , encourage empathy for prisoners , humanize political enemies , or even help users make better financial choices. It's working, to some extent. \"We have spent the past fifteen years designing experiments to test the efficacy of VR to teach empathy. Across dozens of studies, a pattern emerges in that VR tends to be a more effective tool than other media and role-playing techniques,\" Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, says via email. Related: 11 Surprising Predictions From the Top Names in Science Though changes are often small, Bailenson adds, studies repeatedly show that virtual reality experiences can impact thoughts and behaviors in the real world. Sun Joo (Grace) Ahn has observed these behavioral changes first hand. In 2011, then a graduate student in Bailenson's lab, Ahn sent study participants a questionnaire to determine how likely they were to understand the perspective of others. Two days later, the participants were provided with basic information about red-green colorblindness \u2014 a visual disorder that causes difficulty distinguishing between certain hues \u2014 and asked to verbally guide a person they believed to be colorblind through a series of virtual reality color-matching exercises. A guest views Prabal Gurung's Samsung Gear 360 photographs on the Samsung Gear VR at Soho Beach House on November 30, 2016 in Miami Beach, Florida. Bryan Bedder / Getty Images Some participants viewed the exercises through a filter that simulated colorblindness, while others completed the exercises without the filter. Ahn found that after seeing the world through a colorblind lens, study subjects who originally weren't as likely to understand the perspective of others showed more favorable attitudes towards colorblind people a full day after the exercise had ended. That attitude also translated into action. A separate experiment that asked study subjects to help a student group attempting to build colorblind-friendly websites showed that participants who experienced virtual colorblindness themselves, even for just a few minutes, spent about twice as long helping, compared to participants in the control group. VR has been shown to drive behavioral changes across a wide array of scenarios. In Barcelona, light-skinned people who navigated a virtual world as a dark-skinned avatar showed lower subconscious racial bias than those who used an avatar with a closer skin tone to their own. To study if taking the perspective of non-human creatures could motivate people to care more about environmental issues, Stanford University created a time-lapse simulation that allows users to assume the avatar of a piece of coral and watch as ocean acidification corrodes their digital limbs. Researchers observed that those who completed the VR experience perceived acidification to be a more imminent environmental problem than people who watched the same images on video without a VR headset. Courtesy of Stanford University But it doesn't take a university-backed research team to create VR empathy initiatives. iAnimal \u2014 a project launched earlier this year by the advocacy group, Animal Equality \u2014 is a series of virtual reality films detailing life inside factory farms. The first installment shows viewers the lifecycle of a factory-farmed pig, from birth to slaughter, in part from the animal's perspective. Since its release, the film has racked up more than 40,000 views and can be experienced in VR at home with Google Cardboard through the organization's YouTube channel. \"We are sure that this is far more impactful than watching a video on a tablet,\" says Jose Valle, Animal Equality co-founder and director of investigations. \"Even if it's difficult and some people cry when they watch it, they think it's really important to show it to others.\" Related: How Computers Are Learning to Predict the Future Virtual reality doesn't just encourage empathy for external beings; it can also teach us to think differently about how we treat ourselves. A separate Stanford study placed research subjects in a virtual environment and had each of them interact with either an avatar that looked like them currently or an avatar designed to look like a future, elderly version of themselves. After exiting the VR environment, subjects who interacted with their elderly selves were significantly more willing to set aside money for retirement than those who interacted with avatars modeled after their current appearances. Ahn, lead author on the coral study and now director of the Games and Virtual Environments Lab at the University of Georgia, says that virtual reality makes an impact, in part because it fills in some of the perceptual blanks that prevent us from truly understanding another person's condition or circumstance. \"Perspective-taking\" \u2014 the process of imagining life from another person's point of view \u2014 often relies on a relatively small amount of information and a lot of imagination as the brain extrapolates all of the various ways that information affects another person's life, often based on assumptions from our own lives. iAnimal users. Courtesy of Animal Equality / Courtesy of Animal Equality With virtual reality, less extrapolation is required. Instead of imagining a world with distorted reds and greens, VR can ask users to search through a digital closet for the right color shirt, feeling all the emotions that go along with that action. Short VR experiences, when compared to traditional video of the same length, make more of an impact because, Ahn believes, VR's extra sensory input helps imprint the experience more in the brain. \"Virtual simulations tend to mimic what you might experience in the physical world so there's a lot more detail for you to create a mental schema, a memory of this experience as if it happened to you in the real world,\" she says. \"When you are trying to recall that experience later on, it's a lot more salient. You have a lot more details to recall. It's easier for you to build this mental map of what you experienced in your memory.\" Related: How the Tech Industry is Tackling the Cancer Moonshot There's a growing body of scientific literature, Ahn's included, dedicated to uncovering how this salience can be used to encourage positive behaviors, but the best ways to get long-lasting effects aren't yet set in stone, and Ahn says more research examining long-term repeated use of empathy-building VR programs is needed. Even with data showing VR's short-term impact, these projects still fight an uphill battle to change the psyche. Projects aimed at reducing racial bias, for example, may provide short exercises that challenge a user's subconscious prejudices, but those projects compete against a daily deluge of information from the real world that reinforces racial bias through experiences like living in segregated neighborhoods and absorbing media that promotes stereotypes. \"Putting people in contact situations, particularly cooperative ones, is the most likely thing to reduce racial prejudice, though it's no guarantee,\" says Jim Blascovich, director of the Research Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Virtual reality can be a tool to facilitate those meaningful experiences and potentially erode bias over time, but it can't magically solve racism, or any other systemic problem, on its own, Blascovich says. Related: This App is Revolutionizing Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Empathy isn't a cure-all either according to Erika Weisz, a graduate student in Stanford University's Social Neuroscience Laboratory who studies how different motivations drive people toward or away from using empathy. The ability to understand the feelings of others is \"morally neutral,\" Weisz says over e-mail, and \"exquisitely context sensitive.\" While empathy can motivate us to act kinder and become better people, it can also \"be hijacked, or used to promote different agendas regardless of their moral composition.\" Both Weisz and Blascovich believe virtual reality can be a valuable tool in helping us better understand others, a significant step to becoming nicer people and enacting positive change. \"It's not a panacea,\" Blascovich says, \"but it's probably as good or better than anything else we've ever tried.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

Play was not interrupted on the field during Sunday\u2019s game, but eight rows of fans seated below the banner were cleared as a precaution. The two protesters -- a man and a woman -- were later arrested for trespassing, Minneapolis police spokesman Officer Corey Schmidt said.

Police spoke with them from a catwalk in attempt to get them to stop, and by the fourth quarter about a half-dozen police and firefighters in rappelling gear were on the truss waiting to remove the pair.\u00a0 A Minneapolis police officer escorts a protester from U.S. Bank Stadium after an NFL football game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017, in Minneapolis.\u00a0 Close Andy Clayton-King, AP But the protesters willingly climbed up their ropes as soon as the game was over. After speaking with authorities, they climbed down the stairs toward the concourse while being booed by a handful of fans who stayed to watch. Vikings spokesman Lester Bagley said the team\u2019s only concern is about the \u201csafety of our fans and guests.\u201d Protesters say U.S. Bank has extended a large credit line to Energy Transfer Partners. U.S. Bank spokesman Dana Ripley declined comment. The pipeline would carry oil from western North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois where it can be shipped on to users.

    "text": "John Fox after Bears' season-ending loss: 'I've never worried about job security' Photos of John Fox, the Bears'\u00a015th head coach. Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The Bears completed a dismal 3-13 season with a 38-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The team finished the year with a four-game losing streak, the longest skid in the John Fox era. Now, with their third-straight last-place finish in the books, the Bears will begin their heavy lifting, evaluating what changes are needed and just how high up the chain they may go. After Sunday\u2019s loss, Fox addressed reporters. Here are a few quick highlights from that press conference. On losing the final two games by a combined score of 79-31 \u2026 We were minus-10 (in the turnover department). When you give the ball away that many times, the math usually doesn\u2019t work very good. So really in the last three games of the year, we were five, five and four (turnovers) even against Green Bay. And we had a chance to win against Green Bay. Kept it close. But these last two became problematic. On whether he has asked for or received assurance that he would be the Bears coach in 2017 \u2026 You know I really haven\u2019t. I think at the end of the day, I\u2019ve been doing this a long time. I\u2019ve never worried about job security. And I\u2019m not going to start now. On whether he at least had a sense that he\u2019d be back for next season \u2026 The one thing I\u2019ve learned about this league is a lot of different things can happen. But I\u2019m not going to get into all that now. I\u2019m trying to get over this loss.\u00a0 Rich Campbell John Fox made the long, lonely loser's walk from midfield to the visiting locker room Sunday after his team went out with barely a whimper. He disappeared into the tunnel, headed toward questions about his future and the direction of the team. The Bears ' final impotent performance of this awful... John Fox made the long, lonely loser's walk from midfield to the visiting locker room Sunday after his team went out with barely a whimper. He disappeared into the tunnel, headed toward questions about his future and the direction of the team. The Bears ' final impotent performance of this awful... (Rich Campbell) On what he feels has been established this season and in the past two seasons combined \u2026 I think we\u2019ve made a lot of roster changes. And some of them this year were not by design due to injury. I think it\u2019s given us a chance to find out about guys like a Cam Meredith, a Jordan Howard. We\u2019ve got a lot of young guys on our roster that were probably further down the depth chart to begin with. I think we\u2019ve built depth, which we did not have. And you saw that even very early in the preseason, when you line up against playoff teams. That\u2019s a very good indicator. \u2026 So I thought as we probably need to improve the front line (talent-wise) as well as our depth. But that\u2019s something we\u2019ve gotten better at. I feel better about that at this time this year than I did at this time last year. Now we\u2019ll see where it goes. On evaluating the coaching staff going forward \u2026 You evaluate everything. Our whole season. I think from the injuries to turnovers and the lack of (on defense). You just evaluate the whole season. And that includes everybody involved. On whether he has final say on coaching staff decisions \u2026 I\u2019ve never really gotten into all that final say stuff. I think when you have people who look at things logically, you usually come to the same conclusion. Vikings 38, Bears 10: What's next for the Bears after a discouraging season? Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. Tribune writers Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs react to the Bears' 38-10 season-ending loss to the Vikings and discuss what's next as the team prepares for the offseason. See more videos On his working relationship with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio \u2026 I think it\u2019s good. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for anybody. I know (losing) isn\u2019t easy for (media). I know it\u2019s not easy for us or our fans. But when you\u2019re going through 3-13, it\u2019s never easy. Regardless of what coach or personalities or whatever you\u2019re referring to, I wouldn\u2019t want to single out one guy. It\u2019s a very competitive game. On whether he has questioned his dedication to this job after a season like this and whether he wants to be back \u2026 When you start something, you want to finish it. I think compared to situations I was in (elsewhere) and chose to leave, this is a job I wanted. I think a lot of this organization. I think a lot of this city. I think a lot of the tradition of this team. I\u2019ve worked in a couple of different organizations that are similar as far as they\u2019ve been around for a long time. But it\u2019s definitely a job I want to finish. dwiederer@chicagotribune.com ",

The resolution also reaffirms the U.N.'s commitment to Syria's sovereignty, and notes that the \"only sustainable solution to the current crisis\" is through an \"inclusive and Syria-led political process.\" The U.N. also reiterated its calls for humanitarian aid to have \"rapid, safe, and unhindered access throughout Syria.\" Earlier this week, a cease-fire in Syria was brokered by Russia and Turkey .

Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump , expressing lingering skepticism about intelligence assessments of Russian interference in the election, said on Saturday evening that he knew \u201cthings that other people don\u2019t know\u201d about the hacking, and that the information would be revealed \u201con Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d Speaking to a handful of reporters outside his Palm Beach, Fla., club, Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump cast his declarations of doubt as an effort to seek the truth. \u201cI just want them to be sure because it\u2019s a pretty serious charge,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the intelligence agencies. \u201cIf you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong,\u201d he added, referring to intelligence cited by the George W. Bush administration to support its march to war in 2003. \u201cSo I want them to be sure,\u201d the president-elect said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair if they don\u2019t know.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don\u2019t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d When asked what he knew that others did not, Mr. Trump demurred, saying only, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump, who does not use email, also advised people to avoid computers when dealing with delicate material. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way, because I\u2019ll tell you what, no computer is safe,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, no computer is safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI have a boy who\u2019s 10 years old; he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier.\u201d The comments on Saturday were a departure from a statement that Mr. Trump issued through transition officials last week, in which he said that it was time for people to \u201cmove on\u201d from the hacking issue but that he would be briefed on the matter by intelligence officials early in the new year. On Thursday, President Obama ordered a set of retaliatory measures against Russia over the election hacking. The United States expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shuttered two estates that it claimed had been used for intelligence-gathering. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, declined to respond in kind to the measures, a gesture that Mr. Trump appeared to view favorably. He praised it on Twitter and criticized news media coverage that had been harsh about Russia. Mr. Trump, who has sought a warmer relationship with Mr. Putin, has repeatedly scoffed at the notion that Russia was behind the hacking, a stance at odds with members of his own party. At one point, Mr. Trump declared that the hacking may have been the work of \u201csomeone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 1, 2017, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Promises to Reveal More About Hacking.

    "text": "By Mike DeBonis January 1 at 7:29 PM Follow @mikedebonis President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether critical computer networks can ever be protected from intruders, alarming cybersecurity experts who say his comments could upend more than a decade of national cybersecurity policy and put both government and private data at risk. Asked late Saturday about Russian hacking allegations and his cybersecurity plans, Trump told reporters that \u201cno computer is safe\u201d and that, for intelligence officials, \u201chacking is a very hard thing to prove.\u201d \u201cYou want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier,\u201d he said as he entered a New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. [ Obama administration announces measures to punish Russia for 2016 election ] \u201cI think that computers have complicated lives very greatly,\u201d Trump said earlier last week. He tweets prolifically but says he rarely uses any other communications technology more advanced than the telephone. \u201cThe whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on. We have speed, we have a lot of other things, but I\u2019m not sure you have the kind of security that you need.\u201d Since President George W. Bush moved to develop a comprehensive national cybersecurity policy after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government has made a top priority of preserving the integrity of the public- and private-sector computer networks that enable modern commerce and society. Trump delivered a campaign address in October that deemed cybersecurity \u201ca major priority for both the government and the private sector\u201d and said that cyberattacks from both state and non-state actors \u201cconstitute one of our most critical national security concerns.\u201d But the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s determination that Russia engaged in a state-sponsored hacking effort aimed at electing Trump has prompted the president-elect to openly question the reliability of that assessment while simultaneously taking aim at the broader notion of cybersecurity. [ FBI in agreement with CIA that Russia aimed to help Trump win White House ] Experts said Sunday that Trump\u2019s comments and his handling of the Russian hacking allegations could embolden foreign hackers and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s ability to respond to them. Michael Sulmeyer, a former Defense Department policy adviser who directs the cybersecurity project for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, referred to one of Trump\u2019s earliest efforts \u2014 during a presidential debate in September \u2014 to cast doubt on allegations of Russian interference on his behalf. \u201cThis is not some issue about a 400-pound hacker in a bedroom who might be mischievous,\u201d Sulmeyer said. \u201cThese are real threats to our country, and the concerning part for me is to see how this issue has become politicized and made partisan.\u201d Although some Republicans have pushed for a sharper response to the Russian hacking \u2014 notably Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) \u2014 many others have joined Trump in playing down the intense coverage and debate. \u201cRussia spying on the U.S. is not news,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a top Trump ally. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do. A lot is being made about something that\u2019s already known. To all the people acting shocked, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re shocked there is gambling going on in a casino.\u201d Transition spokesman Sean Spicer, slated to become White House communications director upon Trump\u2019s inauguration, said Sunday that intelligence officials will brief Trump this week on the election-related hacking. He suggested on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the retaliatory sanctions President Obama imposed against Russia last week \u2014 which included the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence agents \u2014 may not have been justified. \u201cThe question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken?\u201d Spicer said. \u201cMaybe it was, maybe it wasn\u2019t, but you have to think about that.\u201d Spicer compared the Obama administration\u2019s sharp response to the recent Russian hacking with its reaction to last year\u2019s revelation that hackers linked to the Chinese government stole the personal data of millions of federal employees. \u201cNot one thing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there is a question about whether there\u2019s a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response.\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, drew a sharp distinction between the two cases and called on Trump \u201cto stop denigrating the intelligence community.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t just steal data; they weaponized it,\u201d he said of Russia, also on the ABC program. \u201cThey dumped it during an election with the specific intent of influencing the outcomes of that election and sowing discord in the United States. That is not something China has ever done.\u201d Ari Schwartz, who served as the top cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council in 2015, said in an interview that Spicer misjudged the Obama administration\u2019s response to the employee data hack. Private talks with the Chinese government, he said, resulted in a demonstrable decline in state-sponsored hacking. \u201cWe came up with ways of dealing with them and working with them,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cIt proves that the sanctions work. Even the threat of the sanctions have changed Chinese behavior.\u201d Trump\u2019s recent comments, Schwartz said, point to a possible recalibration of cybersecurity policy \u2014 one that could shift the careful balance of innovation and security embraced by both Bush and Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to the world of couriers and letter-writing; we\u2019re going to continue to do things online,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are ways to do it where you can manage risk, and that\u2019s really what the goal should be here \u2014 to get to the point where we can have the efficiencies and the benefits and still be secure.\u201d What remains unclear is to what degree Trump\u2019s views on cybersecurity will remain filtered through the prism of the Russian hacking affair. In his October campaign speech, he pledged to undertake a comprehensive review of national cybersecurity systems, create law enforcement task forces to combat cybercriminals and strengthen the military\u2019s Cyber Command. In a sign that he plans to follow through on those plans, last week he chose Thomas P. Bossert, a Bush administration official who played a central role in cybersecurity planning, as his top White House assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism. On the Russian hacking, Trump said Saturday that he knows \u201cthings that other people don\u2019t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to his upcoming intelligence briefings. As long as Trump openly doubts the intelligence community\u2019s ability to accurately assign responsibility for cyberattacks, he could find it difficult to identify, fend off and retaliate against cyberattackers. He has publicly compared the intelligence community\u2019s Russian hacking assessment to its erroneous determination that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction \u2014 a comparison Spicer repeated Sunday. Said Sulmeyer: \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to make a full-fledged apology or correction about Russian hacking, okay, but at some point, they\u2019re going to have to come out and explain their understanding of the threat and what they want to do about it. If we see that soon, I think that\u2019s a good sign. If that slips, I think that will be an indicator that they are not prioritizing it and they are leaving the American people at greater risk.\u201d Robert Costa and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

While many states already restrict the use of cell phones in the car, California is now taking that precaution a step further. As of Sunday, it's illegal for drivers to hold their phones behind the wheel. The devices must be mounted and can be used only for functions that require a single tap or swipe, like answering a call. \"If you're not paying attention and something happens in front of you, by the time your mind thinks about it and you react to it, it is definitely too late,\" says Officer Jesus Chavez of the California Highway Patrol. Meanwhile, Philadelphia becomes the first major American city with a tax on sugary sodas \u2014 one and a half cents an ounce. That's 24 cents for a 16-ounce drink. The industry is challenging the law in court.

Berkeley, California, was the first city to impose such a sugar tax, adopting it in 2015. When Michael Bloomberg was New York's mayor, he attempted to have a similar tax imposed by the board of health, but a court said only New York's city council had that power.

Sheriff Mike Sharp of Jackson County was among law enforcement officials who opposed the idea. \"This law would allow anybody to go get a gun, carry it, and never have to fire the weapon until they think it's necessary to use it, without any education whatsoever,\" he said. But a sponsor of the new law, State Senator Brian Munzlinger, discounted fears of more gun violence. \"The basis of this whole bill is that it allows law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families,\" he said. California, by contrast, imposes tougher gun laws as of the first day of 2017. It's now illegal to sell most AR-15 style rifles with removable magazines, or ammunition clips, banned as assault weapons. Current owners must register them.

Anthony Behar / Sipa USA, file Under a new law in Maine, doctors cannot prescribe more than a seven-day supply of such painkillers Vicodin or Percocet, or a 30-day supply for chronic pain. The measure is intended to reduce opioid abuse. In Colorado, it's now a crime to misrepresent a pet as a service animal. The state says untrained pets interfere with real service dogs. Angela Easton, a service dog trainer, says pet owners often ask for an accessory allowing them to take their dogs almost anywhere. Related: Gun Fight: Is the NRA Losing Its Grip on State Legislatures? \"We get calls from people who want a service dog vest so that they could keep their dog with them all the time.\" Starting today in Illinois, bicycles have the same right of way as cars. The law was passed after a Vietnam veteran, Dennis Jurs, was killed when a driver failed to yield. Drivers in Boston begin the new year with a lower speed limit \u2014 25 miles an hour, down from 30, imposed to reduce traffic deaths. And in Alabama as of Jan 1., there will be no more common law marriages. Getting married to celebrate the New Year will require a license and a ceremony, even one as simple as saying \"I do\" in the county courthouse. Pete Williams ",

Heather (Shorty) Burkinshaw-Stanley said she was only trying to defend herself and her co-workers, The Newnan Times-Herald reported Sunday. \u201cI was in fear for my life, my co-workers\u2019 lives, and I did what I thought was right,\u201d she told the paper. Three men ate at Burkinshaw-Stanley\u2019s Waffle House early Thursday. Instead of paying for their meal, the men gave the cashier a note threatening to shoot everyone if their demand for money from the register wasn\u2019t met, the paper reported. Police said they left after another waitress gave them $200. Burkinshaw-Stanley said her gun was in her car. \u201cI safely fired a round in the air in an attempt to scare the robbers who were in the process of getting in their vehicle, not knowing if they were retrieving their weapon to return to the Waffle House,\u201d she said on GoFundMe . \u201cMy shot must have gotten their attention as they rapidly drove off.\u201d The paper reports that Burkinshaw-Stanley was told she was fired on Friday. She had worked at the Waffle House for two years. A Waffle House spokesman declined to discuss the matter, the paper reported. Burkinshaw-Stanley said she was seeking donations because she is raising three kids and her husband is disabled. Advertisement ",

In fact, it feels like I\u2019ve been tired ever since I read Andrew Grove\u2019s book \u201cOnly the Paranoid Survive\u201d a decade and a half ago. That book was the beginning of a sea change in my thinking about work, business, hustling and survival itself \u2014 so much so that I\u2019ve been working like a fanatic ever since. Up at 5 in the morning? Tried it! Daily workouts? Yep. Paleo, bulletproof , gluten-free, cold showers ? Check. Build a business, start a side hustle, dominate Twitter, Instagram and Facebook? Yeah, all that too! Make my family a priority? Of course. Serve in my community? Definitely. For 5,478 days, I\u2019ve been hitting repeat, and it\u2019s killing me. I know I\u2019m not alone. The last 10 years have felt like the #CrushIt decade. Every time you turn around, somebody is crushing something. Gary Vaynerchuk wrote the book on it, and according to him , people \u201cneed to work harder. And faster. There\u2019s really nothing else to it. I\u2019m exhausted every day, but I\u2019m making all sorts of things happen in my 18 hours.\u201d Carl\u2019s Confession The Sketch Guy, on resolving to rest more in 2017. He added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m prioritizing what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not.\u201d So, there we have it. We can add \u201cexhausted\u201d to words like \u201ccynical\u201d and \u201cbusy\u201d that we wear as badges of honor. As crazy as it all sounds, I have to admit to having believed it. A part of me in some dark corner of my mind whispers: \u201cThis is all true, Carl. If you don\u2019t keep hustling, you\u2019ll end up falling behind, and no one will listen to you. Ever. Again. Then, you\u2019ll just be another failure, left to crawl under a rock, cold and alone to die!\u201d But since I\u2019ve appointed myself King of Permission Granting , I hereby grant everyone the permission to declare the #CrushIt decade finished. January 2017 will be the official start of the \u201cWork Hard, Rest Hard\u201d decade. We are going to hustle, sure. But we\u2019re also going to rest. In fact, we\u2019re going to be as good at resting as we are at crushing things. Advertisement We\u2019re going to become pros at turning off social media , getting great sleep , working less and living more. We\u2019re going to make being rested cool. We\u2019re going to write about, share and celebrate people like Jason Fried, who switched his company to a four-day workweek during the summer . Then, when people ask how you\u2019re doing, you can say, \u201cSit down. Let\u2019s talk about it for a minute, because I have time for you, my friend.\u201d At minimum, you should be able to answer, \u201cRested, and how are you?\u201d I know this sounds like crazy talk, but we can do it. Make it a priority to be human again \u2014 to work hard and to rest hard without buying into the idea that we\u2019ll fail at life if we rest.

Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo passes during a\u00a0practice on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 2016, in Foxborough, Mass. (Elise Amendola / AP) Steve Rosenbloom Contact Reporter The RosenBlog The Bears are done embarrassing themselves this season \u2014 John Fox \u2019s \u201ctry hard\u201d clown act capped the embarrassment with a 38-10 loss Sunday in Minnesota \u2014 which means they now can become relevant. To become relevant beyond next season\u2019s opener, however, they will need a new quarterback. They also need a new coach. They always need a quarterback and coach at Halas Hall. Same goes for a Football Yoda and new ownership, but good luck getting this outfit to act professional and successful these days. Let\u2019s just talk about a new quarterback who isn\u2019t the disastrous Matt Barkley , the uninspiring Brian Hoyer or the hopeless Jay Cutler.\u00a0This year\u2019s best rumor available suggests they go after Patriots backup Jimmy Garoppolo, and it makes for a nice story: The Arlington Heights kid who played at Eastern Illinois coming back to Chicago. But let me ask you something: How many quarterbacks have left the Patriots and won a title? Or even played well? Most notably, the Patriots traded Matt Cassel to the Chiefs along with Mike Vrabel in 2009 for a second-round draft pick that became safety Patrick Chung , who helped the Patriots get to two Super Bowls and win one. The Bears completed a dismal 3-13 season with a 38-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The team finished the year with a four-game losing streak, the longest skid in the John Fox era. Now, with their third-straight last-place finish in the books, the Bears will begin their heavy... The Bears completed a dismal 3-13 season with a 38-10 loss to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. The team finished the year with a four-game losing streak, the longest skid in the John Fox era. Now, with their third-straight last-place finish in the books, the Bears will begin their heavy... (Dan Wiederer) Cassel, meanwhile, saw his completion percentage drop by almost five points, his interception percentage jump by almost a full point and his passer rating fall by almost 11 points in Kansas City. And remember, Cassel was a guy who started 15 games for the Patriots. He should\u2019ve been a known quantity. Garoppolo isn\u2019t. Isn\u2019t even close. Garoppolo has started just two NFL games, both this season, and, yeah, he completed more than 70 percent with four touchdowns and no interceptions, but then he got injured. So what do you really know? Other than he gets hurt like a Bears first-rounder, I mean. But listen, here\u2019s the big issue: Do you really want Bears wonks trying to make a deal with Bill Belichick? The Bears can\u2019t evaluate their own safety spots, and you want titular GM Ryan Pace and Dowell Loggains-supporting coach John Fox to deal with the smartest man in football? You know how the stock market has a circuit breaker to halt trading in order to prevent a disastrous crash? The NFL should have some kind of alarm that sounds automatically when someone at Halas Hall calls Foxborough. Look what happened last offseason. The Bears traded Pro Bowl tight end Martellus Bennett because Fox can\u2019t coach players with personalities. The Bears got a 2016 fourth-round pick in that deal, and instead of using it on quarterback Dak Prescott, the Bears chose a defensive back who can\u2019t stop committing penalties. ",

Two protesters rappel from the rafters with a banner against the Dakota Access Pipeline during a game Sunday between the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears at U.S. Bank Stadium. Brace Hemmelgarn / Reuters The incident began at 12:47 p.m. (1:47 p.m. ET), when authorities spotted two people near the roof of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, police said in a statement. The two men, identified as Karl Mayo, 32, and Sen Holiday, 26, according to the statement, were near the stadium's roof when they unfurled a massive white banner that said \"Divest #NoDAPL,\" a reference to the movement against the $3.8 billion pipeline . (A statement obtained by NBC station KARE, which quotes the protesters, identifies Mayo as Karl Zimmerman.) At the top of the banner was the logo of U.S. Bank, which won a 20-year naming-rights deal on the facility last year, the Pioneer Press newspaper of St. Paul reported . As the game was played below, Mayo and Holiday allegedly used ropes and harnesses to remain dangling above the crowd until about 3 p.m., the statements said. In the statement obtained by KARE, Holiday is quoted as saying that the protest was carried out \"in solidarity with water protectors from Standing Rock to urge US Bank to divest\" from the pipeline. A U.S. Bank spokesman declined to comment. I'm over in the section now where the protesters are repelling. I'm told the fire department is on the way @kare11 pic.twitter.com/16jjYPR8Yt \u2014 Dave Schwartz (@Dave_Schwartz) January 1, 2017 After the game, the protesters clambered to the ground and were arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor burglary and trespass, the police statement said. An unidentified 27-year-old woman was also issued a trespass notice and released. In an earlier statement, the company that manages the stadium, SMG, said the two protesters appeared to have climbed a guardrail to gain access to the stadium's truss. The protest comes a month and a half after the Army Corps of Engineers announced that more analysis and discussion was needed before it would allow Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, to continue construction. The decision came amid the largest protest in modern American Indian history \u2014 a protest led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North Dakota. The tribe told NBC News on Sunday that it wasn't aware of the protest or its organizers. Divestment is part of the anti-pipeline movement's strategy, with activists using high-profile events to pressure banks to pull financing from the project. Tim Stelloh ",

By David Weigel December 31 at 5:33 PM Follow daveweigel The Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington. (Paul Holston/AP) In 2004, the last time that Democrats comprehensively lost a national election, an argument broke out about how the party should reform. John F. Kerry had been just one state \u2014 Ohio \u2014 away from victory. Democrats had lost Senate seats in red states,\u00a0but held their own in the House and in state legislatures. (Republicans netted three seats, but would have lost a net of two seats but for mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas.) Hillary Clinton loomed as the favorite for the party's 2008 presidential nomination, but it was clear to many pundits that the party needed someone else. No, not Barack Obama. Clearly, the party needed a moderate nominee from red America. There were plenty of takers. Then-Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), who had never lost an election, visited early primary states and warned that \u201cmany Americans wonder if [Democrats are] willing to use force to defend the country even under the most compelling of circumstances.\u201d Then-Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) shamed Democrats for not campaigning harder for Southern voters \u2014 at a DNC meeting, where the right people were watching. In a cover story for the New York Times magazine, then-Gov. Mark Warner (D-Va.) suggested he could win moderate Republicans, his implication being that Clinton could not. Clinton, indeed, did not win the 2008 nomination. Sixteen years of speculation about her inevitable presidency ended on Nov. 8. But the hand-wringing of 2005 is just as instructive as the Republicans' hand-wringing of 2013. In recent history, the most confident analysts of our political parties have argued that victory will come through moderation. They have been completely wrong. Barack Obama became the first Democrat since FDR to win two popular vote majorities; Donald Trump became the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win most of the Midwest. In both cases, the winning party did not so much moderate its stances as run against the failure of the incumbent party. That failure was obvious in 2008 \u2014 arguably, as early as mid-2006 \u2014 in George W. Bush's low approval ratings and the collapsing economy. It was tougher for Democrats to see in 2016, as Obama's approval numbers were high and the metrics usually used to gauge the health of the economy, like employment, stock markets, and GDP, were moving the right way. The culture was moving the right way, too. In 2004, Republicans blindsided and embarrassed Democrats on social issues, leading to a panic over how the party had lost religious voters who agreed with them on economics, especially Hispanic and black voters. This year, the Republican nominee badly lost the popular vote, and while he overperformed with nonwhites compared to Obama's opponents, he underperformed the rest of the GOP's nominees going back to 1972. His 46 percent of the vote was the lowest for any winning Republican nominee since the three-way election of 1968. Unlike in 2004, Democrats do not look at the electorate and see a majority of personal rejection. Gay voters don't see a president-elect who wanted to change the Constitution to prevent them from getting married; they see one who ceded the issue and literally waved a rainbow flag . For that reason, the last seven weeks have seen Democrats cement their move to the left. The only debate over the future of the party is happening in the race to run the Democratic National Committee. As we reported this month, that's reopened some divisions over the 2016 primary, but it's actually seen the party consolidate around left-wing positions. [ Echoes of 2016 fight shape race to run the Democratic National Committee ] Outgoing Labor Secretary Tom Perez, whose biggest impediment in the race is being seen as the establishment opponent of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), has not even tried to defend the Obama administration over the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In a tweet today, already being mocked in pro-Ellison circles, Perez brands himself as a Mother Jones-approved \u201cprogressive who gets things done.\u201d It's not enough to be progressive\u2014We need a progressive who gets things done. pic.twitter.com/iVb0pZz0e3 \u2014 Tom Perez (@TomPerez) December 31, 2016 The DNC race is also notable as the first that includes absolutely no straight white men. (Ray Buckley, the one white male candidate so far, is gay.) In 2005, Democrats looked for another Bill Clinton; in 2013, Republicans surmised that their defeat required a literal autopsy, and probably a candidate who could appeal to the \u201crising electorate\u201d of nonwhites. None of that turned out to be necessary. Yet both the 2008 and 2016 elections went to candidates with economic policies that appealed to working class, mostly rural, white voters. In 2008, Democrats discovered that these most of these voters did not actually care if the candidate selling those policies was a black man. From 2004 to 2008, the party's share of the white vote in Wisconsin rose from 47 percent to 54 percent; in Pennsylvania it rose from 45 percent to 48 percent. In 2012, Trump won those states by flipping the white vote, grabbing 56 percent of it in Wisconsin and 53 percent of it in Pennsylvania. The unusually large vote for third-party candidates meant that Hillary Clinton's share of that vote was even lower than Kerry's \u2014 more comparable, actually, to the vote for Walter Mondale in 1984. But the 1984 election did not change the makeup of the major political parties. Millions of voters pulled the lever for Ronald Reagan, then voted Democratic for every lower office, from Senate down to alderman. In 2016, the Democrats lost their last state legislature in what we generally call the South, after a wipeout in Kentucky's House of Representatives. Early in the 2016 cycle, plenty of Democrats worried about this and thought they saw a way to prevent it: by nominating Clinton for president. In early 2015, writing then for Bloomberg, I talked to Democrats from Kentucky and West Virginia, all of whom thought that the losses of the Obama years could be reversed when Obama himself left the political scene. Clinton, said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), \"would be the best hope in the state of West Virginia to return [to Democratic] on a national level.\u201d Clinton went on to win just 26 percent of the vote there, the worst performance for a Democrat in West Virginia's 152 years of electoral college membership. (Yes, even George McClellan ran better against Abraham Lincoln.) The state had fallen off the Democrats' presidential map a decade earlier, and Clinton embraced environmental policies with the knowledge that they'd cost votes, and the calculation that they would win votes elsewhere. And coal country didn't cost Clinton the presidency; had she won Florida and Wisconsin, she'd be writing her inaugural address. Still, the party's expectations about Clinton demonstrated just how bad parties are at analyzing what they need to fix to win. Next year, while it is not what they boast about, Democrats are expecting mistakes by Trump \u2014 the most unpopular incoming president in decades \u2014 to create opportunities for them. Their debate about winning a new majority is not about a savior from red America, or even a change in policy. It is about better organizing, and how to win back voters who were Democrats until the party was branded as neoliberal and pro-trade . There has really never been an election aftermath like this. And there has never been a moment when one party consisted almost entirely of conservative and moderate white voters and one consisted of nonwhites and progressive whites. There will be more certitude about what the parties stand for, and less dreaming for a Democratic savior. politics ",

Fleming proposes at toast following the tapping of the first Dublin Stout Keg at Brazenhead in Dublin, Ohio. A flight-tracking service shows that a plane piloted by the Ohio executive with five other people onboard quickly lost altitude after taking off from Cleveland's lakeshore airport. The parents of Superior Beverage Company executive John T. Fleming confirmed he was piloting the Columbus-bound plane when it vanished late Thursday, Dec. 29, 2016, over Lake Erie. (ThisWeek Newspapers/The Columbus Dispatch via AP) 0 Shares Email Debris washed ashore near an airport where a small plane carrying six people took off shortly before it vanished over Lake Erie near Cleveland, the city said Sunday. Authorities received multiple reports of debris washing ashore east of Burke Lakefront Airport, where a plane carrying a family of four and their two neighbors departed late Thursday. Police also continued to investigate the contents of a bag found earlier Sunday near a private harbor in Bratenahl, a small lakeside community near Cleveland. The debris had not yet been verified as coming from the missing plane, authorities said. \"We want to remind everyone that this is an active investigation,\" Police Chief Calvin Williams said. \"If you see something that could be debris from the plane, we are asking people to avoid touching it, and to call the Division of Police immediately.\" John T. Fleming, chief executive of a Columbus-based beverage distribution company, was piloting the plane. His wife, Sue, their two teenage sons, Jack and Andrew, and two neighbors were also aboard. The aircraft was headed to Ohio State University Airport, northwest of downtown Columbus. The plane suddenly lost altitude about 2 miles out during a scheduled return trip to Columbus, according to a flight-tracking service. Fleming's father has said the family and friends were attending a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. The Coast Guard began searching the air after being notified soon after the plane's disappearance. High waves and blustery conditions prevented smaller Coast Guard boats from the Cleveland area from deploying Thursday night. A 140-foot Coast Guard cutter joined a search that covered 128 square miles of the lake on Friday. Weather and water conditions didn't allow for recovery efforts to begin Saturday, but crews searched for the plane until darkness Sunday and planned to return Monday morning, weather permitting. The Cleveland Division of Fire, the U.S. Coast Guard and Underwater Marine Contractors launched boats, and dive teams are ready to search the lake once the plane is located. The mayor's office says four boats are equipped with sonar that can track underwater images and are searching a grid near the plane's last known location. A fifth boat is surveying the shoreline for debris that may have washed ashore. ",

Revelers left an estimated 14 tons of trash behind on Las Vegas Boulevard during the New Year's Eve celebration. (David Montero / Los Angeles Times) David Montero What a messy end to 2016. The Las Vegas Strip began jamming up with people hours before the clock struck midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve and, as people are inclined to do, they brought a lot of stuff with them to celebrate the occasion. There were confetti streamers, 12-packs of Tecate and Miller Lite, water bottles, party horns and festive hats. There were food and soda cans, plastic bags and giant plastic cups filled with booze. A few police officers cut a wide berth where some overzealous drinkers had left their mark in the middle of the street. But mostly it was just garbage. By Clark County Public Works Department\u00a0estimates, revelers left 14 tons of trash behind on Las Vegas Boulevard during the celebration. And so, the first act of the new year by public works, casino cleanup crews and the Nevada Department of Transportation was this: Get the street clean for vehicle traffic within hours of the last fireworks launched over the Strip in the first minutes of 2017. Fireworks explode over the Las Vegas Strip during the New Year's Eve celebration. John Locher / Associated Press Fireworks explode over the Las Vegas Strip during the New Year's Eve celebration. Fireworks explode over the Las Vegas Strip during the New Year's Eve celebration. (John Locher / Associated Press) Hilario Murillo, who has been doing New Year\u2019s Eve cleanups for 18 years for the Paris Hotel and Casino, stood with a broom on the sidewalk and surveyed the piles of trash smashed up in the street gutter.\u00a0 \u201cNot too bad,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI think last year was worse.\u201d Murillo was waiting for the public works crews to methodically walk down the street \u2014 the first wave with leaf blowers and sprayers to move the trash into lines, where a second wave of street sweepers would then suck up the garbage. The Strip had been closed to vehicle traffic a few hours before midnight, allowing people the rare chance to walk down the middle of the street\u00a0\u2014 though the islands in the middle were barricaded and protected by police. Revelers \u2014 an estimated 330,000 \u2014 stopped to take pictures with the cops and video the thumping dance music at parties on outdoor patios outside the casinos. Some sat on the curbs as if they were waiting for a parade. Groups of people yelled greetings to strangers. People took selfies with the bright lights of the casinos in the background. Outside Caesars Palace, a group of people preaching Christianity yelled judgments through bullhorns at the pedestrians. They screamed back while police made sure things didn\u2019t escalate. There were few arrests, and when the fireworks launched over the Strip, people shot video, hugged and kissed and then filtered down the street and headed into casinos, hotels or to their homes. Then it was showtime for the approximately 90 public works employees whose job was to get the debris off the Strip so it could be reopened for vehicle traffic quickly. Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said the cost of cleaning up after the party on the Strip would be between $134,000 and $180,000. A separate operation was responsible for cleanup downtown on Fremont Street, the city's famous Glitter Gulch. On the Strip, Murillo watched the line of street sweepers move slowly with yellow lights flashing and crews removing about 4,200 metal barricades once they\u2019d passed \u2014 leaving a glistening path like watery snail trails. Murillo picked up his broom and joined the casino\u2019s employees and began sweeping up the island area near the vehicle entrance. By 3 a.m., the Strip was open to traffic again, sidewalks were packed with people, and the party continued inside the bars, restaurants and casinos on the Strip. The trash cans were emptied and the cars rolled down the clean boulevard. It had taken cleanup crews about two hours. \u201cIt looks like nothing even happened,\u201d Murillo said. Until next year.

    "text": "Privacy Policy The experiments were manipulated so that the perpetrator appeared to be a member of either the same group as the punisher or a different one. In one experiment, for instance, we led football fans to believe the perpetrator was either a supporter of the same team as they were or a supporter of a rival team. In another, we told them the perpetrator was a citizen of their own country or of a different one. When people made their decisions swiftly \u2014 in a few seconds or less \u2014 they were biased in their punishment decisions. Not only did they punish out-group members more harshly, they also treated members of their own group more leniently. The same pattern of bias emerged in a pair of follow-up experiments in which we distracted half of the punishers. (We increased their \u201ccognitive load\u201d by asking them to retain a string of seven letters and numbers in their memory.) But we also found that people could overcome these biased instincts if they engaged in rational deliberation. When people had the chance to reflect on their decision, they were largely unbiased, handing out equal punishments to in-group and out-group members. This finding \u2014 that people are reflexively prone to \u201cintergroup bias\u201d in punishment \u2014 is consistent with what many scientists believe about humans\u2019 evolutionary heritage. Homo sapiens spent thousands of years in close-knit communities competing for scarce resources on the African savanna. Members of the in-group were presumably sources of help, comfort and cooperation; members of opposing groups, by contrast, were sources of threat and violence. As a result, the tendency to instinctively treat in-group members with care and foreigners with caution may be etched into our DNA. Our finding sheds some light on the nature of implicit racial bias. Because people frequently form group memberships on the basis of race, the same biases that emerge along group lines may underlie many instances of racial discrimination. This human tendency is almost certainly inflamed when different racial groups are exposed to racial stereotyping and institutional discrimination, but it may start with common instincts driven by the pressures of evolution. We need not resign ourselves to a future of tribalism. On the contrary, our research suggests that people have the capacity to override their worst instincts \u2014 if they are able to reflect on their decision making as opposed to acting on their first impulse. These insights, for example, could inform the types of implicit bias training programs that the Department of Justice is now requiring for nearly 30,000 prosecutors and law enforcement officers. Acknowledging the truth about ourselves \u2014 that we see and think about the world through the lens of group affiliations \u2014 is the first step to making things better. Daniel A.

At the annual New Year\u2019s Eve party on Saturday night, a gold-laced white menu included \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s wedge salad,\u201d a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli, and a \u201cbreakfast buffet.\u201d Those in attendance drifted in under a yellow-and-white striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club, and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump\u2019s two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr., posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d were also there. Photo Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s 118-room private club in Palm Beach. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Like most aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides rejected the questions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump was to return to New York on Sunday afternoon. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at Mar-a-Lago compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump\u2019s combative public persona \u2014 often on display during his campaign \u2014 mostly dissolves behind the carved-stone walls of his castle. \u201cMar-a-Lago is an environment he can control,\u201d said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a Mar-a-Lago lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. \u201cI watched him hold court \u2014 he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed.\u201d Mr. Ruddy, has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors, He described the president-elect as \u201cseeking the pre-election Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious.\u201d Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobile (Mr. Trump has called him \u201cMr. Exxon.\u201d). He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a Mar-a-Lago member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held sit-downs with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexico\u2019s richest man. Mr. Trump; his wife, Melania; and their 10-year-old son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night, a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests (\u201cMy Way,\u201d a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice). A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so \u2014 he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And outside the confines of Mar-a-Lago, old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over Mar-a-Lago, and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner\u2019s coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important \u201cthat we keep Donald and his family safe.\u201d Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the president-elect around, and expect it will continue. \u201cThe loser in this game is Camp David,\u201d said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. \u201cOnce you\u2019re at Mar-a-Lago and it\u2019s so opulent and resort-friendly, the idea of suddenly inserting your self into Camp David\u2019s Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely.\u201d Correction: January 1, 2017 An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham attended President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago. While Ms. Ingraham was previously a guest at the club, she did not attend the party. ",

The Sparks ended up winning the WNBA title.</p> Close Harry How, Getty Images ISTANBUL - A handful of WNBA players, including Essence Carson, Chelsea Gray and Jantel Lavender of the Los Angeles Sparks, were next door to the deadly shooting at a nightclub in Istanbul . Search for gunman in Istanbul nightclub attack It marks at least the second time WNBA players have been dangerously close to a terror attack this year in Turkey. In a statement, the WNBA said: \u201cThe  attack at Reina in Istanbul was tragic and we send our heartfelt  condolences and prayers to the victims and their families. The WNBA was  in contact with our players in the region  after the incident; we are thankful each one of them is safe and  accounted for.\u201d Sparks coach Brian Agler confirmed to The Associated Press that Carson had texted him that the three players were OK. An assailant believed to have been dressed in a Santa Claus hat opened fire at a nightclub during New Year\u2019s celebrations, killing at least 39 people and wounding close to 70 others \u00a0in what the province\u2019s governor described as a terror attack. Carson had tweeted earlier in the evening that she was \u201cstuck inside of the club because of \u2018terror\u2019 shooting in Istanbul. Praises to the most high.\u201d She later deleted the tweet and posted a status update indicating the group had survived unharmed. We're okay. Goodnight. \u2014 Essence T. Carson (@Pr3pE) January 1, 2017 About two dozen WNBA players are in Turkey during their offseason playing in a league there, a move many make to supplement their relatively meager earnings in America. Turkey is one of the most popular destinations for American players looking to make some more money for their basketball skills, along with Russia, China and Greece. Indiana Fever star Marissa Coleman is in her third offseason playing in Turkey. Last January, she left the area near the Blue Mosque in Istanbul moments before a suicide bombing that killed several tourists occurred there. \u201cA guy walked by yelling bomb! Bomb!\u201d Coleman recalled. \u201cWe thought he was toying with us, so we left, and then my phone started buzzing. First thing I saw was a CNN update that there was a bomb outside the Blue Mosque.\u201d Coleman said she\u2019s become more worried about her safety with more time in Turkey. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the progression of how things are escalating. We stick out like sore thumbs. You can\u2019t avoid certain things, and it does make you nervous,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019m very hyper aware, vigilant of my surroundings. You never know.\u201d 19 Photos Istanbul New Year's attack The WNBA just announced last week that it had partnered with LiveSafe, a safety communications platform, to provide a mobile security app to its 60-plus players competing overseas during the offseason. The app debuted this week and players are already signing up. \u201cThis was a proactive effort to protect our players and secure their personal safety,\u201d WNBA President Lisa Borders said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. The app will allow the players to communicate directly with the league and its security team. It also can send security advisories and notifications to players when they\u2019re overseas, similar to what one might get from the state department. \u00a0 It is unclear whether the LiveSafe app was used during the attack. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the Istanbul nightclub assault. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The special flight arrived to pickup Russian diplomats expelled by US President Barack Obama as part of sanctions imposed on Russia for suspected cyber-attacks during the U.S. election.</p> Close PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The State Department is confirming that the 35 Russian diplomats President Barack Obama ordered out of the country have departed the United States.\u00a0 Trump claims to have more information on Russian hacking Mr. Obama expelled the diplomats, saying they were really spies, and ordered new sanctions on Russian spy agencies for alleged Russian hacking of political sites during the presidential election.\u00a0 The State Department said Sunday that the 35 Russian diplomats, along with their family members, have left the United States. \u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Obama also shuttered two Russian compounds in Maryland and New York . The U.S. said the two Cold War-era estates were being used for intelligence activities. The 45-acre Maryland retreat boasts a brick mansion along the Corsica River in the bucolic Eastern Shore region. Reports indicate it was bought by the Soviet Union in 1972 and served as a getaway for its diplomats in nearby Washington. How Russians may have hacked U.S. computer systems In New York, Russian diplomatic staff members were evicted from a mansion on Long Island\u2019s Gold Coast. The estate, once called Elmcroft, is in the town of Oyster Bay and was purchased by the Soviets in 1952. Investigators say a hacking unit known as APT28 targeted Democratic Party officials by sending malicious emails last spring that tricked recipients into changing their passwords, CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reported.\u00a0 U.S. intelligence \u00a0officials believe that hack likely gave Russian operatives access to the information of senior Democratic Party officials, which was then leaked to the press and publicly disclosed. \u00a0 President Obama announced the step Thursday as part of a raft of\u00a0 sanctions \u00a0that included the expulsion of 35 Russians who the U.S. said were spies operating under diplomatic cover. \u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave a speech at Pearl Harbor about the power of reconciliation in the waning days of 2016. Koji Sasahara/AP Updated Jan. 1 at 10:25 a.m. The final days of 2016 made for a dramatic time in diplomacy. A quick roundup: The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank; Israel (and President-elect Donald Trump) admonished the U.S. for allowing the vote to pass; John Kerry reiterated his disapproval of the settlements in a blunt speech; and British Prime Minister Theresa May in turn admonished Kerry , though the U.K. was a key broker in the deal. Thanks To Russia, 2016 Isn't Really Going To End For Obama And Trump Then there were the sanctions the White House announced in response to Russia's alleged interference in the U.S. election, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's response that he, er, would not respond \u2014 for now. There were some bright spots on the world stage, though: There is an effort to end violence in Syria that the U.N. supported Saturday with a new resolution. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a historic visit to Pearl Harbor. He delivered a powerful message of reconciliation. Other world leaders offered messages for the new year. Putin congratulated the Russian people on persevering through a \"challenging year\" \u2014 though, as NPR's Lucian Kim pointed out on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday, in many ways it was a year of victories for Putin . North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un made news with his annual New Year's address Sunday \u2014 hinting that the country might soon be test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile. President Obama gave his weekly address Saturday morning, taking the opportunity to wish everyone a happy new year and look back on his presidency: \"Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance. Our kids' high school graduation rate is at an all-time high. We've brought 165,000 troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, and took out Osama Bin Laden. Through diplomacy we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program, opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, and brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our kids.\" YouTube Trump, meanwhile, is well-known for his active Twitter presence. which was often a source of criticism during the election season \u2014 prompting rumors that his staff took away his tweeting privileges in the final days of the campaign. Article continues after sponsorship On New Year's Eve the president-elect tweeted an unusual holiday message. Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love! ",

    "text": "N. Korea's Leader Hints of Long-Range Missile Test By eric talmadge, associated press TOKYO \u0097 Jan 1, 2017, 4:05 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press South Koreans watch a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's speech, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. North Korea's development of banned long-range missiles is in \"final stages,\" the country's leader Kim was quoted as saying in his New Year's message. The letters read \"New Year for Reunification.\" (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) 0 Shares Email North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hinted Sunday that Pyongyang may ring in the new year with another bang \u2014 the test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. In his annual New Year's address, Kim said that after testing what the North claims was its first hydrogen bomb last year, preparations for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile have \"reached the final stage\" Kim did not explicitly say an ICBM test, which if successful would be a big step forward for the North, was imminent. But he has a birthday coming up on Jan. 8, and last year Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6. Kim threatened in the address to boost his country's military capabilities further unless the U.S. ends war games with rival South Korea. But he also said efforts must be made to defuse the possibility of another Korean war and stressed the importance of building the economy under a five-year plan announced in May. \"The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented as an invincible fortress,\" Kim said, according to an outline of the speech carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. \"We should resolutely smash the enemies' despicable and vicious moves to dampen the pure and ardent desire of the people for the party and estrange the people from it.\" The address was shown on television mixing video with Kim speaking and stretches of audio only, as still photos were broadcast. It was less than 30 minutes long. South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns\" Kim's threat to proceed with a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile and strengthen North Korea's nuclear-strike capabilities. It said that the international community will not tolerate North Korean efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that the North will only face tougher sanctions and pressure if it continues to go down that path. Under Kim, who rose to power following his father's death in 2011, North Korea has seen steady progress in its nuclear and missile programs, including two nuclear tests in 2016. It recently claimed a series of technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States. U.N. resolutions call for an end to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. Kim appears uninterested in complying. The year ahead could be a tumultuous one in north Asia, with Donald Trump set to become the new U.S. president on Jan. 20, and South Korea's politics in disarray over a scandal that brought the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye . Kim indicated there will be no change in the North's nuclear policy unless Washington makes a big, conciliatory first move, which, even with the advent of Trump, would seem unlikely. Trump has somewhat offhandedly suggested he would be willing to meet with Kim \u2014 but not in North Korea \u2014 and has at the same time indicated that he wants China to exert significantly more control over Pyongyang to get it to abandon its nuclear program. Demands from Pyongyang for the U.S. to stop its joint military exercises with the South and enter into negotiations to sign a peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War have fallen on deaf ears in Washington for years amid an atmosphere of distrust and deepening hostility. Kim is in his early 30s and is now in his fifth year as the North's leader. His New Year addresses, and a marathon speech at the May ruling party congress, are a contrast with his enigmatic father, Kim Jong Il, who rarely spoke in public. But he has yet to meet a foreign head of state or travel outside of North Korea since assuming power, and remains one the world's most mysterious national leaders. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "In control of Washington, GOP-run Congress sees mandate -- starting with end to ObamaCare Published               January 01, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The 115th Congress begins Tuesday with a full slate of business, though nothing will be more politically important or pressing for Republicans than repealing ObamaCare.\u00a0 With Donald Trump set to officially become president on Jan. 20, Republican leaders in the House and Senate will begin repeal efforts shortly after Congress\u2019 59 new members -- seven senators and 52 House members -- are sworn in and the formalities are concluded. The GOP, which now controls both Capitol Hill and the White House, has made dismantling the 2010 health care law a priority almost since it was signed by President Obama. Lawmakers will also look at a tax overhaul, reversing Obama-era environmental regulations and other conservative priorities. However, such efforts will have to share center stage with the Senate confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks in the days and months that follow the president-elect\u2019s swearing-in. It should be easier for Republicans to move nominations after Democrats changed the Senate's filibuster rules in 2013. Still, Democrats have pledged to fight many of the nominations, highlighting what they call the hypocrisy of Trump\u2019s populist message and his wealthy, corporate-favoring nominees for several posts. Perhaps the biggest wild card in the new Congress\u2019s early weeks will be what to do about Russia\u2019s involvement in several cyberattacks during this year\u2019s presidential race -- in which Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump has been skeptical about Russia\u2019s involvement, while top GOP Sens. including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Arizona\u2019s John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have called for hearings on the issue and proposed sanctions beyond what President Obama imposed last week. McCain told Fox News on Wednesday that he also wants to permanently station U.S. soldiers in the Baltic Sea countries bordering Russia and increase aid to neighboring Ukraine against Russian aggression -- to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin knows \u201cthis kind of interference will be responded to.\" How GOP leaders and Trump negotiate the issue will likely depend on the outcome of the president-elect\u2019s meeting this week with U.S. intelligence officials. \u00a0 Republicans will face other obstacles from Democrats, beyond the Cabinet conformations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have already made efforts to stop proposed changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid and to ObamaCare. Those efforts include a planned national \u201cDay of Action\u201d on January 15. \u201cBring it on,\u201d Schumer said in November, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to make repealing ObamaCare a first order of business. And Obama is scheduled to visit congressional Democrats on Wednesday to discuss ways to save his signature legislation. Republicans likely won\u2019t be able to replace ObamaCare in its entirety for several years, considering they would need an alternative program for the roughly 22 million Americans who would lose their current health insurance. In addition, Trump and both parties have expressed interest in a large transportation bill to create jobs and to fix the country\u2019s aging infrastructure. But a clear plan has yet to emerge, with the estimated, billion-dollar price tag a likely sticking point among fiscal conservatives on the Hill. The new Senate will have 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two Independents who caucus with the Democrats. The House will have 241 Republicans and 194 Democrats. The Senate plans to begin repealing ObamaCare on Tuesday with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield them from Democratic filibuster legislation annulling much of that statute. Lawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Provisions that are most likely to go are the law's mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, as well as its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. Republicans will then begin the more complicated task of building a new system. The GOP will have to craft new programs for the nation's $3 trillion health care system and make sure insurance markets don't collapse while the transition is under way. McConnell, Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also want a massive tax overhaul, with the goal of simplifying a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants as well as corporations that can easily shift profits and jobs overseas. It would be the first major tax overhaul in 30 years. Trump has also advocated a tax overhaul, but with fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. Waiting in the wings will be confirmation hearings to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died 11 months ago. McConnell blocked consideration of Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, saying the next president should make the pick. The strategy paid off, and the Republican Senate will consider whomever Trump nominates. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Wochit Mariah Carey performs during Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in Times Square Saturday. (Photo: Michael Stewart, WireImage) \"Stuff happens.\" Only Mariah Carey didn't put it quite like that early Sunday, when she acknowledged in a tweet that her New Year's Eve performance in Times Square in New York had gone drastically, laughably wrong. The problem\u00a0appeared to be \"technical difficulties\" while she was lip-syncing some of her hits, according to her spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, but Carey also had trouble reaching some notes when she tried to sing. The diva of divas appeared to be perturbed about it at\u00a0the time: She stopped attempting to sing Emotions, paced the stage and told the audience to finish the lyrics for her. She lamented there had not been a sound check for the performance. \"I'm trying to be a good sport here,\" she told the crowd. \"We're missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is.\" Later, she stopped singing We Belong Together after another malfunction. When she\u00a0lowered the microphone from her mouth, the music and\u00a0vocals kept playing, making it clear she was lip-synching. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d she said, and\u00a0left the stage. \"Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,\" Perna told the Associated Press Sunday. By New Year's Day Carey was more philosophical, tweeting sad and happy emojis and a clip of herself shrugging. \"Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!\u00a0Here's to making more headlines in 2017,\" the tweet read, after an introductory sentence that can't be reproduced here. Carey was the headliner for the annual Times Square New Year's bacchanal, Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve; this year, about a million revelers jammed in to greet the new year despite frigid temperatures. As is usual with anything having to do with Carey, the reaction on social media was immediate and stinging. \"Disaster\" was mentioned. Jokes abounded (the Russians did it!) \"Even Milli Vanilli is embarrassed by Mariah Carey's debacle,\" tweeted Jimmy Traina, alluding to the infamous German\u00a0duo undone by revelations that they didn't actually sing on their hit record.

(@weknowwhatsbest) January 1, 2017 I tried to sing along to Mariah Carey but even Mariah Carey can't sing along to Mariah Carey \u2014 Music News & Feed (@Musicnews_feed) January 1, 2017 Carey has had a history of vocal breakdowns in concerts in recent years, when she appeared unable to hit high notes despite her multi-octave range. In the smartphone era, the full Monty of her embarrassment has been captured on video, posted by mocking TMZ or on YouTube by disgruntled members of\u00a0the audience. In 2014, for instance, she had a bad night in Tokyo kicking off\u00a0The Elusive Chanteuse\u00a0tour, sounding unsteady on several songs, including\u00a0Hero\u00a0and\u00a0Vision of Love, and failing to hit high notes she has always hit before. TMZ and critics on social media ensured the rest of the world could witness it. ",

Former U.S. Rep. Candice Miller used her first day in office Sunday to urge Macomb County residents to reduce water consumption while crews create a bypass to get around the bad pipe. The short-term fix could take a month. During a news conference at the sinkhole site in Fraser, Miller said she doesn't have all the answers but promised \"transparency.\" The sinkhole was discovered Dec. 24, just weeks after Miller was elected to lead the county's public works department. Three homes likely are beyond repair, though residents in 19 homes could return in a week. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY Sports Gary Kubiak led the Broncos to a Super Bowl 50 win following the 2015 season. (Photo: Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports) Denver Broncos coach Gary Kubiak told his team Sunday he is retiring from coaching. Multiple reports early in the day indicated Kubiak would resign due to his family's concern about his health. He didn't admit it following the Broncos\u2019 24-6 win over the Oakland Raiders, but one of Kubiak\u2019s players confirmed it. \"He said he was stepping down,\" said tight end Virgil Green. \"I was shocked.\" Several other Broncos said there were tears in the locker room when Kubiak informed them of his decision, according to Mike Klis of KUSA-TV in Denver. Von Miller was asked if he was surprised by the decision. \"As a player, you kind of notice some days,\" he said. \"This was a hard season for Kube. This was a tough season with the losses and the injuries and everything. You could just kind of see it wear down on him, and his health is the most important for us. So, I think the decision was a great decision for him, and I'm going to continue to support him no matter what.\" Kubiak, 55, said of his future: \"I'll address that tomorrow. It's about the football team right now, not me.\" However he did say he was feeling emotions on the sideline as the game wound down. \"I've struggled this year,\" Kubiak admitted. He missed Denver's Oct. 13 game at San Diego after suffering from a complex migraine condition. While coaching the Houston Texans, Kubiak collapsed while walking off the field at halftime of a game Nov. 3, 2013. He essentially suffered a mini-stroke. He does seem to feel like he's leaving the Broncos in good shape even though the team's run of AFC West titles is officially over. \"I'm very encouraged with the future of this football team,\" said Kubiak. Kubiak, who spent nine years as John Elway's backup quarterback in Denver as a player, spent 23 years in various coaching positions. He finishes with an 87-77 record in combined head coaching stints with the Broncos and Texans. He led Denver to a Super Bowl 50 win last season. *** Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis PHOTOS: Week 17 NFL action Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

(Photo by Greg Allen/Invision/AP) \u00a0(2017 Invision) Representatives for Mariah Carey reportedly complained that the diva's troubled performance on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest\" was set up by the show's producers \"so they could get Mariah drama.\" TMZ reported Sunday that the 46-year-old Carey's team claimed in a written complaint to Dick Clark Productions that her sound and microphone systems were deliberately sabotaged. The report said that Carey and her team repeatedly complained that her earpieces were not working.\u00a0 Carey's mood seemed to range from frustration to resignation as she struggled with the pre-recorded musical tracks. Telling the revelers jammed into New York City's Times Square that there had not been a sound check for her hit song \"Emotions,\" she lamented that \"we're missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is.\" \"Let the audience sing,\" she decided as she paced the stage. \"I'm trying to be a good sport here,\" she said, adding her own sarcastic review of the performance. \"That was ... amazing.\" The next song, \"We Belong Together,\" went no better. At times, she lowered the microphone from her mouth and the music, vocals and all, kept playing, making it clear she was lip-synching. \"Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,\" Carey spokeswoman Nicole Perna said Sunday. Dick Clark Production sources told TMZ that Carey should have been able to hear the music even without an earpiece, and added that it was the singer's decision not to do a pre-performance sound check. Carey later tweeted about the night, starting with a brief profanity, throwing in a couple of sad emojis and concluding with, \"Here's to making more headlines in 2017.\" The performance was broadcast on ABC and was subject to widespread mockery on social media.\u00a0Commentators called the fiasco a fitting end to a traumatic year for the music industry, marked by the deaths of Prince, David Bowie and George Michael among others. One tweeter, referring to the 2016 presidential campaign, joked that Carey's show had been hacked by the Russians. The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

    "text": "Chicago records 762 homicides in 2016, up 57 percent from previous year Published               January 01, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The city of Chicago recorded 762 homicides in 2016 \u2014 an average of two murders per day,\u00a0the most killings in the city for two decades and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. The nation's third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents than it did in 2015, according to statistics released by the Chicago Police Department that underlined a story of bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The numbers released Sunday are staggering, even for those following the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings and monthly death tolls that hadn't been seen in years. The increase in 2016 homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2015, a 20 percent from the previous year. The bulk of the deaths and shooting incidents, which jumped from 2,426 in 2015 to 3,550 last year, occurred in only five neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides, all poor and predominantly black areas where gangs are most active. Police said the shootings in those areas generally wasn't random, with more than 80 percent of the victims having previously been identified by police as more susceptible because of their gang ties or past arrests. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was expected to discuss the newly released statistics Sunday afternoon. The city has scrambled to address the violence. Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced last year that 1,000 officers would be added to the police department. At the same time, police officials have been trying to figure out why homicides and shootings -- which began climbing the year before -- suddenly surged. Johnson has said several factors contributed to the increased violence. He noted 2016 was the first full year since the city was forced in November 2015 to release video of the fatal police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was black and shot 16 times by a white police officer. The video cost former Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy his job, sparked major protests around the city, and led to federal and state investigations of the department. It also left Johnson with the task of trying to restore public trust in what appeared to be a weakened police force, a perception that was only buttressed by a dramatic drop in the number of arrests in 2016. While the police department has cited several factors for the declining numbers, including a concerted effort not to make minor drug arrests and focus on gun violence, Johnson acknowledged in a recent interview with The Associated Press that officers have become more cautious -- in part out of fear of becoming the next \"viral video.\" That, he said, has \"emboldened\" criminals. \"Criminals watch TV, pay attention to the media,\" he said. \"They see an opportunity to commit nefarious activity.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare , that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved \u2014 the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the mid-1990s. Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. \u201cThey\u2019ve been given a golden opportunity here,\u201d said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. \u201cBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. \u201cIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,\u201d Mr. Lott continued. \u201cYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you.\u201d The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation; the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for re-election in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats \u2014 including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class, President-elect Trump\u2019s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he\u2019s sworn in,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating middle-class families and the economy.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many business-related, that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. \u201cI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. \u201cI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy.\u201d In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in mountaintop-removal mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules\u2019 completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year \u2014 already a quarter over \u2014 that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster . But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama\u2019s, and they may delay the repeal measure\u2019s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. \u201cThe senator doesn\u2019t want to rush,\u201d said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him \u2014 want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party\u2019s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. \u201cThis is no time for hubris,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou have to perform.\u201d ",

The palace said the queen \"does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold ??(AP Photo/Alastair Grant/file) 0 Shares Email Queen Elizabeth II missed a traditional New Year's Day church service Sunday because of the effects of a lingering cold. Buckingham Palace said the queen \"does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold.\" There was no indication she is suffering from a more serious illness. It was unusual for Elizabeth not to attend the service, long part of her New Year's Day routine. The inclement weather may have been a contributing factor in her decision to stay indoors. It was cold with a steady rain in the Norfolk area 110 miles (175 kilometers) north of London where the queen maintains a private estate called Sandringham. Elizabeth also missed the Christmas church service last week for the first time in decades. She is recuperating out of the public eye in one of her favorite homes. The 90-year-old queen, the longest reigning monarch in British history, had earlier delayed her departure for Sandringham for the Christmas holidays because both she and her husband, Prince Philip , were suffering from intense colds. She traveled one day later than planned and used a helicopter rather than a train to shorten the travel time. Her prolonged illness has raised some concerns because colds and flus can be dangerous for elderly people. The queen has generally been in good health in recent years, although she has cut down somewhat on her traveling and public appearances. Philip, 95, has also reduced his schedule, but managed to attend more than 100 public events in 2016. He and other members of the royal family attended the New Year service Sunday at the church on the grounds of Sandringham estate. Philip was driven to the church in a royal Range Rover. He used to arrive by foot when he was younger. 0 Shares ",

Guy Juneau\u00a0of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s\u00a0Security Services division.\u00a0 It could have been a New Year\u2019s Eve prank, Juneau said, or the work of \u201ca thrill seeker.\u201d\u00a0 The surveillance footage\u00a0showed a man dressed in\u00a0black, tactical-style gear.\u00a0One of the tarpaulins was decorated with a peace sign, and another with a heart. \u00a0 Because the sign was not damaged, the incident will be investigated as misdemeanor trespassing.\u00a0The police have no suspects. Some Angelenos joked that the alteration reflected California\u2019s recent vote to legalize recreational marijuana .\u00a0 The New Year\u2019s Day change is\u00a0far from the first time the Hollywood sign has been edited by artists and pranksters. The sign, erected\u00a0in 1923 as an advertisement for a housing development, originally read \u201cHollywoodland.\u201d A 1929 publicity photo for the Hollywoodland groundbreaking shows a plow, mules and surveyors. (Bruce Torrence Collection / Hollywood Sign Trust) Mother Nature became the sign\u2019s first editor, knocking out the H in a violent storm in 1949.\u00a0The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce restored the letter, but removed the \u201cland\u201d the same year. On New Year\u2019s Day of 1976, the sign\u00a0became\u00a0\u201cHOLLYWeeD\u201d for the first time \u2014 the work of Cal State Northridge student Daniel Finegood, who scaled Mount Lee with $50 worth of curtains. The modification was his project for an art class assignment on working with scale. He earned an A . The Hollywood sign's first iternation as \"Hollyweed\" was 41 years ago, on New Year's Day 1976, when an art student scaled the peak for a class project. (Los Angeles Times) The first iteration of \u201cHollyweed\u201d was also the first day that California classified possession of up to one ounce of\u00a0marijuana as a misdemeanor, rather than a felony. In 1983, the sign was draped with the words \u201cGo Navy\u201d before the annual Army-Navy game. Later that decade, Caltech students edited the sign to spell out the name of their school. (Axel Koester / Los Angeles Times) In\u00a01987, the sign became \u201c Holywood \u201d to mark a visit by Pope John Paul II . But the prank was undone before the pontiff arrived in Los Angeles.\u00a0 In the decade that followed, edits to the sign got political at least twice. The first time was\u00a0 in 1990 , when Finegood scaled the peak again and changed the sign to read\u00a0\u201cOil War,\u201d to protest the Persian Gulf War. Five days before the 1992 presidential elections, supporters of independent candidate Ross Perot draped sheets across the landmark to spell out \u201c Perotwood .\u201d Tired of the unsanctioned changes, city officials eventually enhanced security with a fence, alarms and a surveillance system that captured Saturday\u2019s prankster. Most recently, in 2010,\u00a0the Trust for Public Land modified the sign to read \u201c Save The Peak .\u201d (As the banners went up, Angelenos\u00a0snapped photos that read\u00a0\u201cSallywood\u201d and \u201cSave the Pood.\u201d) That edit publicized a fundraising effort to purchase Cahuenga Peak, the 138-acre parcel just to the west of the sign, following reports that the land\u2019s owners had been planning to build luxury housing there.\u00a0 A helicopter flies over the iconic 450-foot-long Hollywood sign after activists covered it with banners during an effort to prevent the building of houses on the nearby Cahuenga Peak.

(Hector Becerra) By Hector Becerra Contact Reporter My father was working as\u00a0a forklift operator at a Los Angeles factory five decades ago when a trucker from out of state began to insult him. My dad was a Mexican immigrant, though that\u2019s not what the trucker called him, over and over again. It was a thing that would inspire many law-abiding, red-blooded Americans to at least ponder the possibility of punching someone\u2019s lights out.\u00a0 And my old man would have decked \u201cBig Bad John\u201d on principle, but he had an Achilles\u2019 heel: He had young children to feed and he was in the country illegally. He had to grit his teeth and take it. Then his boss showed up and ripped into the trucker, telling him to take his cargo and never come back. This boss, my father said, was white. And no matter how many times, glassy-eyed with memories, he told it, this man was the hero of the tale. My father was like so many immigrants of his generation from Mexico: Coming north, without proper papers, looking for work and a better life for their families. Over the years, my father and people like him were demonized by those who felt they were ruining California and praised by others who believed their work ethic and labor were a boon to the state. During the tough times, it was easy to feel like an outsider, alienated for not being American. That wasn\u2019t quite my dad. :: He had a sixth-grade education, thanks to a Mexico whose stamina for relentlessly poor governance and knack for driving out its citizens was impressive. So he carved out his own learning, going to night school in L.A. to get his high school degree soon after his arrival. Rafael Becerra as a teenager in Zapotlan del Rey, Mexico. (Becerra family) My father read Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Steinbeck and Melville from our childhood porch in Boyle Heights. In spiral notebooks he composed verses to Mexican songs about his hometown in Jalisco state, like the one he first penned as a teenager, just a few years after his father died when he was 12 \u2014 and just a few years before he crossed into the U.S. in the trunk of a car. By 1980, he had become a legal resident, and no longer had to worry about being caught in a work raid.\u00a0 Naturally intelligent and curious about language, he jotted down obscure English words. He would be reading a novel, stop mid-sentence, and ask what a certain word meant. Though my father had a distinct Mexican accent, his English was excellent. But more than anything besides his name, that accent flagged him as Mexican to people like the trucker. And therefore not American. Not then, not ever, no matter what, for some people. He never complained about it. He worked and he learned, relentlessly. In one notebook, with yellow strips of paper as markers, he wrote categories of words. People. Places. Fruits and animals. Gods and rivers. Abas, the uncle of Mohammed. Agenor, prince of Troy, son of Antenor.\u00a0Francis Bacon. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. We bought him subscriptions to \u201cNational Geographic,\u201d reading being about the only way he traversed the wide world, other than a trip he took to a frigid Detroit for his machinist job in Orange County. That job, with its 12-hour shifts and six days of work, brought our family into the middle class. In the 1990s, I took a 2,100-mile trip to Nashville to intern for the Tennessean newspaper. My father eagerly volunteered to take a few days off from work to help me drive there. He portrayed it as just being a helpful dad. But I knew he wanted to see America. He showed a child-like awe as we drove east on Interstate 40, through Arizona and New Mexico, through Texas and Oklahoma, where my 1989 Ford Escort threatened to hydroplane as we drove through a powerful storm; in the blinding rain, a raging refinery fire. \u00a0 As Memphis loomed, we came across the mighty Mississippi. I was a bottle of angst, unable to appreciate the great vistas that passed through my car window. The Ozarks and Waffle House were all the same to me. But my father\u2019s eyes widened as he veered into English and exclaimed: \u201cJiminy Cricket!\u00a0Look at that, mijo.\u201d :: Around that time, my youngest sister turned in an essay for her high school Spanish class. Inspired by our father\u2019s stories, it was called \u201cMi Familia.\u201d \"My dad has said that I'm his favorite,\u201d Michelle wrote in one passage. \u201cI find that doubtful, though I\u2019d like to believe that it\u2019s true. He says I'm the one most like him. Always a book in hand and an idea in my head.\" My father chauffeured his youngest from middle school in Boyle Heights to UCLA, sometimes after completing a long graveyard shift. He said seeing her walk onto the Westwood campus, her blond hair in a bun and lugging a large backpack, was like watching a baby turtle crawling on the sand into the vastness of the ocean. She was 22 years old and just about to graduate when she died in 2005, killed by a reckless teenage driver. Rafael Becerra and his wife, Carmen, with the reporter's older brother and sister in the mid-1960s. (Becerra family) Days later, my father sat on the porch and recounted a dream he had about Michelle. He\u2019s walking with her on a teeming street in a massive\u00a0city. She walks faster and faster and soon he can\u2019t keep up. She disappears and he spends the day looking for her \u2014\u00a0finally returning to the loneliness of a\u00a0hotel room as night descends.\u00a0 On the mantle he finds a note, not unlike those he scribbled on his entire life: Me adelant\u00e9. I went ahead. About two years ago, I visited my parents in Boyle Heights and sat down with my father on the porch. He asked me to administer\u00a0a practice U.S. citizenship exam for him. We had been nagging him on and off for years to become a citizen, telling him we would pay the costs and that he would ace the exam. I read about 100 questions. He got every single answer right.\u00a0 He never got to take the test. Soon the cancer he had lived with for more than a decade crept into his bones. For the first time, he did chemotherapy. It seemed to be working until it no longer did. I never heard him complain about  dying. Confined to a bed during a large family gathering,\u00a0he apologized to me for not having bought us a larger home. He died last October, leaving in his wake children and grandchildren who had opportunities he never had. I think about what I told him the day he breezed through that practice U.S. citizenship exam. It was my only half-serious attempt to scare him. \"Dad, you never know how the mood of the country could change,\u201d I said.\u00a0\u201cHow people will feel about immigrants. It might not be enough to be legal. The best thing is to be an American.\" ",

    "text": "Embed Embed Transcript That means hard times for places like Wyoming's mineral-rich Powder River Basin. In 2016 alone, three coal companies there declared bankruptcy , laying off hundreds of miners at once. Still, the community of Gillette, Wyo. \u2014 self-proclaimed as the Energy Capital of the Nation \u2014 is breathing a sigh of relief lately. Production has ticked back up past where it was at this time last year, and some mines are even hiring workers back. \"I do believe that my friends and co-workers are safe for now,\" says coal miner Stacey Moeller. She believes that \"for one more year, we're going to be coal miners.\" And Trump's win has buoyed her hopes, as well as those of investors. The day after the election, coal stock prices leaped and many in coal communities celebrated. Article continues after sponsorship In Ohio Coal Country, Job Prospects Lie With Neither Coal Nor Trump's Promises For Moeller, a single mom and lifelong Democrat, the decision was complicated. \"I did vote for Donald Trump,\" Moeller says. \"It's really hard to even say that because I so dislike his rhetoric. But I voted for him on one singular issue, and that was coal.\" She's not alone. Dave Hathaway of Pennsylvania will be watching Trump, as well. Since the coal mine he worked in closed a year ago, he spent much of 2016 looking for work. The search gained urgency when his son Deacon was born in August. On Election Day, Hathaway made a choice he hopes will help his long-term job prospects. \"I voted for Trump \u2014 I mean, a coal miner would be stupid not to,\" Hathaway says. Advanced Black Lung Cases Surge In Appalachia He says he's had a hard time finding a job to replace the $80,000 he made working in the coal mines under Greene County, Pa., a few miles from the West Virginia border. Hathaway recently found a job at a nearby mine. While he thinks Trump's election means he'll have a better shot at keeping his new job, he didn't like a lot of things Trump said during the campaign. \"He is a whacko; he's never going to stop being a whacko,\" Hathaway says. \"But I mean, the things he did say \u2014 the good stuff \u2014 was good for the coal mining community. But we'll see what happens.\" That message clearly resonated in Greene County, where over the last four years a third of the coal mining jobs \u2014 like Dave Hathaway's \u2014 disappeared. Trump won the county by 40 points, eight years after Barack Obama basically tied John McCain there. Tom Crooks, vice president at R.G. Johnson, a construction firm that builds mine shafts, witnessed the decline of the coal industry firsthand. \"Two years ago this week we had 145 employees,\" Crooks says. \"Right now, we have 22.\" Pennsylvania Coal Miners Hope Trump Will Help Industry Coal Miners Hope Trump Will Help Struggling Industry ",

Iconic 'Hollywood' sign altered...again Maria Puente , USA TODAY 2:43 p.m. EST January 1, 2017 Los Angeles firemen removed banners from the letters on the Hollywood sign, altered Jan. 1, 2017, to say 'Hollyweed.' (Photo: Damian Dovarganes, AP) A prankster\u00a0climbed up a mountain in Los Angeles overnight to welcome the New Year Sunday by altering the world-famous Hollywood sign to read \"Hollyweed,\" police say. Los Angelenos recovering from New Year's Eve celebrations might have been blurry-eyed as the sun came up on Mount Lee but they couldn't have missed noticing there was something wrong with the familiar 350-feet-long sign. According to Sgt. Guy Juneau, the watch commander for the Los Angeles Police Department's\u00a0Security Services division (which handles security for public buildings and facilities), a \"lone gentleman\" made his way up the mountain, scaled a protective fence, clambered over the sign and placed two tarps covering the two Os. \"It now reads 'WEED,' Juneau told USA TODAY. \"He escaped but (the stunt) was captured on security video footage.\" But by 10:45 a.m. P.T., the tarps had been removed and all was right once again on the \"Hollywood\" sign, according to CBS Los Angeles' live coverage. 2017. It's already better. We did it. \"Pranksters change the Hollywood sign to read 'HOLLYWEED'\" https://t.co/Jv9cUbJBhF \u2014 Anthony Carboni (@acarboni) January 1, 2017 Police are investigating and if the man is arrested, he will be prosecuted for misdemeanor trespassing, Juneau said. But it isn't the first time the sign with its 45-foot-tall letters has been vandalized; Juneau says there's an incident at least once a year. \"It's thrill-seekers, looking for media attention,\" he said. \"It\u2019s L.A.,\u00a0part of our L.A.-crazy,\" he added, chuckling. But seriously, he said, \"We can't have the sign saying that.\" Police had to press to restore the sign quickly;\u00a0finding work crews on a holiday proved\u00a0difficult, he said. The prankster may have had a political motive: Celebrating California voters' approval in November of Proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana, beginning in 2018. This is not the first time the Hollywood Sign became the Hollyweed Sign. -- Happened in Dec. 1983 (Her-Ex) pic.twitter.com/dVxXyHt1bo \u2014 Shelby Grad (@shelbygrad) January 1, 2017 Besides hosting the sign, the mountain also is host to the communications towers used by police and fire departments, he said, which is why the police have an officer assigned to keep watch up there. And by the way, he said, it's \"very dangerous\" to climb up this mountain, located in the Hollywood Hills section of the Santa Monica Mountains. The sign was put up in 1923 as an advertisement for a local real-estate development. \"He took a risk,\" Juneau\u00a0said of the tarp-wielding climber. \"He could have been killed.\" If the police were unamused (or trying to be), Los Angelenos on Twitter were laughing in their New Year lattes. \u2014 Mario J Barrientos. (@MJBUELS87) January 1, 2017 As someone named Caesar tweeted, it might be a sign of a coming good year. \"Somebody changed the Hollywood sign to Hollyweed and if that doesn't mean that 2017 will be a good year then idk what does,\" he posted.

It is part of a veritable infrastructure set up by Hindu nationalists to protect the sacred cow. (Photo: Petra Sorge, Special for USA TODAY) MEWAT, India \u2014 Shaukat Qureshi will never forget the day when police raided his roadside food stall here in\u00a0northern India. \u201cThey picked out meat pieces from my biryani,\u201d Qureshi,\u00a017, said of\u00a0a much-loved local dish of rice, meat and vegetables. \u201cThey packed the pieces in plastic bags and took them away.\u201d The recent raid on Qureshi and his fellow vendors\u2019 stalls was\u00a0the first in the region following the passage of a local law to protect cows, sacred animals among Hindus, who make up\u00a080%\u00a0of India\u2019s more than 1.2 billion citizens. Imposing a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for slaughtering a cow and five years for selling the meat, the state of\u00a0Haryana\u2019s legislation is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s crackdown on beef consumption. Since his election in 2014, Modi has stressed the importance of Hinduism to India\u2019s identity. But his critics charge that he is improperly mixing religion and government in a secular country. After a crowd lynched a Muslim man last year in Dadri, east of Delhi, for allegedly eating beef that his family later claimed was mutton, Modi took days to express his condolences, furthering the perception that he is willing to turn a blind eye to Hindu radicals. In Mewat, a majority Muslim district, the recently formed Cow Protection Task Force heard rumors that street vendors were cooking their biryani with beef. Qureshi insisted he used only chicken and buffalo, which are\u00a0not banned. Months later, the police lab has yet to publish findings from the seizures on whether the rice dishes contained the outlawed meat. Shabnam Hashmi, an activist at Act Now for Harmony & Democracy, a New Delhi-based human rights group, said the raids unfairly target non-Hindus amid an increasingly Hindu nationalist climate in India fostered by the Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0and its affiliated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a private volunteer organization criticized for its paramilitary characteristics. \u201cThis police unit is part of a design to target minorities and to convert India into\u00a0a Hindu state,\u201d she said. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman Vijay Chauthaiwale, who is also an active RSS member, said the central government had nothing to do with the state law. \u201cThat is a local level policy,\u201d he said, adding\u00a0that he supported the law. \u201cPersonally, I am fine with these controls.\u201d Bharti Arora, the head of the task force, said the law addresses cow smuggling that funds organized crime and terrorism. She denied the law targets\u00a0Muslims. Rather, Haryana is a transit route for smugglers heading to neighboring Bangladesh, a largely Muslim country, she said. A free roaming cow stands amidst a field of rubbish. As it is the holy animal, slaughtering it for consumption or transporting it for slaughter is illegal. \u00a0(Photo: Petra Sorge, Special for USA TODAY) \u201cThis is not a Hindu-Muslim problem \u2014 even Hindus are into the smuggling of cows,\u201d Arora said. When the police catch\u00a0a trafficked cow, the driver faces charges and the cow goes to a sanctuary known as gaushala, like the farm Prithvi Pal Arya runs in Gazipur in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He shelters 1,000 cows. These sanctuaries are part of a cow rescuing infrastructure set up by Hindu activists in northern India. \u201cThe punishment for slaughtering a cow should be the same as for killing a man,\u201d Arya said. The task force also works with informants called gau rakshaks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or \u201ccow protectors\u201d \u2014 vigilantes who are increasingly criticized for their militancy. Arvind Swami of Varanasi, an ancient holy city on the Ganges, is a gau rakshak who hunts smugglers and operates bovine sanctuaries across northern India. When Swami hears about cow smugglers on the highway, he dons his bulletproof jacket, grabs a gun and drives off in pursuit. He said\u00a0that he has rescued 130 cows in his career. Human rights activist Hashmi said\u00a0gau rakshaks have been around for decades. But since Modi was\u00a0elected, the right-wing activists have become emboldened, she said. \u201cThe hatred has reached a level that you can even make an announcement from a temple and a crowd will go and attack,\u201d\u00a0Hashmi said. Mohammad Sartaj, 32, the son of Akhlaq Sartaj, the man lynched in Dadri last year, said: \u201cIt looks like cow slaughter is more criminalized than human slaughter.\u201d He added that his younger brother sustained severe head injuries in the attack. Authorities are still investigating the alleged murder, which includes the son of a local Bharatiya Janata Party politician as a prime suspect. While the Sartaj family challenged the results of a lab test that said they possessed beef, a local court ordered the police not only to investigate the lynching but also the allegations of cow slaughter. Prior Supreme Court verdicts on the beef ban have\u00a0been inconsistent. In 2005, the court upheld a ban on cow slaughter in the Gujarat. But in September the judges stopped a temporary prohibition of beef sales in Mumbai. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a human right to decide what you want to eat?\u201d Mohammad Sartaj\u00a0asked. 198 CONNECT TWEET 10 LINKEDIN 116 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hAml7o NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Fleming proposes a toast following the tapping of the first Dublin Stout Keg in Dublin, Ohio, on Aug. 1, 2008. (Photo: Uncredited, AP) Police in Cleveland were examining a bag found Sunday that may be linked to the crash last week of a private plane over Lake Erie. Searchers on Sunday were still trying to recover the plane, which disappeared late Thursday with six people on board. The bag belonged to the missing pilot, John T. Fleming, and apparently contained his identification card and other items, WKYC-TV reported Sunday. It was found at Shoreby Club Newport Harbor in Bratenahl, Ohio, near Cleveland. Recovery of missing plane with 6 aboard resumes Fleming and five others were heading home to Columbus, Ohio, late Thursday after attending a Cleveland Cavaliers game when their Cessna Citation 525 disappeared from radar over Lake Erie. The plane had just taken off from Burke Lakefront Airport, police said. A search plane flies over Lake Erie Dec. 30, 2016, in Cleveland, in the search for a plane carrying six people that disappeared shortly after takeoff from a Cleveland airport along Lake Erie's shore. \u00a0(Photo: Tony Dejak, AP) The search was halted Saturday due to bad weather, but it resumed Sunday morning, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer\u00a0 reported . The search was to begin near the last known location of the missing plane, about two miles north of downtown Cleveland. Also on board, in addition to the 46-year-old pilot, were Fleming\u2019s wife, Suzanne, 46, their two sons, 15-year-old John \"Jack\" Fleming and 14-year-old Andrew Fleming, a neighbor and the neighbor\u2019s daughter, The Columbus Dispatch\u00a0 reported .

Mariah Carey appears exasperated by the technical difficulties during her New Year's Eve show. STEPHANIE KEITH / Reuters She was the headline act at the event, where about a million revelers were ushering in 2017. Carey stopped lip-syncing to her her song \"Emotions,\" paced the stage and told the audience to finish the lyrics for her. \"I'm trying to be a good sport here,\" she told the crowd. Later, the visibly unhappy \" Shake it off \" singer abruptly left the stage. A representative for Carey confirmed to The Associated Press there were technical difficulties.

He died Saturday in California at the age of 84. Red Mclendon/AP William Christopher, an actor best known for his role as Father Mulcahy on the sitcom M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 84. Christopher's agent, Robert Malcolm, told The Associated Press he died early Saturday morning at home in Pasadena, Calif., after a battle with lung cancer. Christopher also had recurring roles on shows like Gomer Pyle: USMC and Hogan's Heroes. But it was his performance as Mulcahy that would come to be his signature role. M*A*S*H, which was based on a hit 1970 movie of the same name, debuted in 1972 and ran for 11 seasons \u2014 all of which featured Christopher. As the U.S. Army chaplain at a mobile surgical hospital, Christopher's Father Mulcahy was the moral compass of the show. After M*A*S*H, Christopher had a number of cameos on popular shows, like The Love Boat and Good Times. Christopher and his wife, Barbara, adopted two sons, one of whom had autism. They co-authored a book together called Mixed Blessings about the joys and struggles of parenting an autistic child. Article continues after sponsorship ",

The whale was seen swimming along the shores of Manhattan's upper East Side, close to Gracie Mansion, where the mayor lives, during a patrol by officers in a police boat. (New York City Police Department via AP) 0 Shares Email Officers patrolling New York City's harbor in a police boat have spotted a whale in the East River. The New York Police Department's special operations division posted a photo of the unusual tourist on its Twitter account Saturday morning. The whale was seen swimming along the shores of Manhattan's upper East Side, close to Gracie Mansion, where the mayor lives. U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Frank Iannazzo-Simmons says officials from his office haven't seen the whale. But he says based on the photos it appears to be a humpback whale. One such humpback whale was also spotted in the East River last month. Iannazzo-Simmons says the Coast Guard usually notifies mariners when it spots whales in busy waterways to be safe and \"let the whale be the whale.\" 0 Shares ",

By Karen Tumulty January 1 at 5:55 PM Follow @ktumulty Reince Priebus says that one of his most important tasks as Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff will be to establish \u201csome level of order within the White House.\u201d That, of course, has been the central mission of everyone who has held this post in the past, but it is certain to be a particularly daunting challenge with a president who regards chaos as a management tool. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a daily, sometimes hourly, testament to his impulsive nature, his disregard for norms and protocol, his bottomless appetite for random information and misinformation. Adding to the potential for tension is the fact that Trump\u2019s White House is being set up with rival centers of gravity. The structure puts Priebus on the same level as Stephen K. Bannon, whom Trump named to be his senior counselor and chief strategist. Bannon is the former chairman of Breitbart News, a media voice of the alt-right, which is a fiery fringe movement that embraces elements of white nationalism. Though the post-election announcement of Trump\u2019s White House team described Bannon and Priebus as \u201cequal partners to transform the federal government,\u201d it listed Bannon first. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s son-in-law and consigliere Jared Kushner is also expected to be close by in some kind of capacity that will give him a say in major decisions. None of the three has ever worked in a White House. All of this means that the 44-year-old Priebus will be at the center of an experiment to determine whether Trump\u2019s singular style of leadership \u2014 honed in his family business, displayed on reality television, and used with devastating effect in a presidential campaign that defied every expectation \u2014 will transform Washington as Trump promised or prove ineffective when applied to the more complex work of presiding over the massive federal government. The role in Trump\u2019s inner sanctum is, by some measures, a surprising spot for Priebus. After the party\u2019s 2012 defeat, the party chairman presided over an autopsy report that called for courting minorities by, among other things, embracing looser immigration laws. Trump, who campaigned on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and endorsed mass deportations, effectively rejected the recommendation \u2014 and won anyway. The power-sharing dynamic between Priebus and his new colleagues looks worrisome to those who have had Priebus\u2019s title in prior administrations. Some predict flatly that it will not work. \u201cThe president has to make it clear that Reince is first among equals,\u201d said Ken Duberstein, who served as chief of staff under Ronald Reagan. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to empower somebody on the staff.\u201d \u201cThe chief of staff, I think, has the responsibility to be all-knowing \u2014 to decide what the president should know, what he needs to know, what he doesn\u2019t need to know,\u201d agreed Andrew Card, who ran George W. Bush\u2019s White House staff for 5 1 /2\u00a0years, the second-longest tenure of any chief of staff in modern history. Ambiguous lines of authority, Card added, are likely to be \u201ca challenge.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, there can only be one chief of staff,\u201d Card said. Priebus, however, brushes off the skepticism. \u201cBannon, Jared and I work together extremely well,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good team of people around [Trump] where we respect each other and we present options for him that I think he looks at and says, \u2018Well, if these folks are on the same page, then it\u2019s probably a pretty good option to take.\u2019 \u201d But Trump is also known for being swayed by the last person he has talked to, especially if the advice is accompanied by flattery. In his White House, an array of people, some with strong personalities, are expected to have coveted walk-in privileges to bring their viewpoints directly to the Oval Office. Besides Bannon and Kushner, this will probably include counselor Kellyanne Conway, policy adviser Stephen Miller, national security adviser Michael T. Flynn and counterterrorism adviser Thomas Bossert. Trump\u2019s spokesmen did not respond to a request to interview the president-elect about his relationship with Priebus, or how Trump envisions Priebus\u2019s role. Historically, a White House chief of staff is often the first to be blamed when something goes wrong. It is a burnout job. Even successful ones rarely last more than a couple of years. Priebus, with a buttoned-up Midwestern bearing, has demonstrated a mastery of internal politics. His tenacity has been tested by the fact that he has survived six turbulent years \u2014 a record \u2014 as chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cReince has this kind of \u2018aw, shucks\u2019 demeanor, but he\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d said former RNC chairman Ed Gillespie. Wisconsin assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who was a college roommate of Priebus\u2019s, described him as \u201ca shrewd operator, in the best sense of the word.\u201d This side of Priebus was not always apparent over the past year. He often seemed like a hapless passenger, along for the wild ride that was Trump\u2019s candidacy. Priebus joked that it wasn\u2019t all that bad \u2014 he had not yet taken to pouring Baileys Irish Cream on his cereal in the morning. The GOP chairman\u2019s plight became so comedic that host Stephen Colbert and actor Tom Hanks tried that recipe of whiskey-and-cream liqueur over Lucky Charms on the \u201cLate Show.\u201d Colbert said: \u201cThey\u2019re going to be serving this at the convention, as part of the suicide pact.\u201d Hanks pronounced it \u201cfriggin\u2019 delicious\u201d and said he would start voting Republican. Priebus does not deny published accounts of one particularly low moment, which came in the wake of The Washington Post\u2019s Oct.\u00a08 revelation of a 2005 tape in which Trump was heard making lewd comments about women and boasting of groping them. The distraught party chairman reportedly urged the GOP nominee to drop out of the race, or face losing it in a landslide. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about private conversations,\u201d Priebus said when asked if it was true. \u201cSure, I mean I was nervous about it, like everybody was, and he apologized for it, and we started doing debate prep again the next day. And he just killed it in the second debate. He did such a great job, and he addressed it, and he did so, I think, like a champion, and he moved forward.\u201d Building a relationship Going back to Priebus\u2019s early days as party chairman in 2011, Trump Tower had been a regular stop on his fundraising rounds. When Priebus made the pilgrimage to Manhattan in early 2015, he noticed something seemed different about Trump. The celebrity real estate developer had flirted with a presidential run so many times before that no one gave the idea much credence anymore. But Trump\u2019s questions about the primary process struck Priebus as unusually detailed and pointed: How did the Iowa caucuses work? How were delegates awarded? Did straw polls matter? \u201cI left, and I started wondering whether he was actually getting very serious about running,\u201d Priebus recalled. It would soon become apparent that he was, and as the campaign unfolded, Priebus began talking to Trump far more frequently than the other contenders. \u201cPerhaps some of the reason we became close is that he wasn\u2019t as rigid as a lot of the people running for president,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cThey were very controlled. They\u2019re trained to be at arm\u2019s length, even if you\u2019re friends with them. Set up a phone call at 4:30 tomorrow to talk for 15\u00a0minutes to somebody. That\u2019s just not the way that President-elect Trump runs.\u201d Early on, Priebus used some of those sessions to urge Trump to tamp down his incendiary and divisive rhetoric. That turned out to be futile. \u201cYes, occasionally we had disagreements along the way,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cWe ended up creating a relationship where our front-runner felt comfortable with the chairman of the party, and the chairman of the party felt comfortable with a front-runner that was not the typical plasticized Washington politician.\u201d \u2018The ultimate diplomat\u2019 The Trump-Priebus relationship has had its rough patches during the campaign, but in one important regard, it also turned out to be what Priebus called \u201ca perfect marriage.\u201d As he had dug the Republican Party out of debt, Priebus had been working for years to construct the kind of political infrastructure Trump\u2019s campaign had neither the resources nor the inclination to build for itself. Such unglamorous basics as ground operation and data collection were a badly needed asset in some of the close states Trump needed to put him over 270 electoral votes. \u201cThe party had to be just about perfect to win. The Democrats can be good and still win, but we have to be about perfect in order to win,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt just turns out that the president-elect\u2019s message was ringing extremely true to the electorate and we had the data and the infrastructure to back it up.\u201d And from the time when it had become clear that the New York real estate mogul would be the 2016 standard-bearer for a party whose establishment he had trashed, Priebus had taken on the difficult task of tugging the warring GOP factions toward reconciliation and acceptance, if not enthusiasm. One of this most important projects was bringing aboard key party leaders in Priebus\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, which had gone for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in the primary and where Trump had been at war with major political figures. The most important target, allies said, was House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). Priebus \u201cwas the ultimate diplomat,\u201d said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose own 2016 presidential hopes had fallen early victim to Trump. \u201cPaul\u2019s support was critical to sending a message, not just to House members, but just overall Republican voters. Reince was just tenacious.\u201d Vos, like many prominent Wisconsin Republicans, had supported Walker, then Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), then Cruz, only to see each of their hopes incinerated in the anti-establishment brushfire that Trump had ignited. \u201cAs soon as Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee, he was all over me,\u201d Vos said of Priebus. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll take whatever you got.\u2019 \u201d Trump carried Wisconsin by less than a percentage point, becoming the first Republican to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1984. As Trump and his team have turned to governing, people knowledgeable about the internal deliberations of the transition say, Priebus has more often than not gotten his way on key administration hires. Several of his top aides are being lined up for big jobs in the White House. Most notable thus far has been RNC communications director and Priebus confidant Sean Spicer as press secretary. Katie Walsh, currently Priebus\u2019s chief of staff at the RNC, is considered likely to become a deputy White House chief of staff. Trump\u2019s naming of Priebus sent a reassuring signal to the Washington establishment, including Ryan, whose ability to work with Trump is going to be vital to Republicans getting anything done. Priebus said his new job was not the result of outside lobbying, but \u201call a matter of Donald Trump\u2019s opinion.\u201d Politics in his blood Priebus grew up in historically Democratic blue-collar Kenosha, the son of a German American electrician father and a Greek mother born in Africa. His first name is short for Reinhold. He was campaign chairman for Ronald Reagan in his third-grade mock election, listened to speeches by rising GOP firebrand Newt Gingrich on cassettes in his car as a teenager, and took his future wife, Sally, to a party fundraiser on their first date. Priebus had nurtured a dream of being elected to office himself some day but lost a close race for state Senate in 2004, forcing him to recalibrate his ambitions and rechannel his love of politics. In 2007, he became Wisconsin party chairman at the beginning of a turbulent era in that state\u2019s politics, requiring some of the rough-water navigation skills he would later need on the national level. Though Priebus had establishment credentials as a lawyer with one of the state\u2019s big firms, he also became a regular presence at tea party rallies and grass-roots gatherings. \u201cHe was this interesting mix,\u201d said Walker, who was a legislator and county executive during those early years. \u201cYou\u2019d think, historically, people like that are raising money. They\u2019re good at knowing the major power players in the Milwaukee area. Reince could do all that. He was also very much connected to the grass roots and the true believers.\u201d Priebus, as a result, shared in the credit for the 2010 election of tea party favorites Walker and Sen. Ron Johnson. And for helping Walker weather a recall effort. Those successes made him something of a star in GOP circles. He became RNC chairman in 2011 at a desperate time for the party, which was $24 million in debt. It had a little more than $350,000 cash on hand and a $400,000 payroll due six days later \u2014 a situation so dire that, early on, he had to help float it by maxing out two personal credit cards to pay his travel expenses. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have the White House and you don\u2019t have the Congress, dialing for money is just hard as hell, and he just kept doing it, and he didn\u2019t have anybody helping him,\u201d said lobbyist Richard Hohlt. \u201cHe loved the job.\u201d By the end of 2012, the RNC has $3.3\u00a0million in the bank and no debt. As different as he is from Trump, Priebus shares one thing with the president-elect: little apparent need for sleep. Walker marveled at how he has texted Priebus at 11\u00a0p.m. on a Saturday, gotten an immediate response, and then awakened to a follow-up sent at dawn. That means that when the future president is firing off tweets in the wee hours, as is his wont, his chief of staff will probably be up and seeing them. The two also will be learning the fundamentals of their jobs together. At a recent lunch with former White House chiefs of staff, hosted by the current one, Denis McDonough, Priebus peppered his predecessors with basic questions, according to three sources with knowledge of what was said during the private session. Among his queries: How do you involve Cabinet officials, and make sure they are pursuing the president\u2019s agenda, rather than their own? Who are the most crucial allies to have in the building? How do you control who gets the president\u2019s ear? What is paramount, said former chief of staff Card, is that no one be allowed to make end runs around Priebus. \u201cAlmost no debate in the Oval Office should come without a prior debate in the chief of staff\u2019s office,\u201d Card said. \u201cIt is going to be a challenge for Reince.\u201d Priebus disagreed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a particular challenge,\u201d he said, promising \u201can orderly system in place in which the president is informed, and not exhausted with multiple sources of information in an unorganized fashion.\u201d There was that word again: order. Achieving it could determine Trump\u2019s success. And the responsibility for making it happen will be riding on his chief of staff, who might want to keep a bottle of Baileys handy, just in case.

    "text": "Manhunt Underway After Shooting Attack at Istanbul Nightclub Kills 39 By Michael Edison Hayden Jan 1, 2017, 4:15 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Dozens Killed in Attack on Istanbul Nightclub 0 Shares Email A manhunt is underway in Turkey after a gunman went on a rampage in a crowded Istanbul nightclub during New Year's Eve celebrations early Sunday morning, killed at least 39 people and injured at least 69 more, according to Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The popular Reina club had attracted a diverse crowd of between 400 and 500 patrons from foreign countries as well as Turkey to ring in the new year before the attack by an apparently lone shooter at around 1:15 a.m, authorities said. Turkish police said one gunman perpetrated the violence. Later, they released on social media photos of men whom they said were the Istanbul nightclub \"attackers,\" images which they said were of the men going through a passport check-in as they entered Turkey. The gunman armed with what authorities described as a long-barreled weapon killed a policeman and a civilian outside of the club before \"[raining] bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people\" inside the club, according to Visip Sahin, the governor of Istanbul. The Associated Press Ambulances rushing away from the scene of an attack in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Private NTV television said more than one assailant may have been involved in the attack. Twenty-four of the 39 killed were foreign nationals, according to Turkey's state-run news agency. Authorities said the foreign victims hailed from Belgium, France, India, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia. Sources told ABC News that one American was among the nearly 70 people injured. The U.S. is not aware of any Americans dying in the attack, the U.S. State Department said early Sunday. Of the 69 people who were injured, four were hospitalized in serious condition, according to Soylu, who described the attack as \"inhuman.\" \"This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery,\" Soylu said. At a press conference Sunday, Soylu said the assailant arrived wearing a jacket and pants, and is believed to have left wearing different clothing. The Associated Press People leave as medics and security officials work at the scene after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a statement Sunday, \"I vehemently condemn the terror attack ... Turkey continues its combat against terror and is absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary in the region to ensure its citizens' safety and peace.\" The Associated Press Medics and security officials work at the scene after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. The U.S. issued a statement offering assistance to Turkish authorities. \"The president was briefed by his National Security Team on the attack in Istanbul,\" President Obama's principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said in a statement. \"The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted.\" The Associated Press Medics carry a wounded person at the scene after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Mark Toner, America's State Department 's deputy spokesman said in a statement, \"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey ... We will remain in close touch with Turkish authorities throughout the investigation ... We stand in solidarity with our NATO Ally Turkey in combating the ongoing threat of terrorism .\" Russian President Vladimir Putin , whose complex relationship with Turkey was further complicated in December after a Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead today by a lone gunman fired at him at a photo exhibition in Ankara, Turkey's capital in a widely-seen, on-camera attack, sent Erdogan a telegram of condolences, according to the Kremlin, writing, \"It is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations. However, terrorists don't share moral values. Our common duty is to combat terrorists' aggression,\" Putin said. The Associated Press Young people leave from the scene of an attack in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Turkey has suffered numerous terrorist attacks in recent years, including bombings. Among the incidents in the country were a suicide attack at a wedding this August and coordinated shootings and bombings of Istanbul's major international airport in June, attacks that killed scores of civilians. The Associated Press People talk to medics in an ambulance near the scene of an attack in Istanbul, early Sunday, Jan. 1, 2017. Turkey's state-run news agency said an armed assailant has opened fire at a nightclub in Istanbul during New Year's celebrations.

Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune The final play of Matt Barkley 's season was a turnover. Returned for a touchdown. In a 38-10 division loss that left the Bears with an 0-8 road record in a brutal 3-13 season. Fittingly, that's the way the Bears said goodbye to the 2016 season on the first day of 2017 \u2014 with that one final giveaway, a Barkley fumble on a strip sack that was returned 20 yards for a touchdown by Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen. Thus, for the final 9:51 of Sunday afternoon's drubbing at U.S. Bank Stadium, Barkley was confined to the visiting sideline, alone with his thoughts and regret as fellow quarterback David Fales saw his first career regular-season action \u2014 in garbage time of a garbage game in a garbage season. Barkley didn't need an explanation for his late benching. \"We were down by four scores,\" he said. \"It was just a chance to get David some reps.\" Barkley detailed the sequence preceding the fumble, noting how he was focused on an in route from Cameron Meredith on the backside. But it never came open. Then, as Barkley scrambled forward, defensive end Danielle Hunter broke away from Bears right tackle Bobby Massie while defensive tackle Linval Joseph shed Cody Whitehair. When the two Vikings linemen converged on Barkley, they pried the ball loose and watched it squirt free as they crashed to the ground. \"I felt like I was down on the play,\" Barkley said. \"But it all happened pretty fast. Just one of those unfortunate things.\" ",

Bill Whitaker is the correspondent. Andrew Bast, Guy Campanile and Michael Radutzky, producers. The number of casualties in Chicago since last New Year\u2019s Day has surged to a level more in line with a war zone than one of America\u2019s great cities. More than 700 people were murdered. Over 4,000 shot. That\u2019s more than Los Angeles and New York combined.\u00a0 Gangs, guns and drugs have caused chaos in Chicago for years. But something new caught our attention. There\u2019s been a drop in the kind of police work that law enforcement says is critical to preventing crime. Usually stops and arrests go up when violence is rising. So we went to Chicago to look for an explanation. What we found was a police department on its heels as the city suffered its worst bloodshed in 18 years. People march to protest gun violence in Chicago, Illinois. CBS News In the six days we were in Chicago, 55 people were shot, 16 were killed. We were struck by just how routine it all felt. The dead and wounded were removed with grim efficiency -- right down to the HAZMAT crews that cleaned away the blood. Murder seemed almost normal. Michael Pfleger: And now we are the poster boy of violence in America. Michael Pfleger is pastor of St. Sabina Church on Chicago\u2019s South Side. His congregation started summer weekends by praying for a low body count. Father Michael Pfleger CBS News Michael Pfleger: I had three families-- three different families call in one day asking to do the funeral of their child that was killed in the last week. I\u2019ve never had that in 41 years here. Three families in one day. Fifty-nine gangs are at war over territory and drugs on Chicago\u2019s West and South Sides. But the makeshift memorials we saw, also mark places where people were killed in gang initiations or over petty insults. This gang member was taunting a rival on his phone live on the Internet when he was shot. Watch and you\u2019ll see the gunman. Bill Whitaker: What\u2019s it like here on a typical Saturday night these days? Michael Pfleger: I\u2019ve never seen there to be a combination of anger, distrust, and a feeling like communities have been abandoned. [Chicago protest: Peace in the streets.] Michael Pfleger: Shame on us that our children are afraid to go out of their house of being shot and killed. When is the tipping point, do we all say, enough? But we were astonished by data we obtained from inside the police department. It revealed that as killings rose, police activity fell. In August of 2015, cops stopped and questioned 49,257 people. A year later those stops dropped to 8,859, down 80 percent. At the same time arrests were off by a third, from just over 10,000 to 6,900. Bill Whitaker: You talk to cops every day. Brian Warner: We do. Bill Whitaker: What\u2019s the morale? Brian Warner: Lowest it\u2019s ever been. Brian Warner is a former Chicago cop. He was shot in 2011. Now Warner counsels officers suffering from extreme stress. He explained what a dozen beat cops told us off-camera: they had stepped back. Brian Warner: You have a 911 call, you go to your 911 call. But if you\u2019re one-- aggressive patrol when you\u2019re out looking for people breaking the law. That\u2019s not happening as much as it was. Bill Whitaker: You say they\u2019re not being as proactive? Brian Warner: No. They\u2019re not. And how could you ask them to be? And why would you expect them to be? Bill Whitaker: Because it\u2019s their job. They signed on to do that. Brian Warner: It\u2019s my job to go to work and listen to your 911 calls and respond. That\u2019s the basic ability of my job. So if you want me to do the basics that\u2019s what I am doing now. Garry McCarthy: The police activity is horrific. Honestly. And there, and there\u2019s not an excuse that could be made in my book. Garry McCarthy, Chicago\u2019s former police superintendent CBS News We showed the stop and arrest data that we got to Garry McCarthy. He was superintendent of the Chicago Police Department until just a year ago. Garry McCarthy: When you have activity falling off the way it is and crime skyrocketing, that\u2019s a huge problem. Bill Whitaker: Some people, looking at the Chicago Police Department have said it\u2019s in crisis. Garry McCarthy: Crisis is a good word. When people are dying, yes, there\u2019s crisis. No two ways about it. This crisis inside the police department began in 2014 with the shooting of Laquan McDonald. He was 17 years old. Police reported McDonald was breaking into vehicles and ignored their commands when they said he lunged at one of them with a knife. But dashboard video appears to show McDonald was moving away when he was shot 16 times by a white officer. Bill Whitaker: When did you first see the video? Garry McCarthy: I saw the video, I believe it was the day after. Bill Whitaker: What did you think? Garry McCarthy: I said that there\u2019s a problem. And the officer\u2019s going to be accountable for explaining his actions. Garry McCarthy immediately gave the case to the independent city agency that reviews shootings. \u00a0But City Hall refused to make the video public, even after it paid McDonald\u2019s family a $5 million settlement. When a judge finally ordered the video released a year later, it sparked outrage. Protesters accused the city of a cover-up to protect Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s reelection. The mayor denied it, but promised sweeping changes. His first move was to fire Garry McCarthy. Bill Whitaker: Do you think you were made a scapegoat? Garry McCarthy: I don\u2019t think it helped the situation, and I think it\u2019s a contributory factor to where are today in Chicago. And if you want to call it scapegoat, that\u2019s fine. The cop who killed Laquan McDonald is awaiting trial for murder and the U.S. Justice department is investigating the Chicago PD. We wanted to talk to Mayor Emanuel, but he declined. Within six weeks of the shooting scandal, investigative stops fell by nearly 35,000. That\u2019s when the violence began to surge. Bill Whitaker: How can a police officer who has taken a vow to protect and serve defend stepping back from taking proactive action. How can you not-- Garry McCarthy: Officers are under attack. That\u2019s how they feel, right. That\u2019s how they feel in this environment, and they\u2019re not going to put themselves and their families in jeopardy. Frustration among cops deepened with a new order to be more selective about who they stopped, and write a two-page detailed report for every one. It was the result of a threat by the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the department for racial profiling. Bill Whitaker: It doesn\u2019t seem that filling out a two page report is that onerous. Garry McCarthy: Oh, sure it is. Bill Whitaker: It is? Garry McCarthy: It could take you up to 45 minutes and one of the things in policing that we\u2019ve been trying to do is knock back the amount of time that officers spend doing paperwork and get them out doing more proactive things to prevent crime. There are reasons for the scrutiny. Since 2004, the city has paid out more than a half-billion dollars in settlements for police misconduct. A task force appointed by the mayor found evidence of racial bias, and reported that nearly 90 percent of police shootings involved minorities. Richard Wooten: The Chicago Police is not racist, but I do know and do believe that there are racist police officers in the Chicago Police Department. Richard Wooten broke ranks and talked to the mayor\u2019s task force about what he saw during his 23 years as a Chicago cop. Richard Wooten: They put me in this car with this guy, and my first couple of stops, I saw this guy stop a black guy. You know, several black guys on the street and they literally almost got strip searched right in the middle of the street. And I\u2019m looking like \u201cWow.\u201d Is this the way things are supposed to be done? Bill Whitaker: You were called a traitor for speaking out? Richard Wooten: Oh yes. At my retirement party when I got up to speak, a group of white boys in the back, they booed me, called me traitor, snitch. Bill Whitaker: Was the booing the extent of it? Richard Wooten: No. I went into the restroom, and I was confronted by a couple of the guys in the restroom about, you know, my position and how could I do that after 20-some years of service? But then as I\u2019m looking into the urinal I see my picture that they\u2019ve torn out of the program is in each urinal. Bill Whitaker: They put your picture in the urinals? Richard Wooten: My picture in the urinals. But I wasn\u2019t angry Bill. Bill Whitaker: You weren\u2019t angry? Richard Wooten: I was not angry. Because that just told me how dysfunctional we have of officers we have on the police department. The turmoil was not lost on gang members who record their attempts to lure officers into a confrontation. [Say \u201chi\u201d! No questions, gentlemen.] This video was posted online by someone claiming to be connected to the Simon City Royals street gang. The impact was evident during this October arrest. Officer Veronica Murillo says it was the fear of becoming the next viral video that kept her from pulling her gun as she struggled with this suspect. He knocked her down and bashed her head into the pavement. She suffered neurological damage that has endangered her career. Garry McCarthy: The noncompliance of the law is becoming legitimized. And the police are on their heels. They\u2019re on their heels for a number of reasons. Bill Whitaker: How dangerous is that? Garry McCarthy: We see the results, don\u2019t we? We\u2019re reaching a state of lawlessness. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Dozens of innocent people have paid the price. Flora White: I pray every night and every day that that no hurt, harm, or danger will come to my children. Flora White\u2019s son, Jonathan Mills Flora White\u2019s prayers went unanswered. She showed us the parking lot where her 26-year-old son, Jonathan, was murdered in July. He played basketball in college and in Europe. Flora White: He wasn\u2019t out here selling drugs. He wasn\u2019t out here gang banging. He wasn\u2019t doing any of that. Bill Whitaker: And yet he ended up dead. Flora White: Exactly. Jonathan was on his way to practice when he stopped to talk to friends. Investigators say he was shot by a gang member who was angry they were on his turf. Bill Whitaker: By our count there have been about a dozen shootings just this August just in the area surrounding the spot where Jonathan was killed. Flora White: Uh-huh. Bill Whitaker: Yet at the same time, stops by police in the neighborhood have dropped by almost 80 percent. What do you think about that? Flora White: What do I think about that? I think it\u2019s a joke of accountability in politics. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson, right, and 60 Minutes\u2019 Bill Whitaker \u00a0at a crime scene in Chicago, Illinois. CBS News We went looking for accountability from Chicago\u2019s new police superintendent, Eddie Johnson. He worked his way up over a 28-year career. Eddie Johnson: If I found someone that was intentionally not doing his job, then I would discipline him. This is a tough job. It\u2019s a dangerous job. But it\u2019s also a noble job. Johnson insisted the main reasons for the drop in police activity were stricter standards for stops and the forms triggered by the ACLU. But he admitted his cops have become more careful. Eddie Johnson: They are cautious about doing their jobs. Bill Whitaker: You are calling it caution. They\u2019re telling us it\u2019s backing down. Eddie Johnson: You know I still go out in the field and I talk to officers too. And they take offense to people referring to them as backing down or not doing their job. Bill Whitaker: The one number that I think is not in dispute is the homicide rate has gone-- not just the rate, the-- Eddie Johnson: Skyrocketed. Bill Whitaker: --number of homicides have skyrocketed. So the number of stops and arrests are going down dramatically. And the number of people being shot and killed are going up dramatically. There\u2019s got to be a correlation. Eddie Johnson: Well, you know, there may be some, you know? But again I-- I\u2019d have to go back to it\u2019s not what the police officers are not doing. It\u2019s more about what these-- what the criminal if-- offenders are doing. Bill Whitaker: But don\u2019t the police pay a role? Eddie Johnson: Yeah we play a role in terms of mitigating it. Bill Whitaker: But it\u2019s not being mitigated. Eddie Johnson: Nah, I wouldn\u2019t say that. What we can\u2019t measure is the crime that we stop. Johnson is hiring and promoting a thousand cops in an attempt to get a handle on the violence. But it\u2019ll take a year under his plan to get reinforcements to where Flora White lost her son Jonathan. Flora White: What good is it gonna do? Bill Whitaker: You don\u2019t think more police on the street will make a difference? Flora White: I\u2019m gonna hire more people to do a job that\u2019s not being done? What sense do that make? \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Recent Segments ",
