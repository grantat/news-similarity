The CDC also reported that eight pediatric deaths have been reported due to seasonal influenza and that 10 states have experienced high amounts of people with flu-like symptoms. Widespread influenza activity was reported in 37 states. What Does the Future Hold for Youngest Double Hand Transplant Patient Currently, there are 15.4 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the U.S., according to the CDC.

    "text": "WATCH Army Veteran, Double Amputee Finds New Battlefield in DC 0 Shares Email Florida Congressman Brian Mast says he decided to run for office on a day seven years ago when he woke up in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The Army bomb technician had been serving in Kandahar, Afghanistan, as part of the Joint Special Operations Command. \u201cWe came to a place on the battlefield that I told my guys I was pretty sure that there was a bomb buried somewhere there,\u201d Mast said. \u201cI found it in a way I didn\u2019t intend to.\u201d Mast stepped on an improvised explosive device and lost both of his legs and his left index finger in the blast. His injuries ended his 12-year military career, but not his commitment to service. \u201cThe most important lesson my father ever gave me was very shortly after I was injured,\u201d Mast recalled. \u201cHe said, 'Brian, you can't let this keep you down ... You cannot let your kids see you sitting on your butt regardless of what happened to you, because your kids will think it\u2019s an OK way for them to go through their life. That's when I decided the most important fight of my life could be here in Washington, D.C. in another capacity.\u201d The father of three announced his candidacy for Florida\u2019s 18th congressional district on June 8, 2015 and defeated five fellow Republicans in the primary election before winning the general election against Democratic businessman Randy Perkins. Mast arrived in Washington six days later for what\u2019s known as freshman orientation for first-time members of the House of Representatives. \u201cI called freshman orientation 'kindergarten for Congress,'\u201d Mast said. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard it said by a hundred different representatives that their first day, it\u2019s like drinking from the fire hose -- and there's some truth in that. They\u2019re explaining to you the system of getting your office, and then what you have to do to set up your office, and you're hiring staff from the chief of staff to the legislative director and the scheduler all the way down the line -- on top of trying to be proficient in every bit of policy that exists out there, because you never know what you are going to get asked about.\u201d Mast says he has two clear priorities for this first term. He\u2019s focused on propping up the Army Corps of Engineers with an eye toward addressing water- quality issues along Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast. And Mast knows there are many people counting on him to be a strong voice for veterans in Washington. \u201cIt is important that I be the loudest possible representative that I can be for our service members coming back home, and making sure that they're getting the care that they deserve from the Department of Veterans Affairs. That when they walk in the door of the VA, they're treated like they're the most important veteran to ever walk in that door, because that's what they deserve.\u201d 0 Shares ",

Holocaust survivor Josiane Traum lights a memorial candle during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day Commemoration at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on Jan. 27, 2017 in Washington. (Win McNamee / Getty Images) Abby PhillipThe Washington Post A statement from President Donald Trump marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day omitted any mention of Jews or anti-Semitism, a departure from recent bipartisan precedent set by previous presidents. The statement calls for remembrance of \"victims, survivors, heroes,\" but nowhere does it mention the millions of Jewish people killed during the Holocaust, nor does it mention the ideology of anti-Semitism that led to the killings. Here's the statement from Trump in full: \"It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror. \"Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent. \"In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world.\" In a series of tweets, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, noted the omissions. \"@WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay, misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just 'innocent people,' \" Greenblatt tweeted. \"Puzzling and troubling @WhiteHouse #HolocaustMemorialDay stmt has no mention of Jews. GOP and Dem. presidents have done so in the past.\" Steven Goldstein, executive Director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, was also critical of the White House statement. \"President Trump's statement today for International Holocaust Remembrance Day makes NO MENTION of Jews,\" he said in a statement. \"How can you forget, Mr. President, that six million Jews were murdered because they were Jews? You chose the vague phrase 'innocent people.' They were Jews, Mr. President.\" The international day of remembrance has fallen on the day the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated since 2006. Former president Barack Obama's statements on the day noted the \"6 million Jews and millions of other people\" who were killed by Nazis. In 2005, when President George W. Bush marked the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, he declared it \"a reminder that when we find anti-Semitism, we must come together to fight it.\" In 2007, Bush's statement marking the day noted: \"We must continue to condemn the resurgence of anti-Semitism, that same virulent intolerance that led to the Holocaust, and we must combat bigotry and hatred in all their forms, in America and abroad.\" The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Fred Brown, a spokesman for the Republican Jewish Coalition, blamed the controversy on political partisans. \"It's outrageous that people are using Holocaust Remembrance Day for partisan reasons or to try and settle scores,\" Brown said in a statement. \"The horrors of the Holocaust are not to be taken lightly. We must never forget the millions of Jews who suffered at the hands of hate, and the heroes who died fighting it.\" ",

    "text": "College students traveled across the country to March for Life By Brooke Metz 4:14 pm EST January 27, 2017 56    shares SEND EMAIL Less than a week after\u00a0nearly 500,000 people\u00a0 flooded the streets in Washington, D.C. in support of women\u2019s rights \u2014 not to mention the satellite Women\u2019s Marches in cities across the country and even around the world \u2014 thousands are gathered in D.C. for a different cause, with one North Dakota college leading the way. This year, the private, Catholic University of Mary led the March for Life , an annual event in which thousands of pro-life supporters assemble in Washington to \u201ctestify to the beauty of life and the dignity of each person,\u201d according to the March for Life\u00a0 website . The group has united against legalized abortion at the march every year since 1974, the year after the passing of Roe v. Wade. This year, about 400 students and 50 faculty and staff members from University of Mary attended, according to the school. (Last year, they were among those\u00a0 stranded \u00a0on the Pennsylvania Turnpike for hours in a blizzard after the march.)\u00a0 The trip from North Dakota takes about 27 hours each way, says\u00a0senior Katrina Gallic, who was among those stranded last year and spoke at this year\u2019s march. \u201cWe want to give witness to babies who have lost their lives and be part of a movement founded in love for each other and the rights we are blessed to have,\u201d Gallic told USA TODAY College. Pro-life demonstrators march towards the U.S. Supreme Court during the 44th annual March for Life in Washington, DC, on January 27, 2017. Anti-abortion advocates descended on the U.S. capital on Friday for an annual march expected to draw the largest crowd in years, with the White House spotlighting the cause and throwing its weight behind the campaign. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) Abortion rights has been drawn into question since the election. While the new administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke at the march, has voiced strong opposition to abortion , a\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0 study \u00a0earlier this month found that about 70% of Americans support Roe v. Wade. The Center also reported that\u00a0 more than half \u00a0of conservative Republicans and leaners believe the decision should be reversed. One major argument in the abortion debate is over the question of when a fetus becomes a human being. While there is discrepancy among states on the exact point at which a fetus can be aborted ( most states \u00a0allow pregnancy termination through the first 24-26 weeks), those on the pro-life side emphasize that a living child comes into existence at the moment of conception. And it\u2019s not just Univ. of Mary students who are actively involved with the right-to-life campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to draw an arbitrary line after conception as to where it can be put down,\u201d says Steve Miller, a junior at the University of Dayton. Many pro-life students feel misunderstood, especially with the recent rhetoric on women\u2019s rights in the U.S. Related: What SCOTUS\u2019 historic abortion ruling means for every woman in America \u201cPeople will say \u2018it\u2019s my body, my choice,\u2019 but it\u2019s more than just the woman\u2019s body \u2014 it\u2019s the body within them,\u201d says Miller.\u00a0\u201cThis movement\u00a0isn\u2019t about taking away the rights of women; it\u2019s supporting the rights of the unborn child.\u201d But what if that child is conceived in violent or tragic circumstances? The Guttmacher Institute found that\u00a0 one percent \u00a0of abortions occur because the woman was a victim of rape.\u00a0While they agree that these situations are unimaginably awful, most pro-life supporters still believe women should carry the pregnancy to term regardless. \u201cIt\u2019s such a terrible thing, and my heart breaks whenever I hear about it,\u201d says Christina Vazquez, a freshman at the University of Central Florida. \u201cBut it\u2019s never the child\u2019s fault.\u201d \u201cAll life has value, no matter the tragic circumstances of its creation,\u201d says Hillsdale College sophomore\u00a0Kathleen Russo, who serves as the school\u2019s March for Life coordinator. They also stress the importance of caring for not only the child, but the mother as well, particularly in\u00a0tragedy. \u201cWomen need to be given the best care and love,\u201d Gallic says. \u201cThere is still another human involved and we need to keep their rights in mind, but we need to love both of them in that situation.\u201d Pence\u00a0voiced a similar opinion in his remarks at the march. \u201cLet this movement be known for love, not anger,\u201d Pence said, emphasizing compassion over judgment. University of Miami senior Alejandro Gomez says though he\u2019s a strong believer in the pro-life movement, he refuses to judge anyone for being pro-choice. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst way to go about it,\u201d Gomez said.\u00a0\u201cInstead of being judgmental, we should allot mercy and talk to those who are pro-choice about why we think like this.\u201d Pro-life supporters say there are various alternatives available for women considering abortion, including pregnancy crisis centers, which offer resources like clothing and counseling. \u201cThere are always options and people who want to promote a culture of love,\u201d Russo says. \u201cWe have to understand\u00a0that all humans are in different circumstances but all need love, from babies in the womb to mothers in terrible situations.\u201d Brooke Metz is a member of the USA TODAY College contributor network.

    "text": "Twitter Despite his 22 years in LaGrange, Ga., Louis Dekmar had not heard of Austin Callaway \u2014 but some members of his community knew Callaway's story well. Callaway, a 16-year-old African-American in police custody, was abducted at gunpoint by a mob. Hours later, Callaway was discovered with five bullet wounds in his head. He died shortly afterward in the hospital. The police department did not pursue an investigation into the lynching. A grand jury's only comment on it was to recommend better jail cell locks. That was Sept. 8, 1940. On Thursday Chief Dekmar, a white man, stood before a gathering at Warren Temple United Methodist Church, and he apologized. \"As LaGrange police chief, I sincerely regret and denounce the role our police department played in Austin's lynching, both through our action and our inaction,\" Dekmar told the assembly. \"For that, I'm profoundly sorry. It should never have happened.\" Dekmar was joined during that remembrance by Mayor Jim Thornton and other authorities in the town. The full remembrance was live-streamed on Facebook by LGTV LaGrange Television for viewers outside the bounds of the church, and can be watched in the video above. Dekmar's speech begins at about the 25-minute mark. It was a moment long in coming \u2014 nearly three-quarters of a century, in fact. Article continues after sponsorship For Dekmar, the path to this apology began several years ago, when he learned of a comment one elderly black woman made to another while waiting to see detectives: \"They killed our people,\" the woman said. It was only after some research that Dekmar learned of Callaway's story. And it was only with the help of the NAACP, local politicians and LaGrange College that a formal remembrance of Callaway could finally come together. He tells NPR that the comment shared between the two women hammered home a crucial point for him. \"Despite the fact that very few people are alive today that were alive then, the attitudes about the police department \u2014 and the attitudes as it relates to the city government in general \u2014 is influenced by those experiences which are passed down through generations,\" Dekmar says. And those memories, and the distrust of law enforcement that they engender, create a filter between the police department and the community. He says that's why moments like Thursday's ceremony, however tardy they are in coming, remain necessary. This is particularly true given the racial makeup of the community in LaGrange, which is about 48 percent African-American . Dekmar says law enforcement in the area is about 14 percent black, though he says his department has worked hard to improve diversity within its ranks. Resentment toward police persists among members of the local black community, he says \u2014 \"and rightfully so,\" given the memories of lynchings like Callaway's. \"Apology is never enough,\" Kristen Reed, who attended the remembrance, told reporter Sam Whitehead of Georgia Public Broadcasting. \"I don't think an apology is ever enough for a murder or for a lynching and for the injustice that followed.\" Still, after the ceremony, Reed noted the rarity of such a moment. \"For them to feel the need to say they were sorry sends a message, especially in a climate like this,\" Reed said. And for Dekmar, it's that small step that matters. \"We don't expect ever to erase the past,\" he says. \"But what I hope last night will do is interrupt the past.\" ",

Ricky Carioti / The Washington Post via Getty Images Share advertisement President Donald Trump's plans to promote natural gas while protecting coal jobs may be nothing but a pipe dream. On the one hand, he's pledged regulatory rollbacks on fracking and opening federal lands to boost natural gas production. But he also has said he's going to \"save coal.\" This Thursday he doubled down on a Trumpian paradox, saying at a GOP retreat in Philadelphia, \"We're going to put our coal miners to work.\" Yet in a 2012 tweet he promoted lower natural gas prices , saying, \"Fracking will lead to American energy independence.\" He stoked the burning contradiction within the same speech this September as well. \"The shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for America,\" Trump told a meeting of natural gas industry executives in Pittsburgh. \"And we will end the war on coal and the war on miners.\" Trump has stated his actions will help the country unlock an additional $50 trillion in untapped energy reserves.

Both coal and natural gas are in the business of lighting American homes \u2014 and one can't win without the other losing. \"Unless the Trump administration wants to constrain natural gas production or drive up gas prices, coal will continue to fall behind cheaper and cleaner energy sources,\" Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told NBC News. In the past decade, natural gas has been on a winning streak, with production increasing 10 trillion cubic feet between 2005 to 2015. That's lowered prices and made it the top choice for power plants across America. A Cleaner Power Plan Experts say energy from coal production could hold steady instead of dropping, if Trump repealed the Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants \u2014 especially those burning coal. Estimate showing the effect of repealing the Clean Power Plan on coal energy production in billion kilowatthours. The blue line projects with the plan, the orange line without. Center for Climate and Energy Solutions \"Without the Clean Power Plan, coal basically flatlines, rising ever so slightly all the way out to 2050,\" said Doug Vine, a senior fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. But even if Trump is able to pause coal's death spiral, that is a far cry from \"bringing coal back.\" There are no plans being considered for new coal plants, except one \"clean coal\" plant in Mississippi. \"I've suggested to Mr. Trump that he temper his expectations,\" top coal executive Robert Murray told CNN Money . Coal jobs, he said, \"can't be brought back to where it was before the election of Barack Obama.\" Fracking Boom Related: Could Trump Really Bring Back Manufacturing Jobs? \"Trump as an antithesis to climate policies will be quite helpful with coal,\" said Ben Zycher, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. He predicted there could be new coal mines dug in the western United States as a result. However, \"Reducing the regulatory burden on natural gas, particularly with fracking fields, will make life harder for coal producers.\" It seems not even Trump can overcome macroeconomics with a pen or a tweet. \"He's going to permit pipelines, take away some restrictions on shale drilling, make it easier to drill, probably remove some restrictions on digging coal, but in the end this is the market that even he cannot control by edict,\" said Irwin Seltzer, a scholar at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. And while presidents have large powers over things like international tariffs, they can't order utilities to burn coal. \"The name of the game is natural gas,\" said Seltzer. \"The game is over.\" Ben Popken ",

    "text": "CBS News Last Updated Jan 27, 2017 11:42 AM EST President Trump spoke directly over the phone Saturday with the National Park Service (NPS) chief following his inauguration -- \u00a0the same day the White House aired grievances about reporting on crowd sizes at the historic ceremony. A National Park Service spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that Michael Reynolds, the acting NPS director, had a phone call with Mr. Trump over the weekend. The Washington Post first reported on the direct communications between the two.\u00a0 According to the Post, the president \u201cpersonally ordered\u201d Reynolds to put out more images of people on the National Mall during the inaugural events. \u00a0 White House Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the New York Times, \u201cIt was a, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 type of thing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhy is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos? That was the bigger issue there,\u201d Sanders said of the phone call, according to the Times. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The Post also reported that Mr. Trump \u201cexpressed anger\u201d over a re-tweet NPS sent out that showing side-by-side comparisons of the audience at the Jan. 20 ceremony and former president Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration. The NPS re-tweet was deleted soon after it was posted, with the official statement from the agency saying that it was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with its social media engagement practices.\u00a0 Asked by CBS News on Sunday whether the White House had ordered the NPS to purge the tweet from its Twitter account, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 And while the NPS no longer releases official crowd size estimates, aerial photos show \u00a0fewer people at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration fewer people on the National Mall than former President Obama\u2019s first inauguration in January of 2009, which boasted an audience of 1.8 million in the nation\u2019s capital. \u00a0 Significantly fewer rides on the transit system were recorded by 11 a.m. on the date of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, as well. Metro ridership showed 193,000 rides taken for Mr. Trump, compared to 513,000 in 2005 for Obama\u2019s first inauguration, and 317,000 for his second. Mr. Trump\u2019s ridership numbers were a few thousand lower than George W. Bush\u2019s second inauguration -- 197,000. Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata info A combination of photos taken at the National Mall shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (L) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009, in Washington, DC, U.S.&nbsp; Close REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (L), Stelios Varias TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTSWJVI Still, Mr. Trump has repeatedly contested the comparisons in the days since his swearing-in.\u00a0 On Saturday, the same day Mr. Trump urged Reynolds to release more photos, the president vented to CIA employees about unfair media coverage of the audience size. \u201cWe had a massive field of people. You saw them. Packed,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Virginia . \u201cI get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field...I looked out, the field was -- it looked like a million, million and a half people.\u00a0 They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.\u201d After the president\u2019s comments at the CIA, that evening, White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u00a0 chastised reporters from the White House briefing room about the crowd sizes.\u00a0 He asserted that \u201cthis was the largest audience to ever witness the inauguration, period -- both in-person and around the globe.\u201d He blasted photos of the inaugural proceedings as \u201cintentionally framed in a way in one particular tweet to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall.\u201d And he described what he considered unfair visuals from the event: \u201cThis was the first time in our nation\u2019s history that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the mall...That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing while in years past, the grass eliminated this visual.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Arden Farhi contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

And, as Betty White has often showed, it's fun watch a stuffy old authority figure act out in a silly modern way. Lauren Naturale, the dictionary's Content and Social Media Manager told NBC News that the \"response was overwhelmingly positive\" to the tweets, adding they are \"among the most viral tweets we've ever had.\" \"A number of people actually told us they were subscribing to our Unabridged dictionary, or getting our app, or running out to buy a physical book,\" Naturale said. Indeed, the public reaction has been \"big league,\" as the president might say. (Or is it \"bigly?\" Merriam-Webster found \"examples of big league as a figurative adjective from 1916. The adverbial use of big league favored by Trump is not often encountered, however.\") Related: In Trump's Twitter Presidency, Experts See Risks and Rewards The dictionary saw its Twitter followers surge to more than 260,000 during last year's election. And while it never engages directly with Trump or his aides, Merriam-Webster's cheeky subtweets regularly get tens of thousands of shares and attention from mainstream media outlets. ( Urban Dictionary \u2014 somewhat of an unruly cousin \u2014 defines \"subtweet\" as \"talking about someone behind their back but sort of in their face on Twitter.\" Merriam-Webster doesn't have a definition for the slang term, yet.) Dictionaries were early adopters of the Internet in the 1990s, recognizing its utility as a teaching tool. And Merriam-Webster, which traces its roots to Colonial-era American lexicographer Noah Webster, and has been reporting on trending words since 2010. \"Reporting on lookup trends completes the circle of telling the truth about words for us, because we have always used evidence of a word's use in order to write definitions,\" said Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster. \"We don't comment on policy or politics, but when a public figure uses language in a remarkable way that makes the news, it's fair game for us.\" Related: Poll: Nearly 70 Percent of Americans Give a Thumbs Down to Trump's Twitter Habit Merriam-Webster's 2016 word of the year was \" surreal .\" Language has always been political, and it's possible the dictionary could join other elite institutions if Trump fans begin to see its definitions as compromised. George Orwell, another classroom favorite, whose \"1984\" has suddenly become a bestseller, described the \"special connection between politics and the debasement of language.\" Play ",

Some Republican lawmakers have sought in the past to make some of the assessed dues also voluntary, but that idea has never passed muster with Congress.One area that is likely to draw scrutiny from the Trump administration, judging from what Ms. Haley said during her confirmation hearing , is peacekeeping. The United States pays the largest share of the peacekeeping budget \u2014 about 28 percent \u2014 but provides virtually no soldiers.The threats to cut funding come as China has stepped up its role at the United Nations, increasing its support for peacekeeping and development aid. China also has a veto in the Security Council.\u201cThis is a time of strength, this is a time of action, this is a time of getting things done,\u201d Ms. Haley said on Friday, adding that she was prepared to re-evaluate the United Nations\u2019 efforts. \u201cEverything that\u2019s working we\u2019re going to make it better. Everything that\u2019s not working we\u2019re going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we\u2019re going to do away with,\u201d she said. Her tone was in contrast to a far more conciliatory approach just days ago, when she faced a Senate confirmation hearing. There, she said she did not favor a \u201cslash and burn\u201d approach to American contributions to the United Nations, but she questioned its value to American national interests. \u201cAre we getting what we pay for?\u201d she asked. Ms. Haley, 45, a former Republican governor of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics during the campaign, had tried to distance herself from some of what Mr. Trump has said about international diplomacy. She has said she favors continuing sanctions against Russia, for instance, but also cooperation with the Kremlin on counterterrorism. She has said she is concerned about security threats posed by refugees, and while she said climate change was \u201con the table,\u201d she said she did not favor policies that imperiled business. Correction: January 27, 2017 An earlier version of this article misstated the portion of the federal budget that the United States contributes to the United Nations. Its contributions represent a little more than 0.1 percent, not 1 percent. ",

Kin Cheung/AP hide caption toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Rafael Nadal throws his towel to a ball boy during his semifinal against Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov at the Australian Open. Kin Cheung/AP Rafael Nadal has reached the final of the Australian Open, where he will face longtime rival Roger Federer in a matchup that answers the prayers of tennis fans eager to see a ninth Grand Slam final between the pair. Nadal outlasted Grigor Dimitrov in a nearly five-hour match Friday. \"For me, it's a privilege\" to face Federer again, Nadal said after his semifinal. By reviving a rivalry that began in earnest when they slugged it out in the 2006 French Open, Nadal and Federer, now 30 and 35, respectively, provide a bookend to the women's bracket, where Venus and Serena Williams will play in the Australian Open's final for the first time since 2003 . The ninth-seeded Nadal needed a gritty win over No. 15 seed Dimitrov to reach the final, winning 6-3, 5-7, 7(7)-6(5), 6(4)-7(7), 6-4. Nadal had been poised to win in four sets \u2014 but Dimitrov used his mobility and a booming serve to prolong the match at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena, and his creativity and lashing backhand gave Nadal fits. Nadal was on the losing end of two key challenges late in the match, as in the final sets, two of Dimitrov's angled shots \u2014 one on either sideline \u2014 were shown to have caught a sliver of the line. Article continues after sponsorship Fate seemed to turn against Nadal in the final set, as Dimitrov held serve by using a no-look over-the-head cross-court shot (after losing his footing near the net) to set up a baseline winner that Nadal couldn't reach. But after both players held serve through the set's first eight games, Nadal finally broke through to go up 5-4. One day earlier, Federer had booked his spot in the title match with his own five-set victory over Stan Wawrinka. On Sunday, Nadal will appear in his first Grand Slam final since the 2014 French Open \u2014 and Federer will be trying to break a drought of his own: He hasn't won a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2012.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story The event was emblematic of an about-face by Google. Over the last eight years, the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama. Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and some later took roles in his administration. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet , Google\u2019s parent company, advised the Obama White House. And last year, Google employees gave $1.3 million to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, compared with $26,000 to the Trump campaign, according to federal filings. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump\u2019s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold. That has led to events like the party at the Smithsonian, which the institution said cost at least $50,000. Mr. Schmidt has embarked on an East Coast charm offensive of Republican political leaders, including twice visiting Mr. Trump and his advisers at Trump Tower. Last month, Google also posted an opening to fill a position for a \u201cconservative outreach\u201d employee in its Washington office. \u201cGoogle has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cEven though it has reached out to Republicans, it can\u2019t shake the image.\u201d Google said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do exactly that.\u201d Photo Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, arriving at Trump Tower in January to meet with Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s team is wary of Mr. Schmidt, who has been allied with Democrats and advised the Obama White House. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times A spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, \u201cEric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum.\u201d Other Silicon Valley tech companies like Facebook are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting. Google has much at stake as it repositions itself. During the Obama years, Google avoided American antitrust charges , even as European regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business. Google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012. Now warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle. Some of the president\u2019s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserved more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration\u2019s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a recent interview with The New York Times, Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Trump transition adviser, also compared the power that Google had under Mr. Obama to that which the oil giant Exxon Mobil had under President George W. Bush. Under President Bush, the administration largely agreed with Exxon\u2019s skeptical stance on climate change policy. Mr. Trump\u2019s team is particularly wary of one Google executive \u2014 Mr. Schmidt \u2014 who has been allied with Democrats. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her election-night party circulated widely in the conservative media. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, including his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt\u2019s funding of a start-up called the Groundwork that provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.

A week after taking the oath of office, Pence\u00a0became the highest ranking official to appear in person at the\u00a0annual March for Life demonstration.\u00a0The significance of his presence wasn\u2019t lost on the cheering crowd. \u201cVice President Pence\u2019s appearance here is huge,\u201d said David Etters, a high school theology teacher from Jackson, Mich. \u201cIt\u2019s an endorsement for this agenda for life.\u201d Debra Maddrell, a retired naval officer from Vienna, Va., said \u201cIt says that he walks the walk as well as talks the talk.\u201d In introducing her husband, Pence\u2019s wife Karen reminded the audience, \u201cThis is not our first March for Life.\u201d CLOSE x Share Vice President Mike Pence took the stage at the anti-abortion March for Life rally in Washington, DC on Friday. He declared that \"life is winning again\" following the election of Donald Trump. (Jan. 27) AP Pence said he was \u201cdeeply humbled\u201d to be the first vice president to attend the gathering and added that President Trump \u201cactually asked me to be here today.\u201d In prior years, Republican presidents have addressed the March for Life by phone or video, but Trump sent Pence instead. \u201cHe asked me to thank you for your support, for your stand for life and for your compassion for the women and children of America,\u201d Pence said. Some of those gathered here expressed uncertainty about Trump\u2019s personal beliefs. Nearly 20 years ago, he described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d but he has since said he has evolved. But the attendees said they see Pence, an evangelical Christian, as a steadfast ally who can hold Trump accountable on an anti-abortion agenda. In Congress, Pence was a leader in efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and co-sponsored \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation calling for Constitutional rights at the moment of fertilization. As governor of Indiana, he signed several anti-abortion bills, including one that banned abortions solely because of genetic abnormalities \u2013 legislation that was suspended by a federal judge. \u201cWe still need as voters to hold Trump\u2019s feet to the fire, but I feel like we\u2019ve got an ally there (in Pence) and that feels like a first in my lifetime,\u201d said Anna Thomas, a kindergarten teacher from Tuckahoe, N.Y.

He said the administration will work with Congress to permanently bar\u00a0taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers. And he added that Trump next week will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will \u201cuphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.\u201d \u201cLife is winning in America,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cAnd today is a celebration of the progress that we have made in the cause.\u201d Democrats, in a fundraising email, cited Pence\u2019s statement as \u201canother one of this administration\u2019s trademark \u2018alternative facts.\u2019\u201d The email added that the administration\u2019s policies \u201cwill lead to more abortions and more women dying from being denied life-saving care.\u201d CLOSE x Share Thousands of demonstrators rallied and marched against abortion in Washington on Friday.

He\u2019s pro-life but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s been actively involved as Mike Pence has.\u201d Of Trump, Anna Thomas said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that he is personally pro-life at all. He\u2019s made the most mealy mouthed comments about pro-life versus pro-choice issues.\u201d But when he chose Pence for the ticket, she thought, \u201cHe sees us and he hears us.\u201d Posted!

The executive order Trump issued Wednesday putting cities and counties on notice that they would lose federal funding if they didn\u2019t start cooperating with immigration agents has broad implications for California, a state that aggressively protects its undocumented population from deportation. But while the order allowed Trump to boast that he is fulfilling a campaign pledge, it also commits him to a fight that he is not necessarily poised to win. The cities and counties Trump is targeting have many tools to strike back. Among the most potent are high court decisions that have interpreted financial threats like the one Trump is now making as an unlawful intrusion on state\u2019s rights. In California, elected officials are skeptical about how aggressively Trump\u2019s vague executive order can be enforced. San Francisco has determined it is worded in such a way that it doesn\u2019t even apply there, and other cities will probably argue the same. Trump left unclear what funding is at stake and what cities and counties are threatened. The administration would be on shaky legal ground going after money allocated for anything other than law enforcement, and taking funds away from local police is a risky proposition for a new president promising to restore order in the streets.\u00a0And even\u00a0that, attorneys for the Legislature assert, takes an act of Congress. \u00a0 (Ruben Vives, Cindy Carcamo, Dakota Smith and Corina Knoll) \u201cThese orders are very Trumpian,\ufffd? said David Martin, who served as deputy counsel for the Department of Homeland Security early in the Obama administration. \u201cThere is a lot of show, a lot of tough rhetoric, and details to follow. Some of those details could take a long time to come.\ufffd? And\u00a0California officials\u00a0appear ready for a\u00a0fight. The sanctuary cities\u00a0order\u00a0creates a myriad of opportunities to enmesh the new administration in unending litigation \u2014 draining its resources and political capital and ultimately undermining Trump\u2019s ability to pursue his broader agenda. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the power to strip funding from local communities simply because we\u2019re sticking up for our immigrant neighbors,\ufffd? said state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco). Wiener, a former San Francisco supervisor, said both his city and the state of California were well-positioned to \u201clitigate until the end of time.\ufffd? \u201cPeople try to pick on California and San Francisco all the time, and we\u2019re tough enough to handle it,\ufffd? he said. Democratic lawmakers in the state are trying to move fast to protect more vulnerable cities. Senate leader Kevin de Leon is championing a measure that would essentially make California a sanctuary state by prohibiting police anywhere within its borders from engaging in immigration law enforcement. Doing that could also give the state standing to sue the federal government as soon as it moves to punish a sanctuary city. Another measure moving in the state Legislature would provide lawyers to immigrants detained by federal agents, which would force federal authorities to redirect enforcement resources to litigating tedious hearings. Lawmakers are also looking at banning federal agents from raiding workplaces and homes in search of people here illegally unless they have a warrant for a particular person. It\u2019s a policy the administration could choose to ignore, but doing so would invite its own slog in court. State lawmakers\u00a0are consulting former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. and his associates \u2014 recently hired as counsel to the Legislature \u2014\u00a0on many of these moves, seeking their expertise on the legal constraints on federal law enforcement that they can exploit to undermine Trump. They are moving so aggressively that they risk confrontation with some of their own cities, like Fresno, where the new Republican mayor has said publicly he would comply with Trump\u2019s directive. He could ultimately find doing so is illegal in California and have to choose between risking federal funds or the much bigger infusions of cash his city gets from Sacramento. There are considerable logistical complications confronting Trump\u2019s directive. John Sandweg, who headed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Obama, said the massive cost of detaining all the people Trump is hoping to expel from the country would probably make Congress recoil. Following through with the sanctuary cities and other immigration-related orders Trump signed Wednesday would require 150,000 prison beds to house detainees, he said, nearly five times as many as are available now. Sandweg estimates the cost for that alone could be about\u00a0$8 billion. \u201cJust because this order has been issued\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean this is happening,\ufffd?\u00a0Sandweg said. \u201cAll we have so far is a statement of principles and it remains to be seen how this will be implemented.\ufffd? Trump\u2019s plan to enlist local police and sheriff\u2019s departments in immigration enforcement has set the stage for a pitched battle with California officials who have long prioritized building ties with immigrant communities. Trump\u2019s plan, which was issued Wednesday\u00a0as part of a pair of executive... President Trump\u2019s plan to enlist local police and sheriff\u2019s departments in immigration enforcement has set the stage for a pitched battle with California officials who have long prioritized building ties with immigrant communities. Trump\u2019s plan, which was issued Wednesday\u00a0as part of a pair of executive... (Cindy Chang, Paloma Esquivel and Maya Lau) It will probably be late summer, he said, before administration attorneys and staff iron out the details and start testing the waters of threatening sanctuary cities with financial penalties. When they do, the administration could find itself buried in lawsuits. The complaints could point to the 2012 Supreme Court decision on Obamacare that restricted the federal government\u2019s ability to force states to expand Medicaid, finding that the federal government cannot coerce a state to enact a policy by threatening its funding, or in the words of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., putting a financial \u201cgun to the head.\ufffd? They may also cite an earlier decision from the high court during the Clinton administration allowing local governments to opt out of the background checks for gun buyers required by the Brady Act. The court\u2019s granting of such power to defy Washington is typically heralded by conservative champions of states\u2019 rights. Now it could prove a potent tool to use against Trump. Also working in the favor of sanctuary cities is the experience of New York in the mid-1990s, when federal agents demanded the city share information on the immigration status of people who had been arrested. The federal courts ordered New York to turn over the information, but then also ruled that the city could opt not to gather the information, and then it would have nothing to turn over. The federal government, the court found, could not force New York to collect it. San Francisco now says Trump\u2019s order cannot be enforced there for similar reasons. The order punishes\u00a0cities that prohibit employees from reporting on a person\u2019s immigration status.\u00a0San Francisco, like most sanctuary cities, doesn\u2019t typically collect that information. \u201cThis executive order is based on the false premise that sanctuary cities are violating federal law,\ufffd? said\u00a0John Cote, a spokesman for Dennis Herrera, San Francisco\u2019s city attorney. \u201cSan Francisco is in full compliance.\ufffd? There still is some money that\u00a0independent legal experts say the administration could\u00a0snatch back from cities. The courts have given the federal government authority to impose such punishment if the offense is related to the program being defunded. So, for example, money that cities and counties receive to cover the cost of jailing immigrants in the country\u00a0illegally would be easy for the administration to cancel. Other law enforcement spending could also be at risk since the executive order focuses on the refusal of local police to help immigration agents. But will the Trump administration want to take money away from urban police forces? \u201cIf they cut law enforcement funding,\ufffd? Martin said, \u201cstates and cities will be able to say that Trump is endangering them in exactly the ways he purports to be concerned about.\ufffd? Caption What would you say to the other side?

    "text": "Putin Consults His Security Council Before Talking to Trump By vladimir isachenkov, associated press MOSCOW \u0097 Jan 27, 2017, 10:56 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump's First Week in the White House 0 Shares Email Russian President Vladimir Putin conferred with his top officials Friday about relations with Washington a day before a scheduled call with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump's senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" Friday that U.S. sanctions against Russia and other issues would be on the table during his conversation with Putin set for Saturday. Conway also said Trump will be receptive if the Russian leader wants to have a serious conversation about how to defeat Islamic extremists. Ahead of the call, Putin chaired a meeting of his Security Council to discuss U.S.-Russian relations, the Kremlin said. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the two presidents are expected to \"exchange views about main parameters of current bilateral relations.\" They last spoke when Putin congratulated Trump shortly after his election victory. Peskov wouldn't elaborate on what specific issues could be discussed and wouldn't say if the two leaders would use the call to agree on an in-person meeting. The Kremlin has applauded Trump's promises to mend ties with Moscow, which have been badly strained by the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. Barack Obama's administration and the European Union slapped Moscow with sanctions for its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and support for a pro-Russia insurgency in eastern Ukraine. The restrictions have limited Russian companies' access to international financial markets and barred key technology transfers, helping drive the Russian economy into recession. Russia has responded by banning imports of most Western agricultural products. The Kremlin has warned that rebuilding ravaged ties will take time, but many in Russia hope there will be an easing of the tensions unseen since the Cold War. \"Relations between the great powers have been going from bad to worse for several years now,\" former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said in an article published in Time magazine. \"The advocates for arms buildup and the military-industrial complex are rubbing their hands. We need to resume political dialogue.\" Warning that \"the nuclear threat once again seems real,\" Gorbachev urged Trump and Putin to initiate a United Nations Security Council resolution stating that \"nuclear war is unacceptable and must never be fought.\" He emphasized that the two leaders bear a special responsibility as \"presidents of two nations that hold over 90% of the world's nuclear arsenals.\" 0 Shares ",

Hang up before saying anything, the Better Business Bureau says. (Photo: KING-TV, Seattle) 5749 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE SEATTLE \u2014 A growing \"Can you hear me?\" phone scam can make you a victim if you utter just one word:\u00a0\"Yes.\" This is how it works, according to the Better Business Bureau: An automated\u00a0call provides an introduction and identifies a business or agency. After the intro, the recording will ask if you can hear clearly. If you answer yes, the scammer behind the call may have recorded you, could plan\u00a0to use your affirmation to sign you up for a product or service you never knew about and then will demand payment. If you refuse, the scammer\u00a0may produce your recorded \"yes\" response to confirm your purchase agreement. How to prevent phishing scams The best advice from the BBB: \u2022 Hang up on any unsolicited robocall.\u00a0If you are on the federal Do Not Call List and a company calls out of the blue to ask questions, it's likely a scam. \u2022 Avoid responding with \"yes,\" \"sure\" or \"OK.\" \u2022 Hang up if you're asked to press a button to be placed on the Do Not Call registry. Doing anything else could help scammers identify an active phone number.\u00a0No government agency will ever solicit for the Do Not Call Registry. \u2022 Write down the phone number and file a scam report with the BBB Scam Tracker and the Federal Trade Commission 's Do Not Call List. College students are prime targets of ID thieves, scammers That doesn't always help because these scammers also often know how to fool phones' caller ID features. But 10 states \u2014 Hawaii with the caveat of having the recording device in a private place; California; Connecticut; Florida; Maryland; Massachusetts; Montana; New Hampshire; Pennsylvania and Washington \u2014 have a two-party consent law for recording a conversation,\u00a0making it a crime to intercept or record a call or conversation unless all parties say yes. Illinois also has the law on its books, but a court found it unconstitutional in 2014, according to the Digital Media Law Project . Follow KING-TV on Twitter:\u00a0 @KING5Seattle Related: ",

    "text": "US Business Spending Rises for 3rd Month, Boosting Factories By christopher s. rugaber, ap economics writer WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 27, 2017, 9:14 AM ET 0 Shares Email U.S. businesses ramped up their investment in industrial machinery, semiconductors and other big-ticket items last month, boosting demand for factory goods. A measure that tracks business spending plans climbed 0.8 percent in December, after jumping 1.5 percent the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. Orders for all durable goods, which are meant to last longer than three years, slipped 0.4 percent, mostly because of a sharp fall in demand for defense aircraft, a volatile category. Excluding transportation-related goods, orders rose 0.5 percent, the sixth straight increase. The report adds to recent evidence that manufacturers are climbing out of a roughly two-year rut. A strong U.S. dollar and falling oil and gas prices had sliced demand for factory products, as drillers ordered less steel pipe and other equipment. Yet demand has risen since oil prices have stabilized. Orders for industrial machinery rose 0.4 percent last month, while demand for computers, semiconductors and electronic goods jumped 2.4 percent. Orders for autos climbed 2 percent, a sign automakers expect additional sales growth. Other measures of the U.S. manufacturing sector have also improved. A private survey earlier this month found that manufacturing activity in December rose to its highest level in two years, led higher by strong increases in new orders and production. And manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent in December, according to a report from the Federal Reserve . Auto sales reached a record level in 2016, and automakers continued cranking out vehicles through the end of the year. Still, manufacturing has not yet fully rebounded. Manufacturing output rose just 0.2 percent in all of 2016, according to the Fed. And business investment in long-lasting goods fell 3.4 percent last year, despite the gains of the last three months. 0 Shares ",

Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he regrets Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to build the border wall and insisted yet again that Mexico will not pay for it. \u201cI have said time and time again, Mexico will not pay for any wall,\u201d he said.

We know nothing about them,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday. \"They can say they vet them. They didn't vet them. They have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don't know anything about them and you have no papers?\" Though the United States government already utilizes a thorough nine-step vetting system for refugees, the president's executive order is said to go further. It is still unclear what these steps would mean and if it would target any particular religious group as the president stated on the campaign trail. According to the Pew Research Center , the United States welcomed almost 85,000 refugees in 2016. Forty-six percent of them were Muslim. The president sets the number of refugees accepted annually into the U.S. and from that authority can suspend the program at any time. President George W. Bush took similar actions following the 9/11 attacks when the program was suspended for several months. Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the Homeland Security committee, said on Friday that he applauds the president's move. \"We are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants. But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us,\" McCaul said in a statement. \"Today, President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States.\" The response from advocates for refugee rights was swift. \"I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war,\" Malala Yousafzai, a student activist and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate said in a statement through a press office. \"I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants \u2014 the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the social media platform to express his concern about the executive order' impact on those fleeing violence and oppression in their homelands. His great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. The parents of his wife, Priscilla, were refugees from China and Vietnam. \"We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation,\" he wrote . \"We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That's who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today.\" Trump also called for a \"great rebuilding\" of the nation's military. \"New planes, new ships, new resources, new tools for our men and women in uniform.\" Halimah Abdullah ",

Everything that is not working, we are going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary, we are going to do away with,\" Haley pledged.

Saul Loeb/AP hide caption toggle caption Saul Loeb/AP President Trump acknowledges the crowds on the National Mall during his swearing-in Friday at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Saul Loeb/AP The day after his inauguration, President Trump placed a call to the acting head of the National Park Service, Michael Reynolds. \"I can confirm that the call took place. I can't comment on the content of the conversation,\" National Park Service spokesman Tom Crosson said in an email to NPR. Trump reportedly was upset over the agency's retweeting of side-by-side photos that unfavorably compared the crowd sizes at his and former President Obama's inaugurations. The retweet was later removed. Trump Administration Goes To War With The Media Over Inauguration Crowd Size \"It was a, 'What's going on?' type of thing,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The New York Times on Thursday night. \"Why is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos? That was the bigger issue there.\" The Washington Post, which first reported the phone call , said Trump ordered Reynolds to provide photos of Inauguration Day crowds on the National Mall on Jan. 20, with the intent of proving the media \"had lied in reporting that attendance was no better than average.\" As NPR's Jessica Taylor reported on Saturday: \"Press secretary Sean Spicer delivered a fiery broadside against the Fourth Estate from the White House Briefing Room Saturday evening, claiming that reporters had engaged in 'deliberately false reporting' in the past 24 hours since President Trump took the oath of office. And, after berating the press, he walked away without taking any questions. \" 'Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,' Spicer claimed.\" Article continues after sponsorship ",

(Photo: Joan Marcus) 6 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE It looks like two New York City men who allegedly raised more than $81 million from investors promised profits from tickets to the Broadway blockbuster musical Hamilton and other high-demand shows just threw away their shot. Joseph Meli and Matthew Harriton and their companies allegedly lured at least 125 investors in 13 states to invest in a Ponzi scheme based on false claims of buying and reselling large blocks of tickets to Hamilton, Adele concerts and other high-demand events, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Friday. The alleged scammers claimed they had an agreement with Hamilton's producer to buy 35,000 tickets to the musical, and said they would use investor funds to pay part of the purchase cost, according to a\u00a0 SEC\u00a0federal civil complaint filed in New York's southern federal district. Hamilton has been one of Broadway biggest hits in decades. Tickets to the rap and hip-hop retelling of heroism and plotting by Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other women and men involved in the American Revolution regularly sell\u00a0out for months in advance. Promising to resell the tickets at high profits, Meli and Harriton gave investors written contracts that promised full repayment of initial investments plus a 10% annualized profit, to be paid in less than one year from investment, the complaint charged. Investors allegedly were also\u00a0promised 50% of any profits from ticket resales that remained after they got their initial investments and 10% return. 'Hamilton' sets Broadway sales record with a $3.3 million week There was never any agreement to buy and resell tickets, the SEC charged. Instead, Manhattan residents Meli,\u00a042, and Harriton, 52, allegedly diverted\u00a0money from initial investors in the Ponzi scheme to new investors. The SEC charges they also spent nearly $2 million of investors' money on jewelry purchases, casino payments,\u00a0private school and camp tuition payments and other personal expenses. \"As alleged in our complaint, Meli and Harriton raised millions from investors by promising big profits from reselling tickets\u00a0to A-list events when in reality they were moving investor money in a circle and creating a mirage of profitability,\" Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. U.S. v. Simmons and Meli Complaint The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office separately said Meli and Steven Simmons, were arrested Friday on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud. The criminal complaint did not charge name Harriton and did not charge Simmons in the ticket-resale charges relating to the alleged\u00a0scheme. \"While soliciting funds from investors for legitimate-sounding investments\u00a0Steven Simmons and Joseph Meli were, in fact, running Ponzi schemes, said Deputy U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in a formal statement.

The couple are dropping lawsuits seeking to buy out Native Hawaiians who own small parcels of land within their 700-acre Kauai estate. (Photo: Ron Kosen, AP) 54 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0\u2014Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife are dropping controversial suits they filed in December to buy small plots of land that are part of a 700-acre waterfront estate they own on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. In a letter published in The Garden Island , a local newspaper, Zuckerberg wrote of the complex legal tangle, \"it's clear we made a mistake.\" Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan bought the\u00a0700-acre waterfront estate on\u00a0Kauai for $100 million in 2014. In December 2016, they filed eight lawsuits against several hundred people to buy 13 plots on eight acres partitioned during the 1850s. Ownership of some of the plots was unclear, crossing multiple generations and many heirs. According to Zuckerberg's letter, some have had no inhabitants for decades. Others come with complex legal land agreements dating back more than 160 years. The plots are mostly one acre or smaller and all lie within the 700-acre estate. Zuckerberg's legal maneuver, called \"quiet title and partition,\" was meant to clarify ownership rights to the land and force it to be sold to the highest bidder through a public auction, allowing Zuckerberg to purchase it. Some Hawaiians\u00a0had harshly criticized the maneuver after the suits became public. The outcry grew louder after Zuckerberg took to Facebook to explain his intent, with some charging him with contributing to a trend with roots in colonialism. A group\u00a0is planning a protest at the wall of Zuckerberg's estate Saturday. ",

The HBO documentary 'Becoming Warren Buffett' will debut on January 30th. USA TODAY NETWORK Warren, Susie, Susan and Howard Jr. Buffett in their home in Omaha at Christmas time. (Photo: Courtesy of HBO) If you were to ask Warren Buffett to what he credits his success, he\u2019d tell you he won the ovarian lottery. \u201cI\u2019m here in my position as a matter of luck,\u201d Buffett says in the new HBO/Kunhardt documentary on his life, Becoming Warren Buffett. The story of one of the richest men in the world is told through access to never-before-released family photographs, home videos, and interviews with friends and family. Buffett is considered by many as one of the greatest investors of all time. Through Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A), he has amassed billions of dollars and controls, or has major stakes\u00a0in, companies that\u00a0range from insurer GEICO, reinsurer General Re, railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, international energy business Berkshire Hathaway Energy and holdings in other industries including manufacturing, media, real estate and retail. And while many Buffett devotees may be awed by all he's accomplished, the documentary dives into the personal side of a man, too humble to revel in his success. Warren Buffett \u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of HBO) \u201cHe doesn\u2019t take credit for it,\u201d Peter Kunhardt, who directed the film, told USA TODAY. \u201cHe says he won the ovarian lottery, he doesn\u2019t try to turn that into: look at me, look at how smart I am and how clever I have been at business.\" Buffett calculates the probability of him being born as a male, in the United States, during the 1930s, as contributing largely to his success. Warren and Susie Buffett (1960) \u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of HBO) \u201cTo think that that makes me superior than anyone else as a human being, I just can\u2019t follow that line of reasoning,\u201d Buffett says in the film. He credits his first wife, Susan, who died in 2004, for his growth and success as a young man. \u201cMy first wife used a watering can and sprinkled on me until I became a well-rounded person,\u201d\u00a0Buffett says. Despite being separated, Susan and Warren remained close throughout her life. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that focused on business, there\u2019s side effects,\" says Kundhart. Kunhardt tells some of Buffett's story through a session held at a local Omaha high school, not far from the home where he\u2019s lived in since 1958. Where Buffett\u00a0was reluctant to talk about the most difficult moments in his life, interviews with his children and close friends fill the gap. \u201cThe other part of him is a very human person that has feelings and gets sad when sad things happen. He\u2019s a very different person than when he\u2019s in the Berkshire office,\u201d daughter\u00a0Susie Buffett told USA TODAY. Baby Susan and Warren Buffett (1954) \u00a0(Photo: Courtesy of HBO) Buffett credits\u00a0Susan Buffett for broadening his politics.\u00a0\u00a0\"Civil rights changed my life,\u201d\u00a0says Buffett. His wife was involved with the movement in Nebraska. A speech by Martin Luther King Jr. influenced him as a young man. \u00a0\u201cHe believed the way she (Susan) believed in social justice and civil rights,\u201d Susie Buffett recounts.

    "text": "AP January 27, 2017, 8:32 AM Questions mount over tax to pay for Trump's border wall WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is promising Mexico will pay for his massive border wall. On Thursday, his administration finally suggested how: a 20 percent tax on products imported from south of the border . The new measure could be part of a comprehensive tax reform package that Trump and Congress will work out, the White House said. But there was great ambiguity about the proposal. White House officials later clarified that the tax was but one possible way Trump could finance the wall. Much was left unanswered. Would Mexico be footing the bill or American consumers? What items would become more expensive? Is this even legal? Some of the details Trump\u2019s proposal still has to work out: IS IT A TAX, A TARIFF OR SOMETHING ELSE? It\u2019s unclear. The White House said Congress\u2019 tax overhaul would place a 20 percent tax on imports from any country enjoying a trade surplus with the United States. In other words, countries selling more goods and service to the U.S. than buying from it. The idea is to rebalance the playing field for U.S. companies by discouraging Americans from importing. The idea appears to overlap with a plan House Republicans are pushing called \u201cborder adjustment.\u201d Under this plan, the U.S. would refrain from taxing American companies\u2019 exports, but would tax imports. The new revenues are projected to top $1 trillion over a decade. The money had been envisioned as an offset for lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates, though House Republicans say it could also pay for a wall. Trump, however, recently said he didn\u2019t like the \u201cborder adjustment\u201d idea. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR AMERICANS? Mexican products would become more expensive. That means pricier tequila , but also things Americans need: cars, eyeglasses and many basic groceries. A Toyota Camry? About $1,000 more, according to Jim Lentz, CEO of Toyota North America, noting that a quarter of the car\u2019s parts are imported. U.S. exporters are behind the House plan because it would reduce their taxes. Here\u2019s the flip side: Importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say the higher prices for Mexican products could hurt sales. And that means American jobs. Retailers such as Wal-Mart also could face higher tax burdens. WOULD MEXICO REALLY BE PAYING? Not quite. The U.S. could recoup some of the wall\u2019s costs by changing the tax and trade policies with Mexico. But the money wouldn\u2019t necessarily be coming from Mexican taxpayers or the Mexican government . While the tax would land first on companies exporting from Mexico, the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. That leaves Americans footing much of the likely bill. Trump has said he\u2019s OK with being \u201creimbursed\u201d at a later point because he is keen to start building the wall immediately. WOULD IT RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE WALL? Probably. Various estimates put the wall\u2019s cost at up to $15 billion. House Republicans expect their plan to pull in much more than that in its first year. They say that could easily cover the costs of the wall. IS IT LEGAL? To be determined. The U.S. has a range of obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and at the World Trade Organization. And Mexico is likely to challenge any new tax that penalizes its economy. Trump has said he plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Mexico, however, is under no obligation to soften the agreement for his sake. Other countries may also object, if their products and services are targeted. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the border adjustment is essentially a tariff that would be struck down by the WTO if it targets Mexico. HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT THE ECONOMY? A topic of great dispute. The White House said the plan would increase U.S. wages, help U.S. businesses and consumers, and deliver \u201chuge economic benefits.\u201d With so much of the plan ill-defined, it\u2019s impossible to substantiate those claims. Any turbulence in the U.S.-Mexican trade relationship could have implications for the entire world. Mexico is the second-largest exporter to the United States, after China. The United States imported roughly $271 billion of goods from Mexico during the first 11 months of 2016, according to the Commerce Department, and ran a trade deficit of almost $60 billion. DO REPUBLICANS LIKE TRUMP\u2019S PLAN? Not all of them. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said on Twitter it would be a \u201ctax on Americans to pay for the wal l.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was \u201cmucho sad\u201d and that \u201cany policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila or margaritas is a big-time bad idea.\u201d Even Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, dismissed the idea of using tariffs as a trade ploy. Republicans have traditionally hailed themselves as the party of free trade. WHAT OTHER WAYS COULD TRUMP GET MEXICO TO PAY? During the campaign, Trump floated a number of possibilities without committing to any in particular. He proposed changing a rule under the USA Patriot Act to block some of the roughly $25 billion in remittances that Mexicans living in the U.S. send home each year. He said he would refuse to free up the money until Mexico agrees to pay the U.S. between $5 billion and $10 billion. Opponents of that plan say Mexicans in the U.S. would likely find other ways to send money back. They could take cash with them when traveling, wire money to a non-Mexican bank or use off-the-books transfers that are difficult to police. Trump also suggested increasing visa fees for Mexicans to raise money, or canceling business and tourist visas issued to Mexicans until their country pays for the wall. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

By ELSA BUTLER on Publish Date January 22, 2017. Photo by Left, Lucas Jackson, Right, Stelios Varias/Reuters. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump spoke by telephone with the acting director of the National Park Service the day after his inauguration to ask why someone from the agency had shared someone else\u2019s Twitter post giving an unflattering comparison of his inaugural crowd, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy press secretary. \u201cIt was a, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 type of thing,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said on Thursday evening. \u201cWhy is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos? That was the bigger issue there.\u201d During the call, Mr. Trump also asked the National Park Service\u2019s acting director, Michael T. Reynolds, if he could produce further photographic evidence of the size of his inaugural crowd, according to a second person briefed on the Jan. 21 telephone call between the two men. Photo President Trump asked the National Park Service to confirm his view of the inaugural crowd size. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed outrage toward the news media for what he believes is a deliberate attempt to undermine his legitimacy by understating the size of the crowd that attended his swearing-in and speech. One of those instances happened on Inauguration Day, when an employee of the National Park Service used the agency\u2019s Twitter account to share someone else\u2019s post of images comparing the inaugural crowds in 2009 and 2017. The images, originally posted by a New York Times reporter, showed the 2009 crowd to be much larger. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, expressed outrage the next day during a forceful statement at the White House in which he lashed out at the press and claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.\u201d Mr. Spicer later said he was talking about a combination of in-person, television and online audiences. That same morning, before Mr. Spicer\u2019s statement, Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him.

    "text": "By Natalie Kitroeff Jan. 27, 2017 Part-time casual longshoremen outside the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Casual Longshore Dispatch Hall in Wilmington, where some lucky workers will nab a shift. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) If Cynthia Byington wins her version of the lottery, she will probably have to wait a decade to claim her prize. But Byington doesn\u2019t mind, because the reward is a shot at one of the rarest lifelines left for working-class Americans: a unionized blue-collar job.\u00a0 In February, for the first time in over a decade, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union will raffle off thousands of part-time gigs working at Los Angeles-area ports. The slots don\u2019t come with benefits or steady hours. But eventually, after putting in years at the docks, some of those part-timers may earn the chance to become unionized longshoremen, who can make as much as $200,000 per year.\u00a0 \u201cYou get full benefits your entire life. Even if it\u2019s not \u2018til I turn 90, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Byington, 53, said. You get full benefits your entire life. Even if it\u2019s not \u2018til I turn 90, it\u2019s worth it. \u2014 Cynthia Byington 92430124 Casual longshoremen who showed up for shifts earned less than $31,000 on average in 2016. Full-time union members get paid $161,000 on average. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) The 2,400 names drawn in the raffle will become \u201ccasual\u201d longshoremen.\u00a0\u00a0 Although they perform the same work as union members \u2014\u00a0loading\u00a0thousands of containers on and off massive cargo ships to keep\u00a0the ports running on time \u2014\u00a0they work far fewer hours. And the wait to receive full union benefits can stretch over a decade. The average casual\u00a0worker\u00a0who showed up for weekly shifts earned nearly $31,000\u00a0in 2016,\u00a0according to data from\u00a0the\u00a0Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents the shipping companies and terminal operators that employ the dockworkers.\u00a0Full-time union members get paid $161,000 on average, but those with seniority can earn tens of thousands more. A worker shows a ticket with her assignment for the day. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) A part-time worker waits near the gate at the dispatch hall. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) Today, there are part-timers who have been waiting 13 years to get into the union. But the PMA said that for now, there are no firm plans\u00a0to elevate any of them. Hundreds of thousands are expected to have applied for the new casual slots, the PMA said. Scores of Southern Californians rushed to post offices and postal stores\u00a0across the South Bay in January, buying up the 4x6-inch blank cards required to enter the raffle. At the Postal Annex, a tiny storefront about five miles from the ports in San Pedro, owner Patrick Meehan could barely take a breath without getting a phone call about the lottery. He said hundreds of people streamed into his store in the three days before the deadline hit in late January. The massive interest in the longshoremen\u2019s lottery is a sign of just how desperate Americans are to gain even the most tenuous ground toward a stable, high-paying career working with their hands. \u201cIt says a lot about the state of our current labor market,\u201d said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the UC Berkeley Labor Center. \u201cThere are a dwindling number of blue-collar union jobs where people with\u00a0just a high school education can make a good living.\u201d\u00a0 Fewer than 14% of workers in manufacturing, construction and trucking belonged to a union in 2015, down from nearly 40% in 1973, according to a database of Census data compiled by economists from Trinity University and Georgia State University. That\u2019s what propelled Byington to put her name in the running. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d said Byington, who lives in a mobile home in Wilmington. She has seen longshoremen and women buy houses and put their kids through college on their union-won paychecks. Another friend recently got a full set of teeth implants, thanks to union-provided dental care.\u00a0 Workers line up on the street to find out if they'll get a shift at the ports. This ritual is repeated every morning for casual longshoremen and women. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) \u201cIf you say someone is a longshoreman, it means respect, even if they are a little spoiled,\u201d Byington said. Earning that title, and the respect that comes with it, takes longer than ever.\u00a0 In the 1990s, longshoremen would spend three to five years freelancing before they got elevated onto the rolls of the ILWU, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former casual workers. But then the recession hit, trade faltered, and the PMA temporarily stopped hiring union members. The ports are using more automated machines , which is part of the reason the union workforce hasn\u2019t grown much. In 2016, the Port of Los Angeles processed 17% more container traffic\u00a0than in 2005, but the number of full-time union longshoremen had increased by only 3.5% over that period. Longshoremen also say employers have been relying more and more on part-timers. \u201cThe PMA, terminal employers and ILWU work together to maintain a balanced approach on the number of registered workers needed at the ports,\u201d said Wade Gates,\u00a0a spokesman for the PMA. Craig Merrilees, a spokesman for the union, said the union has traditionally pushed to get more full-time positions, but the dockworkers\u2019 bosses are reluctant. The last time the PMA\u00a0added full-time union members to the payroll was in 2012. \u201cGenerally speaking, the employers would like to see more casual workers earning a little less pay,\u201d Merrilees said. Mario Huerta says he has been working part time for 10 years at the docks, desperately trying to amass enough experience to become a union longshoreman. Huerta and other casuals show up\u00a0around 6 a.m. at a dingy dispatch hall and wait to hear if their number gets called for one of three shifts at the port. If they don\u2019t get called up in the morning, they can return around 4 in the afternoon for the next round of work opportunities. On good weeks, a part-timer will manage to nab two to three eight-hour shifts, casuals said. Part-timers gather near the dispatch hall early in the morning. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times) After driving 60 miles to Wilmington from his home in Riverside on a recent Friday, Huerta was assigned a shift that would likely involve securing containers to a ship deck. \u201cSometimes I get work two or three days a week. Sometimes it's only one day a week,\u201d Huerta said, standing in the rain just outside the building where casuals go to get dispatched. He has no idea when the unsteady work will turn into something long-term. \u201cHow close am I to being elevated?\u00a0Nobody seems to know,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least today I have work.\u201d Several others who failed to get work that day said they felt as if they\u2019re being kept out of the union for as long as possible so that the shipping companies can avoid hiring more highly paid, full-time longshoremen. Sometimes I get work two or three days a week. Sometimes it's only one day a week \u2014 Mario Huerta The casuals all cobble together odd jobs on days they can\u2019t find work at the docks, including gigs in construction, landscaping and as security guards. Chris Grove, 39, has spent 13 years reporting for duty at the casual hall and says the instability of the work \u201ctore up\u201d his marriage. Grove, who comes from a long line of longshoremen, including his mother, says the work at the ports was steady and continuous until the recession of 2008-2009.\u00a0 \u201cI was able to put groceries on the table and keep the wife happy,\u201d he says. After the financial crisis, though, his name barely ever came up for shifts. So he got a second job, installing security systems, and then another, installing satellite dishes\u00a0for DirecTV. \u00a0He put his name on a list to join an elevator construction union\u00a0and became a bouncer and then a security guard at a cannabis collective. He even got paid to register voters.\u00a0 The work was unpredictable, he says, and his paycheck was so much thinner than it once was. Grove still shows up for work at the casual hall some weekends, but now he\u2019s more focused on his day job: In 2014, after waiting for eight years,\u00a0he was admitted into the International Union of Elevator Constructors and makes good money with a full slate of benefits.\u00a0 Times staff writer Ronald D.\u00a0White contributed to this report.

White Typical Mexican food and ingredients Ragnar Schmuck / Getty Images Share advertisement American consumers would feel a pinch in their pocketbooks if Trump goes ahead with a 20 percent tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from Mexico. \"Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!,\" Donald Trump Tweeted Friday morning. Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017 But economists say a 20 percent tariff on goods coming into the country would translate to higher prices on everything from avocados to automobiles, and that hit could come quickly. \"All of these industries now keep pretty low levels of inventories. They produce to meet demand,\" said Robert Scott, senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \"You would see this work through the pipeline very quickly \u2014 a matter of weeks or months at most.\" Vehicles: Expect to Pay 10 Percent More for Your Car Trump has made cars his focus in the ongoing battle over Mexican imports, much to automakers' chagrin. Far-flung and deeply entrenched, thanks to more than two decades of investment under NAFTA, supply chains mean that everything from steel to steering wheels could cross the border two or three times before a vehicle ever reaches a dealer's lot. \"It is going to have a significant effect on auto producers,\" Scott said. Even if the value of the peso continues to sink, and even if automakers are willing to absorb some of the higher costs, car buyers could be looking at sticker prices of up to 10 percent higher. \"It not only affects the price of the finished vehicle but the parts that come from Mexico,\" he said. \"That's when the law of unintended consequences could really kick in.\" Mess with the price of tequila and guacamole just before the Super Bowl and you've gone too far. \u2014 Lin Brehmer (@LinBrehmer) January 26, 2017 Produce: A 10 Percent Hike on Your Avocados and Tomatoes In 2015, the U.S. imported $9.1 billion of fresh fruit and vegetables from Mexico, and prices shoppers pay at the grocery store could rise by 10 percent or more, predicted Monica DeBolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The perishable nature of this import category makes it tougher to find replacement sources for it, and the ongoing drought in California has hurt harvests, so retailers have fewer options for alternative sources. A strike last fall that hit Mexican avocado producers caused shortages that triggered skyrocketing prices, with reports of a single avocado retailing for $3 or more in stores. And that's not even taking into account the produce we just don't have the climate to grow domestically. \"Consider the impact on American consumers of a 20 percent hike in the cost of foods such as bananas, mangoes and other products that we simply can not grow in the United States,\" Tom Stenzel, president and CEO of the United Fresh Produce Association, said in a statement. \"We urge President Trump to consider the unique nature of food and not place a new 'food tax' on American consumers.\" Appliances/Electronics: Your Fridge Could Cost At Least 20 Percent More While people tend to think of China when they think of imported electronic devices, the reality is that we import a significant amount of machinery and gadgets from Mexico, as well. Prices for items like cooktops and refrigerators could actually increase by a greater percentage than the tariff itself, DeBolle said. \"It could be close to the 20 percent tariff. It could possibly be higher than that,\" she said. As with cars, the interconnected nature of supply chains means that there are innumerable raw materials and parts that can go back and forth across the border multiple times. \"All the additional cross-border costs the company would bear and, likely, would pass along to the consumer,\" she said. \"It could be even higher than 20 percent, and 20 percent is already a lot.\" Medical: Higher Insurance Rates In 2015, the U.S. imported $12 billion of optical and medical equipment from Mexico. The pain of a tariff would be spread more broadly in the case of this category, Scott said. Because consumers aren't buying these products themselves, there's less of an incentive for producers to hold the line on prices. Those higher prices, although initially paid by the healthcare industry in the U.S., eventually get passed along to us in the form of pricier health insurance. Alcohol: The News Isn't Good Brace yourself: Tequila would get pricier, as would Mexican beer. \"Products that have a pretty low elasticity with reference to prices \u2014 in other words, where consumers will buy anyway \u2014 will probably bear the full brunt of a 20 percent increase,\" DeBolle said. And booze certainly falls into that category. \"Alcoholic beverages tend to be very price inelastic,\" she said. \"These would likely go up by the same amount as the tariff.\" 20% tariff on Mexican products? NO NOT MY TEQUILA?!? So this sounds crazy, but if a $100 bottle of tequila now costs me $120, it's almost like *I'm* paying the tariff. That can't be right! \u2014 Gordon C.

Trump has been vocal about how he believes that torture works, while Gen. James Mattis , Trump's recently confirmed secretary of defense, has told Trump that he does not believe that it works. Trump's latest comments came during his joint news conference today with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the White House. \"I don't necessarily agree [with Mattis], but I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power,\" Trump said. \"He is an expert. He is highly respected. He is the general's general. Got through the Senate very, very quickly, which in this country is not easy.\" President Trump Tells ABC News\u2019 David Muir He 'Absolutely' Thinks Waterboarding Works This isn't the first time Trump has commented on the issue of torture in recent days. During his interview with ABC News' David Muir at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said that neither Mattis, his new secretary of defense, nor Mike Pompeo, his new CIA head, believe torture is effective, and that he will ultimately rely on their decisions. \"As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire. Now, with that being said I'm going with General Mattis. I'm going with my secretary because I think Pompeo's gonna be phenomenal. I'm gonna go with what they say,\" Trump told Muir. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 The media is all abuzz, again, about the fact that President Trump spent some time during his televised interview with ABC anchor David Muir pointing out the large size of the crowd in photos of his inauguration. Journalists, who still don\u2019t seem able to understand that Trump is almost always several steps ahead of them, once again are heralding the president\u2019s seeming preoccupation with the issue. Is the president actually so thin-skinned that he needs the world to acknowledge that a huge number of people turned out to honor him as he was sworn in? Um, no. So what\u2019s really going on in his mind? Here\u2019s my opinion: Everything Donald Trump does is strategically calculated to achieve a goal. His communication is designed not to simply convey his gut feelings, but to make people focus on one thing \u2014 call it a decoy \u2014 so he can do six other things while they\u2019re distracted. In this case, Trump has masterfully used the media\u2019s pathetic naivet\u00e9 and desire to battle him to make them focus on a throwaway battle \u2014 his seeming obsession with crowd size (which I can almost guarantee he could not care less about) \u2014 while he determinedly does what he does care about: signing orders that resurrect pipeline projects, retooling our broken immigration laws, laying the groundwork for a better health care system and preparing to build the wall. For journalists who still don\u2019t get it, here it is, again, in direct terms: When Trump says something like \u201cIf I were you I would take your camera and look at the size of the crowd,\u201d he is actually saying, \u201cLet\u2019s debate crowd size, again, because otherwise you might ask me questions about my real and historically powerful plans and ideas, which I don\u2019t trust you to report on fairly, anyhow.\u201d A journalist who might even come close to Trump\u2019s level of strategic communication should then say, \u201cAh, the old watch this hand while I work magic with my other one? No, we shall not linger an instant on that silly issue my colleagues in the media are focused on. Let\u2019s sit down and talk about the pipelines, again. I don\u2019t want to walk around and snort another line of that drug you know the media is addicted to.\u201d The drug, by the way, is called taking the easy path of the pithy, sensational, stupid story. And lots of journalists who get paid lots of money seem to be hopelessly hooked on it. The rest of us, over the next 90 days or eight years, will watch Trump masterfully ignite one squabble after another that the members of the press fall all over themselves to engage in, while he remakes the world. Man, I am just so happy this guy went to work for us. I\u2019m still pinching myself. It\u2019s like a miracle. Dr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

By Aaron Blake By Aaron Blake January 27 at 5:28 PM Follow @aaronblake President Trump signs an executive order that places a hiring freeze on nonmilitary federal workers on Jan. 23. Trump is observed by, from left, Vice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House trade council head Peter Navarro and senior adviser Jared Kushner. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) President Trump's first week in\u00a0office has been marked by two things: controversy (over things like his inaugural crowd size and voter fraud accusations), and executive orders. The first is old hat for Trump. But for casual observers \u2014 and even some political junkies who are paying close attention to Trump's policy moves\u00a0\u2014 the second might be a little foreign. Trump signed two more executive orders on Friday , attempting to fulfill his promise of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to keep potential \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d\u00a0out of the United States. So what is an executive action or executive order? And how unusual is what Trump is doing with them? Below, an explainer. What is an executive order? Basically, an executive order is an official statement from the president about how the federal agencies he oversees are to\u00a0use their resources. It falls under the broader umbrella of \u201cexecutive actions,\u201d\u00a0which derive their power from\u00a0Article II of the Constitution, and it is the most formal executive action. Executive actions also include presidential memorandums (which are a step below executive orders and basically outline the administration's position on a policy issue), proclamations and directives. An executive order\u00a0is not the president creating new law or appropriating new money from the U.S. Treasury \u2014 both things that are the domain of Congress; it is the president instructing the government how it is to work within the parameters that are already set by Congress and the Constitution. Trump's executive order on building a border wall , for example, basically establishes building the wall as a federal priority and directs the Department of Homeland Security to use already-available funding to get the ball rolling on its construction. The president's executive orders are recorded in the Federal Register and are considered binding, but they are subject to legal review. (More on that\u00a0next.) How can a president do this? In a word: carefully. Executive orders have often been the subject of controversy, with the opposition party accusing the president of overstepping his authority and acting like a dictator. Basically, they're arguing that he's changing the law rather than working within it. This came up most recently after former president Barack Obama signed executive orders exempting the children of illegal immigrants and parents of legal children from deportation. They are known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 or DACA \u2014 and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \u2014 or DAPA. The plans would shield about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation, but Republican governors and attorneys general have sued, alleging that Obama was essentially implementing immigration reform on his own \u2014 overstepping his authority. In June, the Supreme Court deadlocked , leaving a federal judge's ruling blocking the programs in place. And questions have already arisen about the legality of an early Trump executive order involving illegal immigration: his order denying federal funding to sanctuary cities . Expect a court fight there, too. What is the history of executive orders? They have been around for as long as we've had presidents, in fact \u2014 all the way back to George Washington. Some of the more most historically significant \u2014 whether for good or ill \u2014 include: ",

Activists protest as President Donald Trump attends the Congress of Tomorrow Republican Member Retreat Jan. 26, 2017, at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. (Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Mike DebonisThe Washington Post Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party's quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. The recording reveals a GOP that appears to be filled with doubts about how to make good on a long-standing promise to get rid of Obamacare without explicit guidance from President Donald Trump or his administration. The thorny issues lawmakers grapple with on the tape - including who may end up either losing coverage or paying more under a revamped system - highlight the financial and political challenges that flow from upending the current law. Senators and House members expressed a range of concerns about the task ahead: how to prepare a replacement plan that can be ready to launch at the time of repeal; how to avoid deep damage to the health insurance market; how to keep premiums affordable for middle-class families; even how to avoid the political consequences of defunding Planned Parenthood, the women's health-care organization, as many Republicans hope to do with the repeal of the ACA. \"We'd better be sure that we're prepared to live with the market we've created\" with repeal, said Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. \"That's going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we'll be judged in the election less than two years away.\" Republican anxiety is mounting over voting to unravel the health care law without having an alternative in hand, fanned by words of encouragement from Donald Trump to a GOP senator who wants to simultaneously repeal and replace the statute. GOP leaders have made dismantling President Barack Obama ... Republican anxiety is mounting over voting to unravel the health care law without having an alternative in hand, fanned by words of encouragement from Donald Trump to a GOP senator who wants to simultaneously repeal and replace the statute. GOP leaders have made dismantling President Barack Obama ... (Tribune news services) Recordings of closed sessions at the Republican policy retreat in Philadelphia this week were sent late Thursday to The Post and several other news outlets from an anonymous email address. The remarks of all lawmakers quoted in this story were confirmed by their offices or by the lawmakers themselves. \"Our goal, in my opinion, should be not a quick fix. We can do it rapidly - but not a quick fix,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. \"We want a long-term solution that lowers costs.\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, warned his colleagues that the estimated budget savings from repealing Obamacare - which Republicans say could approach a half-trillion dollars - would be needed to fund the costs of setting up a replacement. \"This is going to be what we'll need to be able to move to that transition,\" he said. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Tex., worried that one idea floated by Republicans - a refundable tax credit - would not work for middle-class families that cannot afford to prepay their premiums and wait for a tax refund. Republicans have also discussed the idea of generating revenue for their plan by taking aim at deductions that allow most Americans to get health insurance through their employers without paying extra taxes on it. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who has drafted his own bill to reform the Affordable Care Act, said in response, \"It sounds like we are going to be raising taxes on the middle class in order to pay for these new credits.\" Tom Price, Lamar Alexander Carolyn Kaster / AP Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Sen.

Tom Price, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017, prior to the start of Price's confirmation hearing before the committee. (Carolyn Kaster / AP) Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Tex., who chairs a key tax-writing subcommittee, countered, \"I don't see it that way,\" adding that there is \"a tax break on employer-sponsored health care and nowhere else\" equal to $3.6 billion over 10 years. \"Could you unlock just a small portion at the top to be able to give that freedom [to self-employed Americans]? That is the question,\" Brady said. Rep. John Faso, R-N.Y., a freshman congressman from the Hudson Valley, warned strongly against using the repeal of the ACA to also defund Planned Parenthood. \"We are just walking into a gigantic political trap if we go down this path of sticking Planned Parenthood in the health insurance bill,\" he said. \"If you want to do it somewhere else, I have no problem, but I think we are creating a political minefield for ourselves - House and Senate.\" The concerns of rank-and-file lawmakers appeared to be at odds with key congressional leaders and Andrew Bremberg, a top domestic policy adviser to Trump, who have laid out plans to repeal the ACA using a fast-track legislative process and executive actions from the administration. However, these leaders acknowledged in Thursday's meeting, as they have before, that Obamacare cannot be fully undone - or replaced - without Democratic cooperation. That and other aspects of the unfinished GOP plan prompted several wary lawmakers to urge their leaders to move more deliberately - even as the Trump administration appears to be moving ahead with repeal. Thursday, the White House ordered federal health officials to immediately halt all advertising and other outreach activities for the critical final days in which Americans can sign up for 2017 health coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., dismissed the concerns aired in the meeting during an interview at a Politico event Friday. (Tribune news services) \"We have a responsibility to work for the people that put us in office,\" he said. \"That's the oath we take: to defend the Constitution, to fight for the people we represent, and this is a fiasco that needs to be fixed.\" Of particular concern to some Republican lawmakers was a plan to use the budget reconciliation process - which requires only a simple majority vote - to repeal the existing law, while still needing a filibuster-proof vote of 60 in the Senate to enact a replacement. \"The fact is, we cannot repeal Obamacare through reconciliation,\" McClintock said. \"We need to understand exactly: What does that reconciliation market look like? And I haven't heard the answer yet.\" Several important policy areas appeared unsettled. While the chairmen of key committees sketched out various proposals, they did not have a clear plan for how to keep markets viable while requiring insurers to cover everyone who seeks insurance. At one point Cassidy, a physician who co-founded a community health clinic in Baton Rouge to serve the uninsured, asked the panelists a \"simple question\": Will states have the ability to maintain the expanded Medicaid rolls provided for under the ACA, which now provide coverage for more than 10 million Americans, and can other states do similar expansions? \"These are decisions we haven't made yet,\" said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., worried that the plans under GOP consideration could eviscerate coverage for the roughly 20 million Americans now covered through state and federal marketplaces and the law's Medicaid expansion: \"We're telling those people that we're not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them.\" Republicans are also still wrestling with whether Obamacare's taxes can be immediately repealed, a priority for many conservatives, or whether that revenue will be needed to fund a transition period. And there seems to be little consensus on whether to pursue a major overhaul of Medicaid - converting it from an open-ended entitlement that costs federal and state governments $500 billion a year to a fixed block grant. Trump and his top aides, including counselor Kellyanne Conway, have publicly endorsed that idea. But doing so would mean that some low-income Americans would not be automatically covered by a program that currently covers 70 million Americans. Many of the concerns aired Thursday were more political than policy-oriented. Faso's remarks about Planned Parenthood generated tepid applause. Ryan said this month that he expects the House to pursue the organization's defunding in the reconciliation bill. Those expressing qualms included some of the top congressional leaders who are in line to draft the health-care legislation. Alexander, for one, is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Ryan and other leaders have said they intend to pursue a piecemeal approach, following the reconciliation bill with smaller ones that address discrete aspects of reform. Bremberg, chairman of Trump's domestic policy council, offered little detail in the session about particular executive actions the Trump administration intends to take or what legislative proposals the new president favors. Instead, he pointed to the executive order Trump signed last week, his first, as proof of his commitment to undoing Obamacare's mandates and said his choice of Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be his health and human services secretary \"should speak volumes to people trying to understand what he's hoping to achieve.\" \"This is not a technocrat,\" Bremberg said. \"This is an experienced, compassionate doctor who has experienced the health-care system firsthand and who has been a leader here in Washington trying to address the policy reforms that need to take place. Having both of those in a secretary is going to be very important and very powerful.\" Even as Bremberg offered few details about what the president plans to do, he emphasized that last week's executive order \"repeatedly\" used phrases \"such as 'to the maximum extent permitted by law' \" to enable his political appointees to start dismantling the ACA by executive authority. \"I'm sure many of us have been very concerned about the interpretation of that phrase in the last six or so years,\" Bremberg quipped, referring to the previous administration. \"The president has now officially given direction [not only] to HHS, but to all of these agencies that have responsibility . . . to exercise all available discretion to begin helping the American people and to begin fixing our health-care system.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bremberg's remarks. Faso warned that by defunding Planned Parenthood in the reconciliation bill, \"we are arming our enemy in this debate.\" \"To me, us taking retribution on Planned Parenthood is kind of morally akin to what Lois Lerner and Obama and the IRS did against tea party groups,\" he said, a reference to accusations that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative political groups for audits. Faso continued: \"Health insurance is going to be tough enough for us to deal with without having millions of people on social media come to Planned Parenthood's defense and sending hundreds of thousands of new donors to the Democratic Senate and Democratic congressional campaign committees. So I would just urge us to rethink this.\" The Washington Post's Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane contributed to this report. ",

It requires the the Pentagon and Office of Management and Budget to come up with a plan to bolster the military, and calls for an examination of the nation's nuclear arsenal and missile-defense capabilities. Trump signed the memorandum after a\u00a0swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Jim\u00a0Mattis. Trump called the former Marine general \"a man of action\" in whom he has \"total confidence.\" \"Our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will our\u00a0dedication to peace,\" Trump said. In a signing ceremony in the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes, the president also signed a separate executive order that he said would \"keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\" In signing the two orders together, Trump drew a connection between migration and national security. \"We want to make sure we don\u2019t want to admit into our country the very terrorists that our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. Trump's directive did not specifically mention the Islamic State, but Trump also received a briefing by military brass on plans to expand the pace and scope of the bombing campaign against targets in Iraq and Syria. That could be accomplished by providing more aerial spy planes and other assets from the military and intelligence communities, said Scott Murray, a retired Air Force colonel who helped direct the effort to target ISIL fighters and their infrastructure. Commanders could also re-examine limits on the number of civilian casualties that the military risks when it hits\u00a0targets of the Islamic State, also referred to as ISIL or ISIS,\u00a0Murray said. Known as the \u201cnon-combatant value,\u201d the rule restricts the number of civilians who can be put at risk in an airstrike. Last year, the military delegated the authority for those attacks from higher headquarters to top officers in the field. The result was more airstrikes. Special operations forces could be deployed to provide on-the-ground guidance for bombs in real-time, Murray said. Basing A-10 ground-attack jets in Turkey would allow them to loiter over targets for longer periods, he said.

Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, in a statement. Last week in his inaugural address, Trump decried the state of U.S. military forces and has called to bolster them. The United States\u00a0has \u201csubsidized the armies of other countries while allowing the sad depletion of our military,\u201d Trump said. Friday's memo called on the Pentagon to develop a plan aimed at addressing the military's readiness to fight, including manpower shortages, insufficient maintenance and funding needed for fuel and ammunition. During the campaign, Trump called for a significant buildup of the Navy. He called for the fleet increase its strength from 274 ships to 350, a 27% boost. The Army has already begun to increase its ranks. Legislation approved last year would reverse the reduction\u00a0of soldiers planned by President Barack Obama, boosting the size of the Army by 16,000 to 476,000 soldiers. ] Read more: Posted!

By David Nakamura By David Nakamura January 27 at 3:21 PM Follow @davidnakamura President Trump said Friday that he continues to believe torture methods can be effective to combat terrorism, but he pledged to defer over whether to implement such tactics to Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, who has opposed them. \u201cHe will override,\u201d Trump said in a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the White House. \u201cI\u2019m giving him that power.\u201d During his campaign, Trump had expressed support for enhanced interrogation techniques, in particular simulated drowning known as waterboarding, which was forbidden by the Obama administration. His vow to allow Mattis to set the direction for his administration on the issue came on a day when Trump planned to visit the Pentagon and sign new executive actions related to national security, including the fight against terror groups such as the Islamic State. \u201cI happen to feel that it does work. I\u2019ve been open about that for a long period of time. But I am going with our leaders. And we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to win with or without, but I do disagree,\u201d Trump said about \u201ctorture or waterboarding or however you want to define it.\u201d Trump\u2019s meeting with May was his first with a foreign leader, a summit on trade and security that was being closely watched around the world. It represented a chance for the new American president to demonstrate his administration\u2019s commitment to maintaining close relations with a key U.S. ally while pursuing new trade ties as Britain works to exit the European Union. 1 of 43 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The new president is expected to make his mark on an aggressive legislative agenda. Caption The new president is expected to make his mark on an aggressive legislative agenda. Jan. 27, 2017 President Trump greets British Prime Minister Theresa May as she arrives for their meeting at the White House. Carlos Barria/Reuters [ When Theresa meets Donald: A geopolitical odd couple with big implications for the West ] May sought to tie Trump more closely to the long-standing U.S.-European security alliance, saying her opening statement that the two leaders were \u201cunited in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense.\u201d Yet there were signs of potential differences. White House aides have said Trump, who is scheduled to speak with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin on Saturday, is considering lifting U.S. economic sanctions on Russia over its military incursion into Ukraine. May declared at the news conference that she expects the sanctions imposed jointly by the United States and European countries to remain in place until Moscow abides by the Minsk agreement in 2104 to halt the hostilities. \u201cIt\u2019s very early to be talking about that,\u201d Trump said when asked if he favored lifting the sanctions. \u201cIf we can have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I\u2019m all for that. That would be a tremendous asset.\u201d Trump grew defensive about his relationship with Putin, whom he has praised during the campaign as a stronger leader than former president Obama. Trump has said he is willing to work with Putin despite the assessments from U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the presidential elections to help him. Though the president has acknowledge Russia\u2019s involvement in the hacking of Democratic Party emails, Trump has insisted that he does not believe Putin\u2019s regime wanted him to win. \u201cI don\u2019t say good, bad or indifferent. I don\u2019t know the gentleman,\u201d Trump said of Putin on Friday. \u201cI hope we have a fantastic relationship. That\u2019s possible and it\u2019s also possible that we won\u2019t. We will see what happens.\u201d Trump emphasized that in talking with Putin, he would represent the American people \u201cvery, very strongly, very forcefully.\u201d Referring to the Islamic State, the president added that \u201cif we have a great relationship with Russia and other countries, and if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped -- that\u2019s an evil that has to be stopped -- I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d [ British Prime Minister Theresa May warns Trump he cannot trust Putin ] Trump and May vaulted to power last year by speaking to similar strains of populist anxiety over broad global shifts in the economy and immigration that led voters to reject the status quo and take a gamble on forces who promised sweeping change. Trump\u2019s skepticism toward international institutions and multilateral partnerships have raised questions abroad about the future of U.S. leadership on the world stage. Trump used a prepared opening statement to deliver a forceful defense of \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2014 the British vote to leave the European Union. He cast the surprise victory of a populist referendum as a stroke for liberty. \u201cThe United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world.\u201d If that wasn\u2019t a clear enough rebuke of the 28-nation European Union and its common market, Trump later praised Brexit as a building block for better trade relationship for Britain, and he noted that his own business dealings with what he called \u201cthe consortium\u201d had been arduous and disappointing. \u201cI think Brexit\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,\u201d he told May, adding that Britain will be able to \u201cmake free trade deals without having somebody watching you.\u201d And he seemed to agree with political analysts who saw the Brexit vote in June as a harbinger of an anti-establishment, populist wave that carried him to victory five months later. \u201cBrexit was an example of what was to come,\u201d he said. Trump has sought to follow through on his promises of change in a whirlwind first week as he signed a flurry of executive actions meant to shake up the United States\u2019s role internationally . He has withdrawn U.S. participation in a 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal, ordered planning to begin on a border wall with Mexico and floated plans to block refugees and immigrants from Syria and other Muslim-majority countries. \u201cNow is the dawn of a new era of American independence, a rededication to the idea that the people are in charge of their own destiny,\u201d Trump told Republican lawmakers at a congressional retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday. His meeting with May, who replaced David Cameron in July, represented Trump\u2019s opening bid to begin pursuing the sort of bilateral negotiations on trade and security that he prefers over the kind of multilateral partnerships that former president Obama favored. [ A year ago, Britain\u2019s Parliament debated banning Trump. Now he\u2019ll be a guest of the queen. ] In their first meeting, Trump and May both spoke of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the United States and the United Kingdom. But when a BBC reporter asked Trump about worries in Britain over Trump\u2019s support of torture, praise of Russia and potential ban on Muslim immigrants, Trump looked at May and joked: \u201cThis was your choice of a question?\u201d Drawing laughs from White House staff and reporters, Trump continued: \u201cThere goes that relationship.\u201d But the question highlighted that Trump\u2019s rapid-fire moves since taking office have prompted a vocal backlash at home and abroad. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday canceled a visit to the White House scheduled for next week. Trump aides reacted by suggesting that the United States could pay for the wall, which is projected to cost billions of dollars, through a 20 percent import tax on goods from Mexico, a move that, if carried out, could spark a trade war with the United States\u2019 third-largest trading partner. On Friday morning, Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto spoke by phone for an hour, White House officials said. Mexico \u201chas out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They\u2019ve made us look foolish,\u201d Trump said during the news conference. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d Anne Gearan, Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Attending Super Bowl LI Comes With Super Price Tag Individually, Serena has won $81.7 million on the court \u2013 more than twice the total winnings of her nearest competitor, Maria Sharapova, or any other female athlete on Earth. Venus Williams has racked up $34.4 million in career prize money. Both have cultivated a massive audience on social media \u2013 a major benefit for companies looking to reach new consumers. As of Friday, Serena has more than 17.8 million followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, while Venus has more than 4.5 million. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The MVPIndex, an agency that ranks athletes based on social media, graded Serena as the 16th most valuable athlete in the United States in 2016, generating more than $22 million in equivalent value for her brands. That total also made her the most valuable player in women\u2019s tennis. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate the Williams sisters\u2019 performance on the court to what they do for business off the court,\u201d said Kyle Nelson, co-founder of MVPIndex. \u201cThey have both enjoyed long careers and have had a lot of success \u2013 they are household names in America. They\u2019ve been able to translate their success and popularity from tennis into the social realm with lucrative sponsorships, especially for Serena.\u201d Serena has amassed a personal net worth of $150 million, according to Forbes. She has endorsement deals in place with some of the most powerful companies in the world, including Nike, Wilson, Beats by Dre headphones, IBM and Delta Air Lines. A force in the fashion world, she designs and sells a personalized fashion line as part of an equity deal with the Home Shopping Network \u2013 the most recent edition debuted last September at New York Fashion Week. Sales figures for the line are not publicly available. Forbes named Serena the highest-paid female athlete in the world in 2016, as she rang in $20 million in endorsement earnings that year. She has used her platform to become a powerful voice in the media, speaking out against sexism and social injustice. \"I think Serena has also been much more selective than many athletes who play individual sports, because she is so unique,\u201d said Jonathan Jensen, a sports sponsorship expert and professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cShe is not only an incredible athlete and champion, but is outspoken and doesn't want to partner with brands who may not be comfortable with her speaking her mind and her activism.\u201d Together, Venus and Serena have utilized their wealth to invest in several brands. They purchased a small equity stake in the Miami Dolphins in 2009, becoming the first African-American women to own a portion of an NFL franchise. Last year, the sisters purchased ownership shares of Ultimate Fighting Championship, the burgeoning global mixed martial arts brand headed up by Dana White. Venus\u2019 personal brand may not be worth as much as that of her sister, but it is indeed formidable. Like Serena, she has a clothing line \u2013 EleVen, a collection of athletic apparel for women. She has collaborated with fashion powerhouses such as Ralph Lauren and Diane von Furstenberg. She also has a design company: V Starr Interiors, as well as endorsement deals with Wilson, Kraft, Tide and Ralph Lauren, according to Forbes. \u201cOver the past 20 years they have gone their own directions, established and carved out their own brands and they have very different personalities off of the court,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cVenus is an incredible champion in her own right, it just so happens that her sister is the sport's greatest champion.\" What do you think?

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News, \u201cIt\u2019s a safer day for America.\u201d American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero blasted Trump's plan as unconstitutional. \u201c\u2018Extreme vetting\u2019 is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" Romero said in a statement issued moments after the signing. \"Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favoring or discriminating against particular religions.\" Trump defended the executive order during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \"Right now, the FBI has over 1,000 [terrorism] investigations going on \u2026 and these are people that we let in,\" Trump said from the White House Thursday. \"We don\u2019t need this. Some people have come in with evil intentions. Most haven\u2019t, I guess, but we can\u2019t take chances.\" Trump added that the U.S. has taken in tens of thousands of people. \u201cWe know nothing about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can say they vetted them. They didn\u2019t vet them, they have no papers. How can you vet somebody when you don\u2019t know anything about them and they have no papers?\u201d Civil rights and refugee advocates around the world have sounded the alarm over Trump\u2019s executive order after a draft copy was leaked late Wednesday. \u201cThese actions taken by Donald Trump are tantamount to a Muslim ban,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, the legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. \u201cThis is the Muslim ban that was promised by him on the campaign trail.\u201d As president, Trump has the authority to set how many refugees are allowed in annually. He can also choose to suspend the program altogether. Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush suspended refugee processing. It was later restarted. In the last budget year, the U.S. has accepted 84,995 refugees of which 12,587 were from Syria. Former President Barack Obama set the refugee limit for the current budget year at 110,000. Sources close to Trump tell Fox News he has plans to cut that by more than half to 50,000. In an interview with CBN, Trump said persecuted Christians from Syria would get priority. \u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Trump's Suggested Import Tax Would Mean Americans Pay For That Wall During the George W. Bush years, it drew criticism for opinions that paved the way for harsh detainee interrogation tactics. During the Obama administration, the office blessed the legality of weaponized drone strikes against an American citizen overseas. Earlier this month, a career lawyer in the office concluded that Trump's hiring of son-in-law Jared Kushner for a top post in the White House did not violate federal anti-nepotism law. The prospect that administration lawyers are not reviewing a series of executive orders flowing out of the White House in its first week is raising eyebrows in legal circles. \"OLC is supposed to review all executive orders for legality before they are issued,\" Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Obama Justice Department, pointed out on Twitter in response to this reporter. \"Longstanding practice under admins of both parties.\" Hmm. OLC is supposed to review all executive orders for legality before they are issued. Longstanding practice under admins of both parties. https://t.co/p2bAb4zMJT \u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) January 27, 2017 In fact, Miller said, under a decades-old federal rule , the president is supposed to submit proposed executive orders and proclamations to both the Office of Management and Budget and the Attorney General, who reviews the materials for both \"form and legality.\" The White House in years past has at times bypassed the OLC altogether on sensitive matters of national security or has overruled informal, oral advice from lawyers there. For instance, in 2011, the Obama White House rejected the judgment of Justice Department and Pentagon officials and decided it had the authority to continue military operations in Libya without seeking approval from Congress. Article continues after sponsorship Legal scholars and veterans of the OLC said the ultimate legal power resides with the president himself. And, they said, at times during a transition to a new administration, the coordination between the Justice Department and the White House on issues of law and policy can take time to mature. Still, Walter Dellinger, who headed the OLC during the Clinton administration, said it's \"essential that any order issued by the President be reviewed for lawfulness by the career lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel. That is not a task that can be left to White House staff if we are going to be a nation of laws.\" Officials at the Constitutional Accountability Center, a left-leaning public interest law firm and think tank, said Trump's nominee to lead the Justice Department, Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, should answer questions about whether he'll \"commit to requiring OLC to perform its long-established role of reviewing such orders in the future.\" ",

In one of his first moves as president, Trump reinstated the so-called Global Gag Rule or Mexico City policy , which prohibits federal funds for foreign countries which provide abortion rights education and services. While Trump's decision to change the policy was expected, the fact that he signed the executive order in a room full of white men, was not well-received. Wow look at this: @realDonaldTrump signing anti-abortion legislation while SURROUNDED BY ALL WHITE MEN. https://t.co/UdvOVNBlBm \u2014 Andy Oare (@andyoare) January 24, 2017 And some critics have argued that Trump's policy will actually lead to more , albeit unsafe, abortions. Meanwhile, this White House's more active involvement in the March for Life -- senior Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway also appeared -- is a break from previous administrations and may signal an even more outspoken stance on reproductive rights issues. Related: DC's 'March for Life' to Highlight Gains by Abortion Opponents During his address, Pence noted that with \"pro life majorities\" in the House and Senate -- as well as an upcoming Supreme Court pick who will be \"in the tradition of the late great Antonin Scalia\" -- anti-abortion advocates could look forward to a \"historic moment\" for their cause. \"Along with you we will not grow weary, we will not rest, until we restore a culture of life,\" said Pence. Friday's March for Life comes almost a week after a wave of massive protests around the country and the globe led by women's rights activists, that were largely in opposition to President Trump and his policies. And while those marches were criticized on the right for excluding anti-abortion voices, they were still historically unprecedented in terms of their size and diversity . Play ",

Donald Trump speaks about immigration and refugees during a campaign event in Sunrise, Fla., on Aug. 10, 2016. (Cristobal Herrera / European Pressphoto Agency) Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman Contact Reporters President Trump signed an executive order Friday that would temporarily halt the nation\u2019s refugee program and usher in the most sweeping changes in more than 40 years to how the U.S. welcomes the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. The order would block all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and suspend the acceptance of refugees from war-torn Syria indefinitely. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not letting into our country the very threats that our soldiers are fighting overseas,\u201d Trump said after swearing in new Defense Secretary James N. Mattis at the Pentagon. Trump would also block visa applicants entirely from a list of countries that the administration considers of major terrorism concern, including Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, until a new \u201cextreme vetting\u201d procedure for visa applicants can be launched. Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States Open link The action capped Trump\u2019s frenetic first week in the White House, as well as a busy day that included his first meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May. Trump also spoke by phone for about an hour with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, attempting to soothe what has already become a tense relationship. And he swore in Mattis and signed a second directive that instructs the Pentagon to draw up a list of plans to upgrade equipment and improve training. The U.S. has admitted more than 3.3 million refugees since 1975, including more than 80,000 refugees in the last year. Under Trump\u2019s plan, those numbers would plummet to a trickle for the next several months. For the full fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the order sets a cap of 50,000 refugees. The order provides an exception for \u201creligious minorities,\u201d a category that could include Christians fleeing largely Muslim countries as well as other groups including Yazidis and Bahais that face persecution in the Mideast. Trump said in an interview Friday with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the order would help Christians fleeing Syria enter the United States. The order also expands the ability of local jurisdictions to block the settlement of refugees they object to. During the Obama administration, the federal government stopped efforts by some local officials to block refugee resettlements. Trump\u2019s action, seen as part of his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, sparked an international outcry, given the historic role that the U.S. and other industrialized nations have long played in embracing victims of war and oppression. The last major change in U.S. refugee policy came during the Vietnamese resettlement programs of the mid-1970s. In recent months, Trump has backed away from a blanket ban on Muslims and instead said he would focus on blocking people from countries linked to terrorism. Democrats, however, say the new order is just a more cleverly worded way of achieving the same goal. And the Council on American-Islamic Relations immediately announced that it would sue. \u201cMake no mistake \u2014 this is a Muslim ban,\u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris of California. \u201cBroad-brush discrimination against refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, most of whom are women and children, runs counter to our national security interests, and will likely be used as a terrorist recruitment tool.\u201d But Trump won backing from some key congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who leads the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cWe are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants,\u201d McCaulsaid. \u201cBut as we know, terrorists are dead-set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan horse to attack us.\u201d The new vetting procedures would block admission of individuals who engage in \u201cacts of bigotry or hatred\u201d or \u201cwould oppress members of one race, one gender or sexual orientation.\u201d Trump called the vetting procedures \u201ctotally extreme\u201d during an interview with Fox News on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have extreme vetting for people coming into our country, and if we think there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s not going to be so easy for people to come in anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be the president of a safe country,\u201d Trump told ABC News on Wednesday when asked about the policy. \u201cWe have enough problems.\u201d In the ABC interview, Trump said Germany and other European countries had made a \u201ctremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people.\u201d He said residents of countries left out of the ban \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia \u2014 would nonetheless face what he calls \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d and dismissed concerns that his actions will inflame tensions in the Muslim world. \u201cThe world is as angry as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat, you think this is going to cause a little more anger?\u201d Critics called Trump\u2019s order a betrayal of long-held American ideals. \u201cTears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said in a statement. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , whose family fled the communist takeover of then-Czechoslovakia when she was a child, said she had benefited personally from the American \u201ctradition of openness.\u201d \u201cThis order would end that tradition and discriminate against those fleeing a brutal civil war in Syria. It does not represent who we are as a country,\u201d she said. Traditionally, the U.S. has accepted refugees based on their \u201cvulnerability\u201d and their ties to friends and family in the U.S., said Michelle Bran\u00e9, a director at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission. \u201cReligion and nationality are factors to consider in evaluating the refugee claim, but the program should not exclude a refugee on one of those grounds alone,\u201d she said. Several of those who condemned Trump\u2019s order noted that it was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day , a reminder that thousands of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany were denied safe harbors in the United States and elsewhere, forcing them back to Nazi-controlled territory, where many were murdered. \u201cDonald Trump is retracting the promise of American freedom to an extent we have not seen from a president since Franklin Roosevelt forced Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect in New York City.

Students at The Villages Charter Middle School in Sumter County, Fla., told educators about a rumor that potentially averted a school shooting. WESH A 13-year-old suspect \"was intercepted by authorities as he attempted to arrive\" at the school on Wednesday, the sheriff's office revealed in a press release . \"At the time, he acknowledged conversations involving the plot and referenced the mass shootings at Columbine High School,\" the sheriff's office said. The teenage suspect also implicated a 14-year-old boy who was \"quickly\" located at the school, which is located in the town of The Villages, about 60 miles west of Orlando. \"The student informed officials that the two students had planned an attack which included what they would use as a signal to open fire,\" according to the sheriff's office. \"No weapons were found on either of the students or in their bags or lockers.\" But firearms were found in the Fruitland Park home of the 13-year-old and in the Wildwood home of his alleged accomplice \u2014 one of them an AR-15 assault rifle, according to the police report. Both students are now charged with conspiracy to commit murder and local law enforcement is breathing a big sigh of relief. Students at The Villages Charter Middle School in Sumter County, Fla., told educators about a rumor that potentially averted a school shooting. WESH \"The Sumter County Sheriff's Office is grateful for those students brave enough to speak out about the plot,\" the sheriff's office said. \"Their heroic actions may have prevented a deadly tragedy and loss of precious lives.\" The sheriff's office did not identify the students who went to authorities and the school referred all calls back to law enforcement. Under questioning, the suspects gave a tearful confession during which the younger teen said he had been depressed, according to the police report. \"I just want to die,\" he told investigators and insisted he had been joking about staging the shooting. But under questioning, the teenage suspects also admitted they were supposed to meet at the gym and start shooting. The signal to open fire? A dropped pencil. The April 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado by two disgruntled students has been the inspiration for other massacres. Among them the murders of 20 first-graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut by another troubled young man armed with an AR-15 assault rifle. Corky Siemaszko ",

Sanders declined to say whether Trump requested additional official photos of the crowd from the agency. \u201cHe\u2019s not somebody who sits around and waits,\u201d Sanders said, adding that the call demonstrates the president's proactive management style and the reason he beat Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . 2009 vs. 2017: Comparing Trump's and Obama's Inauguration Crowds The retweet on Inauguration Day was of two photos shown side-by-side, comparing Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration crowd to Obama's 2009 inauguration crowd. As part of its policy, the National Park Service does not release official crowd estimates for permitted events. The retweet was removed last Friday and the National Park Service issued an apology the following day. Employees were also told last Friday to \"stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety,\u201d according to a statement from an Interior Department official. The National Park Service runs and maintains the National Mall where crowds gathered to view Trump's inauguration. ABC News' Jordyn Phelps contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, said in a statement to The Garden Island newspaper Friday that they\u2019re ending the cases \u201cto find a better path forward.\u201d They say they \u201cwill work together with the community on a new approach.\u201d The 14 parcels mostly belong to Native Hawaiian families awarded the land during the mid-19th century, when private property was established in Hawaii.\u00a0 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing backlash for building a wall on his Hawaii property. Residents in the area say it is \"immense\" and blocks ... Many original owners died without wills. Ownership today is split among hundreds of descendants, many of whom are unaware of their shares.\u00a0 In 2014, Zuckerberg spent $100 million to buy 700 acres of beachfront land on Kauai\u2019s North Shore. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The couple filed court cases last month to identify the parcel owners and ask the court to auction the land. The suits filed by Zuckerberg were aimed \u201cat forcing these families to sell their land at a public court auction to the highest bidder,\u201d according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \u00a0\u00a0 The move to get the land through a unique Hawaii law angered locals and prompted a state lawmaker to propose a bill that would force Zuckerberg into mediation before buying real estate on Kauai.\u00a0 State Rep. Kaniela Ing said that, in the past, sugar barons in Hawaii employed the same laws Zuckerberg is using to take land from Native Hawaiians, accusing the technology entrepreneur of \u201ccompleting the theft.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Mikhail Gorbachev AFP/Getty Images \"More troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers are being brought to Europe,\" the 85-year-old wrote. \"NATO and Russian forces and weapons that used to be deployed at a distance are now placed closer to each other, as if to shoot point-blank.\" The 1990 Nobel Peace Prize-winner added: \"Politicians and military leaders sound increasingly belligerent and defense doctrines more dangerous. Commentators and TV personalities are joining the bellicose chorus. It all looks as if the world is preparing for war.\" Thousands of U.S. troops have been sent to eastern Europe in recent weeks, the largest deployment of its kind since the Cold War. Gorbachev oversaw an agreement with the U.S. to reduce their nuclear arsenals. President Donald Trump, however, has suggested he could bolster the number of such weapons at his disposal, something that would reverse decades of American policy. Trump has said he would like to expand America's nuclear weapons, telling MSNBC's Morning Joe in December: \"Let it be an arms race.\" This proposed reversal of decades of U.S. policy was in part what moved a group of scientists Thursday to move the metaphorical Doomsday Clock to two minutes and 30 seconds before midnight \u2014 the time that represents when a catastrophic nuclear event can annihilate the earth.

Without providing a clear resolution for how the two countries will mend the rift, the administration of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said the pair \"acknowledged their clear and very public differences in position on this sensitive issue.\" Trump, since taking office a week ago, has ratcheted up calls to throw up a wall along the nations' shared border \u2014 and force Mexico to foot the bill. \"The Presidents also agreed at this point not to speak publicly about this controversial issue,\" the Mexican government's statement said. The White House released a similarly worded readout of the phone call, but did not include the Mexican government's assertion that Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto would remain mum about the border wall and how to pay for it. At a news conference Friday afternoon with British Prime Minister Theresa May , Trump told reporters the phone call with Pe\u00f1a Nieto was \"very, very friendly,\" appearing to try to smooth over a relationship that has grown increasingly tense this week. \"I think we have a very good relationship, the president and I,\" Trump said.

He also complained that the two nations' shared border is \"soft and weak.\" \"We are going to be working on a fair relationship and a good relationship,\" Trump said of the U.S.'s ties with Mexico, without delving into the war of words prompted over Trump's desire to build a border wall. The phone call was \"mutually arranged\" by both administrations, the White House said. It came after Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday nixed next week's scheduled meeting with Trump over his rhetoric. That prompted the White House to punch back \u2014 floating the possibility of a 20 percent tax on Mexican products imported into America. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has been an otherwise unpopular figure in Mexico, used Twitter to say he was bowing out of next Tuesday's face-to-face with Trump. Trump, in turn, blamed Mexico for the problems along the border while speaking at a GOP retreat in Philadelphia. \"Most illegal immigration is coming from our southern border,\" Trump said Thursday. \"I've said many times that the American people will not pay for the wall, and I've made that clear to the government of Mexico.\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto has said Mexico would not fork over any money for a wall, which could cost from $4 billion to $12 billion, according to some estimates . Meanwhile, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim said on Friday a united Mexico was ready to help the government negotiate with Trump and called on all political parties to support Pe\u00f1a Nieto in his discussions with the U.S. president. In a rare news conference by the generally media-shy mogul, Slim said Mexico needed to negotiate from a position of strength, noting that Trump, who he called a \"great negotiator,\" represented a major change in how politics is conducted.

President Donald Trump, left, hands Defense Secretary James Mattis, right, a pen after he signed an executive action on rebuilding the military during an event at the Pentagon in Washington, Friday, Jan. 27, 2017. (Susan Walsh / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Setting a hard-line tone on national security, President Donald Trump on Friday ordered strict new screening for refugees to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States and alternated tough talk with kind words in his diplomatic standoff with Mexico. Trump traveled to the Pentagon where he joined Defense Secretary James Mattis for the signing of an executive action to bring sweeping changes to the nation's refugee policies and put in motion his plans to build up the nation's military. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" During his election campaign against Hillary Clinton, Trump pledged to put in place \"extreme vetting\" procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. The White House did not immediately release details on the order Trump signed, but a draft of the order called for suspending the issuing of visas to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 30 days. Donald Trump has repeatedly characterized as incubators of crime are generally safer than other cities, according to a new analysis of FBI crime data. There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, but most observers adopt criteria used by Immigration and... The so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that Donald Trump has repeatedly characterized as incubators of crime are generally safer than other cities, according to a new analysis of FBI crime data. There's no legal definition of a sanctuary city, but most observers adopt criteria used by Immigration and... (Christopher Ingraham) Joined earlier in the day at the White House by British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump reaffirmed the United States' \"special relationship\" with Great Britain. But he was also asked about more contentious issues, including his recent statements that torture \"does work\" in prying information out of terror suspects. Giving ground, he said his defense secretary's opposition would override his own belief. Hours later he stood at the Pentagon as Mattis, the retired general, was sworn in as the military's chief. Trump was also pressed on whether he would revert back to Bush-era use of torture, in the news since The Associated Press and other news organizations obtained copies of a draft executive order signaling sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. Trump said he would defer to the views of Mattis, who has questioned the effectiveness of such practices as waterboarding, which simulates drowning. \"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. ... I don't necessarily agree. But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert,\" Trump said. The draft order, which the White House said was not official, also would reverse Obama's effort to close the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba \u2014 a place Trump has said he wants to fill up \"with bad dudes.\" Trump Bryan R.

(Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) The draft also requests recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America's image on the world stage Trump held firm Friday on another controversy \u2014 trade and illegal immigration from Mexico. He told reporters at a joint news conference with May that he had a \"very good call\" with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto earlier in the day, but he reaffirmed his belief that Mexico has \"outnegotiated and beat us to a pulp\" on trade \u2014 and that would change. \"We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing,\" he declared a day after the Mexican leader canceled his visit to Washington in response to Trump's plans to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it. While the refugee actions are aimed at thwarting terrorists, the border wall is more for keeping out immigrants trying to enter the U.S. for economic reasons \u2014 though Trump has continually also raised concerns about criminals flowing north. The flurry of national security moves and foreign policy outreach capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House, giving Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the United States around the globe.

(Louisa Gouliamaki / AFP/Getty Images) Trump, who met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, has the authority to determine how many refugees are accepted annually, and he can suspend the program at any time. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later. During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. Trump, according to the draft of the executive action, plans to cut that to 50,000. The draft order says that while the program is suspended, the U.S. may admit people on a case-by-case basis \"when in the national interest\" and the government will continue to process refugee requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion ... is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" That suggests it would allow the admission of Christians from Muslim-majority countries. In an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status. \"We are going to help them,\" Trump said. \"They've been horribly treated.\" Applauded by some in his own party, Trump's refugee action was strongly criticized by some Democrats.

    "text": "info <p>This photo provided by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows agents taking a person into custody in New Jersey, March 28, 2012, during operation Cross Check III, a federal arrest sweep of undocumented immigrants who allegedly committed serious crimes or were considered threats to national security.</p> Close AP Photo/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement NEW YORK - President Donald Trump signed an executive order \u00a0Wednesday that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to publish a weekly list of \u201ccriminal actions committed by aliens.\u201d \u201cMany aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety,\u201d the order states. \u201cThis is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 The order also calls for the establishment of an Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens, to, among other things, study \u201cthe effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security did not provide answers to Crimesider \u2019s questions regarding how the federal government would go about collecting this data from the nation\u2019s more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies, but the order nonetheless begs the question, how big a problem is crime committed by immigrants? Florida State University Professor of Criminology Daniel Mears says that \u201cgood data\u201d focused on immigrant criminality - specifically undocumented immigrant criminality - is scarce. Determining definitively whether someone who has been arrested is in the country legally can take significant effort, and the result might not be noted in all law enforcement records. In addition, researchers often have to rely on arrest and conviction numbers, which may be misleading because they can reflect law enforcement priorities more than criminal behavior. A jurisdiction might see a spike one year, for example, if a police chief or prosecutor decides to prioritize enforcement against immigrants.\u00a0 Despite this, Mears and others who study this subject seem to agree that most research indicates immigrants actually commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. According to analysis of the 2010 census and the American Communities Survey done by the non-profit \u00a0 American Immigration Council , immigrants to the United States are significantly less likely than native-born citizens to be incarcerated. The authors found that 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born. Murder in San Francisco sparks immigration debate The divide was even sharper when the authors examined the incarceration rate among immigrant men the authors believe likely to be undocumented \u2014 specifically less-educated men from El Salvador and Guatemala between age 18-29. According to AIC senior researcher Walter Ewing, there are very few ways for men in this demographic to emigrate legally. According to the analysis, these likely undocumented immigrants had an incarceration rate of 1.7 percent, compared with 10.7 percent for native-born men without a high school diploma. One study published in the journal Criminology and Public Policy in 2008 looked at recidivism among inmates at the Los Angeles County Jail in 2002 and the authors wrote that their results \u201clend no support to the ubiquitous assertion that deportable aliens are a unique threat to public safety.\u201d\u00a0 This conclusion is no surprise to Christopher Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University who has studied antisocial behavior like drug use, gambling and fighting in immigrant and non-immigrant populations. \u201cThe evidence is really compelling that immigrants are involved in these behaviors at a far lower rate than native-born Americans,\u201d Salas-Wright says. A paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2007 found that immigrants had incarceration rates about one-fifth that of native-born Americans, and that the difference actually increased between 1980 and 2000. The reasons for this so-called \u201cimmigrant paradox\u201d aren\u2019t fully understood, said Salas-Wright, but \u201cone theory is people who choose to pick up their lives and move to a foreign country and set up a new life tend to be healthier people. And they tend to be interested in making this new life work.\u201d In other words, he said, after undertaking the economic and social sacrifice necessary to emigrate, it doesn\u2019t make sense to imperil that new life by committing crime or engaging in risky behavior. During his campaign, President Trump often spoke about immigrants as criminals, and highlighted violent crimes to make his point, including the 2015 shooting death of Kathryn Steinle , who authorities say was killed by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been deported five times. It was a powerful example, but not exactly representative of the millions of immigrants living in the country today, researchers say. Kathryn Steinle, left, and Francisco Sanchez Close \u201cTo ascribe group guilt to crimes just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says AIC\u2019s Walter Ewing. \u201cIf every time a native-born white man shot up a mall we tried to round up all native-born white men, it wouldn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Steinle was killed in San Francisco, a so-called \u201c sanctuary city ,\u201d which offers certain protections for undocumented immigrants who might otherwise be deported by federal immigration officials. Mayors of some sanctuary cities, including Philadelphia\u2019s Jim Kenney , Boston\u2019s Martin Walsh , New York\u2019s Bill de Blasio, and Chicago\u2019s Rahm Emanuel argue that forcing local law enforcement to act as immigration officers will deter immigrants from reporting crime and negatively impact public safety. U.S. leaders split over Trump's crackdown on \"sanctuary cities\" As part of Trump\u2019s order to compile a weekly list of \u201ccriminal actions committed by aliens,\u201d the president directed that the list include \u201cany jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\u201d While there is no doubt that some immigrants commit crimes, Salas-Wright says that the myth that they are generally criminals is \u201ctoo bad, because it doesn\u2019t match up with what we know.\u201d\u00a0 To this point, FSU\u2019s Mears wonders what Trump\u2019s plan to create a public list of crimes committed by \u201caliens\u201d is supposed to accomplish. \u201cWhat\u2019s the goal here? If the goal is to vilify immigrants or to create the appearance that immigrants disproportionately contribute to crime in America \u2014 which isn\u2019t true \u2014 then that makes sense. But if the goal is to reduce crime, this isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.\u201d Anne Piehl, the director of the Program in Criminal Justice at Rutgers University, agrees, saying that immigration and crime have, since at least the 1920s, gotten \u201cconflated in ways that I don\u2019t think are particularly productive in terms of policy.\u201d She continues: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about immigration issues as a way to solve the crime problem, but if we really want solve the crime problem, immigration is a very small part of it.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Credit Henry Romero/Reuters MEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid the diplomatic showdown over President Trump\u2019s order to build a border wall \u2014 and who should pay for it \u2014 Mr. Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico spoke by phone on Friday, both leaders said. The two spoke for about an hour, and both presidents made an effort to say that the call had been productive, suggesting that tensions had cooled, at least publicly. But they stood their ground on their positions, with no suggestion that the call had resolved their disagreement over fundamental issues. \u201cWith respect to the payment for the border wall, both presidents recognized their clear and very public difference between their stances on this very sensitive issue,\u201d the Mexican president\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe presidents also agreed for now to not speak publicly about this controversial issue.\u201d The standoff with Mexico\u2019s president has been the first full-blown foreign policy clash with a foreign leader for the Trump administration. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After Mr. Trump ordered the border wall to be built , months of tensions between the two men came to a boil this week. On Thursday, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has long urged diplomacy in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexico, canceled a meeting with the new American leader. Mr. Trump quickly fired back, saying that Mexico saddles the United States with criminals, illegal immigrants and unfair trade. On Friday, he repeated the same themes. \u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a news conference in Washington. \u201cThe border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re no longer going to be the country that doesn\u2019t know what it is doing.\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cI have great respect for the Mexico. I love the Mexican people.\u201d But \u201cas you know,\u201d he added, Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders.\u201d Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that sell a lot of imported goods are among the strongest opponents of the border-tax idea. (Scott Olson / Getty Images) Don Lee Contact Reporter President Trump\u2019s desire to fund\u00a0the cost of\u00a0a wall across the southern border with Mexico has suddenly brought out of obscurity\u00a0a\u00a0border-tax idea that has been around for many years and is\u00a0embedded in the GOP blueprint for tax reform. The plan would subject importers to higher taxes than exporters or\u00a0those that produce at home for domestic consumption. But the proposal \u2014\u00a0which would essentially replace much of the current corporate tax system \u2014 \u00a0is so fraught with controversy and challenges, politically and legally, that many\u00a0experts give it\u00a0long odds of\u00a0being adopted, despite strong backing\u00a0from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and\u00a0House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin\u00a0Brady (R-Texas).\u00a0 Trump himself had initially dismissed the idea as too complicated, but Thursday he and administration officials suggested that they were considering a 20% tax\u00a0as an\u00a0option\u00a0to generate revenue from imports from countries such as Mexico to pay for the wall. Although it wasn\u2019t entirely clear what kind of tax\u00a0the president had in mind, it appeared Trump was opening the door to a so-called border-adjustment tax, also referred to\u00a0as a destination-based tax because the taxes are determined by where the\u00a0goods and services are sold. Under such a\u00a0proposal, a company\u00a0that imports all of its goods would face a 20% tax on sales of those goods in the U.S.\u00a0 By contrast, a business that produces and sells only in the U.S. could reduce the 20% tax bite substantially\u00a0because it would be able to deduct the labor costs incurred domestically that went into the products. Most to gain are exporters: A\u00a0company in the U.S.\u00a0that produces at home would be exempt from paying the tax\u00a0on its\u00a0foreign revenue, and moreover it could deduct the domestic labor costs for those goods or services sold. That means\u00a0a profitable\u00a0export business\u00a0could even wind up with\u00a0a\u00a0negative tax liability, thus a refund.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe export rebates will end up being politically problematic because it will involve the Treasury sending checks to profitable companies instead of collecting taxes from them,\u201d said Eric Toder, a former Treasury official who co-directs the Tax Policy Center.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u00a0don\u2019t think the optics of that would go over very well.\u201d Many economists like the proposal\u00a0because it is simpler\u00a0than the current tax code, which has a high 35% tax rate and is also teeming with special deductions and loopholes. Significantly, the import\u00a0tax\u00a0would sharply reduce,\u00a0if not eliminate, incentives for multinational firms\u00a0to relocate headquarters outside of the U.S., a practice known as corporate inversion, or to manipulate the tax system in other ways to\u00a0shift their profits offshore to avoid U.S. paying taxes. \u201cIt will strongly encourage companies to locate production activities in the United States\u00a0because the taxes paid on profits are going to depend on where they\u2019re sold, not where they\u2019re produced,\u201d said Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley who has written about border-adjustment tax\u00a0over\u00a0the last decade.\u00a0 Based on a 20% tax, the proposal\u00a0in itself would generate more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years. But the border-adjustment\u00a0tax\u00a0is only part of a comprehensive tax overhaul\u00a0plan by House Republicans, which includes substantial cuts in individual income taxes,\u00a0largely benefiting higher-income Americans. On the whole,\u00a0experts say, the House tax reform would reduce federal tax revenue overall, even with the gain from the border-adjustment\u00a0tax. The proposed tax faces opposition from\u00a0many camps, liberals who don\u2019t like the seemingly regressive nature of a consumption tax, and fiscal conservatives. Some of the\u00a0most vocal\u00a0critics are\u00a0large importers such as oil refineries and retailers, which will feel the biggest hit in taxes. And the idea\u00a0won\u2019t be easy to sell to the American public, either. That is because in the end, these taxes will be borne by consumers as businesses that sell imported goods are certain to pass on at least some of their increased taxes to shoppers.\u00a0\u00a0 Publisher Steve Forbes, who twice ran to be\u00a0the Republican presidential nominee\u00a0and is an ardent critic of excessive taxation, argued in a full-page ad this week in the Wall Street Journal that\u00a0the border tax\u00a0could\u00a0result in\u00a0a 30-cent jump in gas prices and consumers paying 20% or more for everyday goods, much of which are imported from China and other low-wage countries.\u00a0 Economists point out\u00a0that such fears are overblown, however. Even as\u00a0a border-adjustment tax raises\u00a0the cost\u00a0of imports, domestic demand for foreign goods\u00a0will fall, thereby pushing up the value of the dollar. At the same time, as U.S. exporters pay fewer taxes, they will be able to lower their prices in foreign markets, which would drive up demand for dollars and also tend to lift up the dollar value relative to other currencies. All in all, economic theory\u00a0suggests that a stronger dollar would offset the additional cost to American importers and consumers.\u00a0 However, Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Bank, doubts that the\u00a0exchange-rate adjustment would\u00a0completely offset the higher costs. And neither he nor anyone else can say how quickly the dollar\u2019s\u00a0value would rise. What\u2019s more, some countries peg\u00a0their currency values\u00a0to the dollar, which would prevent an appreciation of the greenback, and\u00a0international currency markets are notoriously unpredictable.\u00a0 \u201cUnless the dollar appreciates quickly and countries don\u2019t\u00a0fix their exchange rates, at least in the short run you\u2019re going to be paying more for all that\u00a0stuff,\u201d said\u00a0Kimberly Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College who has written about the problems of the border-adjustment tax.\u00a0\u201cSo that government revenue is coming in, but it\u2019s coming in on the backs of the people who shop at Wal-Mart and the Gap.\u201d Because of such competing interests, business organizations\u00a0like the Chamber of Commerce have been reluctant to take a position on the tax, foreshadowing the upcoming political battle in the halls of Congress and the White House. \u201cMost of the major groups want to remain mostly netural,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, an analyst at the Tax Foundation.\u00a0 Toder, of the Tax Policy Center, agrees\u00a0that shifting from the current system of corporate taxation to a destination-based tax on cash flow would make the U.S. a more desirable place for investment, to\u00a0build factories or to conduct operations. The plan could even lead to higher wages, he said. Still, he doesn\u2019t think the proposal will fly, in part because of the preference to exporters, which also is expected to raise\u00a0legal objections under the World Trade Organization . Clausing\u00a0and Reuven Avi-Yonah, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote\u00a0in a paper this month that the wage-deduction element of the border-tax plan makes it incompatible with the WTO rules prohibiting export subsidies.\u00a0 Berkeley economist Auerbach disputes the notion that the border-adjustment tax is an export subsidy:\u00a0\u201cReducing taxes on wages does encourage domestic employment, but I don\u2019t see how that can be characterized as a trade-related policy,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss So-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge. \u00a0 A surge in media mergers is expected under Trump\u2019s pro-business agenda. \u00a0 Chinese New Year begins tomorrow. \u00a0 Grocery store tomatoes are often tasteless but researchers at the University of Florida have discovered a game-changer.

    "text": "Former Baylor Student Files New Lawsuit Alleging Rape By The Associated Press WACO, Texas \u0097 Jan 27, 2017, 6:54 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Former Baylor President Ken Starr Resigns as Chancellor 0 Shares Email A former Baylor University student who says she was raped by two football players filed a federal lawsuit Friday against the school that alleges there were dozens more assaults of women involving other players. The lawsuit by the student, who is listed in the documents only as \"Elizabeth Doe,\" alleges at least 52 rapes by more than 30 football players over a four-year period. It also alleges a \"culture of sexual violence\" and describes her 2013 attack by two players. It doesn't detail the other alleged attacks, but says some were recorded by the players, who shared them with friends. Fifty-two assaults would dramatically increase the 17 reports of sexual and physical attacks involving 19 players since 2011 previously acknowledged by Baylor officials. Baylor officials declined comment. The school faces at least five lawsuits from women who allege they were attacked and that the school failed to protect them or ignored their complaints. The nation's largest Baptist university has been gripped by the on-going scandal that led to the firing of football coach Art Briles and the departure of school President Ken Starr in 2016. An internal investigation last year found that the football program operated as if it was \"above the rules\" and that assistant coaches and staff interfered or stifled investigations into alleged assaults by players. Baylor allowed Briles' staff of assistants to remain for the 2016 season but new coach Matt Rhule hasn't retained them. Some have moved to new jobs, including Briles' son and former offensive coordinator, Kendal Briles to Florida Atlantic, and defensive coordinator Phil Bennett to Arizona State. In the lawsuit filed Friday, the woman alleges being raped by two players in 2013. The attack was reported to Waco police but no charges were filed and the players were allowed to stay on the team at the time. According to the lawsuit, campus officials didn't investigate her case until 2015. One of the players involved was suspended from the team and later expelled. The other had transferred. The lawsuit alleges the football program operated under a \"show'em a good time\" policy that \"used sex to sell\" Baylor to high school recruits. The woman was a member of a campus group called the Baylor Bruins that would host prospective athletes during visits. The lawsuit alleges Baylor encouraged making Baylor Bruins available for sex with recruits, as well as taking recruits to strip clubs, implied promises of sex and using alcohol and drugs in the recruiting process. Art Briles' attorney Ernest Cannon denied the program culture described in the lawsuit. \"If they were doing that it would be terrible, but they weren't doing that. Art wasn't involved in anything like that,\" Cannon said. \"Lawyers have great imaginations when money is involved. It's really sad.\" 0 Shares ",

Caption The 44th annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C. Jan. 27, 2017\u00a0 Jaime Brown, 22 and Molly Hurtado, 30, both from Connecticut, pose before the rally. Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue. Scalia, a conservative associate justice of the Supreme Court, died last year. \u201cLife is winning again in America,\u201d said Pence, who added that Trump asked him to speak at the rally. \u201cThat is evident in...the historic election of a president...who I proudly say stands for the right to life.\u201d Pence was the first U.S. vice president to address the march in its history. Bundled against a stiff wind, marchers from around the country first descended on the northeast grounds of the monument. Pence, who has called himself an \u201cevangelical Catholic,\u201d has long been a hero among antiabortion activists and as governor of Indiana signed what was considered some of the strictest laws on abortion. Also addressing the crowd was key Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway. \u201cI am a wife, a mother, a Catholic, counselor to the president of the United States of America and, yes, I am pro-life,\u201d she said. (The Washington Post) \u201cThis is a new day, a new dawn, for life,\u201d she said. The right to life \u201cis not a privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cIts is not a choice. It is God-given...This is a time of incredible promise for the pro-life, pro-adoption movement.\u201d \u201cWe hear you,\u201d she told the crowd, which earlier had been chanting, \u201cKell-ee-anne! Kell-ee-anne!\u201d \u201cWe see you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe respect you. And we look forward to working with you.\u201d [ March for Life will have a new mood this year: Optimistic ] This year, organizers hoped to see a surge of energy with the ascension of a president who is expected to move forward on antiabortion policies, including defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing an antiabortion Supreme Court justice. \u201cHe\u2019s pro-life,\u201d Lynn Ray, coordinator of campus ministry at the Louisiana State University at Alexandria, said Friday as she stood on Constitution Avenue with a group from the university. \u201cSo that\u2019s good for us.\u201d \u201cBeing that we\u2019re Catholics, we\u2019re very pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery step we take, we take for an unborn baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not persecuting anyone, of course, just marching for the babies.\u201d Madeline Runyan, 22, a senior at LSU, said she, too, was pleased with President Trump\u2019s stance on abortion. \u201cI\u2019m very confident in what he\u2019s doing to help this cause,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited and optimistic.\u201d The rally began at around 11:45 a.m. Pence spoke shortly after noon. The march began at around 1 p.m., and the crowd moved east, past the Capitol, and toward the Supreme Court, where another large assembly had already gathered. There were members of the clergy, as well as \u201cBikers for Life.\u201d Many marchers were in school and church groups, carrying flags, banners, posters \u2014 and a life-size cutout of Pope Francis. They sang, chanted and prayed. The vast majority was white. Dan Kehoe didn\u2019t see the march as a political statement, but a religious one. The 34-year-old from Taos, Mo., was a chaperone on his daughter\u2019s eighth-grade Catholic Church trip. They took a Greyhound bus for 22 hours for what they called a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to Washington. He saw news coverage of last week\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington and thought that was a political march about women\u2019s issues. This, he said, is \u201ccompletely different,\u201d and is not about women\u2019s rights, but human ones. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a woman\u2019s choice, it takes two to make a child,\u201d he said. More than 200 people made the trip from his central Missouri church community with him, most of them children. He said he voted for Donald Trump, and is happy with his presidents performance so far. \u201cIf the younger generation doesn\u2019t speak up now, who will?\u201d Large groups are common at the march, characterized by matching hats or shirts. One block-long mass of 200 teenagers from 15 churches and three Catholic high schools filled five charter buses, but was only part of a 500-strong group from the Archdiocese of Mobile, Ala. \u201cRemember, we are guests in this city and we\u2019re going to be respectful,\u201d called Adam Ganucheau, 30, has he and other youth leaders handed out 200 boxes Subway sandwiches. \u201cWe are pilgrims; we do not litter.\u201d The size of the group is typical, said Ganucheau, who has attended more than a dozen of these marches since 2001. But he senses an extra electricity. \u201cIt\u2019s historic that these kids will be able to say they heard and saw the vice president,\u201d he said as the throng began to move, sandwiches in hand. Ganucheau said he was glad to have an antiabortion administration take office, although there are parts of the Trump agenda that concern him. In addition to opposing abortion, Ganucheau said his faith also led him to support equal wages, equal pay, a welcoming immigration posture and other progressive social causes. \u201cBeing Catholic is more than being conservative or liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe in treating all people with respect.\u201d Earlier, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, listed her four demands for Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress: \u25cf Appoint an antiabortion justice to the Supreme Court. \u25cf Make the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for many abortions in the United States, into a permanent law rather than the one-year provision that has been extended each year from 1976 to the present. \u25cf Pass a law banning abortion nationwide after 20\u00a0weeks of pregnancy. \u25cf Stop all federal funding for Planned Parenthood unless the organization were to somehow stop performing abortions. The gathering came a week after Trump\u2019s inauguration and followed last Saturday\u2019s vast Women\u2019s March on Washington. Asked about the Women\u2019s March, Ray, of Deville, La., said: \u201cI\u2019m all about women\u2019s rights, except when it comes to the baby. I believe \u2014 it\u2019s my opinion \u2014 but I believe a baby is a gift from God, and once the baby is a gift from God, it\u2019s no longer your body, but there\u2019s another body within. And that body has a right also.\u201d When march attendee Brianna Roberts, 21, of Reading, Pa., met her birthmother two years ago, she was upset to hear that relatives wanted the woman to abort her. Her mother was 20, already had one child, and was getting by on food stamps, Roberts said. But when her mother went to a clinic seeking an abortion, she was told she was too far along for the clinic to perform one. Her birthmother placed Roberts for adoption. \u201cShe did the right and responsible thing,\u201d Roberts said. Roberts said she did not vote because she didn\u2019t like either Trump or Clinton, but she is optimistic that Trump will advance anti-abortion policies. \u201cI thought this was going to be a really big year for policy change,\u201d she said. Francis Leung, 18, a college student from Naples, Fla., said he has attended the March for Life with his parents almost every year since \u201cI was a little kid\u201d in a stroller. Now, at 18, six feet tall and a college freshman, he stood in the throng of demonstrators and grinned, saying, \u201cI always look forward to it.\u201d Leung said he grew up in a devoutly Catholic family and has been hearing a strong anti-abortion message from his parents for as long as he can remember. His nine siblings -- eight of whom came to Washington with him this week -- have heard it, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a great movement, because it\u2019s simple,\u201d said Leung, a student at Ave Maria University in Florida. He was referring to the annual the March for Life. It\u2019s simple, he said, because \u201cevery unborn child has a right to life.\u201d Like his brothers and sisters, Leung said, he was home-schooled. And a central theme of his education was this: \u201cWhen two humans come together and produce a child, when they create a baby, that\u2019s like, really, really big -- it\u2019s the most important thing in the world. Procreation. It\u2019s what human beings were put on Earth to do.\u201d The first March for Life was held one year after the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that recognized a right to abortion nationwide. Subsequent marches have been held on or near the Jan.\u00a022 anniversary every year since. On Friday, the marchers chanted, \u201cHey, hey, ho ho, Roe v Wade has got to go!\u201d Nationwide, 59\u00a0percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the highest percentage since 1996, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center . Michael E. Ruane, Perry Stein, Steve Hendrix, Terrence McCoy, Paul Duggan, Tara Bahrampour, Joe Heim and Michael Chandler contributed to this report. Read more: ",

    "text": "President Trump's Executive Orders on Immigration Explained By Jordyn Phelps Jan 26, 2017, 9:05 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump Signs Executive Order on Wall, Toughens Immigration 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump signed two executive orders Wednesday that call for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and aim to deny federal funds to so-called sanctuary cities that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. The actions could have broad implications for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States and set up a potential showdown between the federal government and cities that resist the enforcement of some federal immigration laws. Here\u2019s what the orders mean: About That Wall The first order, entitled \u201cBorder Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,\u201d is the first concrete step President Trump has taken to deliver on his campaign promise to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d along the southern border with Mexico. \" />Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty Images A US Customs and Border Agent standing a post along the United States-Mexico Border at Friendship Park in San Ysidro, Calif., November 19, 2016. \"Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,\" Trump said in remarks at the Department of Homeland Security after signing the order Wednesday. The order defines it as a \"physical wall or other similarly \u2026 impassable physical barrier\u201d and calls for the addition of 5,000 border patrol agents. The order does not specify how the wall would be funded, though the White House continues to insist that Mexico would reimburse the United States for the cost, even though U.S. taxpayers would foot the bill upfront. The president of Mexico has said that Mexico would not pay. Republican congressional leaders said today they will move forward with plans to approve funds for a wall they estimate would cost $12 billion to $15 billion, leaving Trump to \u201cdeal with his relations with other countries on that issue and others.\u201d Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security, Jan. 25, 2017, in Washington. One section of the executive order sheds light on how the United States might find the funds to build the wall, instructing the head of government departments and agencies to identify all sources of aid or foreign assistance the United States has given to Mexico in the past five years. But total U.S. aid to Mexico in 2016 was $161 million, which is only a fraction of the estimated cost. Trump has estimated the wall could cost $8 billion to $12 billion. He told MSNBC host Tamron Hall last February that he only needed a 1,000-mile wall along the nearly 2,000-mile border. \u201cOf the 2,000, we don\u2019t need 2,000, we need 1,000 because we have natural barriers \u2026 and I\u2019m taking it price per square foot and a price per square, you know, per mile,\u201d he said of how he arrived at his estimated cost. However, an analysis published in the MIT Technology Review noted that building a new 1,000-mile wall could cost as much as $40 billion. Their breakdown includes the current price of steel and concrete. For comparison, the portion of the 700 miles of fencing built in 2007, under the Secure Fence Act of 2006 signed by President Bush, was estimated at about $2.8 million a mile, according to the Congressional Research Service in a 2009 report to Congress. That cost did not include expenses for upkeep. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer floated a possible 20 percent border tax on Mexico as one possible idea for paying for the wall today. \"I think when you take a look at the plan that's taking shape now using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico,\" he said. \"We can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone.\" Spicer later clarified that he was just presenting one possible option to pay for the wall and that a broader \"comprehensive tax reform\" plan is \"in the early stages\" of being crafted by the White House, with the close cooperation of congressional leaders. \"Our job right now isn't to roll something out or to be prescriptive, it's to show there are ways the wall can be paid for, full stop,\" Spicer said, qualifying his previous comments. Trump\u2019s order also calls for ending the \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy that temporarily releases some undocumented immigrants because of the limited detention space. They are told to appear in immigration court at a later date. Sanctuary Cities and Domestic Enforcement The second order, entitled \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\u201d is designed to enhance the enforcement of immigration laws within the United States. The order calls for prioritizing the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have, among other things, been \u201cconvicted of any criminal offense,\u201d \u201chave been charged with any criminal offense,\u201d \u201chave committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense\u201d or \"have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter.\" The language means that all 11 million estimated undocumented immigrants in the United States could potentially be a priority for deportation, on the basis that anyone who came to the country with no border inspection committed a criminal misdemeanor and anyone who overstayed a visa committed fraud, even though it\u2019s not a crime, some legal experts told ABC News. The order gives wide discretion to ICE officers in making such determinations. The language is \u201cremarkably broad\u201d and \u201ctakes that notion of \u2018criminal alien\u2019 to its farthest reaches,\u201d University of Virginia professor and immigration scholar David Martin says. Michael Wildes, an immigration attorney who formerly represented Trump Models, the Miss Universe Organization and Melania Trump, told ABC News \u201cthis is scary stuff for America\u2019s legacy of immigration, for business and for our hospitality.\u201d The order also aims to strip federal grant money from \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d which The Associated Press defines as jurisdictions that do not generally cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Such cities are \u201cnot eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary,\u201d according to the order. That could be read to bar any federal funds, including law enforcement funds, to these cities, professor Peter Schuck of Yale Law School said. The order gives the U.S. attorney general and secretary of the Department of Homeland Security the authority to designate what cities constitute sanctuary jurisdictions. Since Trump signed the order, elected officials in some sanctuary cities across the country have vowed to continue their policy of protecting immigrants. New York City is among those sanctuary cities promising to fight the order. \u201cAny attempt to bully local governments into abandoning policies that have proven to keep our cities safe is not only unconstitutional but threatens the safety of our citizens,\u201d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cI urge President Trump to revoke this Executive Order right away. If he does not, I will do everything in my power to fight it.\u201d The action also calls for adding 10,000 additional border enforcement officers, effectively tripling the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The order also calls for the creation of an \u201cOffice for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens\u201d that will be dedicated to helping U.S. citizens who have been victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants. \"We hear you. We see you. You will never ever be ignored again,\" Trump said, referring to the victims. The latest available government data, in a 2011 Government Accountability Office report, placed the number of what it called \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d in federal prisons in 2010 at around 55,000, or roughly 3 percent of the total prison population of 1.6M prisoners, and found 90 percent of \"criminal aliens\" sentenced in federal court in 2009 were convicted of immigration and drug-related offenses.

    "text": "<p>President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, January 23, 2017.&nbsp;</p> Close SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images Anyone who\u2019s ever caught a glimpse of Donald Trump\u2019s three-story penthouse in New York\u2019s Trump Tower knows that the United States\u2019 45th president likes the look of royalty. His Versailles in the Sky, as it has come to be known, is accented with marble, the Trump family \u201ccoat of arms,\u201d and paintings of Greek gods. There is also, of course, loads and loads of gold.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s not particularly shocking that President Trump has taken those decor tastes to the White House. What may surprise people, however, is just how fast the redecorating has occurred. Just one week into his presidency, here are three notable choices Donald Trump has made with regard to the look of the Oval Office. Trump Oval Office Curtains The curtains in the Oval Office during Obama\u2019s presidency vs. the curtain in the Oval Office during Trump\u2019s presidency.&nbsp; Close Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images In accordance with his love of gilded decor, President Trump did away with the red curtains used in the Oval Office during President Obama\u2019s second term and replaced them with a set of gold curtains. While used briefly by President George W. Bush, these curtains ironically first hung in the Oval Office during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. President Bush ultimately swapped them out for a slightly different set of golden drapes. Trump Oval Office Rug President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Jan. 20, 2017, flanked by (L-R) Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, Vice President Mike Pence, Staff Secretary Rob Porter and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Close Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS When George W. Bush took over the Oval Office, he wanted a rug that conveyed there was an optimistic man at the office\u2019s helm. As such, first lady Laura Bush designed a beige-and-blue carpet with golden sunbeams radiating out from a robust presidential seal. Then, in August 2010, President Obama toned down the vibe of the Oval Office a bit, unveiling new golden striped wallpaper, new golden-brown couches and, most notably, a new tan-and-navy rug with inspirational quotes from five American heroes around its outer edge. The Oval Office rug chosen by President Bush, at left, vs. the Oval Office rug under President Obama. Close Getty Images The quotes around President Obama\u2019s Oval Office rug included the famous line from FDR\u2019s inauguration speech, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself;\u201d Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice;\u201d and President Lincoln\u2019s famous declaration, \u201cGovernment of the people, by the people for the people.\u201d It also featured the famous JFK line, \u201cNo problem of human destiny is beyond human beings,\u201d and Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s semi-socialist statement, \u201cThe welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us.\u201d\u00a0 Inspirational, perhaps, but apparently not President Trump\u2019s taste. He has already followed in the footsteps of his predecessors and swapped out the Oval Office rug. The rug he chose instead? A red-and-beige carpet with green leaves around its outer edge, which was used briefly by George W. Bush but originated in the Reagan era. Trump Oval Office Desk President Donald Trump sits at the ornately carved Resolute Desk, used by numerous of his predecessors. Close Kevin Dietsch - Pool/Getty Images For now at least, it appears Donald Trump has chosen to keep the same desk used by President Obama. This, however, isn\u2019t actually all that surprising when one examines the style of said desk. The Resolute Desk, as it is officially known, is the most ornate of the Oval Office desks and it\u2019s most popular one.\u00a0 Used by Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and John F. Kennedy, the Resolute Desk has been used by more U.S. presidents than the Hoover Desk, the Johnson Desk and the Wilson Desk combined. Opulent and highly ornamented, its wood was salvaged from a British ship called the HMS Resolute, which explored the Arctic in the mid-1800s. Not only is it the most in keeping with Trump\u2019s signature style, the Resolute Desk famously features front panels that provide children in the White House with an iconic hiding place, featured in famous photographs of young John-John and Caroline Kennedy. And while Barron Trump is probably a little old now for a game of hide and seek, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric each have several children likely to appreciate that feature of the Oval Office in the coming years. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Brown, AFP/Getty Images) 30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump ended his first week in office Friday by ordering the State Department to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures for immigrants from countries with ties to terrorism. After speaking at the Pentagon, Trump signed an executive order to implement the new vetting measures to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" out of the United States.\u00a0Doing so, he said, is one\u00a0way to honor the sacrifices made by Americans who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001,\u00a0and those fighting terrorism around the world. \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" he said. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" Trump's expected ban on refugees, who could be affected? Media outlets, including the New York Times and Reuters, have reported this week that Trump's order would suspend the U.S. refugee program and temporarily halt all legal immigration from Syria and six other countries with close ties to terrorism.\u00a0The White House did not immediately release the order Trump signed on Friday, but critics and supporters responded quickly. Trump drew widespread condemnation from Democrats, immigrant and civil rights groups\u00a0around the world. The American Civil Liberties Union described Trump's \"extreme vetting\" as \"just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims.\" And\u00a0David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said the order was completely unnecessary since the U.S. already has the \"strongest, most successful\" resettlement program in the world. \"In truth, refugees are fleeing terror \u2014 they are not terrorists,\" Miliband said. \"And at a time when there are more refugees than ever, America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" This is what it looks like for refugees rescued from Mediterranean Sea Congressional Republicans said they would work with Trump to implement the new vetting procedures. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, described the U.S. refugee program\u00a0as a \"Trojan Horse\" for would-be terrorists that had been ignored by President Obama. \"President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States,\" McCaul said. \"With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.\" President Obama had increased the refugee resettlement program during his time in office, increasing the cap from 60,000 to 70,000 to 85,000 in 2016. He reserved 10,000 of those spots for refugees from Syria. While Trump has claimed that most Syrian refugees coming to the U.S are single, military-age men, the\u00a0State Department said those numbers didn't add up. As of Nov. 2015, 77% of Syrian refugees who entered the U.S. were women and children. Only 23% were adult men, and only 2% were \"single men unattached to families.\" 30 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jGhjoD NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.\u201d \u201cYet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest.\u200e As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent,\u201d he continued, again referring only to \u201cthe innocent.\u201d \u201cIn the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good,\u201d he concluded. \u201cTogether, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world.\u201d The White House statement with Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cmisses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just \u2018innocent people,\u2019\u201d\u00a0tweeted Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the ADL shortly after the comments were released. \u201cPuzzling and troubling\u201d that it \u201chas no mention of Jews,\u201d\u00a0Greenblatt\u00a0added in\u00a0a follow up tweet. 1/2 @WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay , misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just 'innocent people' pic.twitter.com/OXiFqcPi4V \u2014 Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) January 27, 2017 Greenblatt noted that both Republican and Democratic presidents \u2014 including all of Obama\u2019s statements on the occasion \u2014 always clearly highlighted the centrality of the genocide of the Jewish people on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. International Holocaust Remembrance Day was established by the United Nations in 2005 to commemorate the deaths of the six million Jews as well as an estimated two million Roma and thousands of disabled and gay people at the hands of the Nazis. A separate Holocaust Remembrance Day was established by Israel in the 1950s to mark the Jewish losses in particular, which are also traditionally marked by a presidential proclamation. Holocaust survivor told story to thousands of students Trump's generic phrasing contrasts considerably with Obama\u2019s fuller statements on the occasion, which always spoke about the sufferings of the Jewish people, even though\u00a0Trump has consistently portrayed Obama as a foe of the Jews and Israel. 2/2  Puzzling and troubling @WhiteHouse #HolocaustMemorialDay stmt has no mention of Jews.

He has also been criticized for failing to call out virulent anti-Semitism among some of his supporters. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "advertisement LOS ANGELES \u2014 Mike Connors, who starred as a hard-hitting private eye on the long-running television series \"Mannix,\" has died. He was 91. The actor died surrounded by family Thursday afternoon at a Los Angeles hospital from complications of leukemia that had been diagnosed a week earlier, said his son-in-law, Mike Condon. \"Mannix\" ran for eight years on CBS beginning in 1967. Viewers were intrigued by the tall, smartly dressed, well-spoken detective who could mix it up with the burliest of thugs and leap on the hood of a racing car to prevent an escape. Episodes normally climaxed with a brawl that left the culprits bruised and beaten. Mike Connors during Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences 60th Anniversary - Inside and Reception at Leonard H. Goldenson Theatre in North Hollywood, Calif. Mathew Imaging / FilmMagic for Academy of Television Arts and Sciences/Getty Images \"Up until Mannix, most private investigators were hard-nosed, cynical guys who lived in a seedy area and had no emotions,\" Connors theorized in 1997. \"Mannix got emotionally involved. He was not above being taken advantage of.\" In the first season, Joe Mannix was a self-employed Los Angeles private investigator hired by a firm that used computers and high-tech equipment to uncover crime. The ratings were lukewarm. Connors feared the series would be canceled but it was produced by Lucille Ball's Desilu studio, and CBS was reluctant to antagonize its biggest star. In the second season, Mannix opened his own office and combated low-lifes by himself. The ratings zoomed. When \"Mannix\" was revised the office acquired a secretary, played by African-American actress Gail Fisher. The network was concerned that affiliates in the South might object to her character but \"there wasn't any kind of backlash,\" Connors recalled. Another highlight was the theme music by legendary screen composer Lalo Schifrin. Connors also starred in the TV series \"Tightrope!\" and \"Today's FBI.\" Each lasted one season. His movie and TV career stretched from the 1950s to 2007, when he had a guest role on \"Two and a Half Men.\" Connors made his film debut in 1952's \"Sudden Fear,\" which starred Joan Crawford. Other films included \"Island in the Sky,\" ''The Ten Commandments,\" and a remake of \"Stagecoach.\" Connors, born Krekor Ohanian in 1925, was from an Armenian community in Fresno. He served in the Air Force during World War II and played basketball at the University of California, Los Angeles. After graduation he studied law for two years but his good looks and imposing presence attracted him to acting. In an era when film actors were given names like Tab and Rock, he appeared as Touch Connors \u2014 \"Touch\" being his basketball nickname. He later changed it to Michael and finally, Mike. Connors and his wife, Mary Lou, were married in 1949 and had two children: a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Dana. Their son, beset by hallucinations starting in his teens, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and before his death lived in a small residential care facility. Connors and his wife championed efforts to erase the stigma of mental illness. In addition to his wife, daughter and son-in-law, Connors is survived by a granddaughter, Cooper Wills.

(Marco Ugarte/AP) By Joshua Partlow and William Branigin By Joshua Partlow and William Branigin January 27 at 3:41 PM Follow @partlowj MEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid one of the worst crises in U.S.-Mexico relations in years, President Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto spoke by phone Friday morning for about an hour, a conversation that Trump said was \u201cvery, very friendly\u201d but one he suggested was a prelude to tough negotiations over what he described as an unfair trade relationship. \u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Trump said in a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May. \u201cI have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people.\u201d But he quickly added that \u201cMexico has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp. They\u2019ve made us look foolish.\u201d Trump said: \u201cThe border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d He said his talk with Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u201clasted for about an hour\u201d and that \u201cwe are going to be working on a fair relationship, a new relationship.\u201d Although Trump said that \u201cit was a very, very friendly call,\u201d he also stressed that \u201cwe are going to be renegotiating our trade deals.\u201d He said negotiations with Mexico will take place \u201cover the coming months\u201d to ensure that the United States does not \u201close\u201d on trade. 1 of 25 See what it looks like along the border fence between the U.S. and Mexico View Photos About 650 miles of fencing is already in place in parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, but the border is nearly 2,000 miles long.

Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s office said the two leaders had a \u201cconstructive and productive conversation\u201d about the bilateral relationship, including the issue about the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, the importance of \u201cfriendship\u201d between the two countries, \u201cand the need of our countries to work together to stop drug trafficking and the flow of illegal weapons.\u201d On the issue of paying for a U.S. border wall that Trump has vowed to build, the Mexican statement said both sides recognized their differences of opinion and that they agreed to \u201cresolve their differences\u201d as part of ongoing discussions about the relationship. \u201cThe presidents also agreed for now not to talk publicly about this controversial issue,\u201d the statement said. [ Why Trump can\u2019t simply build a border wall with an executive order ] A subsequent White House statement echoed the Mexican one, saying that \u201cboth presidents recognize their clear and very public differences\u201d on paying for the border wall \u201cbut have agreed to work these differences out as part of a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationship.\u201d However, the White House statement stopped short of saying outright that Trump would no longer talk about the payment issue publicly. Trump has vowed to force Mexico to pay for his border wall, which independent experts have said could cost as much as $25 billion. Trump did not mention the issue in his joint news conference with May. (Reuters) Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday canceled a planned trip to Washington, after Trump reiterated his insistence that Mexico pay for the wall. Trump\u2019s decision to move forward with building the wall and his threats to dismantle the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have opened a serious rift in relations between the two neighbors. Earlier Friday, Mexican business leaders and politicians warned of economic disaster and possibly unrest if trade ties between the two neighbors are disrupted by new measures proposed by the Trump administration. Some business executives and officials in Mexico are calling for retaliatory plans. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, one of the world\u2019s richest men, said in a rare news conference Friday afternoon that a possible Trump move to tax imports from Mexico would hurt American consumers and make the U.S. economy less competitive. Slim, who recently had dinner with Trump at his Florida mansion, also suggested that Trump was naive to believe he could recapture the lost glory of 20th century U.S. manufacturing. He said it was \u201ctotally irrational, costly [and] unaffordable\u201d to transfer thousands of Mexican industrial jobs to the United States. Slim predicted an \u201carduous and difficult negotiation\u201d with the Trump administration but said Mexico has its own economic strengths, and he expressed surprise and satisfaction over his country\u2019s \u201cnational unity\u201d in the face of Trump\u2019s \u201cchallenge.\u201d Mexico\u2019s economy was sluggish even before the prospect of a renegotiation of NAFTA, which has led to a large jump in commerce with its largest trading partner. The value of the peso has fallen 13 percent since the election and is plumbing historic lows against the dollar. Economists have downgraded prospects for economic growth. A rise in gas prices that started earlier this month, part of reforms by Pe\u00f1a Nieto to wean the country off gas subsidies, sparked looting, roadblocks and clashes between protesters and police. If Mexico goes into a recession, as some economists have predicted if a trade war erupts with the United States, this could lead to further violence in a country already on edge. \"We might have unrest,\" former president Vicente Fox said in an interview this week. \"If you have a poor Mexico, yes. If there is hunger, yes. If unemployment comes back to high levels, yes, we will have problems. And the consequences will hit right back on the United States.\" Mexico's exporters rely heavily on the United States market. Northern Mexico has transformed in recent years into a robust manufacturing belt that produces automobiles, flat-screen televisions and countless other products. Major American corporations are as common as cactus in the northern Mexican deserts. The tensions have left officials on both sides of the border calculating their next moves in a dispute that potentially puts one of the North America\u2019s critical economic partnerships in the balance. Trump appeared to tighten the screws with a combative tweet, while Mexican politicians have rallied around Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is still deeply unpopular but found himself basking in praise after calling off a meeting with Trump. Pe\u00f1a Nieto made the decision after Trump suggested he should not come to Washington if Mexico remained unwilling to pay for Trump\u2019s planned border wall. The president of Mexico\u2019s national conference of governors, Gov. Graco Ramirez of Morelos, told a Mexican newspaper that Trump had declared \u201cwar\u201d on Mexico. \u201cWith Trump, dialogue is exhausted,\u201d Ramirez told El Universal. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to sit down with him. He doesn\u2019t change his attitude or his position.\u201d Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who had flown to Washington this week in preparation for Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s visit, told a news conference Thursday at the Mexican Embassy that Trump had effectively impugned \u201cthe dignity of the Mexican people.\u201d Paying for the wall, he said, was \u201cabsolutely impossible.\u201d \u201cThere are themes that are not part of a negotiation strategy and are totally unacceptable,\u201d he said. Trump seemed unmoved by the outcry from Mexico. On Friday, he tweeted: \u201cMexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!\u201d The growing rift between the two neighbors, who share a 2,000-mile border and half a trillion dollars in annual trade, comes amid a possible renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place for more than two decades. Mexican business executives and officials noted that a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico \u2014 an idea floated Thursday by White House spokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 would make those products more expensive for American consumers. Some expressed exasperation that so much effort must be expended to convince the United States about the benefits of free trade. \u201cIt\u2019s paradoxical,\u201d Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1on, the president of Mexico\u2019s Business Coordinating Council, a coalition of business groups, said in an interview. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, the United States convinced Mexicans about free trade. Today we\u2019re trying to convince Americans about free trade.\u201d [ Border Patrol chief resigns after clashing with powerful union ] Casta\u00f1on said Mexico should reciprocate on any U.S. tax or tariff. If the United States negotiates with Mexico as a sovereign and respected partner, he said, then both countries can become more competitive and prosperous. If not, then \u201cthe first option is not to have NAFTA.\u201d On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer initially said the border barrier would be funded by a 20 percent import tax on goods from Mexico. Spicer did not provide details of how the policy would work. Later, he appeared to backtrack, telling reporters that the tax was \u201cone idea\u201d to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to \u201croll out\u201d a new policy. He said it could be part of a broader import tax plan backed by some House Republicans. Critics said that if implemented, such a tax would mean that the wall\u2019s cost ultimately would be borne by U.S. consumers. Trump\u2019s moves have rekindled old resentments in Mexico, a country that during its history has often felt bullied and threatened by its wealthier, more powerful neighbor. The legacy of heavy-handed U.S. behavior \u2014 which includes invasions in the 19th and 20th centuries and the seizure of significant Mexican lands \u2014 has mostly been played down by a generation of Mexican leaders who have pursued pragmatic policies and mutual economic interests with both Republican and Democratic administrations in the United States. [ Mexicans are angry at their own president for meeting with Trump ] NAFTA has allowed trade between the neighbors to mushroom . Every day, goods valued at $1.4 billion cross the U.S.-Mexico border, and millions of jobs are linked to trade on both sides. Mexico is the world\u2019s second-largest customer for American-made products, and 80 percent of Mexican exports \u2014 automobiles, flat-screen TVs, avocados \u2014 are sold to the United States. Mexico\u2019s economy secretary, Ildefonso Guajardo, said this week that Mexico is prepared to \u201cmirror\u201d any action by the United States to raise tariffs or impose taxes on imports. Guajardo has also said it might be necessary for Mexico to walk away from NAFTA \u2014 a once-unthinkable idea \u2014 if there was no benefit in the negotiations for his country. \u201cIf we are going to go for something that is less than what we have, it makes no sense to stay,\u201d he said. Mexicans said they had trouble recalling a time when relations were this bad with the United States or when an American president appeared to be such a threat to Mexico\u2019s core interests.

There are at least 166 likely cases in King County, where Seattle is located, and 94 cases in Spokane, where at least 300 students were told to stay home due to concerns they were not up to date on their vaccinations, the health departments in those counties said Thursday. Approximately a two-thirds of those infected were vaccinated, but the mumps vaccine can wane over time. A full two doses of the vaccine provides approximately 88 percent protection, while a single dose can provide 78 percent protection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ten cases were reported in King County in November, according to the county health department. \u201cBecause some people do not get lasting protection from the vaccine and mumps spreads easily from person to person, outbreaks can still occur in vaccinated populations,\" Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for public health, Seattle and King County, said in a statement earlier this month. \"But, if unvaccinated, many, many, more people would become ill.\u201d 5-Year-Old Girl Dies After Catching the Flu, Even After Getting Vaccine A community should be between 75 to 86 percent vaccinated in order to prevent an outbreak of mumps, according to UNICEF . Mumps cases rose dramatically in the U.S. in 2016, with approximately 5,311 cases reported, according to the CDC. Eight states have reported an outbreak of 100 people or more. The virus famously can cause swelling of the salivary glands, causing a swollen jaw or face. Other symptoms include fever, headache , muscle aches and tiredness. In rare cases, it can cause swelling of the testes, ovaries, breasts or the brain. The state department of health is investigating the ongoing outbreak and testing possible new cases in the hopes of stopping the outbreak, officials said. 0 Shares ",

By Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff By Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff January 27 at 3:29 PM Follow @missy_ryan Follow @Tmgneff President Trump announced two executive actions, one relating to vetting refugees, the other to increased military funding, on Jan. 27 at the Pentagon. (The Washington Post) President Trump paid his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Friday, signing executive actions subjecting potential immigrants to greater scrutiny and seeking to enhance American military power. Appearing at the\u00a0Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes, which honors military personnel who have received the Medal of Honor, Trump held up an order he said would establish new measures designed to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from entering the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said, flanked by Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas.\u201d The text of the orders was not immediately available. A draft of one executive order obtained this week by The Washington Post, in keeping with Trump\u2019s campaign promises to subject immigrants to \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d\u00a0laid out plans for a\u00a0temporary ban on the entry of people from certain countries, many of them majority Muslim. It also ordered a temporary halt to refugee admission, prompting an outcry from civil rights groups. Some advocates have said the measures, if implemented, would amount to a ban on Muslims entering the country. [ Draft executive order would begin \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 of immigrants and visitors to the U.S. ] Trump said in remarks before a crowd of current and retired defense officials that he was also signing an order that would \u201cbegin a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States,\u201d including plans for new aircraft, ships and other military equipment. The incoming administration has already signaled its intent to restore defense funding and improve military capabilities following a period of declining budgets and shrinking ranks. In another\u00a0 draft executive order \u00a0obtained this week, the White House instructed Mattis to conduct a 30-day review of military readiness and lay plans for ensuring the United States can meet a host of challenges, not only such terrorist groups as the Islamic State but also \u201cnear-peer\u201d nations that could include Russia and China. It also signaled a desire to invest in a host of military capabilities, including Special Operations forces and nuclear weapons. It was not immediately clear if the draft orders made public this week were the same ones signed by Trump on Friday. [ What is an executive order? And how do President Trump\u2019s stack up? ] In his first week in office, Trump has created anxiety among allies by staking out positions in favor of waterboarding, insisting that North American Free Trade Agreement partner Mexico will pay for a wall along the U.S. border and laying out a number of controversial executive orders. His\u00a0first official interaction with senior military leaders suggested he will attempt to follow through on promises to grow U.S. defenses, boost military spending, and restore personnel cut in recent years. But it provided few clues about how a leader with little national security experience will approach fraught issues including the potential for conflict with nations like China and North Korea and decisions on when to risk American lives overseas. After\u00a0a visit of about 90 minutes that included a meeting with senior uniformed officials, Trump\u00a0said that the Hall of Heroes, one of the Pentagon\u2019s most solemn spaces, was a \u201ctestament to the undying courage\u201d of U.S. service members. Appearing to read from prepared remarks, Trump spoke in noticeably\u00a0more somber tones than he did in front of the CIA\u2019s Memorial Wall last weekend. The new president was criticized by some former officials for failing to show adequate gravity during that event. \u201cI am privileged to be here with you and I promise that our administration will always have your back,\u201d Trump said, addressing U.S. service members. \u201cWe will always be with you.\u201d In his remarks, Trump repeatedly praised Mattis, a retired Marine officer with a long combat record who Trump called \u201ca general\u2019s general.\u201d Already, Mattis has already suggested he may differ with his commander-in-chief on key issues such as the importance of the NATO alliance. [ Draft executive order shows how Trump wants to grow the U.S. military significantly ] Earlier in the day, speaking alongside visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump suggested he would defer to Mattis on treatment of detainees. Trump has said he favors waterboarding, while Mattis does not. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree, but I would tell you that [Mattis] will override because I\u2019m giving him that power,\u201d Trump said of harsh interrogation methods. Trump, who has tapped a number of prominent former generals to lead his national security team, has also promised to aggressively combat militant groups as part of his drive to exterminate \u201cradical Islamism.\u201d Trump takes command as U.S. advisers support local troops battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In Iraq, U.S. military personnel have coached Iraqi commanders as they oversee a push through the city of Mosul, seized by militants more than two years ago. In Syria, a small force of Special Operations troops are working with a Kurdish-led force laying the groundwork for an assault on Raqqa, another Islamic State stronghold. Military officials have been developing options that the incoming administration might support in the campaign against the Islamic State. Those could include the authority to place U.S. troops even closer to the front lines in Iraq, increased forces for Syria and greater authority for military commanders to expand the way U.S. forces are used without going to the White House for approval. A defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said Trump\u2019s meeting with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior officials\u00a0lasted roughly an hour. Trump was accompanied by his national security adviser, retired Gen. Mike Flynn, and the meeting covered a broad array of topics, including the role of the national guard and the responsibilities of the combatant commands, the official said. Officials agreed on the need to accelerate progress against the Islamic State, though it was unclear if a timeline or specifics were addressed. While North Korea and other threats were discussed, the official declined to say if Russia was another topic. In a statement issued after Trump\u2019s visit, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that Mattis shared \u201cthe president\u2019s goal of ensuring our military leaders have the support they need to accelerate the campaign against [the Islamic State], and to build combat readiness now and for the future.\u201d John Wagner and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.

His mother Mamie wanted the nation to see the brutality of his killers. Mamie Till \u201cI wondered, why was it necessary to shoot him?\u2019\u201d she said years later. Till was visiting family in Mississippi when a story started going around town that he had whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a 21-year old white cashier at a grocery store. After Till\u2019s body was found a few days later, Bryant\u2019s husband and brother-in-law were charged with murder. At the trial, Bryant testified Till made lewd advances, verbal and physical.\u00a0 \u201cIn court she testified to something that was tantamount to attempted rape.  What she said was \u2018that part\u2019s not true,\u2019\u201d said author Tim Tyson. Carolyn Bryant Tyson writes in his new book \u201cThe Blood OF Emmett Till,\u201d due out next week, that in an interview conducted a decade ago she took it all back. The book is published by Simon and Schuster, a division of CBS. \u201cShe was trying to say nothing that went on between them constituted any excuse for anyone harming him, let alone what happened to him,\u201d Tyson said. Despite overwhelming evidence, the men were acquitted in less than an hour by an all-white jury. They would later admit to a magazine they had killed Till. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was able to get some footage of Bryant in 2004, then Carolyn Donham, but she refused to answer any questions, as her son made clear to Ed Bradley.

This year they have ample reason to believe that under a Republican-dominated government, they will begin to see movement for the first time in more than a decade. In previous years, no president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. This year, the Trump administration will be out in full force with the appearances of Mr. Pence and Ms. Conway. President Trump, in one of his first official acts, signed an order prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad who discuss abortion as a family-planning option. And in a break with previous Republican presidents, he has embraced the idea of a litmus test for his Supreme Court nominees and pledged explicitly to name someone who opposes abortion. He said he would announce his choice on Thursday to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February. The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support! \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 27, 2017 Mr. Trump has become an unlikely champion for the movement, with abortion opponents saying he is probably their most unflinching White House ally since President Ronald Reagan. Though Mr. Trump spent much of his life as a supporter of abortion rights, he spoke more vividly and forcefully on the issue during the campaign than any recent Republican nominee. Advertisement And while many groups opposing abortion were vehemently opposed to Mr. Trump during the Republican primaries last year, almost all of them came around. Today, however unexpectedly, they march in a Washington suddenly more friendly to their interests. Photo People on the National Mall for the March for Life rally on Friday in Washington. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Voices of the marchers Many of the activists said they were looking forward to President Trump appointing Supreme Court justices who might overturn the right to abortions and to the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Marchers waved signs spelling out their beliefs in messages like \u201cSave the babies,\u201d \u201cPro-Child, Pro-Women, Pro-Life,\u201d and \u201cTrump for Baby Bumps.\u201d Still, some of the marchers remained wary of the new president. Kathleen Crank, 19, a sophomore at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan., traveled on a five bus caravan of 260 students to come to the march. She said she was happy to have a president who would oppose abortion but wasn\u2019t excited about much else about Mr. Trump. She said she waited until the last minute and decided not to vote for either him or Hillary Clinton. \u201cTheir stance on abortion is probably the only issue I\u2019m glad about for this administration,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that after eight years of reading Obama\u2019s tweets celebrating Roe v. Wade, I\u2019m glad we finally have an administration that is recognizing we need to cut funding for abortions in other countries and bringing it back down to the state level.\u201d Ms. Crank also said she saw abortions as less about religion than about preserving the rights of unborn children. \u201cIt\u2019s more a social justice issue for unborn babies than a religious one to push an agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone should be able to live their life and live it however they want to.\u201d Annette Saunders, 60, drove five hours with her husband from Norwalk, Conn., to volunteer with Save the Storks , a group that opposes abortion, and to hand out signs that said, \u201cFor those who can\u2019t.\u201d Though she voted for Mr. Trump, Ms. Saunders said she agonized over the decision because she found him to be \u201ccrass\u201d and was frustrated by the tape of him using vulgarities to talk about women. \u201cI was concerned but I felt like God told me to vote for Donald Trump ,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is standing up for pro-life and his vice president certainly is and I\u2019m excited about seeing a turnaround.\u201d Advertisement Young voters say why they turned to Trump Photo A bag featuring President Trump\u2019s likeness at the rally on Friday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Jon Banks and Josie Rauh, both 18, were taking photos of each other in front of the Washington Monument clad in red and blue Trump-45th President caps. They were part of a group that traveled to Washington from Archbishop Hoban, a private Catholic high school in Akron, Ohio. Both said Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to abortion were the centerpieces of their support for the new president. They grew up in families dedicated to the cause. Ms. Rauh had supported former President Barack Obama but became enthusiastic in 2016. \u201cI thought Obama was a pretty good president,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are some things that need to be changed, like Roe v. Wade. I think Trump has got a plan and is ready to do it.\u201d \u201cI want women to have their rights,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think there are a bunch of women in the womb that are being killed, too.\u201d Mr. Banks, the son of a police officer, said he was thrilled by Mr. Trump\u2019s patriotism. He said he hoped the new president found a way to outlaw abortion.

Anti-abortion demonstrators march towards the U.S. Supreme Court during the 44th annual March for Life in Washington on Jan. 27, 2017. (Tasos Katopodis / AFP/Getty Images) Matt Pearce For the past two years, a divided America has been on a desperate quest to figure out which political world view is most popular, and thus more powerful, and thus rightfully\u00a0in control of the nation's future. We apparently still don\u2019t have an answer. There were the seemingly endless presidential polls, the election predictors like FiveThirtyEight.com, and, of course,\u00a0 Donald Trump himself, who bragged about his rallies and\u00a0his TV ratings. Whatever it was, bigger numbers were better:\u00a0They indicated\u00a0momentum for the biggest opinion poll of all on\u00a0Nov.\u00a08. Except Trump\u2019s presidential victory\u00a0has come and gone,\u00a0and in a sign of how fractious things have gotten,\u00a0the quest for quantification rages on: Crowd sizes have  lately\u00a0become one of America\u2019s most important opinion polls, the latest metric to measure the turbulent political winds blowing through the country. Over the course of just one week, the National Mall in Washington has held three large political gatherings, each representing three huge  constituencies, with each trying to demonstrate popular legitimacy and influence. Trump supporters made their showing first, on Inauguration Day, as an estimated  couple of hundred\u00a0thousand\u00a0supporters gathered in front of the U.S. Capitol to watch and hear  him become president. Facing historically low approval ratings for a new president,\u00a0Trump has tried to argue that his inauguration was the most-watched of all time. He also reportedly pressured\u00a0the National Park Service to find photos showing that his crowd wasn\u2019t smaller than the gargantuan crowd at Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009, and he continued to litigate the issue in the media. \u201cI looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people,\u201d Trump said in an appearance at the CIA on Jan. 21, complaining about media coverage that had accurate reflected the attendance of his swearing-in.\u00a0\u201cThey showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, \u2018Donald Trump did not draw well.\u2019 \u2026\u00a0It\u2019s a lie.\u201d The crowd on the National Mall at the inauguration of President Donald Trump, on Jan. 20, 2017. Associated Press The crowd on the National Mall at the inauguration of President Donald Trump, on Jan. 20, 2017. The crowd on the National Mall at the inauguration of President Donald Trump, on Jan. 20, 2017. (Associated Press) A day after the inauguration, America\u2019s left responded in force, with millions gathering for\u00a0a massive Women\u2019s March, on the Mall in Washington and in cities around the country. An estimated 500,000 alone marched in Washington. Many of those marchers saw Trump as an illegitimate president: a candidate who received almost 3 million fewer votes than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Many also saw the march as new, quantitative evidence of Trump\u2019s unpopularity. \"The President is not America. We are America!\u201d actress America Ferrera declared to the crowd.

(Mario Tama / Getty Images) Some conservatives tried to downplay the massive display in D.C. \u201cIt's almost as if one party has a base of wealthy coastal elites who can travel easily and the other does not,\u201d tweeted Conn Carroll, the spokesman for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Amid all this, on Friday, America\u2019s religious right, which largely supported Trump, swam into the political cataracts as at least tens of thousands gathered for the annual\u00a0March for Life at the foot of the Washington Monument. (Some photographs suggested the march was smaller than the Women\u2019s March crowds, though there were no official counts.) The March for Life is\u00a0typically the largest conservative demonstration of the year, a gathering held to rally opposition\u00a0against the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling in 1973, which defined women\u2019s legal right\u00a0to abort a pregnancy. It\u2019s been a good year generally for conservatives opposed to abortion. They stand to pick up a conservative Supreme Court justice and have seen one of their champions, Mike Pence, ascend to the vice presidency. Yet many on the right had watched the widespread news coverage of the earlier Women\u2019s March and\u00a0wondered why their own annual march doesn\u2019t get more attention from the media. \u201cWhen you looked at how much the networks covered the Women\u2019s March even before it happened, they served as press agents for the Women\u2019s March, and turned around and said, \u2018Look at how successful this was, look how many people attended,\u2019\u201d said Dan Gainor, vice president of the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog that has pushed for more mainstream television coverage of the March for Life.\u00a0\u201cThat seems a tad unfair.\u201d Gainor pointed to polling showing that\u00a0Americans are more likely to call themselves conservative than liberal or moderate. \u201cIs CNN going to go live for the whole March for Life?\u00a0Is ABC going to run an endless live-stream shot?\u00a0That\u2019s the problem here,\u201d Gainor said.\u00a0\u201cThis is a big event ...\u00a0the biggest conservative rally of the year, and we struggle to get coverage for it at all.\u201d Pro-life demonstrators march towards the U.S. Supreme Court during the 44th annual March for Life in Washington on Jan. 27, 2017.

(Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) Yet some recent polling also shows that public support for abortion legalization is at its highest point in two decades , largely driven by increases in support among Democratic women. Kristina Hernandez, a spokeswoman for\u00a0Students for Life, a group that opposes abortion,\u00a0said about 50 of its members had attended the Women\u2019s March and felt \u201cvastly outnumbered.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe reaction to the Women\u2019s March has overwhelmingly been, \u2018If\u00a0this is what feminism looks like, I want no part of it,\u2019\u201d Hernandez said.\u00a0 Ann Grimes-Essay, 56, from Pittsburgh\u00a0braved the cold Friday to join the March for Life, which she had first attended when she was 14. She, too, had heard about the Women\u2019s March and how an anti-abortion women\u2019s group had been prevented from joining the leadership, and she called\u00a0that \u201ca slap in the face to women who believe in respecting all life.\u201d Because of that, Grimes-Essay said, \u201cI really think that for most pro-lifers it was very important that we make a stand, to say that we\u2019re still here.\u201d And so she made her stand, gathering among the thousands to be heard, and to be counted.

That\u2019s because Mexico is the third-largest exporter of goods to the U.S., behind Canada and China. In 2015, the U.S. imported $295 billion worth of products from Mexico, according to the government trade data . The top category was cars and car parts, most of them owned by American automakers and intended for the U.S. market. The U.S. also relies heavily on Mexico for machinery, oil and agricultural products. CBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that revenue raised from a tariff on Mexico would be used to pay for the construction of a proposed wall along the U.S. southern border.\u00a0 \u201cMexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Friday. \u201cMassive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!\u201d Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017 Among other imports from Mexico, the U.S. got $11.3 billion worth of oil came from Mexico in 2015 (the latest year for which data was available), according to UN Comtrade, which keeps data on trade. Mexico also shipped $9.3 billion worth of prefabricated buildings, hailed as the next big innovation in construction, as their use speeds up projects and keeps their cost low. There was $2.1 billion worth of rubber and rubber articles, and $2.4 billion worth of apparel. The category of \u201cbeverages, spirits and vinegar\u201d racked up $3.5 billion of exports to the U.S. Beer made up $1.9 billion of that figure and spirits another $1 billion of spirits. That includes Mexican beers Corona, Dos Equis and Modelo, and the many tequilas for which the country is renowned. ",

The president had signalled he wanted to return to the harsh interrogation techniques used under President George W. Bush, but Defense Secretary James Mattis' commitment not to reinstate the interrogation practices would \"override\" his own support, Trump said. \"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it \u2014 enhanced interrogation I guess would be a word that a lot of ... words that a lot of people would like to use,\" Trump said. \"I don't necessarily agree. But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert.\" May's visit comes at important junctures for both countries. World leaders have watched Trump's first week in office with unease as he made threats of a trade war with Mexico and promoted an \"America first\" agenda. Trump said he had a \"good\" call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday after he scrapped a trip to Washington scheduled for next week, but added that the countries would be \"working on a fair relationship and a new relationship.\" Play ",

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) By Ashley Parker and Sean Sullivan By Ashley Parker and Sean Sullivan January 27 at 4:26 PM Follow @ashleyrparker Follow @WaPoSean No one can accuse Donald Trump of campaigning in poetry. But after just one week in the White House, the new president is bumping up against the hard reality of governing in prose. Many of the sweeping actions President Trump vowed this week through his executive orders and proclamations are unlikely to happen, either because they are impractical, opposed by Congress and members of his Cabinet, or full of legal holes. The reality \u2014 that yawning gap between what Trump says he will do and what he actually can do \u2014 underscores his chaotic start, which includes executive actions drafted by close aides rather than experts and without input from the agencies tasked with implementing them. On a host of issues, from health care to trade to immigration, Trump began his presidency with executive orders intended to both placate and excite his base by keeping his bold campaign promises \u2014 in rhetoric, if not immediate, tangible results. And the White House says Trump\u2019s executive actions should be viewed as initial moves to enact his agenda. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) \u201cWe\u2019re taking the first steps to get it done, with the understanding that some of these things may be a process, but you have to begin the process and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing\u00a0\u2014 taking bold action and doing everything he can to make sure these things happen,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\u00a0\u201cI have no doubt these things are going to happen.\u201d [ In his first major TV interview as president, Trump is endlessly obsessed with his popularity ] But the reality is far more complicated.\u00a0On immigration, for instance, Trump\u2019s call for a border wall paid for by Mexico first has to be funded by Congress. And the possibility that Mexico would pay for the wall\u00a0\u2014 always a long shot\u00a0\u2014 grew even more remote this week after Mexico\u2019s president on Thursday canceled his planned visit to Washington to meet with Trump, citing disagreement over the wall.\u00a0The White House said that one possible option would be to pay for the project with a border tax on Mexican imports. On trade, Trump can withdraw from and renegotiate trade agreements, as he promised during the campaign. But there is no guarantee that he will have willing partners with whom to renegotiate better trade deals, and certainly not necessarily with better terms. And change will hardly be instantaneous: Under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, the president or any other leaders must give six months\u2019 notice of his or her intention to withdraw. Trump has also promised to order an investigation into his false claims that 3\u00a0million to 5\u00a0million people voted illegally in November for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who beat Trump by nearly 3\u00a0million votes. But there is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim, and although he has the authority to launch a fact-gathering investigation, it is unlikely to unearth the extensive election fraud he is asserting.\u00a0 One national security executive order he is considering would allow the Central Intelligence Agency to reopen \u201cblack site\u201d prisons abroad , as well as reconsider the agency\u2019s now-shuttered enhanced interrogation program. But it does not have buy-in from Defense Secretary James Mattis or CIA Director Mike Pompeo, both of whom privately told lawmakers they were not consulted. Many lawmakers in both parties have also expressed strong opposition to the directive.\u00a0 5 challenges Trump may face building a border wall View Graphic 5 challenges Trump may face building a border wall The ad hoc nature of Trump\u2019s executive orders \u2014 including some finalized at the last minute or prompted by an off-the-cuff conversation Trump had with a friend or business executive \u2014 has further undermined their impact.\u00a0 Trump, for example, said that only after a discussion with industry leaders this week did he\u00a0realize that the nation\u2019s pipelines are not necessarily made with U.S.\u00a0steel. The epiphany scrambled aides to draft an executive order requiring that they be constructed with solely\u00a0American-made materials. But specifying U.S.-made steel is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement , except in cases of national security \u2014 which this is not. \u201cIt would certainly be subject to challenge at the WTO,\u201d said Rob Shapiro, a Commerce Department official under President Bill Clinton. Although it could take five years to adjudicate at the WTO, he said, there is also \u201cthe possibility of retaliation by\u00a0whoever does produce them. The truth is that\u00a0\u2018America first\u2019 is contrary to global trade.\u201d Trump, however, does not seem to realize the limited power of his executive orders and has made public signing ceremonies a trademark of his first week.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump needs to go back to civics class because he can direct his employees to do various things, but he cannot repeal a bunch of laws through his executive orders because he needs congressional consent \u2014 and the executive orders themselves say that,\u201d said Rena Steinzor, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s law school. Steinzor, who is also a member of the Center for Progressive Reform, added that the language in many of Trump\u2019s executive orders explicitly acknowledges that they can only be done in accordance with the law.\u00a0\u201cHe can\u2019t just sit there and show people pieces of paper with his overly emphatic signature and say,\u00a0\u2018I have changed the world,\u2019 because that\u2019s not how we do it,\u201d she said. Some of Trump\u2019s actions have caught fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill off guard. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the new action or what\u2019s being proposed,\u201d said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), as he was peppered this week with questions about Trump\u2019s draft order revisiting interrogation practices. And although there is broad consensus among Republicans about the need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act\u00a0\u2014 a process Trump began with an executive order the day he was sworn in \u00a0\u2014 there is far less harmony on exactly when and how to handle the issue. Trade, infrastructure and tax restructuring have also exposed rifts in the party.\u00a0 \u201cPunitive tariffs are not helpful,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a centrist lawmaker. \u201cTrade wars do not end well.\u201d In many ways, Trump is simply experiencing the stark difference between campaigning and governing, a riddle that has bedeviled nearly every incoming president, including Barack Obama. Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, said that although\u00a0\u201cit would be a serious mistake to underestimate the patience Trump supporters have for him and his agenda,\u201d he wondered if Trump himself may grow frustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s going to find that running a business is a lot simpler than running the government,\u201d Newhouse said.\u00a0 [ Tracking Trump\u2019s promises ] David Axelrod, a former senior Obama adviser, pointed to Obama\u2019s executive order his first week in office to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, noting that he faced stiff congressional opposition and never completed his pledge. But Trump, he said, could face an even more difficult challenge, in part because he presented himself \u2014 rather than his policies \u2014 as the linchpin. \u201cThe appeal he had as a candidate is that people clearly want someone to snap their fingers and just make something happen, and he saw that desire and played to that desire,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cNow comes the reality, and he\u2019s going to be snapping in the dark.\u201d Axelrod added, \u201cHe campaigned as an autocrat and now he\u2019s the president, and the president isn\u2019t an autocrat \u2014 and he\u2019s going to find that some of the things he wants to do are difficult.\u201d Many Republicans, however, say that Trump\u2019s supporters may give him a generous amount of time and latitude before demanding concrete results. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said a goal such as building a wall along theborder with Mexico is largely symbolic. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of greater security and greater control,\u201d Ayres said.\u00a0\u201cIf he gets part of a wall built and Congress has to pay for it, the response from his supporters will be,\u00a0\u2018Well, we didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it, but at least we got the wall.\u2019 \u201d And Judd Gregg, a former Republican governor and senator from New Hampshire, said that for Trump supporters, concrete changes may be beside the point, at least initially. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in the verbal jockeying and the confrontational verbal approach than the results,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo as long as he\u2019s poking a stick in the eye of the people his constituency feels are a problem, the rest won\u2019t matter.\u201d Steven Mufson contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Got it Cups depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump for sale in St.Petersburg, Russia. The two leaders are set to talk Saturday. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP) By Karen DeYoung and David Filipov By Karen DeYoung and David Filipov January 27 at 2:17 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @davidfilipov President Trump said Friday that it is \u201cvery early\u201d to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia, suggesting no action is likely in a Saturday call that will be his first official conversation with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin. Trump spoke at a White House news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who reaffirmed her support for keeping the sanctions in place until substantive progress has been made toward ending the conflict in Ukraine. She said she would continue to press that argument with other European allies. The United States and Europe imposed sanctions, beginning in 2014, to protest Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and military intervention on behalf of Ukrainian separatists. Additional U.S. sanctions were levied by the Obama administration last month as punishment for what the intelligence community said was Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election process . U.S. policy toward Russia has become one of the front lines in a simmering power struggle between the White House and powerful congressional Republicans, some of whom have looked to members of Trump\u2019s foreign policy team for support. At the news conference, Trump said he hoped for \u201ca great relationship with Russia\u201d but had \u201cno guarantees.\u201d President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Don Emmert and Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images) \u201cAs far as again Putin and Russia, I don\u2019t say good, bad or indifferent,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That\u2019s possible. And it\u2019s also possible we won\u2019t. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully.\u201d Couching a possible relationship in personal terms, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019ve had many times where I thought I\u2019d get along with people and I don\u2019t like them at all.\u201d [ Trump meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May ] Trump\u2019s comments followed earlier remarks by a senior White House adviser that sanctions removal was \u201cunder consideration,\u201d sparking warnings from senior Republican lawmakers. In a statement Friday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that he hoped Trump \u201cwill put an end to this speculation\u201d about lifting sanctions \u201cand reject such a reckless course.\u201d McCain and leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have threatened to introduce legislation to prevent it. Defense Secretary James Mattis, prodded by McCain at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, said: \u201cWe have a long list of times where we\u2019ve tried to engage positively with Russia. We have a relative short list of successes in that regard . . . and I think the most important thing right now is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with with Mr. Putin.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Friday that he was \u201cagainst lifting any sanctions on the Russians. These sanctions were imposed because of their behavior in Crimea, eastern Ukraine, and now we know they\u2019ve been messing around in our elections as well,\u201d McConnell told Politico. \u201cIf there\u2019s any country in the world that doesn\u2019t deserve sanctions relief, it\u2019s Russia.\u201d (Jenny Starrs, David Filipov, Julie Vitkovskaya / The Washington Post) Numerous Russia analysts outside government have also opposed lifting sanctions, while some have also cautioned against legislation that could weaken Trump\u2019s leverage with Putin by signaling, early in the administration, that the new U.S. president\u2019s powers are limited. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bad idea, almost as bad as some in the Senate, which would deprive President Trump of the opportunity\u201d to set his own policy, said Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Washington-based Center for the National Interest. Trump himself first gave rise to speculation about reversing the sanctions. After repeatedly praising Putin during his campaign, he told the Wall Street Journal days before his inauguration that he expected to keep them intact for \u201ca period of time.\u201d But, he said, \u201cif you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\u201d In an interview with the New York Times, Trump suggested sanctions could be scrapped in exchange for nuclear arms reductions. Statements by McCain, McConnell and others followed remarks Friday morning by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway that sanctions would be \u201cunder consideration\u201d when Trump speaks to Putin. Asked just hours before Trump\u2019s news conference whether Russia, before sanctions are lifted, would have to \u201cchange its behavior\u201d in Ukraine and in Syria, where Russian warplanes have aided the Syrian government in bombing rebels and civilians, Conway told Fox News, \u201cYou know what the president has said \u2014 it\u2019s America first, and that includes in his foreign policy and his national security moves.\u201d The scheduled Saturday call was first announced early Friday in Moscow by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. [ Trump lays groundwork to change U.S. role in the world ] Putin has cautiously expressed optimism that Trump can improve the U.S.-Russia relationship. In addition to the lifting of sanctions, Russia is also pushing for a reduction of NATO\u2019s military presence near its borders and counterterrorism cooperation in Syria.\u00a0 On a grander scale, Moscow hopes the new administration will relax what it sees as a policy of containment since the fall of the Soviet Union left the United States as the world\u2019s sole superpower, allowing the Kremlin to have a greater influence in world affairs and, in Russia\u2019s view, to feel more secure at home. Saturday\u2019s call will cap a week in which Trump has begun sweeping foreign policy changes\u00a0in line with the \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to global affairs that\u00a0he has promised. But Moscow has consistently cautioned about \u201cexcessive optimism\u201d over what Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for Russia, and Peskov stayed on script Friday. \u201cOne can hardly expect substantive contacts on the entire range of affairs from this call,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cLet us wait and see. Let us be patient.\u201d Moscow\u2019s establishment has welcomed Trump as a pragmatist who will not try to enforce American values on the rest of the world.\u00a0In a nationally televised news conference earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov railed against the \u201cmessianism\u201d \u00a0and export by the West of \u201cpost-Christian values\u201d that embrace \u201cpermissiveness,\u201d a nod toward the conservative ethos that has found increasing support in the Kremlin. \u00a0\u201cIf we hear that in the foreign policy of Donald Trump the main thing will be the fight against terrorism, then we, of course, can only welcome that, since that is exactly the thing that has been lacking with our American partners,\u201d Lavrov said. The Obama administration frequently characterized Russia as an unreliable partner at best and raised cautions about Trump\u2019s willingness to work with Putin amid growing concerns about the nature of his ties to Moscow.\u00a0 Trump has denied any business involvement in Russia, a claim that is impossible to verify\u00a0because he has refused to release his tax returns. But a look at his record since the 1980s shows that he and his family have launched several efforts to do business in Russia. Just after the election, a Russian deputy foreign minister was quoted saying his government had been in contact with Trump\u2019s campaign, and afterward, reports emerged that Russian intelligence had compromising information on the future president . Trump has vehemently denied the allegations and has sought to portray his upbeat words about Putin as a positive. Putin has also dismissed the reports that Russia had gathered material on Trump as a\u00a0fabrication to \u201cundermine the legitimacy\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency.

Payal Modi, an art teacher at Adamson High School, was caught on camera shooting a squirt gun as a video of President Trump at his Inauguration ceremony projected onto a whiteboard. The 8-second video shows the teacher repeatedly pointing the water gun at the president and then yelling, \u201cDie.\u201d Tens of thousands of people have seen the video since it was posted online Wednesday, prompting an investigation from officials at the Dallas Independent School District. While the school looks into the matter, officials say Modi will be placed on administrative leave. \u201cToday, we were made aware of a social media posting being circulated involving a teacher at W. H. Adamson High School. The teacher has been placed on administrative leave and the district has opened an investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThis is a personnel matter and, as such, we cannot comment.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop parents from voicing their concerns. \u201cFive of my grandchildren go to Dallas ISD schools...do you have a venue where concerned voices can be heard?\u201d one Facebook user asked. \u201cUnbelievable!\u201d another exclaimed. Some students admit Modi\u2019s actions were inappropriate, but ultimately, the majority believe the teacher was just making a joke. \u00a0\u201cAlthough her actions didn\u2019t display that she was a good role model, she\u2019s always there and supports my classmates, my peers,\u201d \u00a0Briana Castillo, a senior at the school, told CBS Dallas. Adamson High School junior Leslie Jaimes told CBS Dallas she was in Modi\u2019s second-period class when the teacher pulled out a squirt gun she had taken earlier from a student. \u201cTrump came out and she shot at him, but like, it was just a water gun,\u201d Jaimes told CBS Dallas. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d But the school may not feel the same way. As of Friday afternoon, the school had no further update on the investigation or the teacher\u2019s employment status. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

On the morning after Donald Trump 's inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day's... (Karen Tumulty, Juliet Eilperin) Majority Republicans in the House and Senate would also like to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which which provided more than a third of the nation's abortions in 2014. They also hope to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk. Many people at the march said they were encouraged by the early days of the Trump administration, even if they did not support him initially or disagreed with him on other issues. Trump \"was elected because of people who did not have a voice before. This past administration did not listen to us and did not even care,\" said Glenn Miller, 60, a cabinet maker from Coventry, Connecticut, who was attending the march for the fourth time. \"I wouldn't say that I was a supporter of Donald Trump. I voted for him because I didn't think I had a choice.\" Other participants said they felt the march was important this year because their voices were not represented at last week's Women's March on Washington, an anti-Trump demonstration that drew massive crowds in Washington and cities around the country. The women's march included support for abortion rights in its mission statement and dropped an anti-abortion group as a partner. March for Life 2016 Susan Walsh / AP Marchers head past Capitol Hill and the Supreme Court in Washington during the 2016 March for Life, the annual rally held on or near the anniversary of 1973's Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. Marchers head past Capitol Hill and the Supreme Court in Washington during the 2016 March for Life, the annual rally held on or near the anniversary of 1973's Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. (Susan Walsh / AP) Joi Hulecki, 63, a nurse practitioner from Orlando, Florida, said abortion-rights supporters wrongly portray the decision to terminate a pregnancy as empowering for women, when in fact women often feel pressured to have abortions and regret it later. \"We don't want to judge them. We want to help them,\" she said. \"We consider ourselves pro-women too.\" The annual event was never expected to attract a crowd on the scale of the women's march, which brought more than half a million people to Washington. Organizers said in their permit application that they expected 50,000 people, though they hoped for more. \"There's been a lot of talk about numbers this past week,\" said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life. \"It's hard to add up so many numbers after 44 years because there have been a lot of us.\" Mancini added that the most important number for marchers was 58 million, an estimate for the number of abortions performed in the United States since 1973. Americans remain deeply divided on abortion. The latest Gallup survey, released last spring, found that 47 percent of Americans described themselves as pro-abortion rights and 46 percent as anti-abortion. It also found that 79 percent believed abortion should be legal in either some or all circumstances. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said that poll shows why abortion-rights supporters should not despair. \"The vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade and support the legal right to abortion,\" Hogue said. The March for Life, however, is running ads arguing that a majority of Americans support some restrictions on abortion and don't believe it should be funded by tax dollars. Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, also addressed the rally and assured the crowd that Trump and Pence were on their side. \"Their decisive actions as president and vice president will further this cause,\" she said.

    "text": "Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell said they are on the \"same page\" as the Trump administration when it comes to health care and ta... Spicer told reporters Thursday that the administration is considering \u201cusing comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico.\u201d The proposal is meant to raise the billions of dollars from Mexico needed to cover the cost of the border wall, a promise Mr. Trump has made since his days on the campaign trail.\u00a0 Mexican president cancels meeting with Trump after border wall executive order \u201cRight now our country\u2019s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous,\u201d Spicer said. But \u201cif you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports -- which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do...By doing that, we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That\u2019s really going to provide the funding.\u201d Trump talks executive orders, agenda at GOP retreat in Philadelphia Trump\u2019s wall could benefit this Mexican company Later in the afternoon, however, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the White House was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. \u201cIt is part of a buffet of options,\u201d White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters, according to CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan. He said this is one of the many ways that the border wall could be funded. While Mr. Trump has publicly said he had already figured out how to pay for the wall, Spicer said he\u2019s now willing to work with Congress to find a way to do it. That includes making it a part of comprehensive tax reform like that being proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. White House officials said the proposed border tax would essentially be a way to derive payment from Mexico. When pressed as to whether this now meant that the Mexican government would not have to write a check to the U.S. to repay it for construction of the wall, Spicer stipulated that the president had never said that was going to happen. He made the point that there were multiple ways for Mexico \u2013 either via its corporations or other entities \u2013 to help fund the construction. The border adjustment act that Ryan has proposed would include a tax on goods produced outside the country for sale inside the U.S. In short it would incentivize corporations to produce their goods in the U.S. and sell them here instead of seeking a cheaper labor source outside the country. \u00a0Ryan\u2019s argument is that the corporate tax rate would be lowered to offset that increase in cost of doing business. He also argues that it would strengthen the dollar. In 2015, the U.S. suffered a $58.4 billion trade deficit with Mexico, its third largest trading partner.\u00a0 In a tweet early Wednesday, Mr. Trump lamented that \u201c$60 billion\u201d deficit.\u00a0 According to the U.S. Trade Representative, the top items exported by Mexico to the U.S. in 2015 were vehicles ($74 billion), electrical machinery ($63 billion) and machinery ($49 billion).\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear, however, who would bear the brunt of an import tax on Mexican goods. For instance, any border tax hike could potentially be passed on to American consumers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was quick to point out that the U.S. isn\u2019t the only country that can impose an import tax. Border security yes, tariffs no. Mexico is 3rd largest trading partner. Any tariff we can levy they can levy. Huge barrier to econ growth /1 \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 On Wednesday, the president signed an executive order to begin \u201cthe immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border.\u201d\u00a0 CBS News\u2019 Steven Portnoy contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The property is a part of a former rail yard. Los Angeles city lawmakers moved forward Friday with the purchase of a 41-acre site near the Los Angeles River. The property is a part of a former rail yard. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) David Zahniser Contact Reporter The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to spend $59.3 million to buy a piece of land billed as a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d in Mayor Eric Garcetti \u2019s push to restore\u00a0an 11-mile stretch of the Los Angeles River. On an 11-0 vote, the council moved ahead with the purchase of the 41-acre site,\u00a0formally known as G2,\u00a0from railroad company Union Pacific. Councilman Mitch O'Farrell, who heads the committee overseeing the river restoration effort, said the property is by far the largest along the concrete waterway to have a willing seller. That makes the purchase a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d for City Hall, he said. \u201cIt's unheard of to have a parcel of this size that we can acquire next to the river for habitat restoration, for public use, for revitalization efforts \u2014\u00a0you name it,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said. \u201cIn order to do anything along the river, we must control the property.\u201d Because the site is heavily contaminated, the city\u2019s strategy for buying the land, cleaning the soil, restoring habitat and adding public improvements is expected to reach $252 million . The work would transform the mostly empty site\u00a0into a place for residents to hike, bicycle and view wildlife. The project is expected to take several years and\u00a0is still short tens of millions of dollars. Nevertheless, Garcetti said at least a segment of the site could become \u201can initial park\u201d within three years. That would represent a big change for the G2 site, which has long been a barrier between the river\u2019s edge and the nearby neighborhoods of Cypress Park and Glassell Park.\u00a0The G2 parcel, said Garcetti, will open\u00a0up more than a\u00a0mile of direct riverfront access. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve looked at this piece of land, which has split the community\u00a0away from the river,\u201d Garcetti\u00a0said in an interview.\u00a0\u201cWe finally have the ability to bring people down to the banks of the river, through nature and parks, in a working-class part of Los Angeles.\u201d City officials have been working for years on a strategy to restore a stretch of the river between Griffith Park and downtown.\u00a0That initiative would include efforts to widen the river in some locations and free sections of the channel from what Garcetti called its \u201cconcrete straitjacket.\u201d Revitalization of the 11-mile stretch of river was expected to cost $1 billion three years ago, with the city splitting the cost equally with the federal government.\u00a0Since then, the overall price tag has jumped to nearly $1.6 billion. A\u00a0recent analysis warned that unless additional funds are identified, the city could shoulder as much as 76% of the financial burden for the restoration and recreation initiative. State Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles)\u00a0 identified $25 million \u00a0in funds for the G2 site two years ago.\u00a0City officials also expect\u00a0the federal government to provide at least $25.4\u00a0million for the property. Still, prospects for securing federal funds are unclear, in part because of the election of President Trump, who has threatened to\u00a0withhold federal funds from cities with lenient policies toward illegal immigration. G2 was once part of\u00a0the 247-acre Taylor Yard\u00a0railroad complex, which\u00a0hosted train maintenance and fueling operations. Sections of the yard have been sold off over several decades. Friday\u2019s vote was welcomed by several environmental organizations, including the Friends of the Los Angeles River. Lewis MacAdams, that group\u2019s co-founder and former president, said he has\u00a0been pushing for the purchase for more than 30 years. Escrow on the G2 site is expected to close by\u00a0March 1.

    "text": "WATCH Vice President Mike Pence Addresses March for Life 0 Shares Email For the first time at the annual anti-abortion March for Life rally, a vice president addressed the crowds gathered in Washington, D.C. Vice President Mike Pence, a Catholic and longtime supporter of the anti-abortion movement who enacted some of the strictest abortion laws in the country as governor of Indiana, told cheering supporters gathered on the National Mall \u201clife is winning again in America.\u201d \"Along with you, we will not grow weary, we will not rest until we restore a culture of life in America for ourselves and our posterity,\" said Pence. The march, which began in front of the Washington Monument, ends at the steps of the United States Supreme Court. Pence said at the pre-march event that next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee in the anti-abortion jurisprudence of the late Antonin Scalia who \u201cwill uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.\u201d Out on the campaign trail, Trump frequently said that he would nominate \u201cpro-life\u201d judges to the Supreme Court. And while Trump was not able to attend the rally, he expressed his support on Twitter. \u201cThe #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support!\u201d Trump tweeted. The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017 Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway joined Pence in representing the Trump administration. \u201cSteps away from here in the White House a president and vice president sit at their desks and make decisions for a nation. as they sit there, they stand here with you,\u201d said Conway. \u201cThis is a time of incredible promise for pro-life, pro-adoption movement. Our action must reach those women who face unplanned pregnancies, they should know they are not alone. They\u2019re not judged. They\u2019re protected and cared for and celebrated. So to the March for Life 2017 allow me to make it very clear -- we hear you, we see you, we respect you, and we look forward to working with you.\u201d The March for Life draws advocates against abortion rights from around the country to Washington, D.C. It is held each year around the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, made on Jan. 22, 1973. Many in the movement against abortion rights have spoken highly of the Trump administration. Tom McCluksy, vice president of government affairs at the March for Life, expressed optimism for the advancement of an anti-abortion agenda in the first 100 days. \u201cTrump has made pro-life promises and has assembled a team of personnel with incredible pro-life convictions, and qualifications, starting with ... Pence,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. This year\u2019s march centers on the theme \u201cThe Power of One.\u201d Beyond Pence and Conway, speakers included Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and conservative author Eric Metaxas. \u201cIt is our hope that this year\u2019s March for Life will encourage each of us to seek and fulfill our unique mission to the best of our ability because only in doing so we will collectively build a culture of life in the U.S. -- a culture where abortion is unthinkable,\u201d March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement. 0 Shares ",

W. Bush in 1988. \u201cJust do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It\u2019s fine.\u201d Gun rights top Mr. Wade\u2019s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend concealed-carry rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt: He\u2019s good at showmanship,\u201d said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. \u201cBut I think this first week is proving he\u2019s capable of following through on that with real action.\u201d It may be a minority opinion. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, in more than two dozen interviews, Trump voters said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved \u2014 freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several Muslim-majority nations. \u201cTrump\u2019s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B.L.T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1,900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the multibillion-dollar border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35,000, and it has grown only 0.3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour\u2019s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants.

I\u2019m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us.\u201d She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate\u2019s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton\u2019s.

Credit Andrew Spear for The New York Times \u201cIt should be about America first,\u201d Mr. Cottrell said. \u201cWe see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we\u2019re helping refugees and immigrants.\u201d Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the high-ranking staff of the V.A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that didn\u2019t affect his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cI have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,\u201d he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall.

Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. \u201cWe have a pro-life president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,\u201d she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday\u2019s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a self-described \u201cRorschach test\u201d for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were cocktail-napkin sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details.

He also expressed hope that looser regulations on coal would reduce his electric bills. Photo Amanda Abdon outside the gift shop where she works in Mount Gilead, Ohio. She said she would like to see a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend has had to pay. Credit Andrew Spear for The New York Times Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead\u2019s red-brick downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of food-safety regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40,000 canning room for her maple-syrup business. \u201cHe\u2019s a get-it-done person,\u201d Ms. Meimer said of the president. \u201cI wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press\u2019s mind off what he\u2019s really doing.\u201d Jonathan Katz contributed reporting from Durham, N.C., Mitch Smith from Chicago, and Julie Turkewitz from Denver. ",

She plans to become\u00a0\"the new Jackie Kennedy,\" the cover proclaims in Spanish, as the immigrant first lady sits at a table pretending to eat ropes of diamonds as if they were spaghetti. \"Melania Trump, on February cover,\" the magazine's tweet on Thursday\u00a0said. \"A report that reveals the past of this intriguing first lady.\" No, esta no es una historia de adulaci\u00f3n. Les invitamos a leer el adelanto de este reportaje sobre Melania Trump. https://t.co/xduTFkMyBl \u2014 Vanity Fair M\u00e9xico (@VanityFairMX) January 26, 2017 The tweet appeared on the same day President Trump vowed again to build a border wall that could cost $20 billion and make Mexico pay for\u00a0it. He also floated the idea of charging a 20% import tax on Mexican goods. That led Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel a planned visit to Washington. The cover did not go over well in Mexico nor in the USA, judging from tweets.\u00a0\"Total lack of sensitivity,\" said one tweet in Spanish; \"worst timing\u00a0in all editorial history,\" charged one in English.

    "text": "Donald Trump Says He'll Give Christian Refugees Priority By Meghan Keneally Jan 27, 2017, 5:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump Signs Executive Orders at Pentagon 0 Shares Email Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to cut down or stop the number of refugees entering the country, but he has now said that persecuted Christians will be treated as priorities. During an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, the president said today that Christians in Syria have been treated unfairly in the refugee process. \"They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them,\" Trump said in a clip of the interview that was released this afternoon. Trump Speaks to Mexican President by Phone 1 Day After Canceling Meeting In the remarks released by CBN in advance of the full interview airing on Sunday, Trump did not give any examples or cite evidence to support his claim that it is more difficult for Syrian Christians to gain refugee status than Syrian Muslims . According to the CIA World Factbook , as of June 2014, 87 percent of Syrians were Muslim while 10 percent were Christian. And likewise, there were more Muslim refugees from Syria who came to the United States last year than Christian refugees. The Refugee Processing Center reports that in 2016, there were 15,302 Muslims who arrived in the U.S. from Syria and there were 93 people, also from Syria, who identified as either Catholic, Christian, Protestant or Jehovah's Witness. \"The Middle East is a region of extraordinary ethnic and religious diversity,\" said Chris Boian, the senior communications officer of the U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR. \"UNHCR believes that any human being that has been forced to flee his or her homeland to escape life-threatening conflict and persecution should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\" he told ABC News. 0 Shares ",
