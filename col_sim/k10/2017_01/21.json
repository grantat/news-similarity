    "text": "OPEN Graphic That was only one of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises: he also said he would deliver jobs, wealth, a secure border, a path off of welfare, and the return of America\u2019s dreams. And he did not suggest he needed anyone\u2019s help to do it. Mr. Trump has told visitors in recent weeks that he had looked to the inaugural addresses of Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy for inspiration. There were echoes of both in his words: Reagan\u2019s blunt rejection of the Washington status quo (\u201cIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem\u201d), and Kennedy\u2019s call to join a grand national project (\u201cthe torch has been passed to a new generation\u201d). But Mr. Trump did not have the uplifting vision with which Mr. Reagan ended his speech. And he attached his Kennedy-like promise to send forth a message to his campaign slogan \u201c America First .\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cWe will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\u201d Mr. Trump was as unyielding toward foreign adversaries as he was toward domestic ones. He promised to protect the United States from China and other economic rivals who he said would \u201cravage\u201d the country by luring away its factories or stealing its jobs. And he pledged what would amount to a clash of civilizations in the fight against Muslim extremism. The United States, Mr. Trump said, would \u201cunite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.\u201d \u201cAt the bedrock of our politics,\u201d he concluded, \u201cwill be a total allegiance to the United States of America.\u201d Follow The New York Times\u2019s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Just hours after President Trump was sworn into office, the Senate on Friday confirmed two nominees for critical national security positions, James N. Mattis as defense secretary and approve John F. Kelly as homeland security secretary. Republicans had hoped to approve a far greater number of nominees on Mr. Trump\u2019s first day in office, but that process has been delayed because several of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees have been late in filing ethics disclosures, prompting protests by Senate Democrats. Photo Ret. Gen. John Kelly speaks during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, on Capitol Hill, last week. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times While Republicans sought to confirm a third national security nominee on Friday, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the president\u2019s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, Democrats planned to delay his approval, noting that he had not even been approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee as of Friday. Three Democratic senators \u2014 Ron Wyden of Oregon, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut \u2014 objected to what they characterized as an overly speedy push to confirm Mr. Pompeo. \u201cThe importance of the position of CIA Director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated,\u201d the senators said in a statement.

    "text": "<p>Officer Michael Louviere</p> Close WWLTV MARRERO, La. --\u00a0Louisiana authorities say that a police officer and a woman he was helping have been shot and killed. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand told local media that Officer Michael Louviere of Westwego was killed Friday morning in a shooting in neighboring Marrero, just across the river from New Orleans. Normand said Louviere, 26, was shot in the back of the head while he was trying to help the woman, who he believed had been in a car accident,\u00a0 reports CBS affiliate WWLTV. Westwego Police Chief Dwayne Munch told the station the officer was off duty and on his way home when he stopped to try to assist with what looked a car crash. He was still in uniform and driving a marked police cruiser, Munch said. Just before the incident, police received 911 calls from a woman who said her boyfriend had shot her, and another from an anonymous caller reporting an apparent domestic dispute, officials tell the station. Louisiana authorities say a woman, who WWLTV identifies as 32-year-old Simone Veal, was killed as she lay on the ground after crashing her car. Col. John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office says witnesses say a shooter fired at Veal, then chased her car in his vehicle to an intersection where she hit a truck waiting at a light. Fortunato says that while in the intersection, the man shot Louviere, then ran around the car and shot Veal as she lay on the ground. Fortunato didn\u2019t know if Veal has been hit in the earlier shooting.\u00a0 Archdiocese of New Orleans spokeswoman Sarah Comiskey McDonald says the shooting happened outside Visitation of Our Lady School. She says the sheriff\u2019s office must answer all other questions, including whether the woman was a school employee. Normand says police are looking for 32-year-old Sylvester Holt, who police say had been romantically involved with the slain woman. Veal was eight weeks pregnant, according to the station. A U-Haul truck that Holt was said to be driving has been recovered, reports the station. Sheriff\u2019s officials tell WWLTV Holt has had several protective orders issued against him over time. Abdallah Aballah, who works at a gas station near the scene, said a woman ran in about 6:30 a.m. Friday screaming for someone to call 911. He said he and some customers made calls. Aballah says he heard two shots, and customers ran outside. Munch told WWLTV that Officer Louviere joined his department in July 2015 after graduating the police academy at the top of his class. He was also a former marine who served in Afghanistan. He leaves behind a wife, a 4-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son, Munch said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. We\u2019re a close knit police department,\u201d Munch told the station. \u201cHe was shot in the back of the head. He had no idea what was coming. As he was trying to assist someone he believed to have been injured in an auto accident, he was murdered.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Scores were arrested for trashing property and attacking officers. Officers arrested 217 protesters,\u00a0 CBS affiliate WUSA report s . Six police officers were hurt during the protests, including three who were hit in the head with flying objects. All of them have minor injuries. \u00a0 Violent protests break out after Trump sworn in The bulk of the criminal acts happened at 10:30 a.m. when 400 to 500 people on 13th Street destroyed property, Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said. The protesters were armed with crowbars and threw objects at people and businesses, destroying storefronts and damaging vehicles. Police used pepper spray to diffuse the situation. \u00a0 There were protests in other cities, including Portland, where protesters and police clashed and police used flashbangs and tear gas, CBS affiliate KOIN reports .\u00a0 The planned protest began peacefully Friday afternoon, but the tone of the event changed when police said protesters began throwing \u201crocks, bottles, flares and unknown liquids\u201d at officers who blocked them from walking onto local bridges. \u00a0 In New Orleans, 15 people were arrested and two officers were injured as a band of protesters going through the French Quarter and Central Business District spray-painted graffiti, damaged police vehicles and smashed out windows as businesses, NOPD Chief Michael Harrison said Friday night, CBS affiliate WWL reports .\u00a0 A video on social media shows District of Columbia police pepper-spraying a group of protesters - including an elderly woman and a man on crutches, as well as those trying to help them to move out of the way.\u00a0 A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department declined to immediately provide comment. It was unclear what happened just before the video began.\u00a0 The video shows a woman screaming \u201cmy child\u201d as she runs with her crying son in her arms. Others are hunched over or coughing as plumes of pink spray waft over hundreds of people in the street. Toward the end of the video, protesters appear to be breaking up cement blocks and some people are seen throwing objects toward police.\u00a0 Several spirited demonstrations unfolded peacefully at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through to the inaugural ceremony. Signs read, \u201cResist Trump Climate Justice Now,\u201d \u2018\u2019Let Freedom Ring,\u201d \u2018\u2019Free Palestine.\u201d Many American citizens gather in protest of the presidential inaguration But about a mile from the National Mall, police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, a Bank of America, a Wells Fargo and a McDonald\u2019s as they denounced capitalism and Mr. Trump. Police in riot gear used pepper spray from large canisters and eventually cordoned off protesters at 12th and L streets in northwest Washington. The confrontation began an hour before Mr. Trump took the oath of office and escalated several hours later as the crowd of protesters swelled to more than 1,000, some wearing gas masks and with arms chained together inside PVC pipe. One said the demonstrators were \u201cbringing in the cavalry.\u201d When some crossed police lines, taunting, \u201cPut the pigs in the ground,\u201d police charged with batons and pepper spray, as well as stun grenades, which are used to shock and disperse crowds. Loud booms echoed through the streets about six blocks from where Mr. Trump would hold his inaugural parade.

At 13th and K streets, police moved in on a crowd after a limo was set on fire, CBS News homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports. The fire department responded to the blaze and put it out. Pegues didn\u2019t see anyone injured at the scene. After the police moved in, some in the crowd removed bricks from the ground and threw them at officers, Pegues reports.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images According to a police spokesman, around 95 people had been arrested by 2 p.m., CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. The charges include rioting and vandalism. Two officers were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Milton reports. Police said in a statement that the group damaged vehicles, destroyed property and set small fires while armed with crowbars and hammers. Peter Newsham, the interim police chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said the group caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d along a number of blocks. Donald Trump delivers his inaugural address as President of the United States Before Inauguration Day, the DisruptJ20 coalition, named after the date of the inauguration, had promised that people participating in its actions in Washington would attempt to shut down the celebrations, risking arrest when necessary. Earlier in the day, as guests were going in to the ceremony, lines for ticket-holders entering two gates stretched for blocks at one point as protesters clogged entrances. Trump supporter Brett Ecker said the protesters were frustrating but weren\u2019t going to put a damper on his day. \u201cThey\u2019re just here to stir up trouble,\u201d said the 36-year-old public school teacher. \u201cIt upsets me a little bit that people choose to do this, but yet again, it\u2019s one of the things I love about this country.\u201d View Gallery Activists race after being hit by a stun grenade while protesting against President Trump on the sidelines of the inauguration in Washington Jan. 20, 2017. Reuters/Adrees Latif At one checkpoint, protesters wore orange jumpsuits with black hoods over their faces to represent prisoners in U.S. detention at Guantanamo Bay. Eleanor Goldfield, who helped organize the Disrupt J20 protest, said protesters wanted to show Mr. Trump and his \u201cmisguided, misinformed or just plain dangerous\u201d supporters that they won\u2019t be silent. Black Lives Matter and feminist groups also made their voices heard. Most Trump supporters walking to the inauguration past Union Station ignored protesters outside the train station, but not Doug Rahm, who engaged in a lengthy and sometimes profane yelling match with them. \u201cGet a job,\u201d said Rahm, a Bikers for Trump member from Philadelphia. \u201cStop crying, snowflakes, Trump won.\u201d Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States Outside the International Spy Museum, protesters in Russian hats ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of President Vladimir Putin, marching with signs calling Mr. Trump \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet\u201d and \u201cKremlin employee of the month.\u201d Demonstrations in Washington were not the only ones Friday. In San Francisco, thousands of demonstrators formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted \u201cLove Trumps hate.\u201d In the city\u2019s financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Mr. Trump. In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Mr. Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement. In New York, Democratic Councilman Jumaane Williams and other protesters were arrested outside Trump Tower in Manhattan after sitting on Fifth Avenue. Other demonstrators chanted loudly but the event remained peaceful. And in Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Mr. Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud.

Reuters/Adrees Latif In Washington, the \u201cFestival of Resistance\u201d march ran about 1.5 miles to McPherson Square, a park about three blocks from the White House, where a rally featured the filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. \u201cWe have to perform an intervention,\u201d Moore said, according to CBS affiliate WUSA-TV . \u201cIt helps us that he has such a thin skin. He can\u2019t stand the fact that people don\u2019t like him. He wants to be loved.\u201d Friday\u2019s protests weren\u2019t the first of the inauguration. On Thursday night, protesters and Trump supporters clashed outside a pro-Trump event in Washington. Police used chemical spray on some protesters in an effort to control the unruly crowd. The demonstrations won\u2019t end when Mr. Trump takes up residence in the White House. A massive Women\u2019s March on Washington is planned for Saturday. Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia\u2019s homeland security director, has said 1,800 buses have registered to park in the city Saturday, which could mean nearly 100,000 people coming in just by bus. 91 Photos Inauguration of Donald Trump \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Sierra Club executive director talks EPA nominee During one of the United States\u2019\u00a0 largest astronomical conferences , on Jan. 4, scientists discussed what geoengineering the planet\u2019s atmosphere could mean for astronomers whose job it is to observe the night sky. Geoengineering refers to directly altering the Earth or its atmosphere to try and lessen the impact of climate change. While climate change is seemingly unrelated to night-sky observation, the panelists argued that it was an issue that astronomers needed to be concerned with. \u201cIt\u2019s an astronomical problem if we define astronomy to include planetary science and evolution,\u201d said David Grinspoon, an astrobiologist at the Planetary Science Institute. He was joined by Jane Long, a retired scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Tom Ackerman, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Washington; and Mel Ulmer, an astronomer at Northwestern University. James Lowenthal, an astronomer at Smith College, served as moderator. \u201cWe [humans] need to learn how to become a long-term stabilizing factor on this planet,\u201d Grinspoon said. \u2018Dirty little secrets\u2019 To mitigate the most serious consequences of global warming, climate scientists have warned that the rise in Earth\u2019s temperature needs to be capped at no more than\u00a0 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u00a0(2 degrees Celsius). Long-term strategies require reducing the burning of fossil fuels, which puts carbon dioxide into the air. But the panelists said that won\u2019t be sufficient to reach the low levels necessary to meet the goals established by the\u00a0 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u00a0(IPCC). Stunning photos of climate change \u201cOne of the\u00a0 dirty little secrets \u00a0of the IPCC is that it requires negative emissions,\u201d Long said, referring to the process of recapturing CO2 that has already been released. No existing models predict staying below the necessary levels, she said, which means that it\u2019s not enough to simply stop emitting carbon dioxide; further steps will need to be taken to remove what\u2019s already in the air. Geoengineering Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u00a0includes several different proposals for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Various proposed methods can lock solid or liquid carbon into the ground, in trees or in water. \u201cI like fizzy water, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing lots of CO2 in ground water,\u201d Ulmer joked. Geoengineering also includes methods for reducing the amount of sunlight. The panelists discussed\u00a0 releasing aerosol particles \u00a0or spraying seawater into the atmosphere to form clouds, and launching mirrors into orbit to redirect sunlight. The planet\u2019s temperature depends on how much sunlight it receives, so changing that amount can keep the planet cooler. Changing the amount of sunlight is more readily deployable than removing carbon dioxide, Ackerman said. Synthetic volcanic clouds or clouds that hang over the ocean would reflect sunlight back into space, lowering the temperature. \u2018Nobody wants to do this\u2019 Geoengineering the atmosphere isn\u2019t something to be\u00a0 rushed into , however. According to Ackerman, there is no active research program in the United States or Europe that is studying the consequences of geoengineering. Bernie Sanders grills EPA nominee Scott Pruitt on climate change \u201cNobody wants to do this,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201cNo one wants to fund it.\u201d With no funding for trying to understand how any of the proposed methods could affect the atmosphere, those ideas are immediately dismissed from the realm of possibility. That needs to change if scientists plan to actively take steps to reduce carbon dioxide, the panelists said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go out and start this tomorrow, at least not in any responsible way,\u201d Ackerman said. He said that he firmly supports the need to do more research before deploying any systems to change the environment. That includes studying what kinds of unintended consequences could come from geoengineering. The panel members seemed certain that manipulating the climate on large scales could lead to problems on smaller scales: Changing the entire planet\u2019s climate could result in catastrophes at regional levels. \u201cWe can have a solution that works globally and gets the average temperature down to a safer range,\u201d Grinspoon said. It\u2019s possible, however, that such a solution could kick off a monsoon and cause a disaster for a lot of people, he said. \u2018More important than astronomy\u2019 The panel members agreed that geoengineering was only a short-term solution to help scale down the planet\u2019s temperature before it reaches catastrophic levels \u2014 it\u2019s not a long-term, permanent solution. \u201cSolar-radiation management is not a substitute for mitigation,\u201d Long said. Adding particles into the air could have a number of\u00a0 important ramifications , including affecting how well astronomers can view the night sky. According to Lowenthal, some studies have shown that adding clouds to the atmosphere can increase the brightening of the night sky by as much as\u00a0 25 percent . But that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be done. \u201cFixing global warming is more important than astronomy,\u201d Grinspoon said. He expressed the hope that such a solution might inspire more astronomers to invest time in promoting climate change. Even without that impetus, he felt that the need to address the long-term consequences of global warming outweighed the potential benefits of studying the heavens. \u201cThere\u2019s no question to my mind that saving our civilization and many other species is more important than our ability to do ground-based astronomy for a few decades,\u201d Grinspoon said.

Celeste Greig of Northridge, left, and Nancy Eisenhart of Woodland Hills were among jubilant Californians who attended the inauguration of President Trump in Washington. (Seema Mehta / Los Angeles Times) Seema Mehta Contact Reporter Shannon, a 48-year-old accountant from Encino, didn\u2019t tell her co-workers she was traveling all the way across the country to get a great view of President Donald Trump \u2019s swearing-in. She told them she was going skiing.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list,\u201d\u00a0said Shannon, who didn\u2019t want The Times to use her last name, lest she be outed. Standing amid\u00a0throngs of like-minded people celebrating a Republican win, Shannon marveled at her freedom to be herself. \u201cI can wear a Trump sweatshirt without getting hoots and hollers. In L.A., you can\u2019t even put a bumper sticker on your car \u2014 it would be keyed in a second.\u201d For California Republicans , Trump\u2019s improbable election was a rare taste of victory. The GOP has not won\u00a0a statewide election\u00a0in more than a decade. The party failed to field a viable candidate for the Senate in 2016, the first time a seat in the upper house had been vacant in nearly a quarter century. Voter registration for the party that gave birth to Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon appears to be at a historic low. \u201cVictories like this are few and far between and very sweet for us, much more so than someone from Texas who is used to winning all the time,\u201d said Harmeet Dhillon, a Republican National Committee member from San Francisco who attended the swearing-in ceremony\u00a0with her husband and parents. The ceremony was chilly and rainy, but that didn\u2019t dampen the rally-like\u00a0mood\u00a0among\u00a0the GOP faithful ready to have their moment. \u201cThe last time I was able to celebrate an inauguration was when [former California Gov. Arnold] Schwarzenegger was inaugurated. That was many years ago, and now, it\u2019s correct, we are certainly not used to winning victories at this level.\u201d The number of Californians who ventured to the nation\u2019s capital for the festivities is unknown. Unlike the heyday under President Reagan \u2014 when the official California ball was the most coveted ticket in town and\u00a0attended by Hollywood royalty \u2014\u00a0there is no longer a central gathering spot. But this week, there were several events aimed at the state\u2019s visitors. More than 140 Californians bought seated tickets for\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s All American Ball, the official ball of the Virginia GOP. The state\u2019s well-heeled donors dined Thursday at the Lincoln Club of Northern California\u2019s soiree at the exclusive Cosmos Club on Embassy Row. Earlier Thursday, more than 600 Californians and expats living in Washington attended a lunch at the Ritz-Carlton featuring the state\u2019s wines, produce and entertainers organized by the nonpartisan California State Society. Members of Congress held receptions and dinners throughout the week.\u00a0Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher \u2019s formal ball at the Library of Congress was expected to be a popular post-inauguration fete on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s better. It\u2019s nice to be amongst all friends,\u201d said Cynthia Bryant of Elk Grove, the state GOP\u2019s executive director, comparing the nation\u2019s capital with her home state. \u201cEveryone in D.C. right now is a Trump supporter. I find it exciting because there\u2019s a lot of people getting along, celebrating the victory. It seems like such a happy time.\u201d Given the distance between California and Washington, it has\u00a0also been an incredibly expensive time. Tickets to balls cost a couple hundred dollars, airfare cost\u00a0several hundred more and basic hotels started in the high three-figures per night. Many Californians stayed in the capital for a few days to enjoy the sights\u00a0in addition to the inaugural festivities, which usually require\u00a0renting or buying ball gowns and tuxedos. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Celeste Greig, a longtime GOP activist from Northridge who shared a basic hotel room with two others for $700 a night near the White House. This was the fifth Republican inauguration the 69-year-old has attended. \u201cThis is my Christmas gift from me to me, my Mother\u2019s Day gift from me to me and my birthday gift from me to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s history, it\u2019s being part of history, and the fact that he was not supposed to be our nominee, the fact he was not supposed to win the November election, the fact that he is so hated by some people and loved by others\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it\u2019s history,\u201d she said. Trump was not Greig\u2019s first choice; she preferred former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. She also liked Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But once Trump became the nominee, Greig and her friend, Nancy Eisenhart of Woodland Hills, went all out volunteering for him. They\u00a0traveled twice to Nevada on their own dime to try to sway voters in that battleground state. \u201cThat\u2019s when we saw America join us, and it was beautiful,\u201d\u00a0said Eisenhart, tearing up on the chilly grounds of the nation\u2019s capital waiting for Trump\u2019s swearing-in as she recalled the diverse group that supported Trump in Nevada, including minorities, the disabled and the elderly. Trump ultimately lost the state to Clinton by 2.4 percentage points. Still, the retirees were not alone in bragging about the amount of energy volunteers in California expended on Trump\u2019s behalf. Though both sides knew Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would overwhelmingly win California\u2019s election, Trump got nearly 4.5 million votes in the state, along with many volunteers who called or traveled\u00a0to more competitive states on his behalf. \u201cIn Sacramento, our call center made more phone calls than the Trump Tower. Not everyone realized that about California, what California did for the Trump campaign,\u201d said West Walker, a middle school teacher from Stockton, as he watched a Trump celebration concert featuring Lee Greenwood, Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down on Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see common people with a common passion who are more about the United States as opposed to dividing the country,\u201d Walker said, recalling that California Republicans were beaten during a Trump rally in San Jose before the state\u2019s primary. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the ones attacking other people. We\u2019ve been victimized; we\u2019ve been literally beaten up when we go to a rally to hear a Trump speech. People [in California] are afraid to come out and speak. So it\u2019s nice to see people with a common passion.\u201d Caption Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Caption Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Morning after inauguration, thousands gather for Women's March in Washington Caption Trump supporters react on Inauguration Day Trump supporters react on Inauguration Day Trump supporters react on Inauguration Day Caption President Donald Trump's inaugural speech Donald Trump gave his first address as president of the United States at his inauguration Jan. 20, 2017.

    "text": "Rick Perry Regrets Call to Close Energy Department By CORAL DAVENPORT Photo Rick Perry at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Rick Perry , the former Texas governor and President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee as energy secretary, said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the Energy Department in the past. He addressed his awkward history on the issue up front, telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after \u201cbeing briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,\u201d he no longer believed, as he said while running for president in 2011, that it should be eliminated. Mr. Perry also offered a full-throated reversal of his views on the science of human-caused climate change , which he called a \u201ccontrived, phony mess\u201d in a 2010 book. \u201cI believe the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-made activity. The question is: How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn\u2019t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy or American jobs?\u201d Mr. Trump, by contrast, has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and has continued to express doubts about established climate science. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from Mr. Trump on nuclear weapons policy, the Energy Department\u2019s chief portfolio. Mr. Trump has said the United States must \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand\u201d its nuclear capability, \u201c Let it be an arms race ,\u201d he said. But Mr. Perry, asked by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a \u201cdangerous idea,\u201d replied, \u201cI think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world.\u201d He added, \u201cI think nonproliferation is a good thing.\u201d Asked if he would support the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 which Mr. Trump has derided and which was largely negotiated by the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz \u2014 Mr. Perry said he had not received classified briefings on it. \u201cIf D.O.E. has a role to make sure that Iranians are living up to the deal, message delivered, sir,\u201d Mr. Perry said to Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Video Perry on Energy: \u2018I Regret Recommending Its Elimination\u2019 Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for the Department of Energy, Rick Perry, answered questions on his past statements about the department and on climate change. By REUTERS. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Last month, when Mr. Trump offered Mr. Perry the job of energy secretary, he accepted with the understanding that the role would be largely focused on promoting American energy development, according to people who have briefed him. Only later did he learn that the agency\u2019s central portfolio is the oversight and management of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex, as well as 17 national scientific laboratories. \u201cThis confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,\u201d Mr. Perry said, citing his conversations with Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist. He highlighted his experience as an Air Force pilot from 1972 to 1977 as among his qualifications to oversee the nuclear weapons complex. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Democrats pressed him sharply on his views on climate science, noting that the Energy Department is a major science agency, with thousands of research scientists across the country. Democrats expressed concern that his past views, so at odds with established mainstream science, could be a serious impediment. Advertisement They also pressed him on reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s team is considering making cuts to the Energy Department\u2019s offices of energy efficiency, renewable energy and fossil energy. The last is focused on research to lower planet-warming carbon emissions. Mr. Perry said he was unaware of such reports. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll have the same experience I had and forget that they said that,\u201d he said to laughter, referring to the moment in a 2011 presidential debate when, asked which agencies he wanted to eliminate, he could not recall the name of the Energy Department. What Mr. Perry later called his \u201coops\u201d moment was widely seen as sinking his campaign. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said, \u201cLike many of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned by some of the things that Governor Perry has said in the past about climate science.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Department of Energy\u2019s scientific horsepower is key to understanding these trends. I hope you can understand there is widespread anxiety about President-elect Trump\u2019s intention to dismantle these scientific capabilities or simply just starve them for resources.\u201d Ms. Cantwell pushed Mr. Perry on whether he would protect the agency\u2019s budget for climate science. \u201cI\u2019m going to protect all the science, whether it\u2019s related to climate and all other aspects of what we are doing,\u201d he replied. Ms. Cantwell also asked Mr. Perry about a questionnaire sent to Energy Department employees by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team that appeared to target the agency\u2019s climate science research. Mr. Perry disavowed the questionnaire, saying it was sent out before he was selected as the nominee. \u201cI didn\u2019t approve it, I don\u2019t approve it, I didn\u2019t need the information, I don\u2019t want that information,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I manage.\u201d The hearing was leavened with some humor. Asked by Mr. Franken, who had earlier pushed him sharply on nuclear weapons and climate change in his Senate office, \u201cDid you enjoy meeting me?\u201d Mr. Perry responded, \u201cI hope you are as much fun on the dais as you were on your couch,\u201d before adding, \u201cMay I rephrase that, sir?\u201d \u201cPlease. Please,\u201d Mr. Franken replied. \u201cOh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord.\u201d \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve found our \u2018 Saturday Night Live \u2019 sound bite,\u201d Mr. Perry said.

    "text": "Poor, Chronically Sick, Unemployed Most Likely to Lose Coverage if ACA Repealed, Study Finds By Gillian Mohney Jan 20, 2017, 1:11 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH New Study Examines Those Potentially Affected by ACA Repeal 0 Shares Email With Republican lawmakers promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act under the new administration, researchers have been working to understand how people who gained coverage after the ACA's passage will be affected. Those most at risk for losing coverage are more likely to be poor, have a chronic illness or be unemployed, according to a study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine . The groups more likely to lose coverage also visited their doctors more often, according to the study, which examined demographic data of people who had coverage or tax credits thanks to ACA provisions. Dr. Pinar Karaca-Mandic, lead author of the study, told ABC News that the goal was get hard data on the people who would be affected by a repeal of the ACA. \"This is not a simulation exercise,\" Karaca-Mandic said. \"We used data from the National Health Interview Survey.\" Canada Approves Prescription Heroin to Combat Opioid Crisis Approximately 20 million people have gained health care coverage after the ACA was passed in 2010, according to the study. Currently, 10.4 million individuals have private insurance policies acquired through an exchange. Of these individuals, 84 percent had incomes that were 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Individuals who make less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for tax credits to help pay for health insurance. The federal poverty level income is $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four. It remains unclear if repealing the ACA and replacing it with an alternate plan will imperil these individuals coverage in the future, the study authors said. The researchers from multiple institutions, including the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, examined federal data to understand who would be affected if the tax credits provided by the ACA were stopped and Medicaid expansion was repealed. To understand the demographics of the people who would be affected by a repeal of the ACA, researchers looked at three cohorts of financial status. These cohorts were adults who get tax credits because they made less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, childless adults who became eligible for Medicaid coverage after the ACA's passage, and parents or caretakers enrolled in Medicaid whose income was between 50 to 139 percent of the federal poverty level. The people most likely to be affected by an ACA repeal were minorities, the poor, unemployed people and people with chronic medical conditions, researchers found. They also found that these people were more likely to have been to an emergency room at least once or have seen a doctor 10 or more times in the previous year. Christine Eibner, an economist and professor at Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, California, who has conducted other research on the ACA, said the new JAMA study echoes past predictions on who would be affected by a repeal of the ACA. \"It substantiates the model estimates,\" Eibner told ABC News. \"This takes actual data and looks at who was enrolled.\" Dr. Darien Sutton-Ramsey is an emergency medicine physician at Bellevue Hospital in New York. He is a resident in the ABC News Medical Unit. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Gen. James Mattis, Gen. John Kelly confirmed for Trump Cabinet spots Published               January 20, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 As President Trump\u2019s limousine drove the Washington, D.C. parade route on Friday, the Senate was busy at work stocking Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2013 though not fully. Gen. James Mattis was confirmed as Secretary of Defense and Gen. John Kelly was confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security\u00a0in a pair of Friday evening votes. Mattis was approved by a vote of 98-1. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was the lone vote against. Kelly was approved 88-11. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., did not vote on either Kelly or Mattis. Sessions has been nominated to be Attorney General. Trump signed the commissions for Mattis and Kelly later Friday. Vice President Mike Pence swore in both Generals. TRUMP OUTLINES NEW VISION FOR AMERICA Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also tried to\u00a0begin debate on Rep. Mike Pompeo\u2019s nomination as CIA Director following the Mattis and Kelly votes, but Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., objected. Instead, the Senate was set to begin the Pompeo debate on Monday. \u201cI am pleased by the confirmation votes of Generals Mattis and Kelly,\" Trump said in a statement. \"These uniquely qualified leaders will immediately begin the important work of rebuilding our military, defending our nation and securing our borders. I am proud to have these two American heroes join my administration. \"I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay.\u201d Noting the Senate approved seven of former President Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees on the first day of his administration in 2009, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chastised Democrats for refusing to consider confirmation of more of Trump\u2019s nominees. McCain said the only difference between 2009 and 2017 is that now \u201cwe\u2019ve got a world on fire,\u201d citing Syrian refugees and Russia\u2019s aggressive actions. \u201cWe need a new Director of the CIA more than ever,\u201d McCain said. Wyden, however, countered that the Senate would not be Trump\u2019s \u201crubber stamp.\u201d Trump earlier Friday signed into law a waiver allowing Mattis to serve as Defense Secretary. The bill passed by Congress last week granted Mattis a one-time exception from federal law barring former U.S. service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis, 66, retired from the Marine Corps in 2013 after a 41-year career in uniform. FORRESTER: 4 LESSONS MATTIS TAUGHT ME During that same signing ceremony, Trump joked with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about Pompeo\u2019s confirmation. \"Mike Pompeo. Great. They tell me he's going to be approved momentarily, but you never know with this place,\" Trump said. Schumer retorted: \"Depends how you define momentarily \u2014 soon.\" There was little debate about the confirmation of Kelly, who is widely respected by Democrats and Republicans alike. As the former head of the military's Southern Command, based in South Florida, he routinely worked with the Department of Homeland Security to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling. Kelly joined the Marine Corps in 1970 and served three tours in Iraq. He was also the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in November 2010 in Afghanistan. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

(Jan. 20) AP Two parked cars parked on K Street on fire as police line up against protesters on inauguration day in Washington D.C. (Photo: Sean Dougherty, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014 Protesters and police clashed in\u00a0a section in northwest Washington\u00a0Friday during Donald Trump's historic inauguration in a rolling series of confrontations that injured six police officers and left store windows and ATMs smashed. Police used pepper spray to control the crowd, some of whom were armed with crowbars and hammers, authorities said. A total of 217 people were arrested by early evening in what were the most violent episodes of the day involving protesters and police.\u00a0Police said six officers suffered minor injuries, including three head injuries caused by rocks and other projectiles. Columns of officers outfitted in heavy riot gear smothered a violent late-morning eruption, when about 90 were arrested. Only hours later, the quiet turned to chaos near the intersection of 13th and K streets, just a few blocks off the inaugural parade route. Police rushed protesters who had begun to hurl broken bricks, tossed newspaper racks and sidewalk trash containers into the street, setting them on fire. Police responded with pepper spray and flash grenades, with detonations echoing off surrounding office buildings, as police helicopters circled above.\u00a0One heavily-damaged limousine was swarmed by protesters at one point\u00a0and later set ablaze. D.C. interim Police Chief Peter Newsham described the damage as significant to local businesses and vehicles. He said a core group of up to 500 protesters was believed to have been involved in the series of daylong eruptions. All those arrested were charged with rioting, he said. \"Unfortunately, we had a small group of protesters who wanted to disrupt the inauguration,'' Newsham said. \"They caused significant damage to a number of blocks in our city.'' D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that while \u201chundreds and hundreds\u2019\u2019 of protesters demonstrated peacefully, much of the damage was caused by smaller groups bent on destruction. \u201cWe will not tolerate the destruction of our neighborhoods, and we will not tolerate violence against our officers,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said. Patrick McGuire, 37, was struck in protests at 13th and K streets NW at Franklin Square in D.C. \u00a0(Photo: Emily Brown/USA TODAY) Patrick McGuire, 37, of Baltimore, said he was was hit\u00a0point blank\u00a0by something thrown by police. Multiple groups of protesters had converged quickly, he said, and the situation escalated quickly. \"The pain is so great, you have no expectation of the pain ever ending,\" he said. The violence, however, was largely contained to a three-to-four-block area, while the main protest site\u00a0at the Navy Memorial near the inaugural parade route was largely peaceful. But the slow pace of security checks there kept many protesters from accessing the site. Nevertheless, protesters yelled in defiance as Trump was sworn in, with some carrying signs of support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\u00a0Within moments of the 45th president being sworn in, rain began to fall on the crowd. Small groups of protesters popped up at various security checkpoints across the spectator zones, attempting to block entry. One group, affiliated with Black Lives Matter, chained themselves to metal barricades. But police said no entrances were completely shutdown. Robert Hrifko, 62, a member of Bikers for Trump, said he was struck by a rock while trying to break up clash between police and anti-Trump demonstrators. \u00a0(Photo: Kevin Johnson/USA TODAY) Robert Hrifko, 62, a member of Bikers For Trump, appeared to suffer the most visible injury from the late-morning clash in the city's northwest section, as blood streamed from a cut under his left eye. The Florida man said he was attempting to assist police when he was hit with a rock by an anti-Trump protester.\u00a0He said the encounter devolved into a chair-throwing free-for-all. \"It was just crazy, man,\" Hrifko said, holding a block of ice to his injured face. Police quickly moved in and cornered a group of protesters on L Street, between 12th and 13th. Other protesters chanting, \"Let them go!\" shouted from behind crime scene tape as officers prepared to make arrests. Shortly before the encounter, limo driver Luis Villarroel of Virginia said he was dropping off passengers near the Washington Post building when he saw \"hundreds of masked men\" coming his way. \"They threw food at me,\" he said, adding that they pounded the vehicle and then threw a flare inside the car. \"This is my business. Why are you destroying\u00a0my stuff? It took me years to build,\" he recounted after the crowd left. On the next corner at a Wells Fargo bank at 13th and I St NW, glass windows were shattered and ATMs smashed. Luis Villarroel from Virginia said protesters suddenly began destroying his limo. \u00a0(Photo: Emily Brown/USA TODAY) \"At least I'm alive,\" Villarroel said. Late Thursday, raucous protesters had squared off against local police outside a meeting of Trump supporters. A 34-year-old D.C.\u00a0man was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit assault after an incident outside the National Press Club. Protesters massed there to demonstrate against the \"DeploraBall,'' an event drawing some of the president-elect's most ardent supporters. Washington, D.C., police said \"several individuals'' had planned to disrupt the event, resulting in the arrest of Scott Ryan Charney of Northwest, D.C. An undisclosed number of others also were being sought by police. Newsham said that police were prepared for the demonstrations, but would not tolerate\u00a0unlawful disruptions. \"There will be some people who will have views different than yours,'' Newsham said. \"But this is Washington, D.C. People agree to disagree.'' Organizers of protests said they\u2019re kicking off a modern-day resistance. Julie Godshaw, a 27-year-old social work student from Queens, said her goal\u00a0was simply \u201cto be heard and to represent those who can\u2019t be heard.\u201d But she said this is the start of her commitment to organizing and protesting against Trump\u2019s policies. Police and protesters clashed on K Street Friday afternoon. \u00a0(Photo: Kevin Johnson/USA TODAY) \u201cI will fight for you and I will love you with every ounce of my soul,\u201d read her sign, which she said is directed at minority communities that could face the brunt of issues in the new administration. Trump takes office with one of the lowest approval ratings of any occupant of the Oval Office, although he has called those polls \u201cphony\u201d and \u201crigged.\"\u00a0The sound\u00a0of protests pulsating\u00a0through\u00a0the nation's capital demonstrated\u00a0the breadth of concern among those groups who feel threatened: minorities, labor,\u00a0women,\u00a0LGBTQ,\u00a0environmental activists and others.

Elections matter. Exhibit A:\u00a0Moments after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, the White House website was overhauled to wipe away all vestiges of former president Barack Obama's priorities. Here are the big changes\u00a0that caught people's attention: 1. Got rid of key environmental rules The Trump White House website now says \"President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.\" These are two\u00a0contentious Obama administration rules that President Trump can't simply undo by himself; both will require either congressional action to change the underlying law or a long regulatory\u00a0process to reverse the policy. 2. Gone quiet on gay issues The Obama White House legacy website includes a section on Obama's effort to preserve gay and lesbian rights. \"President Obama has led the fight to protect everyone \u2014\u00a0no matter who you are, where you're from, what you look like, or whom you love,\" it says. The Trump White House website says \"Sorry, no results found for LGBT,\" and the only \"gay\" result is a reference to the \"gay friendliness\" of Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge, wife of President Calvin Coolidge. 3. Civil rights are no longer on the list The Obama White House listed \"civil rights\" as the first among \"top issues\" on its website. The new Trump White House website does not mention civil rights at all\u00a0but does list as a top issue \"Standing up for our law enforcement community.\" Specifically, the site says, \"The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong ... Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter.\" 4. A military build-up is coming The new White House website commits to \"making our military strong again,\" including getting rid of the across-the-board budget cuts known as \"the sequester\" and investing in ballistic missile defense \u2014 long a priority of Republican administrations. Trump's website promises to \"develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system to protect against missile-based attacks from states like Iran and North Korea.\" 5. The site is no longer accessible A little button at the bottom of the Obama White House website provided information for people with disabilities \u2014 including a White House video tour in sign language and an explanation of links on the site that allowed users to use audible screen readers, closed captioning and other services.

Three-thousand members of local, state and federal law enforcement \u2014 backed by 5,000 National Guard members and police officers from as far away as New Jersey \u2014 patrolled the streets as the evening's festivities got under way and the legions of protesters still seething over the Manhattan mogul's unexpected victory threatened more disruptions. PHOTOS: As Trump Takes Oath, Protesters Pledge to Keep Fighting Acting Police Chief Peter Newsham said that by around 6:30 p.m. ET things had calmed down, but authorities were still monitoring several groups. At the same time, police are preparing for the Women's March on Washington set for Saturday that is expected to draw 200,000 protesters \u2014 a number that inaugural historian Jim Bendat said could break records.

Also, demonstrators torched a limousine, police at the scene said. All of the 217 people arrested on Friday were charged with rioting, Newsham said.

One man was accidentally knocked over by protesters, a law enforcement officer told NBC News. He was bleeding from the back of his head as paramedics helped him onto a stretcher. Friday's violence came after a night of chaotic clashes between police and anti-Trump protesters. And it wasn't just limited to downtown D.C. Interstate 695, which runs through the capital, ground to a standstill on Friday afternoon when protesters holding signs and waving flags stopped traffic. To keep protesters out, several security checkpoints were set up around Capitol Hill to screen ceremony ticket holders and keep demonstrators out. Quickly, these became flashpoints of fury where Trump supporters and opponents came face. Play ",

    "text": "Accused Orlando Killer Allegedly Stood Over Wounded Officer and Repeatedly Fired By EMILY SHAPIRO Jan 20, 2017, 4:15 PM ET 0 Shares Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP Photo WATCH Accused Orlando Cop Killer Appears in Court 0 Shares Email A store's cameras allegedly show accused killer Markeith Loyd standing over Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton as she was wounded and lying on her back, repeatedly firing and mortally wounding her, according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed today. The warrant described the alleged shooting that occurred around 7:15 a.m. on Jan. 9, while Clayton was on duty and at a Walmart. A witness, not identified in the warrant, approached Clayton and told her Loyd, who was wanted for the Dec. 13 murder of his ex-girlfriend, was in the store, according to the warrant. Clayton requested backup and while another patrol car was on its way, announced on the police radio that she was in \"foot pursuit,\" after which the sounds of gunshots were heard. Walmart camera footage shows the suspect running between two concrete pillars outside the store as Clayton pursued him, the warrant said. As the suspect took cover behind one pillar, Clayton ran around the pillar and saw the suspect pointing a gun at her. Clayton drew her gun and changed direction, and the suspect fired three times, hitting her once in the hip. Clayton stumbled and fell to the ground, but rolled onto her back and pointed her gun at the suspect approaching her. \"The suspect advances toward her with his right arm outstretched and repeatedly firing his gun\" at her as she was on her back, the warrant said. Clayton fired back at the suspect seven times as he stood over her firing, the warrant says, adding that the suspect then ran around her with his gun pointing at her head, firing several more shots quickly before running to a vehicle and leaving the area. The warrant said the entire exchange of gunfire lasted about six seconds. The medical examiner determined that Clayton died from a gunshot wound to her neck. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said that after Loyd first shot Clayton, he had a clear and unobstructed path to his car but chose instead to run over to where Clayton was. Mina said Clayton was still alive when, he said, Loyd stood \"over her defenseless body\" and fired multiple shots at her, killing her. Clayton was a police master sergeant when she was killed. She was promoted to lieutenant on the day of her funeral, Orlando police said. Slain Officer Was Mom Who 'Deeply Cared' for Orlando Community Loyd was combative from the start in today's court appearance for Clayton's alleged murder. He interrupted the judge as she tried to read his charges and refused to answer questions. Loyd -- appearing with a bandage over his left eye, his hands cuffed and officers holding each of his arms -- said to Judge Jeanette Dejuras Bigney in the state's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court in Orlando, \"My name is Markeith Loyd, who are you? Lady in the black dress, who are you?\" He appeared without legal representation. When asked whether he wants a public defender, he again asked for the judge's name. \"State your name for the record,\" he said. In connection with Clayton's death, Loyd was charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder with a firearm, carjacking with a firearm, aggravated assault and wearing a bulletproof vest. The judge today held him on no bond. Loyd did not enter a plea. Loyd was caught by police Tuesday after a nine-day manhunt; he was wanted for allegedly killing Clayton and for allegedly killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon in December. When Loyd appeared in court Thursday in connection with Dixon's death, he said to the judge, \"Y'all making up s---, like I just went in there and shot this girl, endangering my family ... Y'all portray this s--- to the news people like I just went in there and shot this girl.\" While leaving the courtroom Thursday, Loyd said to Judge Bigney, \"F--- you.\" In connection with Dixon's death, Loyd was charged with one count of first-degree murder with a firearm, one count of unlawful killing of an unborn child, one count of attempted first-degree murder with a firearm and two counts of aggravated assault with a firearm. The judge ordered him held without bond. Loyd did not enter a plea. The judge said Thursday that Loyd would have a hearing in one week to determine counsel for him in the case over Dixon's death. Orlando police on Thursday released video of Loyd's capture. In the video -- which was shot from a police chopper above the scene -- Loyd is seen crawling away from a house and toward officers by the roadway. After he stopped crawling, the officers approached him while he lay prone in the street. At least one officer then appeared to kick Loyd in the head. At that point, the chopper camera panned away. Mina called the camera pulling away \"concerning\" and said the apparent use of force will be investigated. Mina said Loyd suffered a fractured left orbital bone and damage to his eye. He was hospitalized until late Wednesday. When asked at a press conference if kicking the suspect was necessary, Mina said, \"The officers were very concerned about what was underneath him. After they handcuffed him and searched him, pulled off his body armor, he had a large bag of ammunition.\" Mina called Loyd a \"cold-blooded, ruthless killer,\" and said Loyd's \"long and violent history\" will be factored into the use-of-force investigation. Mina said that when reviewing the use of force, officers are judged regarding the \"totality of circumstances\" and that officials will try to determine what an objectively reasonable officer would have done in light of those circumstances. Officers involved in the arrest are still on full duty, Mina said. According to the arrest warrant affidavit, in an interview after he was caught, Loyd said of the Dixon shooting that he and Dixon were in a tussle when Dixon's brother attacked him. Loyd said Dixon also had a gun. When asked about Clayton's murder, Loyd said, \"she pulled her gun out first,\" according to the arrest warrant affidavit. Loyd said the shooting might not have happened if Clayton had \"waited for backup,\" according to the warrant. Rounds from one of the weapons recovered with Loyd on Tuesday matched rounds from the scenes of Dixon's shooting and Clayton's shooting, according to the warrant. Meanwhile, an Orlando Police Department spokesperson said today that it appears someone vandalized Clayton's police vehicle Thursday night or early this morning. Words were scrawled in blue across parts of the parked car, which has been sitting strewn with flowers and flags as a memorial to the fallen officer. The police department said it was hard to decipher what the words say. Unbelievably sad someone would vandalize Lt. Debra Clayton's vehicle. pic.twitter.com/2yairat1Rq \u2014 Orlando Police (@OrlandoPolice) January 20, 2017 The incident is being investigated, the police said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Still, the mood at the party in downtown Moscow was subdued compared to outbursts of joy at the news of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November.\u00a0 Revelers on Friday watched Mr. Trump make his\u00a0 inauguration speech in silence, and no one stood up for the American anthem, although the host suggested that all Americans should do so.\u00a0 Meanwhile, there was no comment from the Russian president, CBS News\u2019 Palmer reported from Moscow. Earlier on Friday, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Putin was unlikely to watch the inauguration live, but catch it later on the news. \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d said Peskov, \u201cis not our soulmate.\u201d That was a frosty change from the surprisingly warm endorsement Putin gave Mr. Trump during the campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s a colorful and talented man,\u201d Putin had said. \u201cAnd he says he wants to move to deeper relations. How can we not welcome that?\u201d At one Moscow nightclub, different from the trendy loft where others were celebrating, several dozen people began toasting Mr. Trump late Thursday. Willi Tokarev, 82, a singer who emigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1970s and later became a music legend in Russia, topped the entertainment bill with his song \u201cTrumplissimo America!\u201d\u00a0 Entertainer Willi Tokarev, center, an 82-year-old Russian emigre to the U.S. appears during a nightclub party entitled \u201cTrumplissimo America!\u201d in Moscow, Russia, on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017. Close AP Photo/Ivan Sekretarev Mr. Trump\u2019s praise for Putin has raised expectations that he could move to normalize ties, although Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t articulated a clear policy and some of his Cabinet nominees have made hawkish statements on Russia. Leonid Slutsky, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of parliament, expressed hope that Mr. Trump will move to establish constructive ties with Moscow, but cautioned there is no \u201cmagic button\u201d to instantly achieve that. \u201cWe expect a slow but steady revival of our relations,\u201d he said. Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, predicted that Moscow will face a pragmatic but very tough partner in Mr. Trump. \u201cRussia\u2019s potential is incomparable to that of the United States,\u201d he said, adding that Moscow will have to apply a lot of skills \u201cto play from the position of weakness and not lose.\u201d Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov voiced hope that Mr. Trump will work with Putin on solving the Ukrainian crisis and other problems, but warned against expectations of quick progress. \u201cDifficulties will remain,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Judah Adunbi, 63, was incapacitated after a confrontation with two officers who apparently mistook him for someone wanted by police. In fact, Adunbi has volunteered as a member of an independent advisory group for Avon and Somerset police, a panel established to improve relations between police and the local communities of color. A neighbor recorded the incident on video, shown above. \"Avon & Somerset police officers used the Taser on a 63-year-old man in Colston Road, Easton at around 9.10am,\" the Independent Police Complaints Commission said in a statement released Friday . \"A complaint from a member of the public who witnessed the aftermath of the incident was voluntarily referred to the IPCC by the force on 19 January.\" We've begun an independent investigation into the actions of @ASPolice after a man was tasered in Bristol https://t.co/mbcy865A6H \u2014 IPCC (@IPCCNews) January 20, 2017 In the neighbor's video, two officers are seen stopping Adunbi outside his home as he was walking his dog. They refer to a wanted man they are looking for, and ask him for his name. Adunbi refuses to give his name several times as he attempts to enter his front gate. Article continues after sponsorship Like everyone in the U.K., Adunbi has the right to withhold his name when stopped by officers, according to Avon and Somerset Police guidelines . After a break in the footage, the video shows one of the officers apparently pulling Adunbi out of the gate by the arm. Immediately after that scuffle, one of the officers uses her Taser on Adunbi. Once on his back, Adunbi appears to toss his wallet to the ground beside them, telling the officers to look at his ID as they handcuff him. \"You are under arrest for assault,\" one of the officers tells him. The charges were later dropped, the BBC reports . \"The way I fell, on the back of my head, I was just paralyzed,\" Adunbi later told the British broadcast network ITV . \"I thought that was it. I thought they were taking my life.\" He says his fear stemmed partly from a similar confrontation with police. In 2009, \"he won a wrongful arrest case against Avon and Somerset Police and was awarded compensation,\" according to the BBC. Since then, Adunbi has been a volunteer with the Bristol IAG, one of several groups that serve \"a vital role in helping us build trust, confidence and better relationships, especially with our diverse communities,\" according to the Avon and Somerset police . \"It's a little distasteful in my mouth,\" Adunbi told The Guardian . \"To know that one of the founder members of the independent advisory group, which was created some years ago in order to improve the relationship between the Afro-Caribbean community and the constabulary, and to be treated like this, it's difficult.\" Chief Superintendent Jon Reilly, Bristol area commander for the Avon and Somerset police, says the force voluntarily referred the complaint about Saturday's incident to the watchdog IPCC. He said he would like to answer further questions but could not, given the ongoing investigation. According to ITV, he added: \"I want to reassure the community the whole incident was captured on body-worn camera. Both officers were wearing it. \"And we're determined to understand what happened. That's why we've referred it, voluntarily, to the Independent Police Complaints Commission for them to assess whether an independent review is necessary. \"We work really hard to work positively with all communities and I can see no reason why that should change.\" The IPCC has asked members of the Bristol community to come forward if they have any further information. The group said it has not yet spoken to the two officers involved. ",

Gregorio Borgia/AP hide caption toggle caption Gregorio Borgia/AP On Friday, Italian rescue helicopters approach the area of the Hotel Rigopiano, which was buried by an avalanche on Wednesday, to help airlift out some people found alive in the debris. Gregorio Borgia/AP Updated at 12:45 p.m. ET At least 10 survivors, including children, have been found inside the rubble of a ski hotel in central Italy that was engulfed by an avalanche on Wednesday, according to fire officials \u2014 and several of them have been safely removed from the remnants of the building. About 30 people had been in the hotel when the disaster struck. Many still remain missing, Christopher Livesay reports for NPR from Rome, while four others have been confirmed dead. The death toll is expected to rise. Tourists staying at the hotel had checked out and were waiting for roads to be cleared when an avalanche, possibly triggered by earthquakes on Wednesday, swept over and into the hotel. Two men had been outside the building when the avalanche began. One of them, Giampiero Parete, had gone to his car to pick up medicine for his wife and soon made frantic calls for help, saying his wife and children were trapped inside the resort. Article continues after sponsorship Avalanche Buries Italian Ski Resort; Rescue Operations Underway Both men were found alive \u2014 but until Friday morning, there had been no sign of life inside the snow-covered resort. On Friday, rescuers were overheard by The Associated Press saying over the radio that they had found people alive. Luca Cari, the spokesman for Italy's national firefighting service, told both Reuters and The Associated Press that rescuers found 10 people in the building on Friday. After talking with the trapped people, firefighters and other rescuers began to free them from the snow and debris. The ANSA news agency says rescue operations proceeded in two stages, with six people being extracted \u2014 including two children \u2014 and then two more people. The AP, however, says that Cari reports only a \"few\" survivors have actually been freed from the building, and rescue operations are ongoing to bring the rest to safety. The wire service reports that the \"incredible\" discovery boosted the spirits of rescue crews: \"Video released by rescuers showed a boy, wearing blue snow pants and a matching ski shirt, emerging from the structure and crews mussing his hair in celebration. \"Next was a woman with a long ponytail wearing red snow pants. 'Brava Brava!' the rescuers cheered. The survivors appeared fully alert and walking on their own. Both were helped down to a stretcher for the helicopter ride out.\" The rescue was followed by an emotional reunion, according to Italian media. The woman was reportedly the wife of Giampiero Parete, the man who had stepped out to the car for medicine when the avalanche struck and called for help, and the boy was his son. \"Rescuers said the mother indicated her 6-year-old daughter Ludovica was also alive amid the debris nearby and rescue workers immediately set to work to find her, too,\" the AP reports. \"Italian media said Parete and wife and son hugged at Pescara hospital, where the woman and child were taken, apparently in good condition. From very early on, rescue crews knew that at least some people had survived the initial disaster \u2014 a few people buried alive sent text messages, according to reports in Italian media on Thursday. \"Italian daily La Repubblica reports that one of those texts read, 'Help, help, we're freezing to death,' \" Livesay says. But rescue operations have been challenging. Those inside the hotel were trapped by 17 feet of snow as well as by the rubble, the AP reports. Walls were collapsed by the force of the avalanche, and entire one wing of the hotel was pushed downhill. Transport has also been hampered by the narrow, snow-covered roads in the region. The first rescue teams arrived on skis; the next wave, by helicopter. Attempts to reach the region by vehicle have been slow, according to the AP, with snow piled 10 feet high and a 5.5-mile stretch of road able to take only one-way traffic. \"By late Thursday, only 25 vehicles had arrived, along with 135 rescue workers, and civil protection authorities said part of the night was spent trying to widen the road,\" the AP writes. Rescuers are also fighting against the clock, Livesay reported earlier. \"Chances of survival are waning amid nightfall and plunging temperatures,\" he says. Meanwhile, even as rescue operations are ongoing, Italian media and officials are already considering the question of responsibility. \"State prosecutors have launched an investigation to find out if the disaster could have been averted,\" Livesay reports. \"An avalanche warning had already been in effect, so the question is: Why wasn't the hotel evacuated before the avalanche, when it's at the base of a snowy mountain in an area that's prone to earthquakes?\" ",

Mattis, strongly defended the importance of NATO during his confirmation hearing. Both Rex W. Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, and Nikki Haley, the choice for ambassador to the United Nations, offered up paeans to the need for robust American alliances, though Mr. Tillerson periodically tacked back to concepts echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And there is a question about whether the exact meaning of America First will continue to evolve in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. He first talked about it in a March interview with The New York Times, when asked whether that phrase was a good summation of his foreign-policy views. He thought for a moment. Then he agreed with this reporter\u2019s observation that the world had been \u201cfreeloading off of us for many years\u201d and that he fundamentally mistrusted many foreigners, both adversaries and some allies. \u201cCorrect,\u201d he responded. Then he added, in his staccato style: \u201cNot isolationist. I\u2019m not isolationist, but I am \u2018America First.\u2019 So I like the expression.\u201d He soon began using it at almost every rally. In another interview with The Times, on the eve of the Republican National Convention, he offered a refinement. He said he did not mean for the slogan to be taken the way Lindbergh meant it. \u201cIt was used as a brand-new, very modern term,\u201d he said. \u201cMeaning we are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world.\u201d Video Trump Sworn In as President Donald J. Trump took the oath of office, becoming the 45th president of the United States on Friday. By THE NEW YORK TIMES on Publish Date January 20, 2017. Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed As Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College and a scholar at the conservative Hudson Institute, put it the other day, \u201cThe fact that he doesn\u2019t have a grounding in the prior use of the term is liberating.\u201d \u201cIf you said to the average American voter, \u2018Do you think it\u2019s the job of the president to put America first,\u2019 they say, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s the job.\u2019\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Mead said that formulation disregarded the reality that \u201csometimes to achieve American interests, you have to work cooperatively with other countries.\u201d And any such acknowledgment was missing from Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Friday. Mr. Trump cast America\u2019s new role in the world as one of an aggrieved superpower, not a power intent on changing the globe. There was no condemnation of authoritarianism or fascism, no clarion call to defend human rights around the world \u2014 one of the commitments that John F. Kennedy made in his famed address, delivered 56 years ago to the day from the same spot, to protect human rights \u201cat home and around the world.\u201d That was, of course, the prelude to Kennedy\u2019s most famous line: that America would \u201cbear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\u201d But the America that elected Mr. Trump had concluded that it was no longer willing to bear that burden \u2014 or even to make the spread of democracy the mission of the nation, as George W. Bush, who was sitting behind Mr. Trump, vowed 12 years ago. Mr. Trump views American democracy as a fine import for those who like it. \u201cWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.\u201d ",

Trump speaks in Baton Rouge, La., on Friday, Dec. 09, 2016. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The nation\u2019s stark divide was on full display in Washington Friday as Donald J. Trump became America\u2019s 45th\u00a0president amid joyous roars of support and eruptions of chaos throughout the city, including the removal of a half-dozen protesters who tried to disrupt the swearing-in ceremony. Less than two miles from where Trump and former president Obama joined hundreds of other elected officials at the west front of the U.S. Capitol, anarchists armed with crowbars and hammers marched through the city\u2019s streets, toppling over news boxes, smashing bus-stop glass, vandalizing businesses, spray-painting buildings and, in one case, bashing in the windows of a black limousine. The acts of violence prompted helmeted police to chase the protesters with batons, hose them with pepper spray and apparently toss flash\u00a0bangs into their ranks. Three D.C. police officers were injured as the\u00a0sound of explosions and sirens filled the air \u2013 marking the first intense confrontations in a day that began with protesters shutting down at least a few security checkpoints. The clashes intensified during the afternoon as protesters hurled objects \u2014 including concrete bricks \u2014 at police in black riot gear, who fired back with more flash bangs and pepper spray. As helicopters swirled overhead and about two dozen booms echoed through downtown buildings, dozens of demonstrators fled, coughing uncontrollably and pouring milk in their eyes to wash out the stinging liquid. Traffic throughout the area was left gridlocked. An hour later, the abused limousine was set ablaze, spreading dark smoke throughout the area before firefighters extinguished the flames. The sound of more booms and sirens soon followed. In total, more than 200 people were arrested throughout the day, and the confrontations continued as darkness fell. Richard Spencer, a self-described white nationalist and leader of the \u201c alt-right \u201d movement, was punched in the face by one of the demonstrators after denying that he was a Nazi.

Someone hurled a bottle at the police line. Someone else\u00a0set another garbage can on fire, while another burned a Trump flag on the flames as the crowd shouted, \u201cTrump is a garbage fire.\u201d A half-dozen Trump supporters in \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats charged at protesters shouting \u201cUSA, USA,\u201d then left after a brief verbal confrontation. A limousine surrounded by protesters burns in downtown Washington. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large) worried that the violent demonstrations would unfairly reinforce the image of the nation\u2019s capital as a liberal bastion hostile to Trump and his supporters. \u201cProtesting is, in my opinion, your civil right. But I don\u2019t want you coming in to my town and destroying my property,\u201d\u00a0Bonds said, suggesting that out-of-towners were at fault. \u201cGo home and do it.\u201d Protesters smashed windows of businesses in downtown Washington west of 13th and K streets, just a mile from the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Reuters) Trump\u2019s inauguration\u00a0capped a campaign that galvanized millions of Americans who were eager to embrace a Washington outsider willing to say, or tweet, whatever is on his mind. The 70-year-old real estate mogul \u2014 who has never before held elected office \u2014 was jubilant Friday morning. And legions of his supporters were on hand to embrace their new president. [ Live coverage of Trump\u2019s inauguration ] As his parade began around 3:45,\u00a0thousands of people standing along the route \u2014 some who had woken up before dawn to get there \u2014\u00a0endured an intermittent chilly rain to cheer for and wave banners at the New York real estate mogul. \u201cThe president\u2019s coming,\u201d parade-goers near the start said to each other as they peered down Pennsylvania Avenue. They readied their cell phone cameras, fidgeting and arching their necks as the bass of brass instruments and drums came closer and closer. Just before reaching his newly opened $212 million Trump International Hotel, the president and First Lady Melania Trump exited their armored limousine to wave toward the crowd. But by the time Trump reached the front of his hotel \u2014 where protesters had gathered across the street \u2014 he\u2019d returned to the limo. Beneath the gloomy lighting of a winter afternoon, few could tell which vehicle the president was in. \u201cWas that him?\u201d asked a man from Tennessee at the western edge of the hotel, near 12th Street. Hardly anyone applauded as Trump passed, and an announcement came minutes later that the president had reached Freedom Plaza. \u201cWorst parade ever,\u201d said another man in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. \u201cI waited three hours for that?\u201d Up the street, 37-year-old Kelly Dolin had come from Waynesboro, Va., with his family to watch his\u00a017-year-old son, who attends Fishburne Military School, march in the parade. Dolin was surprised at the subdued mood of the crowds he had seen. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I expected,\u201d said Dolin, who voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019d hear more cheering.\u201d Earlier in the day, at least, Trump\u2019s many supporters didn\u2019t lack in enthusiasm. Kathy Davis and a friend sat in yellow ponchos in a light rain west of the Capitol, awaiting a moment they\u2019d long anticipated.\u00a0Both evangelical Christians, they\u2019d driven down together from upstate New York on Thursday. \u201cWe have just known that Donald Trump was supposed to be president, \u201d said the 59-year-old. \u201cWhen we saw the miracle happen on Election Day, I can\u2019t tell you the feelings that rose up.\u201d One 68-year-old grandmother so adored Trump that she and her family drove 19 hours from Missouri to D.C. to watch him become commander in chief.\u00a0Security had confiscated Marian Curry\u2019s pepper spray and taser but let her keep a small folding chair because of her arthritic knees. Curry insisted she\u2019s neither a Republican nor a Democrat, but something about Trump drew her in. \u201cHe woke me up,\u201d she said. Donna Lutz, a 71-year-old teacher from Florida, said she\u2019d lost friends over her support for him. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I have not been able to have an opinion,\u201d said Lutz, dressed in a bright red coat, fuzzy red earmuffs and a button with Trump\u2019s face. \u201cI was very passionate, so now I get to see that my passions were shared.\u201d [ \u2018I do solemnly swear\u2026\u2019: The 35 most momentous words Donald Trump will say at his inauguration ] Her feelings certainly weren\u2019t shared by everyone. Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric has angered and offended millions of Americans, making him the most unpopular incoming president \u00a0in at least four decades. Friday, Trump supporters and detractors came face to face on the National Mall, around the White House and throughout downtown D.C. Protesters attempt to disrupt Donald Trump\u2019s swearing-in ceremony. In one case, 10-year-old Josh Wheeler\u2019s anti-abortion sign was thrown to the ground, driving him to tears. Wheeler\u2019s father, Todd, said a protester had pushed the boy and called him names, though another anti-Trump activist helped comfort Josh afterward. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the police for letting them do that,\u201d said Wheeler, whose family came to Washington for the inauguration from Indianapolis. Josh Wheeler, 10, cries after his anti-abortion sign was tossed to the ground by a protester. At John Marshall Park\u2019s checkpoint, Black Lives Matter protesters \u2014 chanting \u201cShut it down\u201d \u2014 did just that. Five men chained themselves together, preventing anyone from passing and forcing police officers to redirect attendees to other entrances. \u201cIt feels great that we closed the checkpoint,\u201d said 28-year-old Aaron Goggans, one of the organizers. \u201cBut we know this is just the beginning.\u201d At the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and 20th Street, a very different sort of demonstration was being held as the earthy scent of burning pot wafted, and reggae pumped from a sound system. A cry went up from the crowd of marijuana enthusiasts waiting for their free joints. They were reacting to a herd of motorcycles roaring past, one bike flying a Trump campaign flag. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Bikers for Trump? \u201d said the DJ. \u201cCome for some free weed?\u201d Across the street stood five D.C. police officers, hands in their pockets. Protesters handing out pot at #trump420 pic.twitter.com/kG1adRAHLA \u2014 Sadie Dingfelder (@SadieDing) January 20, 2017 As the newly inaugurated Trump signed paperwork on Capitol Hill, hundreds of protesters meandered up Massachusetts Avenue from Union Station, occasionally blocking both sides of the thoroughfare. The march had taken on a carnival feel, with stilt walkers, large puppets, a\u00a0brass band and\u00a0a giant inflatable elephant adorned with the word \u201cracism.\u201d \u201cImmigrants are welcome here!\u201d people chanted. \u201cNo hate! No fear!\u201d Trump supporters leaving the inauguration taunted the peaceful protesters, waving their ubiquitous red hats. Earlier, at 10th and E streets, protesters had blocked the entrance to a checkpoint. A group of women tied themselves together with purple yarn and sat on the ground to prevent people from passing through. \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho! Donald Trump has to go!\u201d shouted the group of about 100 mostly young protesters. \u201cEnd white supremacy!\u201d Armed with signs, brass instruments and life-size wooden crosses, the assembly danced, blew whistles and sang along with a small marching band. The protest continued until a large group of inauguration goers \u2014 many dressed in suits and dress clothes \u2014 tried to push through the human barricade. People fell to the ground and swore until police officers helped create a lane for the attendees to pass through. Trump supporters and protesters clash. Throughout the city, other anti-Trump protests popped up. At 14th and I streets NW, about 100 anti Trump marchers chanted, \u2018Whose streets? Our streets!\u201d One man carried a bundle of American flags over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to continue shouting into the echo chamber of social media,\u201d said Clara Mystif, 31, a writer from Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re here to actually put our bodies on the line in support of our friends who are going to be targeted by this regime.\u201d Protesters traveled from across the nation and descended upon Washington for Donald Trump's inauguration. Some demonstrators tied themselves created human barricades, blocking entrances to inauguration. (Dalton Bennett,Bastien Inzaurralde,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Law enforcement was prepared to contend with more than 60 demonstration groups that planned to gather in the District, including DisruptJ20 , which drew thousands of participants. The activists\u2019 website promised \u201ca series of massive direct actions that will shut down the Inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations.\u201d They set out to challenge a security plan \u00a0that took months of planning and millions of dollars to execute. Among the obstacles\u00a0facing agitators: Checkpoints, roadblocks, truck-barricaded streets, hundreds of Jersey barriers, miles of \u00a0fencing and 28,000 security officials\u00a0deployed across\u00a0100 square blocks in the heart of Washington. On Friday, counter-demonstrators also arrived\u00a0to support their new president \u2014 most notably, Bikers for Trump , a group that\u00a0served as a vigilante security force at the\u00a0Republican National Convention and expected 5,000 members in Washington. The region\u2019s normally packed Washington-bound Metro trains were mostly empty early Friday. In a yellow line car headed south, two groups of four wearing Trump gear \u2014\u00a0beanies saying \u201cTrump America\u2019s 45th president\u201d and American flag scarves \u2014 sat ebulliently at the end. One bearded man in a North Face vest and sweatpants, clearly new to Metro, propped his feet on a divider and later asked if he could smoke his cigarette. He hopped off his seat to record a selfie video with his friends. \u201cIt\u2019s the best day in America,\u201d he beamed. The man swiveled the camera to show the rest of the crowd. \u201cWashington sucks,\u201d he bellowed, before turning the recording off. \u201cI said \u2018Grab them by the p\u2014y,\u2019 17 times yesterday,\u201d he joked later, referring to Trump\u2019s vulgar comments on the set of Access Hollywood in 2005. He casually repeated the phrase several times, until his female companion shushed him. \u201cToday\u2019s a huge day,\u201d he said as the train approached their stop. \u201cYuuuuge!\u201d his friend responded. Meanwhile, just before 9:30 a.m., the outgoing president left the Oval Office for the final time . As Obama did, reporters asked, \u201cFeeling nostalgic?\u201d Obama responded, \u201cOf course.\u201d Another reporter shouted, \u201cAny words for the American people?\u201d The 44th president of the United States\u00a0answered, \u201cThank you.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s reputation as a showman, the celebration in honor of the former \u201cApprentice\u201d star\u00a0was smaller than the one in 2009 for the nation\u2019s first African American leader. Trump\u2019s 3 p.m. parade is expected to last just 90 minutes . Obama\u2019s took more than four hours. Trump is expected to appear at three official balls. Obama attended 10 . Just 450 bus permits \u00a0had been sought for Friday. About seven times that many \u2013 more than 3,000 \u2013 registered eight years ago. Though Trump suggested \u201crecord numbers\u201d of people would attend\u00a0Friday\u2019s festivities, at least one\u00a0 longstanding ball had to cancel due to a lack of interest, and others have struggled to sell tickets. Compared to past celebrations, far fewer notable celebrities and musicians are attending or performing, and a number of the city\u2019s great halls haven\u2019t been rented. Trump\u2019s hotel\u00a0has frequently been targeted by protesters in recent months. An extra layer of high metal fencing appeared outside its front doors this week, and staff have carefully monitored everyone coming and going. Washington\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s arrival may be due in part to the adversarial relationship he\u2019s long had with the fiercely liberal capital, a place he described as a \u201cswamp\u201d that needs draining. Just 4 percent of D.C.\u2019s residents voted for the new occupant of the city\u2019s most hallowed quarters: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Trump was sworn into office, the Trump Administration detailed its commitment to an \"America First\" foreign policy and rebuilding the U.S. military. Immediately released on the White House website , following Trump\u2019s inaugural address, the \" America First Foreign Policy \" stated that \"peace through strength\" will be at the center of Trump\u2019s foreign policy approach to achieve that goal. The Trump administration further stated that, in its commitments to a stronger military, it will \"pursue the highest level of military readiness.\" What to Expect in Donald Trump's First 100 Days The commitments align with Trump\u2019s Friday inaugural address. \"From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first,\" he said in his speech. \"Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\" The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. From this moment on, it\u2019s going to be #AmericaFirst ???? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2017 \"We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism ,\" Trump added. The White House website also said that the Trump administration aims to work with international partners to cut off funding for terrorist groups, to expand intelligence sharing and to engage in cyberwarfare to disrupt propaganda and recruiting. \"Defeating ISIS\" is the administration\u2019s \"highest priority,\" it reads. In reinforcing a strong military presence, the site said Trump seeks to end the defense sequester -- a mandatory, decade-long cut to defense spending imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 -- and submit a new budget to Congress that outlines a plan to \"rebuild the military\" and \"develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system\" as a defense mechanism against missile-based attacks from countries such as Iran and North Korea. 0 Shares ",

Bush remains in stable condition Friday, according to a family spokesperson.\u00a0 The 41st president, who was fighting off \u00a0an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia, was \u201cextubated\u201d Friday morning and is \u201cbreathing well on his own with minimal supplemental oxygen, Jim McGrath said in a statement. \u201cPresident Bush is comfortable and watching inauguration coverage ,\u201d McGrath wrote, noting the former president was spending his time with wife Barbara Bush, their son Neil and their daughter-in-law Maria. He will remain in the ICU for observation.\u00a0 Barbara Bush, who was also in the hospital with bronchitis, \u201ccontinues to feel better.\u201d The 91-year-old former first lady will remain in the hospital as a precautionary measure.\u00a0 The two did not attend President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony, though George W. Bush and his family were there. What happened to George and Barbara Bush? Doctors intubated the 41st president on Wednesday for a procedure to protect and clear his airway. Barbara Bush \u00a0is also in the hospital with bronchitis. She is not in the ICU. This is the former president\u2019s fourth hospital stay in five years, but McGrath says he is a fighter. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious situation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s 92. He has pneumonia. He\u2019s in the ICU. But again, you don\u2019t bet against George Bush.\u201d In a\u00a0 Facebook post \u00a0on Thursday, the younger Mr. Bush thanked those who sent supportive messages for his parents. \u201cYour prayers are working: 41 and Mom are doing much better today and fighting on,\u201d the former president said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

USA TODAY NETWORK The Internet is commemorating Michelle Obama's final morning as First Lady by turning her into a #NeverTrump meme. Before Donald Trump's presidential swearing-in Friday morning, he and Melania met the Obamas at the White House for a pre-inauguration coffee ceremony. And as the two first families posed for photos together,\u00a0Melania handed Michelle Obama a gift box wrapped in Tiffany blue. While the meeting was perfectly diplomatic , screengrabs of Michelle's expression became an instant meme. Trust me we feel you Michelle, we feel you on so many levels\uf615 #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/pbSHnnoOJc Is that a side-eye, or just a bad camera angle?

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Vowing to \u201cget the job done,\u201d President Trump took office Friday outlining a drastically different agenda than that of his predecessor and installing key members of his national security team \u2013 as he began the work of turning his bold, and often brash, campaign promises into action.\u00a0 He took the first steps Friday evening, signing an executive order directing agencies to ease the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. The White House also said Chief of Staff Reince Priebus would be directing agencies to enforce an \u201cimmediate regulatory freeze.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,\u201d Trump declared in his inaugural address earlier on the West Front of the Capitol, issuing a fiery condemnation of business as usual in Washington.\u00a0 The president presided over the traditional inaugural fanfare, taking part in the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue before an evening of balls and other festivities. But on the sidelines, his team already was making its mark, part of what Trump called a \u201cnew vision.\u201d\u00a0 The official White House website swiftly switched as Trump took the oath of office, reflecting a new agenda for the new administration. At the top of the \u201cissues\u201d section was Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First Energy Plan,\u201d which included a commitment to nix Obama-era policies to curb global warming and regulate U.S. waterways. Team Trump deemed them \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d that hurt the economy. \u201cLifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,\u201d the website now states. The site posted additional plans for the military, foreign policy, the economy and more. The jobs plan committed to \u201cpro-growth tax reform\u201d including a reduction in the corporate tax rate. In terms of official actions, Trump\u2019s first day consisted mostly of routine transfer-of-power measures. He signed nomination papers for his Cabinet picks \u2013 but also his first bill, legislation allowing retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as Defense secretary. The Senate later confirmed Mattis to lead the Pentagon, as well as retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats angered GOP colleagues by resisting efforts to consider more Cabinet nominees on the first day. But bigger and more visceral battles were playing out on the streets of Washington Friday, as anti-Trump protesters swarmed parts of the District in demonstrations that turned violent at times. Amid dozens of arrests, protesters smashed the windows of businesses, forced the temporary shutdown of security checkpoints and clashed with police \u2013 who used pepper spray and tear gas to try to control the crowds. But thousands of Trump supporters also came out, watching the 45th president\u2019s inaugural address from the National Mall and later the parade, at times drowning out the protesters with cheers. The address itself was heavy on populist themes, and stitched together by an appeal for a \u201cnew national pride,\u201d as Trump described patriotism as a salve for the country\u2019s divisions. \u201cWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,\u201d he said.\u00a0 He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while \u201cthe people did not share\u201d in Washington\u2019s wealth.\u00a0 In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals \u2013 he described \u201crusted out factories scattered like tombstones\u201d across the land \u2013 and the crime in America\u2019s cities. \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down. \u201cFrom this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. \u2026 We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\u201d\u00a0 Telling the American people this is \u201cyour moment\u201d and \u201cyour day,\u201d Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d\u00a0 As Barack and Michelle Obama departed the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation. His team has vowed a \u201crobust\u201d start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.

The book is called \"The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine\" and is scheduled for Sept. 26. The work is based on 16 pages of notes written by Twain in 1879 that were spotted at the Mark Twain Papers & Project at the University of California at Berkeley. The prize-winning team of Philip Stead and Erin Stead have expanded the unfinished story to an 11-chapter, 152-page illustrated book.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow emotionally proclaimed Trump's \"America's First\" slogan has \"very dark echoes in American history.\" \"There was an America First Committee that formed in this country, hundreds of thousands of people in this country, some of the richest businessmen in the country who were part of it, they were formed to keep us out of World War II. They were infiltrated by the Nazis, many of them are anti-Semitic, part of why they weren't alarmed by Hitler's rise in Germany,\" Maddow said. NANCY SINATRA SLAMS CNN FOR ANTI-TRUMP SPIN ON STORY ABOUT HER HUMOROUS TWEET Over on ABC, journalist Terry Moran echoed Maddow's comments saying Trump's speech reminded him of the 1930s. \"It carries with it overtones from the 1930s when an anti-Semitic movement saying, 'We don't want to get involved in Europe's war. It's the Jews fault in Germany!'\" Reps for ABC and MSNBC did not immediately return FOX411's request for comment. ",

The announcement, on WhiteHouse.gov , was made shortly after Trump's swearing-in. \"President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule,\" the website states. \"Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.\" It continues, \"We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. The Trump administration is also committed to clean coal technology and to reviving America's coal industry, which has been hurting for too long.\" Donald Trump Vows to Cut US Funding for UN Climate Change Programs if Elected Other noticeable changes to the official White House website include a revised foreign policy plan, which promises to \"work with international partners to cut off funding for terrorist groups, to expand intelligence sharing and to engage in cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable propaganda and recruiting.\" Also, the site has a statement titled \"Standing Up for Our Law Enforcement Community,\" which reads that the \"dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong. The Trump administration will end it.\" Regarding his call to build a wall on the border with Mexico, \"President Trump is committed to building a border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities,\" the site says. Trump also vowed online to renegotiate NAFTA and pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Finally, the Trump administration announced its goals to \"Make America strong again,\" pledging to \"end the defense sequester and submit a new budget to Congress outlining a plan to rebuild our military.\" Also noteworthy: The first petition on WhiteHouse.gov calls for Trump to \"immediately release\" his \"full tax returns. More than 2,700 people have signed it thus far. 0 Shares ",

The city was sued by Hertz and Enterprise. Chicago's requirement that car rental firms in nearby suburbs collect a tax for the city was ruled unconstitutional Friday by the state Supreme Court. The city was sued by Hertz and Enterprise. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) Becky Yerak Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Chicago's requirement that car rental companies in nearby suburbs collect a tax for the city's coffers was ruled unconstitutional Friday by the Illinois Supreme Court, which reversed an appellate court decision. Chicago has long imposed a tax on the use of leased personal property within city limits. In 2011, the city determined that what was then an 8 percent tax should be applied to car rental companies within 3  miles of the city limits, if the vehicles were rented by city residents. The tax is now 9 percent. Unless there was written proof to the contrary, if a suburban car rental firm leased to a Chicago resident, the city assumed the driver used the vehicle more than half of the time in the city and would tax the transaction. Enterprise and Hertz sued the city in 2011. Enterprise alone estimated it had 26 rental car locations in the 3-mile tax zone. A Cook County Circuit Court ruled the city overstepped its authority. In 2015, however, an Illinois appellate court reversed the circuit court's decision. The appellate court said the city has the authority to tax cars rented by city residents within 3  miles of the city's border based on a presumption that the vehicle would be used primarily in the city. The court said the taxable event is the use of the rental car in Chicago, and so  the city has the power to tax it. The court also said a use tax by the city is justified, partly because the resident renting the vehicle might be using the city's roads and police protection. In appealing to the Illinois Supreme Court, Hertz and Enterprise argued that by that reasoning, any Illinois merchant could be required by a city to ask customers where within Illinois a customer intended to \"use\" an item and then assess a tax on that transaction.

    "text": "People have descended on Washington to witness, celebrate and protest for 150 years. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ve estimated the size of the crowds. The New York Times Good morning folks, it\u2019s great to be here with you. Alan Rappeport Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, have just arrived. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 9:51 AM ET I\u2019m duplicating Twitter here, but Melania Trump is channeling Jackie Kennedy with her powder-blue dress and fitted suit jacket over it. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 9:53 AM ET Good morning on a remarkable day. This is the first time since George Washington took the oath at Federal Hall in New York in April 1789 that a president without political or military experience will assume ultimate power. So, in a way, an unprecedented day. Maggie Haberman Jon, this was also a strikingly acrimonious campaign. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 9:53 AM ET The  greeting between the Trumps and the Obamas was slightly awkward in terms of the body language. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 9:53 AM ET Trump has, for five years, questioned the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s presidency by falsely insisting he may not have been born in the United States. Maggie Haberman It\u2019s remarkable watching the two of them with their arms around each other. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 9:55 AM ET This won\u2019t be the first time Donald Trump has spoken on the West Front of the Capitol, though obviously not in such a setting.   Back in September 2015, he joined a rally there with Sarah Palin and others against the Iran nuclear deal. It was seen at the time as a sign of the seriousness of his political intentions. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 9:57 AM ET On the birther and body language point, Maggie, I\u2019ve heard for a year and a half that Mrs. Obama was even more worried about Trump than the president was \u2013 a concern driven by how Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories fomented paranoia and hatred toward her husband. So it\u2019s a miracle that it wasn\u2019t even more awkward out there \u2013 and a tribute to the Obamas\u2019 grace. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 9:59 AM ET Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon, two of Trump\u2019s top aides, just arrived at the Capitol. Maggie Haberman Bannon wearing a suit, no less. Alan Rappeport Conway is looking very patriotic, wearing a red, white and blue dress. Alan Rappeport And Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has just arrived. Alan Rappeport We\u2019re about an hour and a half away from the swearing-in ceremony. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:02 AM ET One person who will have a starring role today probably won\u2019t be too well known to most Americans. Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, will serve as master of ceremonies. He is the chairman of the inauguration committee by virtue of being chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. He survived a tough re-election last year against a strong Democratic challenger.  Told me yesterday he wasn\u2019t worried about a thing. Morrigan McCarthy 10:03 AM ET Photo A crowd gathered on the National Mall for the inauguration. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:05 AM ET And Senator Blunt is a big history buff; he and I once had a long conversation about Andrew Jackson, so I bet this is fun for him. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:05 AM ET Mr.  Blunt\u2019s role is also why you will be hearing from the Missouri State University Chorale later! Power has its privileges. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:06 AM ET Ah, politics. When Senator Chuck Schumer did the job, we had a lot of New York bands. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:09 AM ET Chuck Schumer is on the program as well. He will deliver remarks and introduce Justice Clarence Thomas to swear in Mike Pence. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:09 AM ET One thing I would say about Trump\u2019s speech \u2013 which a senior adviser told me is expected to be anchored in the Jacksonian tradition \u2013 it won\u2019t necessarily tell us about the type of president he will be. For that I would look to what has come before. But it will tell us about how he views his place in the canon of U.S. history. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:10 AM ET Former Speaker John Boehner on hand.  He has a relationship with Donald Trump. And they both love golf. Alan Rappeport Newt and Callista Gingrich are also making their way. A reunion of former House speakers. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:14 AM ET Boehner was an original member of the leadership with Newt Gingrich after the 1994 Republican takeover.  Boehner was knocked out in 1998, as was Gingrich, but was able to bounce back. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:15 AM ET Maggie, on the Jackson point: I think this is all coming from Steve Bannon. You know the new president vastly better than I do, but I talked history with him in May 2016 and Jackson never came up. The only role model Trump cited then was Ronald Reagan, and that was only in passing. What strikes me most about today is that the new president truly sees himself as singular figure. Maggie Haberman Newt and Callista are talking to Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:16 AM ET As our readers may recall, Adelson essentially kept Gingrich\u2019s campaign for president alive in 2012. And Gingrich was Adelon\u2019s preferred secretary of state. Maggie Haberman Jon, there is no question this is coming from Bannon. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:16 AM ET For all of the understandable criticism of Bannon, he is also the only person around Trump besides Pence with a deep sense of U.S. history and the presidency. Maggie Haberman Trump sees himself as singular, and for many reasons. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:17 AM ET But Trump has also really liked the comparisons that some of his aides - mostly Bannon and Kellyanne Conway - have made of his rise to Jackson\u2019s rise. Maggie Haberman Bob Dole is arriving now. Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent 10:18 AM ET Good morning all. Among the dignitaries arriving now are members of the clergy. Trump has more clergy praying for him in this inauguration than any previous president. Trump has six, outdoing Nixon, who had five. Laurie Goodstein National Religion Correspondent 10:19 AM ET This has already been a divisive morning, faith-wise. The featured preacher at the service Trump attended today at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, was the Rev. Robert Jeffress. He\u2019s a Southern Baptist from Dallas who has condemned Mormons, Muslims and gays in very vitriolic language, and said that Obama has paved the way for the Antichrist. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:19 AM ET Bill Frist and Trent Lott, two former Republican Senate leaders, also on hand.  Frist, from Tennessee, was Senate leader the last time Republicans controlled the entire government in 2006. Alan Rappeport Hillary Clinton just emerged from a black Lincoln with Bill at the Capitol. Alan Rappeport Clearly a difficult day for them. Maggie Haberman It is really surreal watching Hillary Clinton walk in. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:20 AM ET And it will be significant to watch how Trump deals with her presence, which I suspect may make him uncomfortable. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:20 AM ET It just has to be so difficult for her to be going through this.  Hard to imagine. But she also is aware that is part of her role. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:20 AM ET All former presidents and first ladies are invited to inaugurations and there were some questions about whether they would attend. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:21 AM ET Knowing Trump, he will make some reference to how hard she fought and what a competitor she is. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:21 AM ET I can\u2019t imagine how painful this is for her, Carl. But you\u2019re right that she knows this is what\u2019s expected and not doing it would send a signal she might regret. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:22 AM ET It appears that the rain is holding off for now. Trump joked last night that rain wouldn\u2019t be so bad because it would prove his hair is real. Morrigan McCarthy The crowd on the National Mall. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:22 AM ET While Representative John Lewis made headlines for saying he does not consider Trump a legitimate president, he was elected legitimately, and Clinton herself has said that. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:24 AM ET Mrs. Clinton definitely wants to show she can rise above it.  The presidential loser often has to share the inaugural stage.  Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Al Gore \u2026. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:25 AM ET On Jackson again: The moment is clearly Jacksonian, in that Jackson was the first president of his kind\u2013the first one who was neither a Virginia planter nor an Adams from Massachusetts. But Jackson had been a judge, a senator, a general, and had run for president before. He had a temper and could be erratic, but he knew how to control himself and leveraged those skills in negotiations. To me the key question for the new president is whether he will be able to do the same. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:25 AM ET Yes, Jon, Trump\u2019s lack of grounding in government or public service is completely outside the norm. Maggie Haberman And I don\u2019t know what it will translate into. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:28 AM ET On the Cheneys, remember this is a small dynastic moment for them: Liz is now a Wyoming member of Congress, nearly half a century since her dad came to Washington and 40 years since he became the youngest White House chief of staff, at age 34. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:28 AM ET I agree that this is a moment for the Cheneys.  You will remember that Liz first wanted to run for Senate, but ran into a buzzsaw of opposition and support for the incumbent, Mike Enzi.  Now in the House, her ascension to the Senate will have to wait. Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:29 AM ET Jon, I wrote a piece that ran on Election Day about how hard it is to lose a political race, almost like a death. At the time, I thought I was writing a piece about how Trump, who\u2019d never lost a race, would handle this. Maggie Haberman Presidential Historian 10:29 AM ET After losing to Bill Clinton in 1996, Senator Dole walked over to George McGovern, who had lost to Nixon in 1972. \u201cGeorge, when does it stop hurting?\u201d McGovern\u2019s reply: \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:30 AM ET Just saw Nikki Haley. To those who criticize her lack of global experience, I commend a small story from the life of Bush 41. After Bush lost to Lloyd Bentsen in the 1970 Senate race, Nixon nominated Bush for the United Nations. \u201cGeorge, what the [expletive deleted] do you know about foreign policy?\u201d one of his oldest friends, the Democratic congressman Lud Ashley, asked him. \u201cAsk me in two weeks,\u201d Bush replied. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:30 AM ET House members are arriving at the Capitol.  Republicans are jubilant, while Democrats are bracing for a difficult two years but hope they can bounce back in 2018.  Midterms are when there is typically a backlash to the party in power. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:30 AM ET Trump and Obama should be departing the White House shortly to make their way to the Capitol together. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:34 AM ET The crowd is starting to fill in across the National Mall. Officials are expecting around 900,000 people coming to Washington for the main event. That\u2019s about half as many as the 2009 inauguration. Jon Meacham Presidential Historian 10:34 AM ET In 1981, on \u201cthe ride\u201d from the White House to the Capitol, Jimmy Carter, who was exhausted from last-minute negotiations on the hostages in Iran, had little to say to Reagan. Reagan, who hated silence, started telling Hollywood stories. When Carter got out of the limo at the Capitol, he asked Gerald Rafshoon, his communications director: \u201cWho the hell is Jack Warner? He keeps talking about Jack Warner.\u201d Maggie Haberman White House Correspondent 10:36 AM ET A bunch of familiar faces are showing up on the C-Span feed, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; a former Trump campaign adviser, Rick Gates; and the House GOP leadership. Alan Rappeport Washington Correspondent 10:36 AM ET The makeup of the crowd looks to be more reflective of Trump\u2019s supporters, more white and less diverse than the last two inaugurations. Carl Hulse Chief Washington Correspondent 10:36 AM ET Crowd counts are always problematic and the National Park Service doesn\u2019t want to make one. But from my own experience at these - this is my 7th - I think they will be hard pressed to hit 900,000. Maggie Haberman ",

Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, for the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. (Saul Loeb / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The Republican-led Senate voted to confirm James Mattis to be President Donald Trump 's defense secretary and John Kelley to lead Homeland Security. Mattis is telling military personnel and their families that his actions are aimed at making sure \"our military is ready to fight today and in the future.\" Mattis said in a statement Friday evening that he recognizes that \"no nation is secure without friends\" and is pledging to \"work with the State Department to strengthen\" the nation's alliances. He says the Pentagon is \"devoted to gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense, thereby earning the trust of Congress and the American people.\" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who challenged the idea of a former military leader in a civilian job, voted \"no.\" Republicans pushed for fast approval to ensure the post wouldn't be empty even for a brief amount of time after Trump's swearing-in. Mattis will replace Ash Carter, who has been former President Barack Obama's defense secretary since February 2015. Congress had to pave the way for Mattis to serve. Lawmakers last week passed legislation that Trump signed granting Mattis an exception from the law barring former service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the job. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. John Kelly Cliff Owen / AP Retired Marine Corps Gen. John F. Kelly testifies during the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on his confirmation to be Secretary of Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John F. Kelly testifies during the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on his confirmation to be Secretary of Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017. (Cliff Owen / AP) The Senate also voted convincingly to put a tough-talking retired Marine general in charge of overseeing President Donald Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration. Senators confirmed Kelly's nomination to lead the Homeland Security Department, 88-11. Among Kelly's likely first assignments will be executing Trump's plans for the fate of a program that has protected more than 750,000 young immigrants from deportation. If Trump keeps his campaign promises, Kelly's agency will be responsible for strengthening the screening of immigrants permitted to enter the U.S. His department also will be charged with finding additional resources to locate and deport people living here illegally. Kelly says he's in favor of a wall at the Mexican border, but he says a physical barrier alone isn't enough to secure the 2,000-mile frontier. Associated Press ",

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Authorities escort Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman to a waiting caravan of SUVs at Long Island MacArthur Airport on Thursday in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. AP For decades, U.S. authorities have been preparing to prosecute one of the world's most feared drug traffickers, known as El Chapo. Friday, the Justice Department announced charges against Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman following his extradition from Mexico to the United States. He landed Thursday evening on Long Island, N.Y., and Friday afternoon entered a plea of not guilty at a federal court in Brooklyn. \"Today marks a milestone in our pursuit of Chapo Guzman,\" said Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. \"So who is Chapo Guzman? In short, he's a man known for no other life than a life of crime, violence, death and destruction. And now he'll have to answer to that. That's who Chapo Guzman is.\" The Associated Press described the scene: \"Holding his unshackled hands behind his back, Guzman appeared calm and collected as he gave yes and no answers, through an interpreter, to a judge's questions.\" Article continues after sponsorship Interview With 'El Chapo' Draws Backlash From Mexican Journalists In a statement, acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates called him the \"alleged leader of a multi-billion dollar, multi-national criminal enterprise that funneled drugs onto our streets and violence and misery into our communities.\" Prosecutors are seeking life in prison and a $14 billion forfeiture in drug proceeds and illicit profits from the drug trafficking kingpin. The 17-count indictment accuses El Chapo of operating a continuing criminal enterprise that included murder conspiracy, other drug-related crimes including money-laundering, and use of firearms. \"As part of the extradition process, we had to assure the Mexican government that the death penalty would not be sought,\" Capers said. The allegations date to the 1980s. Guzman, 59, is accused of leading the Sinaloa drug cartel, which became the world's largest drug trafficking organization. The indictment alleges that Guzman \"directed a large sale narcotics transportation network involving the use of land, air and sea transportation assets, shipping multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America, through Central America and Mexico, and finally into the United States.\" The billions in profits were then \"laundered back to Mexico,\" according to the court documents. Guzman, along with other cartel leaders, allegedly hired hit men \"who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults, kidnappings, and acts of torture at the direction of the defendants.\" The Mexican government has approved the U.S. request to prosecute these charges, which were filed in a federal court in New York, the Justice Department added. As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico City : \"Mexico had at one point said it would not extradite Guzman and would have him stand trial for his crimes at home. That was shortly after a second arrest in 2014. But the government reversed itself after being embarrassed by Guzman's brazen escape from Mexico's maximum security prison in the summer of 2015. \"From a hole that began [in the shower floor] in Guzman's prison cell, the drug lord climbed down a ladder and then rode a rigged motorcycle through a mile-long tunnel to freedom. Guzman remained on the run for nearly six months. During that time, he met secretly with Mexican actress Kate del Castillo and U.S. actor Sean Penn. \"Shortly after, though, and partly due to his meeting with the stars, Mexican officials caught up with Guzman, capturing him in January of last year. This time officials immediately began extradition procedures. Guzman's lawyers have been fighting it ever since. He lost his final appeal this week.\" El Chapo has eluded law enforcement for decades, as William F. Sweeney, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, told reporters. U.S. officials vowed that Guzman won't escape again. \"He's about to face American justice. ... And I assure you, no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom,\" said Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of ICE Homeland Security Investigations in New York City NPR correspondent Joel Rose in New York contributed to this report.

    "text": "1st White House Website Petition Calls for Trump to Release Taxes By TOM LIDDY Jan 20, 2017, 4:20 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump's Promises and Challenges Under Scrutiny 0 Shares Email The White House has a new version of its website and a new leader in President Donald Trump , but he can't seem to shake an old issue. The first We the People petition to hit the website calls for Trump to release his tax returns. He the first president in decades not to do so, and controversy has swirled around what the documents contain. The petition , which was created today by \"A.D.,\" has garnered about 3,000 signatures, far short of the 100,000 required by Feb. 19 for the White House to review. \"The unprecedented economic conflicts of this administration need to be visible to the American people, including any pertinent documentation which can reveal the foreign influences and financial interests which may put Donald Trump in conflict with the emoluments clause of the Constitution,\" the petition reads. A second petition, by \"H.B.,\" which garnered just a couple of hundred signatures, calls for Trump to \"divest or put in a blind trust all of the president's business and financial assets.\" Experts have told ABC News that Trump may be in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution if he does not adequately separate himself from his businesses. The emoluments clause seeks to prevent U.S. officials from profiting from foreign leaders. A lawyer for Trump, Sheri Dillon, said that Trump is not required by the Constitution to take action regarding his businesses but has signed an agreement to \"completely isolate [him] from the management of the company.\" His sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. will take over the Trump Organization along with a longtime company executive. Donald Trump Sr. refused to release his tax returns during the presidential campaign because he said he was under audit by the IRS. His team said he paid hundreds of millions of dollars in other taxes in response to a report that he may have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Live Coverage: Donald Trump's Presidential Inauguration \"For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,\" Trump said. \"Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. The establishment protected itself.\" In his 16-minute remarks, he criticized an educational system \"flush with cash\" that fails to fulfill its mission to students. He lamented factories left to rust while jobs flowed overseas. And he decried crime and gang violence, despite reports from the FBI and criminologists that the U.S. crime rate remains near historic lows. \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" Trump said, amid cheers from the crowd. Moments earlier, with his hand on Bibles once used by Abraham Lincoln and his own family, Trump pledged to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" completing an unlikely trajectory from real-estate mogul to the nation's 45th president. A crowd that stretched along the National Mall assembled under gray Washington skies to witness the ceremony. So did nearly every living former president, from Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush to Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, who was defeated by Trump last November after a costly and bitter campaign. President Trump walks down the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Friday. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption President Trump walks down the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Friday. Alex Wong/Getty Images Afterward, dozens of dignitaries walked through light rain into the Capitol for a three-course lunch program emceed by Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. The menu included Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, Angus beef with dark chocolate sauce and potato gratin, and chocolate souffle with cherry vanilla ice cream. Trump and his vice president, former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, presided over the parade, which stretched a little under 2 miles from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. School marching bands, the Boy Scouts, veterans groups and 8,000 members of the military participated. Article continues after sponsorship Also lining that route: Protesters representing 99 different groups. In sporadic exchanges at security check points across downtown Washington, protesters shouted: \"No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!\" Others carried signs with such slogans as \"Fake 45.\" Donald Trump Has Plans To Hit The Ground Running. Here's What He Wants To Do But, so far, skirmishes appeared to be mostly free from violence. Not far from the White House, several hundred protesters clad in black ran through the streets, breaking windows and knocking over trash cans. Police fired pepper spray to subdue demonstrators. The Metropolitan Police Department reported at least 95 arrests, mostly on charges of rioting. Preparations for the event had been under way for months. Around 28,000 officers are on hand to provide security for the event, including Secret Service, FBI agents, the Coast Guard, police departments and nearly 8,000 National Guard troops. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said authorities had \"no specific, credible threat\" directed at the proceedings. Donald Trump's Been Saying The Same Thing For 30 Years Meanwhile, at the White House, household crews are furiously preparing the mansion for its new occupants. Earlier in the day, camera crews spotted President Obama making one last visit to the Oval Office, slipping a letter in the desk drawer for his successor. Staff members at the residence presented the Obamas with two flags: one that welcomed them to the White House eight years ago; another that flew over the building Friday morning, on their last day there. The Obama family headed to Palm Springs, California, Friday for a vacation.

Evan Vucci/AP The formal hand-off of power is now complete, as the Trump administration only begins to come into focus. Trump, who has had no experience in elective office, now controls a vast federal bureaucracy, including national security, international diplomacy, the economy, the environment and the justice system. He's painted his governing agenda in broad strokes, promising to \"Make America Great Again\" by bringing jobs back to the U.S. and deliver a tough message on the international stage. His remarks from the inaugural platform harked back to his campaign speeches: \"We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\" Trump went on to blast \"empty talk\" by politicians of the past. \"Now arrives the hour of action,\" he said. Flanked by his extended family, his vice president, and congressional leaders, Trump took his first actions: signing papers for his cabinet nominees and proclaiming a national day of patriotism. ",

Raymond Murrell, 27, a Bloomingdale police officer, died in an on-duty crash Jan. 19, 2017. (Bloomingdale Police Department) Joseph Ruzich and Elvia Malagon Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune When he was growing up, Raymond Murrell aspired to be a police officer. And when that career goal became reality, he \"was so happy,\" according to his stepmother. It was while on-duty Thursday night doing the job he loved that Murrell was dispatched to a crime in progress in west suburban Bloomingdale. En route, his police SUV crashed, and Murrell was killed, authorities said. Murrell, 27, who was in his first year with the Bloomingdale Police Department, became the village's first officer to die in the line of duty, authorities said. \"He loved being a Bloomingdale police officer,\" police Chief Frank Giammarese said. \"He will be sadly missed.\" Murrell was responding to a call about a theft at a store when his vehicle crashed about 9:30 p.m. at Army Trail Road and Cardinal Avenue, police said. Bloomingdale firefighters extricated Murrell from the SUV and he was taken to Adventist GlenOaks Hospital in Glendale Heights, where he was pronounced dead. No other vehicles were involved in the crash. After an autopsy Friday, the DuPage County coroner's office said its preliminary findings indicate Murrell died of multiple traumatic injuries. Toxicology test results are pending. Giammarese on Friday morning said he did not know how fast the officer was driving but he said emergency lights were on at the time. The officer was the only person in the SUV. The vehicle was not equipped with a video camera, Giammarese said. Mourners gather to memorialize Bloomingdale officer killed in crash Mourners gather Jan. 20, 2017, to memorialize Bloomingdale Police Officer Raymond Murrell, who was killed in a crash while answering a call. Mourners gather Jan. 20, 2017, to memorialize Bloomingdale Police Officer Raymond Murrell, who was killed in a crash while answering a call. See more videos The crash remains under investigation, though officials suspect rainy weather could have played a role, he said. \"We are all very shocked and devastated,\" said Murrell's stepmother, Lori Murrell. \"We never expected to get a phone call informing us that our son had died.\" Raymond Murrell, who was single and lived in Addison, graduated from Addison Trail High School in 2008, his stepmother said. He earned a degree in criminal justice from the College of DuPage and also attended DeVry University, she said. \"His ideal job was to be a Bloomingdale police officer,\" Lori Murrell said. \"And he achieved that and was so happy. Even as a child, he always talked about how he wanted to be a police officer.\" Murrell is also survived by his father and mother, a sister, a stepsister and a stepbrother, his stepmother said. \"To know Raymond was to love him,\" said Lori Murrell, who helped raise him. \"If you met him, you would never say anything but a kind word about him.\" Murrell said her stepson loved muscle cars and motorcycles. \"He would refurbish them with his father,\" she said. \"His 1970 Oldsmobile 442 was his pride.\" Giammarese said his fallen officer was \"well, well liked with officers and within the community.\" Murrell received a commendation after he and another officer helped save the life of a heart attack victim. \"He was just a wonderful young man that represented our Police Department so well at such a young age,\" Giammarese said. Murrell \"died doing what he loved, serving his community,\" the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge and Labor Council said in a news release. \"Raymond knew the danger that all law enforcement officials willingly face every day when they put on the badge and go out to protect and serve all of us,\" said Shawn Roselieb, FOP Labor Council assistant executive director. Funeral arrangements are being handled by Salerno's Rosedale Chapels in Roselle, according to the coroner's office. WGN-TV contributed. ",

(Laura King) Shortly after Trump took the oath of office, White House aides posted a 500-word description of Trump\u2019s approach to the world titled \u201cAmerica First Foreign Policy.\u201d \u201cThe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies,\u201d the statement read. It added that defeating radical Islamic terror groups will be the \u201chighest priority,\u201d and that Trump\u2019s administration would add ships to the\u00a0Navy and build the\u00a0Air Force back up to Cold War levels. Trump also plans to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the terms of NAFTA with Canada and Mexico.\u00a0 Trump appears to have first tried out the phrase \u201cAmerica First\u201d during\u00a0an interview with the New York Times in March, when he was asked if he was taking an isolationist, \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign policy.\u00a0 \u201cNot isolationist, I\u2019m not isolationist, but I am \u2018America First.\u2019\u00a0So I like the expression. I\u2019m \u2018America First,\u2019\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher,\u201d he added.

Trump,\u201d according to a new report by the New York Times.\u00a0 Citing former and current senior American officials, the Times said that Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is one of the Trump associates included in the investigation. Prior to his work with Mr. Trump, Manafort was an advisor to Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician.\u00a0 Former Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page is also a subject of the investigation, according to the report, as is longtime Republican strategist and longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone. Like Manafort, Stone was fired from the Trump campaign.\u00a0 Manafort told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett in an email, \u201cThe pro-Russian narrative about me being pro-Russia and interacting with the Russian Government is a Democrat Party dirty trick and completely false. I have never had any relationship with the Russian Government or any Russian officials.\u00a0 I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone, on the \u2018Russian hacking of the DNC\u2019 and my only knowledge of it is what I have read in the papers.\u201d ",

    "text": "WATCH President Trump to Americans: 'You Will Never Be Ignored Again' 0 Shares Email A divided nation on edge greeted a new president on Friday. And President Donald J. Trump delivered a message unlike any the nation had heard from its leader. The nation is broken, he said - drifting, decaying, addled by crimes and drugs \u2014 and Trump presented himself as the figure who will \u201cfight for you.\u201d FULL TEXT: President Donald Trump's Inauguration Speech \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d the new president declared. \u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first. America first.\u201d Yet the America he\u2019s putting first is not united and not particularly optimistic. His portrait of America was similar to the one he embraced as a candidate, with little adjustment for the fact that he is now president. Carlos Barria/Reuters President Donald Trump speaks at inauguration ceremonies swearing him in as the 45th president of the United States on the West front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 20, 2017. Trump\u2019s short speech offered essentially no acknowledgment of the millions who opposed his campaign. It was an appeal and a pledge to his base \u2014 to the millions of Americans for whom this is a moment of great hope and not those greeting this era with trepidation. He addressed \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d directly: \u201cYou will never be ignored again.\u201d In vowing to be their voice, Trump outlined a vision for unity that starts with a nation lining up behind its new president. He hinted at an agenda that will scramble party lines \u2014 on trade, on infrastructure \u2014 while emphasizing aspects that are likely to harden his opposition. JUSTIN LANE/EPA President-elect Donald J. Trump delivers his Inaugural address after taking the oath of office as the 45th President of the United States in Washington, D.C., Jan. 2017. Trump\u2019s vision is a rebuke not just to President Obama but also to presidents who came before him. His suggestion that \u201cyou, the people\u201d will now come back into great power is provocative and could test his own Republican Party \u2019s loyalty to him. The president\u2019s prescription comes down to the same word he famously plasters on his airplanes and his buildings. As if on cue, the pageantry of Inauguration Day, with its familiar and beautiful American rituals, obscured the nation\u2019s divisions only for as long as it took protesters to seize the streets. Trump\u2019s hope is that success will be its own uniting force \u2014 a new creed built around a new president, at an anxious time for the nation. \u201cA new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions,\u201d Trump said. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "OPEN Graphic For Mr. Trump, the ceremonies capped a remarkable rise to power that defied all expectations, and his ascension amounts to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, Mr. Trump has at times assailed leaders of both parties and positioned himself as the ultimate outsider, making clear that he will follow his own instincts in determining the nation\u2019s course. America has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out on tabloid front pages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Never before has the presidential oath been administered to someone who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump will become the oldest president ever sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He is one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business ties that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country\u2019s begin. He arrives in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf and, in the hours before his inauguration , fresh word of a federal investigation into the Russian ties of some of his advisers. The New York Times asked people who are attending Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration to tell us about why they\u2019re going. But Mr. Trump overcame the skeptics who did not take him seriously when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy League-educated mogul who lives in a tower with an 80-foot-long living room in the heart of the nation\u2019s largest city, he turned himself into the unlikely leader of a populist movement rooted away from the country\u2019s urban and suburban coasts. His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth telling to many Americans disenchanted with politically correct Washington elites in both parties. But his constant quarrels and impulsive Twitter storms have alienated many others, leaving him with the lowest support in polls of any president entering office in modern times. He takes over on Friday without much of a team in place. Although he has named nominees for every cabinet post, the Senate confirmation process has slowed and few sub-cabinet officials have been announced. Mr. Trump has asked more than 50 officials from Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, particularly in security agencies, to stay temporarily to ensure the continuity of government. For the nation\u2019s 58th inauguration , Mr. Trump opted largely to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a Slovenian-born former supermodel, started the day at a service at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church across Lafayette Square from the White House, then made the short trip to the executive mansion for coffee with Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle. From there, the two presidents shared a limousine for the short motorcade to the Capitol.

Trump was sworn in as 45th President of the United States of America. USA TODAY NETWORK President Donald Trump delivers his inaugural address on Jan. 20, 2017. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump spent the evening of his first day in office ordering all federal departments and agencies to find ways to ease the economic burden of President Obama's health care plan as Congress works to repeal and replace it, spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday. Before leaving for a set of inaugural balls that capped his festive day, Trump also signed two executive orders confirming the appointments of Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly ; new Vice President Mike Pence later swore\u00a0in both Cabinet members. \"Thank you, it's a great day,\" Trump said after the signings in the Oval Office, flanked by Pence and chief of staff Reince Priebus. In addition, Priebus issued a government-wide \"regulatory freeze,\" Spicer said, as Trump seeks to lift or change a series of federal rules in the weeks ahead. Earlier in the day, as the president\u00a0delivered his inaugural address , Trump's\u00a0staff posted a variety of proposals ranging from an \"American First Foreign Policy\" \u00a0to killing Obama's climate action plan \u2014\u00a0plans largely echoing his campaign website. \"For too long, we\u2019ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule,\" reads the top issue brief on the new president's White House website. \"New executive actions are expected later Friday as the nation's 45th president begins his administration.\" The new administration's\u00a0first executive action, earlier in the day, involved canceling Obama-backed cuts in mortgage premiums . The last executive order of the first day \"directs the departments and the agencies to ease the burden of Obamacare as we transition to repeal and replace,\" Spicer said. He did not provide details. Trump also issued his first formal statement as president, thanking the Senate for confirming Mattis and Kelly, and added: \"I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay.\u201d After the inauguration ceremony, Trump went inside the U.S. Capitol, chatted with lawmakers\u00a0and signed documents that included formal nominations of Cabinet members and a waiver that allows Mattis to become secretary of Defense. The new president also signed a proclamation declaring a \"national day of patriotism,\"\u00a0said Spicer. Shortly after Trump took the oath of office, the government switched over the White House website from Obama\u2019s to Trump\u2019s. (Obama\u2019s is now frozen in time , archived by the National Archives and Records Administration under the Presidential Records Act.)

While the top issues on the Obama website were \u201cCivil Rights,\u201d \u201cClimate Change,\u201d \u201cEconomy\u201d and \u201cEducation,\u201d Trump\u2019s site\u00a0features\u00a0different issues with more Trump-themed names: \u201cAmerica First Energy Plan,\u201d \u201cAmerica First Foreign Policy,\u201d \u201cBringing Back Jobs and Growth\u201d and \u201cMaking Our Military Strong Again.\u201d Trump made no specific policy proposals during his inaugural address. So in the absence of any other kind of direction, something as basic as the content of a website became an important signal to interest groups about what issues would take priority in the Trump administration. Various organizations expressed concern that, in wiping the Obama White House website nearly clean, the Trump team eliminated sections devoted to such issues as climate change, gay rights\u00a0and civil rights in general. \"The Department of Labor\u2019s crucial report on worker rights has also disappeared,\u201d said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cIf President Trump truly believes in uniting the country, now is the time to make clear whether he will be an ally to the LGBTQ community in our struggle for full equality.\" Civil rights groups also criticized an opening move of the Department of Justice. Within hours of Trump\u2019s inauguration, the DOJ asked a federal district court in Texas to delay a hearing scheduled for next Tuesday on whether the state\u2019s voter ID law was enacted with a discriminatory purpose. Civil rights groups opposed to the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions as Trump\u2019s attorney general have warned that the new administration could reverse Obama\u2019s measures on key voting rights issues\u00a0and viewed the 30-day delay request as an early example. \u201cOnly hours after inauguration and we are already seeing signs that this new administration intends to delay important litigation or shift its position in critical cases,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cThis is not a good sign of things to come.\u201d Policy proposals on Trump's revamped website ranged from increased cyber warfare capabilities to changing the terms of trade deals with other nations, issues the New York businessman discussed on the campaign trail. Also notable: There are pages on the website for the release of White House visitor\u2019s logs, ethics pledge waivers, financial disclosures and staff salaries, suggesting that some Obama-era transparency initiatives may remain in place. And the White House \u201cWe the People\u201d petition site \u00a0also apparently survived the transition. The new president has already taped another White House duty,\u00a0the Saturday morning radio address to be broadcast tomorrow\u00a0morning. After an inaugural address saying that \"the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\"\u00a0Trump had lunch with members of Congress and led the inaugural parade to his new home at the White House. Throughout the day, Trump staff members began trickling into the West Wing, looking for their offices and trying to figure out how the phones and computers work. They included aides who bolstered Trump's remarkable run to the presidency: sdvisers Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, and Kellyanne Conway, as well as Spicer, the new White House press secretary. The front page of the Trump-style White House website echoes his presidential campaign by proclaiming, \"Let's Make America Great Again, Together!\" It also quotes his inaugural address: \"The Movement Continues \u2014\u00a0The Work Begins.\" Read more: ",

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development-nominee Ben Carson testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Jan. 12 in Washington. (Riccardo Savi / TNS) Andrew Khouri Contact Reporter An hour after Donald Trump assumed the presidency Friday, his administration indefinitely suspended a pending rate cut for mortgage insurance required for FHA -backed loans, which are popular with first-time home buyers and those with poor credit. The move by the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one of the first acts of Trump\u2019s administration\u00a0\u2014\u00a0reversed\u00a0a policy announced in the waning days of the Obama presidency\u00a0that would have trimmed\u00a0insurance premiums for typical borrowers by hundreds of dollars a year. Some Republicans expressed concern that the rate cut could cost taxpayers if the loans started to go sour and the Federal Housing Administration was unable to cover the losses. The agency needed\u00a0a $1.7-billion bailout from the U.S. Treasury in 2013 after it expanded its role last decade after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. The FHA does not issue loans, but instead insures mortgages and collects fees from borrowers to reimburse lenders in case of default. Borrowers can qualify for an FHA-backed mortgage, with down payments as small as 3.5%,\u00a0even with a credit score as low as 580, which could signal a past bankruptcy or debts sent to collection. The average credit score of an FHA borrower in the third quarter of last year was 679, a credit worthiness considered to be fair. Trump swore the oath of office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, painting a bleak version of a country marked by \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones\" as he pledged to deliver prosperity to forgotten Americans.

Donald John Trump swore the oath of office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, painting a bleak version of a country marked by \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones\" as he pledged to deliver prosperity to forgotten Americans. Trump, one of the most polarizing figures to... (Noah Bierman) FHA-backed loans have seen robust growth in recent years and\u00a0lenders not chartered as banks now control a majority of the riskier\u00a0FHA market. The\u00a0shift toward nonbank lenders also has drawn concerns because banks\u00a0have strict reserve requirements while the crop of new lenders operates under a variety of business models. Last week, during a confirmation hearing for Trump\u2019s nominee for HUD secretary,\u00a0 Ben Carson , Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.)\u00a0argued that private mortgage insurance should play a larger role in the market for homes acquired by buyers who can\u2019t afford traditional 20%\u00a0down payments. Carson appeared open to such a possibility and told Toomey it didn\u2019t matter what entity provided insurance, but \u201cwe do have to have a mechanism, backstop.\u201d Carson also said he was surprised by the recent FHA rate cut and promised that if confirmed he would work\u00a0with the \u201cFHA administrator and other financial experts to really examine that policy.\u201d The suspension of the rate cut, set to take effect Jan. 27, came before his confirmation vote. In a letter announcing the suspension Friday morning, HUD, which oversees the FHA,\u00a0said more analysis is needed on any \u201cfuture adjustments\u201d to insurance premium rates. For most borrowers, the rate will now remain at 0.85%, rather than 0.60%. \u201cFHA is committed to ensuring its mortgage insurance programs remains viable and effective in the long term for all parties involved, especially our taxpayers,\u201d the letter to the real estate industry said.\u00a0 In cutting the insurance premium, the Obama administration had\u00a0argued that the FHA\u2019s finances had\u00a0vastly improved\u00a0since it received its first-ever bailout in 2013 to cover potential losses on the huge volume of low-down-payment mortgages it insured from 2007 to 2009 after the housing bust. The administration noted that the agency\u2019s\u00a0Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund\u2019s capital reserve ratio\u00a0exceeded requirements for the second year in a row. \u201cWith sufficient reserves on hand to meet future claims, it\u2019s time for FHA to pass along some modest savings to working families,\u201d former HUD Secretary Julian Castro said in announcing the cut.\u00a0 The suspension of that decision will be a disappointment to home buyers currently out shopping, especially on top of the rise in mortgage interest rates following the November election.\u00a0 In Los Angeles and Orange counties, the limit on an FHA mortgage is\u00a0$636,150. If the planned reductions went into effect, borrowers who put down less than 5%\u00a0on a $600,000, 30-year mortgage would have saved $1,500 a year. The Obama administration estimated that new FHA borrowers across the nation would have saved an average of $500 a year.\u00a0 \u201cThat is real money,\u201d Southern California mortgage broker Jeff Lazerson said. Lazerson, president of\u00a0Mortgage Grader in Laguna Niguel, said he had several clients who were putting off deals so they could get a cheaper insurance rate after Jan.\u00a027.\u00a0 \u201cWe got lots of calls,\u201d he said.\u00a0 In its letter announcing the suspension of the rate cut, HUD did not give a timeline for any coming decision and said the suspension was indefinite. The California Assn. of Realtors called for the Trump administration to quickly review the rate reduction, noting it would have saved FHA-backed borrowers in California an average of $860 a year. \u201cFHA\u2019s single-family home portfolio is financially sound as it has ever been, and we hope that once the new administration has thoroughly reviewed the merits of the premium reduction the suspension will immediately be lifted,\u201d the association\u2019s president, Geoff McIntosh, said in a statement.

But the largest is expected to take place in Washington, D.C., less than 24 hours into the presidency of Donald Trump. Organizers are expecting around 200,000 marchers to gather on the National Mall. To accommodate the throng of visitors, Washington's Metro subway system will add trains and open two hours early \u2014 at 5 a.m. \u2014 on Saturday.

She is organizing a free bus ride to the march for transgender, gender nonconforming and homeless protesters from New York City. Hansi Lo Wang/NPR A four-hour rally is expected to kick off the march near the National Museum of the American Indian. It will feature speeches by Angela Davis, Gloria Steinem and the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, as well as musical performances by artists including Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Maxwell and the Indigo Girls. While the initial idea was formed as a protest of the presidential election results, organizers say the march is not all about Trump. Instead, they say they're marching to remind the country about the need to expand and protect the rights of all women. Their demands span from paid family leave and affordable access to abortion and birth control to accountability in cases of police brutality and a higher minimum wage.

Hansi Lo Wang/NPR hide caption toggle caption Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Organizers in New York City collected donations and sold T-shirts for the Women's March on Washington. Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Besides a debate over policy issues, the march has also generated a discussion about race and feminism. \"This march was initially put together by white women, and a lot of women of color felt they weren't part of the conversation,\" explains Carmen Perez, one of the march's national organizers who has been highlighting challenges specifically facing women of color, including those in the immigrant and LGBT communities. There has been some pushback against the organizers' emphasis on race, and some participants say they have decided to drop out of the march in protest. But Perez says she and other organizers hope discussing racial inequities will encourage marchers to find common cause with activists of different backgrounds. \"We can't continue to work in isolation. We can't continue to be one-dimensional,\" she says. \"We have to make sure that we look up, that we begin to really coordinate our efforts.\" ",

By Ashley Parker By Ashley Parker January 20 at 6:43 PM Follow @ashleyrparker On Jan. 20, 2017, President Trump took the oath of office, pledging in his inaugural address to embark on a strategy of \"America first.\" Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Just moments after President Trump took the oath of office Friday, the\u00a0official White House\u00a0website was transformed into a set of policy pledges -- and absence of them -- that offered the broad contours of the Trump administration's top priorities, including fierce support for law enforcement and gun owners' rights to defend themselves, the disappearance of the outgoing White House's policy page on climate change and a notable lack of any directives involving former president Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Otherwise, Trump's first day as the nation's chief executive was largely ceremonial. The president took several executive actions after he was sworn in at noon, the most notable being to overturn a\u00a0recent mortgage-fee reduction \u2014 geared at helping first-time and low-income home buyers \u2014\u00a0that Obama announced last week and that called for the Federal Housing Administration to cut its annual borrowing fee by a quarter of a percentage point. The issues page of Trump's White House offered no new plans or policies but rather a rehash of many of his most prominent campaign promises \u2014 a signal to the nation\u00a0that Trump, more pragmatic than ideological, plans to implement at least the\u00a0key\u00a0guideposts\u00a0of his campaign vision. [ Donald Trump is sworn in as president, vows to end \u2018American carnage\u2019 ] His policies include plans to both withdraw from and renegotiate\u00a0major trade deals, grow the nation's military and increase cyber-security capabilities, build a wall at the nation's southern border and deport undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes. \"Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter,\" read the law and order section, which calls for \"more law enforcement\" and \"more effective policing.\" \"Our job is to make life more comfortable for parents who want their kids to be able to walk the streets safely. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.\" The new White House website updated almost simultaneously as Trump retreated inside the Capitol to sign a series of largely perfunctory executive actions, including a waiver for retired Gen. James Mattis\u00a0to lead the Defense Department, despite having only been retired for three years. Without the waiver, federal law would have prohibited Mattis from serving as defense secretary until he had been retired from military service for at least seven years. Trump's official website differed in both style and tone from that of his predecessor. The site repeatedly referred to the former businessman as \"Mr. Trump,\" not \"President Trump,\"\u00a0whereas Obama went by \"President Obama\" on his administration's website. (Vice President Pence is referred to by his office, rather than as \"Mr. Pence\"). And Trump's biographical page devoted significant space to boasting about his electoral win\u00a0\u2014 from the\u00a017 Republican primary rivals he vanquished\u00a0to what he called his \"truly national victory and a historic movement.\" Strikingly\u00a0absent from the six issues the website highlighted \u2014 and from his speech Friday \u2014 was anything on repealing or replacing Obamacare. The issue was a defining feature of his campaign, and aides have signaled he may begin the process of undoing the law in a series of executive actions he hopes to sign in the early days of his presidency. Nor did Trump mention health care among a set of goals he articulated in his inaugural speech\u2019s pledge to end what he termed \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d and improve the fabric of life for the nation\u2019s citizens. The closest he came was to include among his scientific aspirations \u201cto free the Earth from the miseries of disease.\u201d During his campaign and afterward, Trump has pledged that fundamental changes to the health-care system would be a first priority. In a speech outside Philadelphia six days before the November election, Trump vowed to abolish the Affordable Care Act before he was sworn in. \u201cHave to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace.\u201d 1 of 96 The scene in Washington on Inauguration Day View Photos Trump supporters and protesters gather in the capital as a new presidency begins.

Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Last week, both chambers of Congress approved a budget resolution that was the first legislative step toward repealing the 2010 law, which was the centerpiece of the Obama administration\u2019s health policies. But health care was not among a half-dozen issue areas listed on the new WhiteHouse.gov website that debuted shortly after noon on Friday. The climate change web page that existed under Obama was not replaced on the Trump site, with scant\u00a0mention of climate change under the new president's energy plan.\u00a0Also gone or not immediately replaced were the web pages the previous administration had devoted to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals; people with disabilities; and civil rights more generally. Trump's entire campaign was largely a repudiation of Obama, and a new Republican administration is unlikely to have the same set of issues and priorities as an outgoing Democratic one. But the missing issue pages were \u00a0particularly alarming to Democrats and activists, especially after a vitriolic campaign in which Trump drew\u00a0criticism for seeming to mock a disabled reporter and being insensitive to the needs and rights of \u00a0minority communities. The Trump administration did not respond to requests for comment on the missing issue pages. On\u00a0energy, Trump\u00a0vowed to eliminate \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\" such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. The first represents a variety of efforts Obama had pursued to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions while the second is a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency to protect not only the largest waterways but smaller tributaries that others believe should fall under the jurisdiction of states rather than the federal government. [ Trump is right. He didn\u2019t create the country\u2019s divisions. But will he heal them? ] The initial Trump website also did not devote a separate section to immigration, another central tenet of his candidacy, though it mentioned immigration under the law enforcement section. Despite rumors within the immigration advocacy community that one of Trump's initial executive actions could be to revoke Obama's protections for the so-called \"Dreamers\" -- undocumented immigrants brought to the country as young children -- his website so far focused only on big-picture\u00a0enforcement and security goals. \"He is dedicated to enforcing our border laws, ending sanctuary cities, and stemming the tide of lawlessness associated with illegal immigration,\" read part of the immigration section. The new administration's language echoed Trump's tough rhetoric on the campaign trail, including his promises to strengthen the law enforcement community, crack down on he views as a broad range of trade violations and potentially forge alliances with countries\u00a0long considered dangerous rivals, like Russia. [ Donald Trump\u2019s full inauguration speech transcript, annotated ] \"Finally, in pursuing a foreign policy based on American interests, we will embrace diplomacy,\" read part of Trump's policy vision. \"The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.\" Melania Trump, the first lady, also received a biographical overhaul. Her web page featured a black and white glamour shot of her, and touted her QVC jewelry line and modeling career, describing the many high fashion photographers with whom she has worked and the glossy magazines for which she has posed (Vogue and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition, among others). The first lady's biography also correctly stated that she began college at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, her home country, but never graduated \u2014 a fact that was misstated during the campaign. Only at the very end of her page did Melania offer a glimpse of the sort of first lady she might be: \"Mrs. Trump cares deeply about issues impacting women and children,\" read the biography, \"and she has focused her platform as First Lady on the problem of cyber bullying among our youth.\" Amy Goldstein and Steven Mufson contributed to this report.\u00a0 \u00a0 ",

The president-elect recently said he wanted his nominees to \u201cbe themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!\u201d On Friday, he will have an opportunity to sketch out a broad vision during his inaugural address from the steps of the Capitol. During his campaign, Mr. Trump was often contradictory in laying out a domestic policy blueprint. On immigration, he talked about the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented workers, then later said he was focused on getting \u201cbad dudes\u201d out of the country. He also proposed, then backed away from, a total ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. Photo Betsy DeVos arriving for her confirmation hearing to be secretary of education on Tuesday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times Mr. Trump at times called for having guns in classrooms, but other times said he opposed that policy. He said he was against a \u201cfirst-strike\u201d policy on the use of nuclear weapons, but also said he could not \u201ctake anything off the table.\u201d He said in one interview that he would criminalize a woman\u2019s decision to have an abortion; in another, he said the opposite. As his nominees faced lawmakers during the past two weeks, many of them took a similar approach, responding to questions about their records with less hard-edge language even as they declined to accept Democrats\u2019 approaches. The hearing for Mr. Price was one example. Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon from an Atlanta suburb, sought to reassure senators that he and Mr. Trump did not want to let people \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d as they overhauled the nation\u2019s health care system. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cNobody\u2019s interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s absolutely imperative that individuals that have health coverage be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunities.\u201d But any Democrats who heard those comments as a kind of concession in the fight to unravel Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law are likely to be disappointed. Mr. Price insisted that \u201cstates know best\u201d in caring for Medicaid beneficiaries. He said the government should not dictate care to patients. And he vowed that Mr. Trump and his administration would put in place \u201ca different construct\u201d for providing health care to every American. Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor who will serve as commerce secretary if he is confirmed, also tried to reassure senators on issues like trade, even as he echoed some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more incendiary promises of economic warfare with other nations. Like the president-elect, Mr. Ross lashed out at China, accusing it of being \u201cthe most protectionist country of the very large countries \u2014 they talk more about free trade than they actually practice.\u201d But he also declared that he was \u201cnot anti-trade\u201d and declared as unworkable Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal of a 35 percent tax on American companies that manufacture goods overseas and try to sell them in the United States. Shortly after arriving in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Trump toasted his cabinet nominees, telling a luncheon audience at his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel that there had never been better ones. \u201cWe have by far the highest I.Q.,\u201d he said, \u201cof any cabinet ever assembled.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Arrives, Set to Assume Power.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 20, 2017 3:07 PM EST NEW YORK -- Saying they were bringing the world\u2019s most notorious drug lord to justice, U.S. prosecutors on Friday described Joaquin \u201c El Chapo \u201d Guzman as the murderous architect of a three-decade-long web of violence, corruption and drug addiction and announced they were seeking a $14 billion forfeiture from him. Extradited Thursday from Mexico, Guzman made an appearance in a New York City courtroom, where a federal public defender entered a not-guilty plea for him. Exclusive video of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman arriving in U.S. A hush fell over the Brooklyn courtroom moments before Guzman entered. He looked dazed and wore a dark blue T-shirt, dark blue pants and sneakers. He answered questions through an interpreter standing to his right and said he could understand the judge\u2019s English. No bail was sought. Prosecutors have sought to bring Guzman to a U.S. court for years while he made brazen prison escapes and spent years on the run in Mexico. \u201cToday marks a milestone in our pursuit of Chapo Guzman,\u201d said Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. \u201cHe\u2019s a man known for a life of crime, violence, death and destruction, and now he\u2019ll have to answer for that.\u201d As boss of the Sinaloa cartel, Guzman presided over a syndicate that shipped tons of heroin and cocaine to the U.S., using tanker trucks, planes with secret landing strips, container ships, speedboats and even submarines, prosecutors said. Perhaps most famously, Guzman\u2019s cartel built elaborate tunnels under the U.S. border to transport drugs, said Wifredo Ferrer, the U.S. attorney in Miami. Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman is led by agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration after arriving on New York\u2019s Long Island on Jan. 19, 2017. Close The cartel made billions of dollars in profits - hence prosecutors\u2019 bid for a $14 billion forfeiture - and employed hit men who carried out murders, kidnappings and acts of torture, according to prosecutors. The Sinaloa smugglers also helped fuel an epidemic of drug abuse in the U.S. in the 1980s and \u201890s, the prosecutors said. Guzman\u2019s lawyers in Mexico called his extradition, which he had fought, a political move to distract from gasoline protests there. The Drug Enforcement Administration flew him to New York from the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez on Thursday - hours before the inauguration of President Trump , who has criticized Mexico for sending the U.S. \u201ccriminals and rapists\u201d and vowed to build a wall at the Mexican border. When Guzman got off the plane, \u201cas you looked into his eyes, you could see the surprise, you could see the shock, and to a certain extent, you could see the fear, as the realization kicked in that he\u2019s about to face American justice,\u201d said Angel Melendez, who leads U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations in New York. The U.S. has been trying to obtain custody of Guzman since he was first indicted in California in the early 1990s. Now in his late 50s, he faces the possibility of life in a U.S. prison. Prosecutors had to agree to not seek the death penalty as a condition of the extradition. 38 Photos Recapturing \"El Chapo\" While he faces federal charges in several U.S. states, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn won the jockeying to get the case. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office there has substantial experience prosecuting international drug cartel cases and was once led by outgoing U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Guzman was recaptured a year ago in Mexico after escaping from a maximum-security prison for a second time. The episode was highly embarrassing for President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s government, and Mexican officials were seen as eager to hand him off to the U.S. U.S. officials said they didn\u2019t learn until Thursday that Mexico was extraditing Guzman. Thanking the Mexican government for its work, prosecutors refused to comment on whether politics played a role. In Mexico, Deputy Attorney General Alberto Elias Beltran said the timing was due to a court ruling against Guzman\u2019s appeal, not to politics. But many considered the timing to have been carefully planned, and observers differed on whether Guzman\u2019s extradition was a final-hour salute to outgoing President Obama or a gesture of obeisance to the incoming Mr. Trump. \u201cThere is no coincidence here,\u201d Peter Vincent, former Homeland Security general counsel, told CBS News. \u201c\u2019El Chapo\u2019 Guzman was extradited by the government of Mexico on the last full day of President Obama\u2019s tenure in the White House to send a very strong message of thanks to the president for working so hard over the past few years on this particular issue.\u201d 31 Photos Mexican drug lord's brazen tunnel escape After breaking out of prison the first time in 2001, Guzman spent more than a decade at large, becoming something of a folk legend among some Mexicans for his defiance of authorities. He was immortalized in ballads known as \u201cnarco-corridos.\u201d Captured in 2014, Guzman then made an even more audacious escape, coolly stepping into a hole in the floor of his prison cell shower and whizzing to freedom on a motorcycle modified to run on tracks laid the length of the tunnel. While on the run, he secretly met with actors Sean Penn and Kate del Castillo in a fall 2015 encounter that Penn later chronicled in Rolling Stone magazine. Why Sean Penn wanted to interview El Chapo In Penn\u2019s article, Guzman was unapologetic about his criminal activities, saying he had turned to drug trafficking at age 15 because it was \u201cthe only way to have money to buy food, to survive.\u201d The piece was published shortly after Mexican marines rearrested Guzman in a January 2016 shootout that killed five of his associates and wounded one marine. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

(Diego Sanchez) President Trump told a top Democratic senator Friday that he did not want to \"hurt\" young immigrants who have been living illegally in the U.S. since childhood but are otherwise law-abiding. Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, met Trump for the first time at Friday's inaugural luncheon in the Capitol and used the opportunity to bring up the so-called Dreamers. \"We don't want to hurt those kids,\" Trump said, according to Durbin's recounting of the lunch conversation. Trump's team has indicated he will immediately clamp down on illegal immigration by launching workplace raids and curtailing new entrants and refugees in the first days of his new administration. But whether that snares the Dreamers is uncertain. Trump campaigned on a hard line against illegal immigration, promising to deport those already in the country and build a wall along border with Mexico to stem new arrivals. But since then Trump has said he wants to \"work something out\" for the young immigrants, more than 700,000, who have been temporarily protected from deportation under former President Obama 's executive actions. Trump once vowed to undo Obama's actions on \"day one\" of his administration. Durbin has led a bipartisan coalition in Congress that has drafted legislation to help Trump do both. Under the \"Bridge Act,\" Trump could end Obama's executive actions but also give Dreamers a three -year temporary deferral of deportation while Congress considers broader immigration law changes. ",

Donald Trump gave his first address as president of the United States at his inauguration Jan. 20, 2017. Noah Bierman Contact Reporter Donald John Trump swore the oath of office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, painting a bleak version of a country marked by \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones\" as he pledged to deliver prosperity to forgotten Americans. Trump, one of the most polarizing figures to assume the office, delivered a brief, unusually combative inaugural address matching the nationalist and populist themes he sounded on the campaign trail. The Republican, whose inauguration was met with protests in Washington and around the country,\u00a0blamed an establishment from both parties for enriching itself at the expense of an ignored underclass. \u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another,\" he told thousands of red-cap-waving supporters\u00a0scattered across the National Mall. \"But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d Trump, who won the presidency by smashing nearly every convention in politics, narrowed his eyes and gave a thumbs up to the crowd amid a light drizzle as he celebrated one of the most solemn and sober rituals in American democracy, a peaceful transfer of power that culminated with him ascending to an office that few thought was within his grasp. His 16-minute speech \u2014 the shortest since President Carter's inaugural in 1977 \u2014 lacked specific policy. In its place was a sense of anger at what he defined as a ruling class that has raided America for its own benefit. He talked of crime, gangs, drugs, poverty, jobs lost to foreign countries and a way of life destroyed by globalism. \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said in a blunt, staccato cadence\u00a0that marked a sharp departure from the soaring rhetoric of his predecessor, former President Obama . \u201cWe are one nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams and their success is our success.\u201d He promised to shift America\u2019s focus inward, placing the country\u2019s interests ahead of its global presence. Read the story \u201cWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth,\u201d Trump said. After his inauguration, Trump began the job of president, signing routine papers to nominate candidates for Cabinet secretary positions and a waiver that allows his pick to lead the Pentagon, retired Gen. James N. Mattis, to serve despite a rule that typically bars recently active officers from holding the post. Mattis and Gen. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, were\u00a0confirmed quickly by the Senate later Friday. Trump\u2019s spokesman promised more vigorous action in the coming days. Trump, in a red tie and black overcoat, made history on many levels as he was sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\u00a0At 70, he is the oldest president to begin a first term. The brash business mogul also became the only commander in chief to enter the White House with neither government nor military service. And while his predecessors included a screen actor and several war heroes, none became international celebrities in the era of reality television. The gut-check moments along Trump\u2019s journey \u2014 winning his first primary, the Republican nomination and the election itself \u2014 have not mellowed his disdain for tradition any more than Friday\u2019s inauguration. His refusal to conform to political norms helped him attract millions of voters who felt disconnected from coastal power centers and eager to see a leader unafraid of offending people. Trump\u2019s inaugural address seemed targeted to those supporters. \u201cJan.\u00a020, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.\u201d Though no crowd count was announced, the audience was visibly smaller than the 1.8 million people who gathered to witness the nation\u2019s first black president be sworn in eight years ago. Still,\u00a0many who came on Friday had driven 10 or 20 hours from Texas, Florida, the Rust Belt and elsewhere to see a man they believed offered a starkly different kind of politics than his predecessors. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \u2014 President Trump \u201cIt sounded like someone was speaking to us \u2013 finally,\u201d said Pam Lazarites, 61. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing about the establishment \u2013 the government, the politicians.\u201d She and her husband, Ted, drove to Washington from Dayton, Ohio, to attend the inauguration, wearing matching red Trump hoodies. They stood near the back of the crowd, close to the Washington Monument. Trump\u2019s unconventional qualities, and a promise to bring back jobs lost to outsourcing and automation, helped him compile a historic electoral upset in which he dispatched 16 primary opponents and trampled both the Bush and Clinton family political dynasties. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent who attended the inauguration with husband Bill, looked on stoically as she dutifully made her way through the Capitol to watch Trump take the job she had long hoped would be hers. The former rivals failed to shake hands as Trump walked to the stage to deliver his address, though Trump later greeted and thanked her during a congressional lunch at the Capitol after the swearing-in ceremony, prompting a standing ovation from politicians on both sides of the aisle. Some in the inaugural crowd Friday booed and chanted \u201cLock her up\u201d when Clinton\u2019s face showed on the jumbo screens, remnants of the campaign\u2019s ugly tenor overflowing\u00a0into an event that usually feels more celebratory and unifying. Trump shared a fuller embrace with the man he was replacing, Obama, and a kiss with outgoing First Lady Michelle Obama. It could have been an awkward changing of the guard. Yet Trump thanked Obama, whose legacy he campaigned against and whose American birthplace he once questioned, for his graciousness. And Obama, who had said Trump was unfit for the job during the campaign, smiled through much of the transfer of power. Michelle Obama was less visibly comfortable, looking sideways as Trump spoke. The new first lady, Melania Trump , offered a note of glamour beside her husband, wearing a powder-blue shift dress under a half-sleeved bolero-cut jacket pinned at the neck with matching long gloves, reminiscent of Jacqueline Kennedy. Even without new laws or major executive actions, the new thrust of the White House was made clear. Old Twitter handles were quickly replaced and old photos of the Obama era were stripped from the walls of the West Wing in recent days. Trump\u2019s top policy priorities were almost immediately affixed atop the White House website : a rollback of Obama\u2019s efforts to fight climate change; a promise to rebuild the military, defeat Islamic State and create 25 million new jobs; lower taxes for corporations and individuals; a moratorium on regulations; and a promise to end certain trade deals. Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by more than 2.8 million, and he has failed to build support from skeptics who see his presidency as divisive and even dangerous. During the transition period, a time other modern presidents have used to mend wounds from bitter elections, Trump sparred with enemies and inflamed old divisions. He held victory rallies in states that helped win him the election and continued to criticize Clinton in public appearances weeks after she faded into the woods of New York for long walks. Though his inaugural address tended to reinforce that division, he did embed a call for unity into his broader nationalist vision, promising that \u201cthrough our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\u201d He also said during the congressional lunch that the two major political parties are made up of good people. Yet Trump\u2019s more persistent appeals to a\u00a0lingering sense of grievance, combined with resentment from Democrats amid a period of polarization, has helped him secure an ignominious distinction. His approval rating is lower than that of any incoming president in decades, according to polls. \u201cHe\u2019s a bulldog. He calls people names. He has no kind of decency left in him,\u201d said Beritu Haile-Selassie, a Washington resident who stood by herself on a traffic circle, holding up a cardboard sign that read \u201cfake president.\u201d In addition to scattered protests throughout Washington on Inauguration Day, another wave of marchers were expected in the city Saturday to celebrate women\u2019s rights and register disapproval of Trump. Just 40% of Americans hold a favorable impression of Trump, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week. That\u2019s lower than the approval ratings for Presidents George W. Bush (62%), George H.W. Bush (65%), Obama (79%), Reagan (58%) and Carter (78%) before their inaugurations. Yet those ratings demonstrate another truth: Popularity at the beginning of a term does not always correlate with future popularity. Carter and George H.W. Bush lasted just one term. And Reagan, whose lower approval numbers came closest to Trump\u2019s, later\u00a0became one of the most beloved presidents in history.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus would send a memo to all agencies ordering a hold on all regulations. Spicer declined to give further details on the ObamaCare order. Trump was joined in the Oval Office by Vice President Mike Pence, Priebus and other top advisers as he signed the executive order on President Obama's signature health law, which he opposed throughout his campaign. Asked about his first day as president, Trump described it, \"It was busy but good -- a beautiful day.\" Trump also signed the commissions for his first two Cabinet appointments. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly were easily confirmed by the Senate earlier in the day. Both men were formally sworn in by Pence. Advertisement ",

By Philip Bump By Philip Bump January 20 at 12:21 PM Follow @pbump On Jan. 20, 2017, President Trump took the oath of office, pledging in his inaugural address to embark on a strategy of \"America first.\" Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) It's raining in Washington today \u2014 or, at least, it's rainy. It's not cold, really, at 45 degrees, but there are certainly reasons one might rather stay inside than, say, head to the Mall to watch an hour-long outdoor event. Perhaps that's one reason that the crowd in attendance at Donald Trump's inauguration seems a bit more sparse than in years past. Or perhaps it actually is more sparse \u2014 particularly in comparison to the first inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009. It can be tricky to evaluate attendance at events based solely on photos. Perspective matters, as does the time at which the photos were taken. Take the images below, from the inaugurations in 2009 and 2017. 2009 Crowds gather on the Mall for the swearing-in ceremony of President-elect Barack Obama. (The Washington Post) 2017 Crowd gather for the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) The latter certainly seems to include fewer people \u2014 but when was it taken? This tweet, from the Boston Globe's Matt Viser, offers a different perspective. The crowd size comparison, from 2009 and today. pic.twitter.com/iMYZy9PRK8 \u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) January 20, 2017 That ABC News screen capture was from a bit before the event itself. Below is a still from CNN, taken only a few minutes before Trump took the oath of office. The crowd looks similarly sparse. Side-by-side, from our Matt Callahan. Washington's public transit system offered its own assessment of how the crowds compared. Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata ",

President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their spouses wave to the helicopter carrying former President Obama and the first family. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times) Michael A. Memoli Contact Reporter Freshly sworn in to office, President Trump set about Friday trying to deliver the change he promised as he took the helm of the vast executive branch bureaucracy and began steering\u00a0it toward a new conservative-dominated government. Away from the pomp and circumstance of Inauguration Day that celebrated\u00a0the handover\u00a0of power to Trump from former President Obama ,\u00a0the nuts-and-bolts implementation began largely behind the scenes. In a ceremonial office of the Capitol shortly after he took the oath, Trump signed papers nominating candidates for Cabinet secretary posts,\u00a0paving the way for their confirmations. The Republican-led Senate voted hours later to approve retired Gen. James N. Mattis as secretary of Defense and John F. Kelly , another retired Marine general, as head of Homeland Security. And Friday night in the Oval Office, Trump signed a largely symbolic executive order directing agencies to take steps to \u201cease the burden\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, as Republicans work to repeal and replace it. \u201cThe time for empty talk is over,\u201d Trump declared in his inaugural address. \u201cNow arrives the hour of action.\u201d Early clues about Trump\u2019s top priorities came on the updated White House website , including a commitment to reverse Obama\u2019s climate plans, pursue tax reform, enhance law enforcement and the military, and withdraw from a major Pacific Rim trade pact that had been an Obama administration priority. Trump\u2019s most significant plans will require cooperation from Congress. But Obama\u2019s own aggressive use of presidential authority\u00a0also provides a path Trump can use to quickly reverse course on his predecessor\u2019s actions on immigration, foreign policy and other issues. An hour after Trump assumed the presidency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development indefinitely suspended a pending rate cut for mortgage insurance required for government-backed home loans.\u00a0 The move\u00a0reverses a policy announced in the waning days of the Obama administration that would have trimmed payments for borrowers by hundreds of dollars a year. Similar directives were being made at other agencies, an advisor said,\u00a0though not all were expected to be\u00a0announced. Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s nominee for Housing secretary, singled out the policy for scrutiny during his confirmation hearing last week amid GOP concerns about whether taxpayers would be responsible for the loans if they started to go sour. Like many other candidates in the lengthy presidential campaign, Trump\u00a0had identified dozens of actions he intended to take on his first day in office. As Trump\u2019s inauguration approached, aides increasingly focused on which would ultimately make the list. But a fluke of the calendar meant that the most significant changes would wait at least another few days.\u00a0With the inauguration\u00a0falling at the end of the work week\u00a0and additional celebratory events planned over the weekend, aides said Friday that the most significant actions \u2014 probably on healthcare and foreign policy \u2014\u00a0would wait until Monday. Officials have devised a \u201cday-one, day-100 and a day-200 action plan,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told reporters this week.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the rocky nature of the transition meant Trump was forced to ask dozens of Obama administration appointees to stay on until he could fill their jobs. And the business of government did not pause for the transfer of power. The Pentagon announced Friday that\u00a0U.S. drones and warplanes launched airstrikes the day before on an Al Qaeda training camp in northwestern Syria, killing more than 100 militants.\u00a0Though the U.S. bombs Islamic State fighters daily in\u00a0Syria, it does not hit Al Qaeda strongholds nearly as often. The exceptions are known Al Qaeda leaders, who\u00a0are targeted with drone strikes. The strike was\u00a0authorized by the outgoing Obama administration;\u00a0Trump\u00a0may pull back U.S. support for rebels struggling against President Bashar Assad 's government. Republican congressional leaders signaled their readiness to work with the new president, even if his style was one that at times discomfited some in the party. ",

Bush's breathing tube on Friday and he was breathing well on his own at a Houston hospital, his spokesman said. The tube was inserted Wednesday while the 92-year-old former president was being treated for pneumonia. Bush remains in intensive care at Houston Methodist Hospital but is comfortable, family spokesman Jim McGrath said. \"He was extubated this morning, and is breathing well on his own with minimal supplemental oxygen,\" McGrath said. \"President Bush is comfortable and watching inauguration coverage together with Mrs. Bush, their son Neil and daughter-in-law Maria.\" Former first lady Barbara Bush also remained hospitalized Friday for treatment of bronchitis, but she's feeling better and \"focusing on spending time with her husband,\" McGrath said. The 91-year-old is expected to remain in the hospital over the weekend as a precaution. Their son, former President George W. Bush, offered thanks on Instagram on Thursday for all the messages \"of love and support for Mother and Dad.\" \"Your prayers are working: 41 and Mom are doing much better today and fighting on,\" he said in his first public comments about their illnesses. The younger Bush and his wife, former first lady Laura Bush, were at President Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday. Trump and former President Bill Clinton have sent their well wishes earlier this week via Twitter, and Barack Obama offered similar thoughts earlier this week at his farewell presidential news conference. The Bushes were married Jan. 6, 1945, and their 72-year marriage is the longest of any presidential couple in American history. 0 Shares ",

Got it (The Washington Post) By David A. Fahrenthold , Robert Costa and John Wagner By David A. Fahrenthold , Robert Costa and John Wagner January 20 at 5:03 PM Follow @Fahrenthold Follow @costareports Follow @WPJohnWagner Donald John Trump was sworn in Friday as the 45th president of the United States, after which he delivered a dark but ambitious speech promising to throw out entrenched Washington elites, end \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in cities and restore jobs lost to shuttered factories. \u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d Trump said. He spoke on a day that featured less ceremony than usual, and crowds that seemed to be smaller than the ones that attended President Barack Obama\u2019s inaugurations in 2009 and 2013. Trump\u2019s parade rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue, passing crowds that often stood just two people deep. Elsewhere in downtown Washington, columns of peaceful protesters marched with anti-Trump signs, and small groups of black-clad anarchists clashed with police and set fire to trash cans and a limousine. In his speech, Trump seemed to promise not just the obvious transition from Obama\u2019s Democratic administration to full Republican control of Washington \u2014 but to a new style of politics, in which Trump will seek to be a new kind of independent power center. Trump, 70, was administered the oath by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., using two Bibles \u2014 one from President Lincoln\u2019s inauguration, and another that Trump\u2019s mother gave him in 1955. His wife Melania Trump stood at his side. 1 of 96 The scene in Washington on Inauguration Day View Photos Trump supporters and protesters gather in the capital as a new presidency begins.

Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Then, as rain began to fall, Trump gave an inaugural address that \u2014 while short in duration \u2014 made a major break with presidential precedent. Most presidents use this moment to acknowledge the opponent they defeated, to praise America\u2019s promise and to call upon both parties to work together. Trump, by contrast, used his speech to make a wide-ranging condemnation of America\u2019s current state \u2014 talking about \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d caused by urban crime, and saying that \u201cwealth, strength and confidence has dissipated\u201d because of jobs lost overseas. Trump charged that both major political parties have lost their way, serving the needs of an elite rather than the needs of the public. In grandiose language, Trump sought to cast this day as a kind of restart for American politics, with everything before \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 cast aside. \u201cThe United States of America is your country,\u201d he said. With now former president Obama and three previous presidents watching from behind him, Trump seemed to condemn them as unfaithful to the popular will, saying that his inauguration signaled that \u201cthe people\u201d would rule the country again. \u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPoliticians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.\u201d [ \u2018I do solemnly swear\u2026\u2019: The 35 most momentous words Donald Trump will say at his inauguration ] (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) It was a speech that closely matched the tone of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which he cast as a populist insurgency against GOP orthodoxies. But it was not as close a match with the way Trump has acted since the election \u2014 a time when he has chosen some of his Cabinet picks and top staffers from Washington and Wall Street\u2019s existing elites. His choices have included the head of ExxonMobil, three retired generals, several top members of Goldman Sachs and several sitting GOP legislators. \u201cWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree . . . From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first. America first!\u201d Trump said. This two-word slogan, used heavily in Trump\u2019s campaign, became infamous in U.S. history as the slogan of isolationist forces opposed to American entry in World War II. Trump has used it as an economic message. \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American factories,\u201d Trump said. [ A fierce will to win pushed Donald Trump to the top ] Trump\u2019s speech clocked in at less than 17 minutes, making it unusually short among recent inaugural addresses. It concluded with the signature promise of his stunningly successful presidential campaign, to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d During the morning\u2019s events, there were large crowds of protesters opposing Trump with signs and slogans \u2014 and some groups of black-clad anarchists who roamed District streets smashing windows of businesses and cars. Outside The Washington Post\u2019s headquarters on K Street NW, a group of a few dozen anarchists hurled bricks and rocks at police, who responded with loud \u201cflash-bang\u201d grenades and streams of pepper spray. D.C. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said officers have arrested more than 90 people in connection with protests that turned violent on Friday and caused \u201csignificant damage to a number of blocks in our city.\u201d He said a \u201ca very small percentage\u201d of the thousands who came to demonstrate against the inauguration resorted to violence. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it had to happen. I\u2019m extremely pleased how the [police] responded to this and took the folks responsible for this into custody.\u201d Elsewhere in the city, news reports showed columns of peaceful protesters marching. After the speech, before a traditional lunch at the Capitol, Trump signed three measures. One was a bill providing a waiver for James Mattis \u2014 a retired Marine general \u2014 to become secretary of defense, despite a law that prohibits that position going to recently retired military personnel. Trump also signed formal nominations, sending his Cabinet picks to the Senate. At that ceremony, Trump appeared a slightly different politician than the flame-throwing populist he had been on the inaugural stage. He was in the middle of Washington\u2019s elite, and enjoying their company. Trump joked with Congress\u2019s two top Democrats, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) about the prospects that his choices would be confirmed. At one point, Trump seemed unsure of whom he was nominating for what office. \u201cAh, Betsy,\u201d Trump said, looking at one sheet he was to sign. \u201cEducation, right?\u201d He looked to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), seemingly for confirmation. \u201cYes,\u201d McCarthy said. It was, indeed, the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Trump\u2019s secretary of education. Trump also signed a proclamation declaring a national day of patriotism, new White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a tweet. In recent years, other presidents have declared Sept. 11 of each year \u201cPatriot Day,\u201d in commemoration of the 2001 terrorist attacks. It was not immediately clear whether Trump\u2019s proclamation was a repeat of that tradition, or a new tradition on a different day. As he entered the lunch, Trump appeared to shake the hand of his Democratic opponent, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, whom he made no mention of in his inaugural address. \u201cHow are you? Thank you for coming. Thank you,\u201d Trump said. Later, at the same luncheon, Trump asked both Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, to stand and be applauded. As the lunch ended, the Clinton\u2019s headed toward the exit, walking alongside the statues. Hillary Clinton, when asked by The Post what she thought of the speech, paused, smiled and lightly tapped a reporter\u2019s arm. \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d she said. And then she disappeared around the entrance, out and away as Trump continued to greet lawmakers. Trump\u2019s swearing-in now gives Republicans control of both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006. The new president has promised to undo some of the most significant pieces of Obama\u2019s legacy \u2014 including his signature health-care law. But Trump also enters office with a significant amount of uncertainty, since he has repeatedly contradicted other Republicans \u2014 and himself \u2014 on major questions about how immigration, taxes, health care and other issues will be handled in the new administration. On the Internet, there were other signs of the seismic shift in power. The White House Web page \u2014 which that morning had touted Obama\u2019s initiatives to slow climate change \u2014 now touted a promise from Trump to eliminate \u201charmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s website also promised to be more pro-police than the Obama administration, under which the Justice Department investigated misdeeds in local departments. There was also, seemingly, a nod to Trump\u2019s open attitude toward Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 whose intelligence agencies reportedly sought to intervene in the 2016 election to boost Trump\u2019s chances. \u201cThe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies,\u201d the White House website said. [ Trump keeps Obama appointee tasked with helping run the war against ISIS ] After the speech, new White House counselor Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 the former head of the right-wing website Breitbart News \u2014 said in an interview that Trump\u2019s speech had echoes of another long-ago American populist. \u201cIt was an unvarnished declaration of the basic principles of his populist and kind of nationalist movement. It was given, I think, in a very powerful way. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cBut you could see it was very Jacksonian. It\u2019s got a deep, deep root of patriotism there.\u201d Unspoken, however, was that Trump\u2019s speech seemed to pull the GOP away from the policy positions that had mattered deeply until Trump came onto the scene. The party of free trade had been declared the party of economic nationalism. A party of Russia hawks had been rebranded as a party open to friendship with \u201cold enemies.\u201d \u201cHe keeps telling us, \u2018This is who I really am.\u2019 And people say, \u2018Yeah, but who are you really?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Well, this is who I really am,\u2019\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a longtime fixture in the Washington political and pundit establishment who has become and enthusiastic backer of Trump\u2019s attack on it. \u201cHe\u2019s so different from what you guys are used to covering.\u201d Gingrich was asked: How will Trump, who lost the popular vote, work with Washington\u2019s existing power structure? \u201cHe runs over it. I don\u2019t think he gets cooperation,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThe only way he\u2019s going to get those goals is to go to the American people over and over. I suspect that he\u2019ll end up by spring having to go back out and have huge rallies and try to [bring] grass-roots pressure to bear.\u201d Signs of the transfer of power were on display throughout the day. Before 9:30 a.m., TV footage showed Obama leaving the Oval Office for the last time, before he and the first lady held a pre-inauguration tea with the Trumps. Obama smiled as he walked down an exterior hallway, in view of cameras. \u201cAny last words for the American people?\u201d a member of the press called out. \u201cThank you,\u201d Obama said. Soon after, the Trumps arrived at the White House, greeting the Obamas and presenting them with a gift \u2014 a box wrapped in the distinctive light blue of high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co. The meeting at the White House between Trump and Obama marked an Inauguration Day tradition, but one made more unusual this time by the two men\u2019s history. Trump, a real estate businessman and reality-TV star, began his rise in conservative politics by essentially calling Obama a liar and an illegitimate president: Trump insisted for years that Obama was born in Kenya. Obama was actually born in Hawaii, as Trump conceded late in the 2016 campaign. Obama, in turn, had mocked Trump at a televised White House Correspondent\u2019s Association dinner in 2011. Now, they met at the White House door, one going in and one going out. On the White House steps, the bitter history between Trump and Obama went unmentioned. Obama asked Trump, \u201cHow was church?\u201d and they turned to go inside. The two men and their wives took a motorcade to the U.S. Capitol, through empty streets. Around them, there were sporadic clashes between police and protesters around Washington. In several instances, news video showed black-clad protesters \u2014 some carrying symbols of \u201canarchist\u201d groups \u2014 smashing shop windows and overturning newspaper boxes. [ Two worlds collide: Trump backers and foes trade barbs in Washington ] Before meeting with the Obamas, the Trumps attended a service at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church near the White House, continuing an Inauguration Day tradition. One of the preachers was Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist minister who is pastor of a Dallas megachurch, and who has made inflammatory condemnations of both Mormonism and Islam in the past. Jeffress, who grew close to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, said on Twitter that his sermon would be entitled, \u201cWhen God Chooses a Leader.\u201d Trump left the service about 9:30 a.m. He mouthed \u201cThank you\u201d to supporters as he climbed into an SUV. Trump takes office as the least-popular new president in 40 years, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Forty percent of Americans view Trump favorably, which is 21 points lower than the rating with which Obama will leave office. But Trump won the election and this is his day to command. \u201cIt all begins today!,\u201d Trump tweeted early Friday morning. \u201cI will see you at 11:00 A.M. for the swearing-in.

(Photo: Porter Binks, USA TODAY) Presidents typically avoid facts and figures when delivering inaugural addresses, serving up a blend of broad platitudes and generalities to lay out a vision. President Donald Trump was no different in that regard. But in his inaugural address , Trump portrayed the United States as a nation in decline, using rhetoric that did not always match reality: \u2022\u00a0Trump portrayed the U.S. as crime-ridden and promised to stop the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d But the U.S. violent crime rate in 2015 was less than half what it was at its peak in 1991. \u2022\u00a0Trump promised to \u201cbring back our jobs.\u201d Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline for decades, but Trump inherits an overall economy that has gained jobs for a record 75 straight months and has an unemployment rate well below the historical norm. \u2022\u00a0He said he would \u201cget our people off of welfare and back to work.\u201d But the welfare rolls have declined under President Obama, and they have dropped precipitously since President Clinton signed legislation in 1996 instituting work requirements and time limits. \u2022 Trump promised to \u201cbring back our borders,\u201d blaming past politicians for \u201crefusing to defend our\u201d border. But the U.S. Border Patrol budget has tripled since 2001, and the number of border patrol agents has doubled. Southwest border apprehensions have dropped 75% from the peak in fiscal 2000. Crime \u2018Carnage\u2019 As he did so often on the campaign trail, Trump again painted a picture of a crime-ridden nation. While Americans want \u201csafe neighborhoods for their families,\u201d Trump said, \u201cfor too many of our citizens, a different reality exists,\u201d one in which \u201cthe crime and the gangs and the drugs \u2026 have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\u201d \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u201d Trump said. Although he spoke in general terms this time, Trump has often framed the issue by citing rising violent crime and murder rates \u2014 which focuses on a one-year uptick but ignores the long-term trend. FBI data show the number of overall violent crimes in the U.S. increased by 3.9% from 2014 to 2015, and murder and nonnegligent manslaughter went up by 10.8%. While authorities are concerned about the one-year violent crime increase, as USA TODAY\u00a0reported , the 2015 figure is still lower than in 2011, and 16.5% below the level nine years earlier. As we have noted , the long-term trend nationwide is a decline, not only in murder rates, but for violent crime in general. The violent crime rate has been on a decline since it peaked at 758.2 in 1991. It was less than half that, 372.6 in 2015. (The FBI describes its data as \u201cestimated,\u201d and it comes from the voluntary reports of local law enforcement agencies.) The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate nationwide, at 4.9 in 2015, is less than half the peak of 10.2 in 1980. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly referenced a spike in murders in cities like Chicago. And indeed, several U.S. cities have seen an alarming spike. A New York Times story in May 2016 cited \u201cnotable increases in murders in about two dozen cities in the first three months of the year compared to last year and a 9 percent increase nationwide.\u201d Criminology and statistics experts told us they can\u2019t discern a trend from such a small snapshot in time. An analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice released on Sept. 19, concluded: \u201cOverall crime rates in 2016 are projected to be nearly the same as last year, with crime remaining at an all-time low.\u201d The analysis found that murder increased by 14% \u201cwith just three cities \u2014 Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. \u2014 responsible for half that increase. All told, 2015\u2019s murder rate was still near historic lows.\u201d The analysis said that \u201cthe average person in a large urban area is safer walking on the street today than he or she would have been at almost any time in the past 30 years.\u201d \u2018Bring Back Our Jobs\u2019 Trump blamed \u201cother countries\u201d for \u201cdestroying our jobs,\u201d and he promised that he would \u201cbring back our jobs.\u201d He did not name the countries or how the jobs were destroyed. But Trump regularly blamed Mexico and China during the campaign, citing the North American Free Trade Agreement and China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, and China entered the WTO Dec. 11, 2001. It is true that U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 website provides data on manufacturing jobs dating to 1939. As of December, there were not quite 12.3 million manufacturing jobs \u2014 which is nearly 7.3 million jobs, or about 37%, fewer than the peak of more than 19.5 million jobs in June 1979. However, not all the job losses can be attributed to trade deals, and some of those job losses were offset by job gains elsewhere in the U.S. economy. For example, a 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service called NAFTA\u2019s impact \u201crelatively modest.\u201d CRS said, \u201cIn reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d One factor in the job losses is automation, which improved U.S. productivity but reduced jobs. A Jan. 18 CRS report, \u201c U.S. Manufacturing in International Perspective ,\u201d noted that \u201cU.S. manufacturers\u2019 large investments in automation \u2026 have eliminated many routine assembly jobs; only two in five workers in U.S. manufacturing establishments are now directly engaged in production.\u201d Overall, Trump inherits a job market that has steadily improved since hitting a post-recession low in 2010. As we wrote in \u201c What President Trump Inherits ,\u201d the U.S. economy has gained jobs for 75 straight months (the longest streak on record), and the unemployment rate is 4.7% (far below the historical norm since 1948). There were also more than 5.5 million job openings as of the last business day in November \u2014 double the number when Barack Obama took over as president in January 2009. BLS has been keeping track of job openings only since December 2000, but since that time the record high was in April 2016, when job openings topped 5.8 million. Poverty and Welfare Trump spoke of \u201cmothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities,\u201d and he promised, \u201cWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\u201d On poverty, as we pointed out in \u201c What President Trump Inherits ,\u201d there were 43.1 million Americans with incomes below the poverty line in 2015. That\u2019s 3.1 million more living in poverty than in 2008, the year before Obama took office. The 13.5% poverty rate, which experienced its biggest one-year drop since 1968 last year, was still three-tenths of a percentage point above where it was in 2008. Poverty figures for 2016 won\u2019t be available until September. Despite a rise in the number and rate of those living in poverty under Obama, the number on welfare declined, reflecting a long-term trend since then-President Bill Clinton signed welfare overhaul legislation in 1996. That legislation, which created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF, to replace the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, imposed time limits for cash assistance and work or work-related requirements for recipients to continue to receive welfare. The average monthly number of individuals and families on TANF since fiscal year 1997 has declined by 75% and 69%, respectively. And the AFDC program provided cash assistance to even greater numbers in the years prior. The average monthly number of individuals receiving assistance in fiscal 1970 was 7.9 million . The figure for 2016 was 2.8 million . Under Obama, the welfare rolls have declined as well. The average monthly number of individuals and families on TANF declined 27% and 26%, respectively, from fiscal year 2008 to 2016 . The number of people receiving food stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , has been declining in recent years but is still up overall under Obama\u2019s tenure. As of October 2016, the most recent month on record, 43.2 million people were receiving SNAP benefits. That\u2019s up 35% from January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, but down 9.6% from the record level in December 2012. \u2018Bring Back Our Borders\u2019 During the campaign, Trump made immigration a central issue, and it was a topic he returned to in his inaugural address. The newly installed president blamed past politicians for \u201crefusing to defend our\u201d borders, promising to \u201cbring back our borders.\u201d But the facts tell a different story. Beginning with President George W. Bush and continuing under President Barack Obama, the U.S. Border Patrol budget went up 218%, from nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $3.6 billion in FY2016. Under Bush, the total number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled \u2014 increasing from 9,821 in fiscal year 2001 (which was the last budget signed by President Clinton) to 20,119 in fiscal year 2009, under funding levels signed by Bush. Under Obama, the number of agents peaked at 21,444, but declined to 19,828 by fiscal 2016. Even so, the number of border patrol agents have doubled since 2001. While spending has gone up, apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border have gone down. In fact, the number of people apprehended while trying to enter the U.S. illegally from Mexico is one-quarter of what it was at its peak over a decade ago. There were 408,870 apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal year 2016, which was 75% below the peak number of 1,643,679 apprehended in FY2000. Read more: ",

The dog rescue group Fetching Tails Foundation raised more than $1,700 within 24 hours for his medical care. Malnourished dog Faith is seen on Jan. 19, 2017, at Chicago Animal Care and Control. The dog rescue group Fetching Tails Foundation raised more than $1,700 within 24 hours for his medical care. (Chicago Animal Care and Control) Leonor Vivanco Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune When Kristen Gottschalk saw the heartbreaking photo of a medium-sized, rust-colored dog that was all skin and bones, she knew what she had to do. She told Chicago Animal Care and Control that the Fetching Tails Foundation was interested in rescuing the dog, which had been at the pound since Wednesday. Typically stray dogs are placed on hold to see if their owner turns up, but the malnourished dog was released early Friday to get emergency medical care, Gottschalk said. \"The picture killed me,\" she said. The dog, now named Faith, was weak, had sunken eyes and weighed 18 pounds, about half of what a healthy dog his size should weigh, she said. The dog is so emaciated that every bone of his rib cage is clearly visible. The city shelter put the dog on fluids, giving him more energy to eat and drink. Before then the dog, estimated to be 1 to 2 years old, couldn't get up, she said. \"It wasn't ... 'Who could do' this or 'How anyone could hurt an animal like this?'\" she said. Her thought was: \"Let's go and save him.\" To help pay for Faith's medical costs, Gottschalk, co-founder of the Itasca-based rescue group,\u00a0 created a GoFundMe campaign Thursday that reached its $1,000 goal in 40 minutes and raised more than $1,700 in less than 24 hours. The money raised will first go toward medical care and then training, she said.

(Fetching Tails Foundation) The dog is currently at the Park Rose Animal Hospital in Roselle getting evaluated and receiving fluids, vitamins and antibiotics. On the way to the vet, Faith got a surprise visit to McDonald's and scarfed down two hamburger patties. \"He enjoyed every second of that,\" Gottschalk said. She should find out later Friday whether Faith needs to be hospitalized or can go to his foster home. Once he's fully healthy, he can get his shots, be neutered and get microchipped before being adopted. \"You can tell he's gentle. He'll just sit there as I pet him,\" she said. ",

    "text": "By Rebecca Shabad CBS News January 20, 2017, 1:13 PM In inauguration speech, Trump vows to give power back to the people Email After taking the oath of office , President Donald J. Trump promised to take the power from the Washington elite and return it to the people, and he stressed that his priority will be to put the U.S. ahead of other nations. Live coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Speaking from the the West Front of the Capitol, Mr. Trump said in his inaugural address that Americans were not merely transferring power from one administration to another and one party to another. \u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d the newly sworn-in president said with thousands watching in person on the National Mall and potentially millions watching on television. In his 17-minute inaugural speech , which he had said he wrote himself, Mr. Trump said that Jan. 20, 2017 \u201cwill be remembered as the day that the people became the rulers of his nation again.\u201d \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\u201d he said. The highlights from the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Among those seated behind him were President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden as well as former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, also attended the inauguration and was seated on the platform. President George H.W. Bush was unable to attend because he\u2019s being treated for pneumonia at a hospital in Houston. Mr. Trump highlighted issues that he said need to be solved such as violence in the nation\u2019s \u201cinner cities,\u201d an education system that\u2019s flush with cash, and crime, gangs and drugs that have taken too many lives. \u201cThe American carnage stops right here, and stops right now,\u201d he said. He denounced previous U.S. policies that he said have subsidized militaries of other countries, allowing for the depletion of the U.S. military, policies that have defended other nations\u2019 borders before America\u2019s and measures that have resulted in spending trillions of dollars overseas before spending money on rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure that Mr. Trump said has \u201cfallen into disrepair and decay.\u201d \u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America First. America first,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\u201d Mr. Trump promised that, \u201cAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before\u201d and that the U.S. would follow \u201ctwo simple rules: buy American and hire American.\u201d The new president vowed to not impose America\u2019s way of life on other nations and to fight \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d \u201cYou will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether, we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again again and yes, together, we will make America great again.\u201d Mr. Obama and the rest of his family will depart Washington, D.C. Friday for a vacation in Palm Springs, California. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

One former intelligence official briefed on the matter said the investigation is looking into whether certain former Trump campaign aides had improper contacts with the Russians. The CIA, the National Security Agency and the Treasury Department are also participating in the probe, officials say. Paul Manafort, advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign, checks the teleprompters before Trump's speech at the Mayflower Hotel on April 27 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images file The current and former officials have not said whether the investigation has unearthed any evidence of wrongdoing by Trump aides or any other Americans. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said on the TODAY Show that the president would let the investigation go wherever it leads. \"Of course \u2014 absolutely, I think he's made that clear,\" Spicer told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd. \"He's not going to shut anything down.\" Former intelligence officials told NBC News that President Trump would technically have the authority to order an end to the investigation, given that the intelligence agencies report directly to him. But it would be politically disastrous for him to do so, they said. \"I remember the last president who ordered a stop to an investigation and it cost him his presidency,\" said Raymond Batvinis, a former FBI counter intelligence agent who teaches national security at George Washington University, speaking of Richard Nixon and Watergate. NBC News has not confirmed reports in the New York Times and Washington Post, published in the days leading up to the inauguration, that investigators are reviewing intercepted communications and financial data relevant to Trump aides as part of the probe. However, obtaining such documents in a counter intelligence investigation would be standard practice, current and former officials say. The Times reported that officials who had disclosed details of the investigation to the paper had done so because of fears that the Trump administration would shutter it. The existence of the counter intelligence investigation was first reported this week by McClatchy newspapers.

NBC News reported in November that the FBI had been conducting a preliminary inquiry into the business activities of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his dealings with Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs. It's unclear whether that inquiry has grown, and whether it is related to the counter intelligence investigation or has any connection to Manafort's work for Trump. Manafort has denied wrongdoing. He left the Trump campaign in August. Counter intelligence investigations examine whether Americans have broken the law to help foreign governments steal secrets or improperly influence American policy. The nature of this one has not been made clear, and there are major unanswered questions, including whether the U.S suspects collusion between any Trump associate and the Russian influence campaign that intelligence assessments say favored Trump. It's also not clear whether the FBI has sought, through a special national security process known as a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, records associated with any American as part of the probe. Some news organizations have reported the existence of such a warrant, but NBC News has not confirmed those reports. To use a FISA warrant to target the communications of an American, the FBI would have to show a judge probable cause to believe the American was acting as an agent of a foreign power while breaking U.S. law, according to the statute. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to shut anything down, we want to know the facts.\u201d It is also possible for intelligence agencies to pick up communications by or about Americans as they eavesdrop on foreigners abroad, an activity that does not require a FISA warrant. After weeks of casting doubt on intelligence assessments that Russia was behind a broad effort to interfere in the election in favor of Trump, the president said he accepted the findings after a secret intelligence briefing on them. \"The president is going to make sure that he gets the best information from the intelligence community and the other department justice entities to make the best decision possible,\" Spicer said on TODAY. \"But we're not looking to shut anything down, we want to know the facts.\" Several experts said it was highly unlikely Trump would pull the plug on the investigation.

Obama began his last full day on the job Thursday the way he did some 2,920 times before \u2014 with the Daily Presidential Briefing. It was held in the usual location, which is the Oval Office. And, as is typical, Vice President Joe Biden was in attendance, according to a schedule released by the White House. The only other thing on Obama's official agenda was a last lunch as president with Biden in the private dining room. But while the rest of the First Family was bracing and preparing for the Friday departure from what's been their home for the last eight years, Obama still had a country to run. U.S. President Barack Obama departs the Brady Press Briefing Room after his last press conference as president at the White House in Washington on Jan. 18, 2017. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA The White House released a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate underscoring that while his administration has transferred nearly 200 detainees from the facility at Guantanamo Bay, 41 remain. He commuted the sentences of 330 prisoners. President Obama's final call with a foreign leader was with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, fitting, as they've spent the last eight years together as world leaders dealing with the financial crisis, the rise of ISIS and the new nationalist movement sweeping the world. Obama called Merkel a \"strong, courageous, and steady\" leader and acknowledged a \"personal friendship\" and that they've forged a \"deeper partnership between Germany and the United States.\" In a break from usual protocol, First Lady Michelle Obama joined the call as did Merkel's husband, Professor Joachim Sauer. Related: Obama in Letter to America: 'You Made Me a Better Man' \"We know he will be spending a lot of time reviewing clemency cases and signing clemency documents,\" Terry Sullivan of the White House Transition Project told NBC News. \"Then there will probably be some administrative things he has to do.\" The average work day of a U.S. President is 14 hours a day, seven days a week, Sullivan said. And up to a quarter of that day is spent \"taking care of presidential clerkships.\" \"That means signing a lot of documents,\" Sullivan said. \"It's a vast government. There are lots of things that a president has to review and sign off on.\" PHOTOS: The Obama Era in Pictures What else will Obama be doing? \"My guess is he will spend a fair amount of time calling important people in his administration and thanking them for their service,\" Sullivan said. \"He'll probably be calling some members of the Senate to encourage them and to tell them they can count on him to continue fighting for things important to his legacy. That's part of what a leader does.\" The White House press staff office of the West Wing of the White House in Washington, on Jan. 19, 2017. Only a skeleton staff remained at the White House on Thursday, creating an eerily quiet feeling in the normally bustling West Wing. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP White House aides told NBC News that Obama has also been calling some key foreign leaders. One thing Obama is not likely to be doing is doing any serious packing, Sullivan said. \"He's not boxing stuff up,\" he said. \"He's still the leader of the free world.\" The contents of the Oval Office will be packed up by workers from the National Archives. Movers will handle the rest while Obama is handing over the reins to Trump at the inauguration on Friday. But in recent days, Obama has personally packed up some personal items that will travel with him to his new digs some two miles away in Washington, D.C., aides say. Already the White House feels emptier. Many staffers are gone and most of the photos of Obama, his family and staff that lined the West Wing walls have been taken down as workers prepare for the arrival of Donald Trump. Picture frames that once displayed photographs of President Barack Obama now sit empty in the West Wing of the White House in Washington, on Jan. 19, 2017. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA The First Family will say thanks and farewell to the White House staff at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. Two hours later, they will depart via the North Portico and head by limousine to the Capitol. \"It's a nostalgic day,\" said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College. \"The only thing that upsets this routine is friction between incoming and outgoing presidents.\" For example, Franklin Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover barely spoke to each other. Things were also tense between Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. And George H.W. Bush was miffed when the Clintons showed up late for the traditional pre-Inaugural coffee, Maney said. Obama, however, has gone to great lengths to smooth the transfer of power to Trump, a man who until recently publicly questioned whether the president was even an American. \"What happens tomorrow will be very interesting, \" Sullivan said.

The importance of the position of CIA Director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated,\" Senators Ron Wyden of Orgeon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the Democrats are playing a dangerous game. \"It's critical for the president to have a full national security team today, day one,\" he said. \"Earlier today the director and deputy director of the CIA resigned. They left; they're gone. The director's job is open and unfilled. We need to confirm a new director today,\" McConnell added. Democrats point out that a new President Barack Obama asked Preisdent Bush's CIA director to stay on until his nominee, Leon Panetta, was confirmed. But Trump has made no such request and the CIA will be without a director at least until Monday. Trump will enter his first full day in the White House with fewer confirmed Cabinet secretaries than any incoming administration since George H.W. Bush's. Despite the pomp and circumstance and lawmakers' vocal celebration of a peaceful transition of power after one of the most divisive elections in modern history, the polarized electorate is representative of Washington. President Donald Trump and former president Barack Obama stand on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with First Lady Melania Trump and Michelle Obama on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Rob Carr / AFP - Getty Images At a bipartisan luncheon after the inauguration honoring Trump, former presidents, former presidential candidates, former leaders of Congress and current members of Congress mingled at a carefully orchestrated seating at tables of eight made up of both Republicans and Democrats. About 200 attendees dined on lobster in saffron sauce and Angus steak with dark chocolate and juniper jus. The mood from the balcony seemed jovial, but tough conversations were had. A person familiar with the conversation said that Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who sat at the head table with Trump, told Trump that his cabinet nominees are too extreme. Schumer pointed to Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a tea party Republican nominated to be director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Rep. Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton attended the luncheon with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Upon entering, the former secretary of State was surrounded by a gaggle of people, both Republican and Democrat, wanting to shake her hand, give her a hug and take her picture. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, Clinton's challenger in the primary, waited in the periphery until he made his way to her. She shook his hand briefly and turned to his wife where she held her gaze for a few moments longer. Clinton then quickly moved on. Trump gave brief remarks at the end of the lunch that were much more unifying than what he said in his inaugural address. In the luncheon, Trump acknowledged, and even praised, Clinton, allowing the attendees of dignitaries give her a standing ovation. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

Braces for Tens of Thousands of Protesters During Trump's Inauguration Week Despite the arrests, the demonstrations continued through the afternoon, and police used pepper spray and flash-bang grenades to hold back the crowds, refusing to let people closer to the parade route. Police arrest and detain a protester in the street in Washington, D.C. Protesters took to the streets to march against presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Stefan Jeremiah / Rex Features via AP What is largely a day of jubilation for the new president has been defined by mass protests that are expected to strengthen through the weekend. A Women's March on Washington set for Saturday is expected to draw 200,000 protesters \u2014 a number that Inaugural Historian Jim Bendat said could break records. Meanwhile, Interstate 695, which runs through the capital, came to a standstill Friday afternoon as people holding signs and waving flags stopped traffic. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has said more than 3,000 police officers from other regions and 5,000 National Guardsmen are on hand to help secure the parade route. With hundreds of thousands descending on D.C., security checkpoints were choked with foot traffic earlier Friday as inauguration ceremony ticket-holders weaved through demonstrators to get to Capitol Hill. The protesters chanted and carried signs \u2014 many attacking Trump or making other political and social statements, including \"Not my president,\" \"No Islamophobia\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" Demonstrators protest against President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, 2107. Jewel Samad / AFP - Getty Images Protesters Joni Lipson and Joan Duckenfield, both of Philadelphia, said they were buoyed by the huge turnout of protesters. \"It looks like there are more of us than Trump supporters here,\" Duckenfield said. Trump supporters at one checkpoint at 10th and E streets tried to thread their way past a group of self-described \"anarchists.\" But the demonstrators locked arms and inadvertently tripped a pro-Trump couple trying to pass. Police immediately pounced and untangled everybody, while the protesters roared \"Don't touch me\" and \"Stop! Stop!\" Nobody was arrested.

Patrick Smith / Getty Images The scene was just one tense moment that played out after police deployed pepper spray as hundreds rallied Friday night outside the National Press Club, where a pro-Trump event billed as the \"DeploraBall\" was being held. Some demonstrators set off smoke devices in the middle of the crowd, and police in riot gear mobilized to block entrance to the event.

Schooner, a professor specializing in government procurement law at George Washington University. \u201cWe are about to have a legitimate scandal on our hands.\u201d Representative Cummings, the Maryland Democrat, said he expected the G.S.A. to declare the Trump Organization in breach of the contract. Renee Kelly, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not confirm that it intends to take such a move, saying only in a written statement that the \u201cG.S.A. won\u2019t have an update until Friday after the inauguration.\u201d That a company Mr. Trump controls is a prominent tenant of the federal government is just the beginning of it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His administration will assume oversight of Wall Street regulation, which includes policing Deutsche Bank\u2019s activities. The Trump administration will also direct American foreign policy and will probably be in regular contact with the diplomats sent by other countries to the United States. For Washington hotels, those diplomats\u2019 visits are big business, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel has been actively courting them in recent months. Photo The lobby of the Trump International Hotel has been the social center for the president-elect\u2019s supporters this week in the days before his inauguration. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Mickael Damelincourt, the hotel\u2019s managing director, has held meetings and attended social events with ambassadors and other foreign dignitaries, all potential sources of business for the new hotel, given that visiting delegations frequently come to Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said he would donate any profit derived from foreign government hotel guests to the United States Treasury. But Mr. Trump\u2019s critics say that would not eliminate the risk he would be violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which some legal experts say prohibits federal employees from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of University of California, Irvine, School of Law, said, \u201cThere is no doubt he will be benefiting financially from foreign government officials who are patronizing the Trump Hotel in Washington and other facilities around the world.\u201d Employees at the hotel \u2014 the bellhops, bartenders, restaurant servers and housekeeping aides \u2014 are deciding if they will join the local hotel workers union, a process Mr. Trump recently agreed to allow without protest. Signature cards are being distributed to new employees at the hotel who will decide if they want to be organized. Labor disputes have ended up before the National Labor Relations Board, including one at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Members of the board will be picked by Mr. Trump. Photo Gentry Beach, left, a prominent fund-raiser and old friend of the Trump family, in the hotel lobby on Tuesday. Credit Eric Lipton/The New York Times \u201cWe want to get workers at the hotel organized, into a union and then negotiate a contract,\u201d said John Boardman, the president of the local, which represents about 7,000 hotel and casino workers in the Washington area. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Employees at the hotel who might have discrimination claims or claims related to overtime pay, worker safety or health could end up having them investigated by federal agencies overseen by people Mr. Trump appoints. And if the Trump hotel seeks to fill job vacancies with foreign guest workers \u2014 as Mr. Trump did at Mar-a-Lago, the resort he owns in Florida \u2014 the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security would need to approve different aspects of the issuance of visas. \u201cHim being an employer can only lead to complications,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization that studies labor issues. \u201cIt is inherent in owning a business.\u201d Already, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract after they backed out of the hotel development. The chefs had a change of heart about doing business with the hotel in 2015, after Mr. Trump made incendiary comments about Mexican immigrants. Both lawsuits are continuing and in one case Mr. Trump has given a video deposition . ",

(Jan. 20) AP As President Trump made his way down Pennsylvania\u00a0Ave. for the traditional\u00a0inaugural parade, there were a notable number of empty seats in the grandstands along the route. In particular, the stand next to the president's viewing stand was noticeably vacant. The Presidential Inaugural Committee was to distribute tickets for those sections. \u00a0The non-ticketed standing areas along the route were less sparse.\u00a0Whether the ticket holders didn't show or the tickets were not given out, the empty seats made for bad optics, particularly on the television broadcast, and people on Twitter took notice. The bleachers right next to Pres. Trump's White House viewing stand for the Inauguration Parade are virtually empty. pic.twitter.com/kNNkfRu3Wo \u2014 Micah Grimes (@MicahGrimes) January 20, 2017 Vice President Mike Pence just passed ... #InaugurationDay2017 pic.twitter.com/ICgrhMZ5Kq \u2014 Deborah Berry (@dberrygannett) January 20, 2017 #Trump organizers were on the metro this morning handing our prime parade viewing seats. They clearly messed up, cuz the stands are empty. \u2014 Howard Fineman (@howardfineman) January 20, 2017 This whole Trump Inaugural Parade has felt and had the energy of a funeral. And the empty stands/small crowds reinforce the hollowness. \u2014 jeff perera (@jeffperera) January 20, 2017 Every shot I see on TV of this parade is of empty stands. Don't let #Trump or anyone else lie about the turnout. #Inauguration \u2014 Just me (@reluctantzealot) January 20, 2017 There were more people in #PresidentTrump 's parade than in the stands \uf629 \u2014 Stephanie Officer (@OfficerStephNY) January 20, 2017 Those embarrassingly empty stands along the parade route? That's what a 42% approval rating looks like. #SoMuchWinning \u2014 Bob Cesca (@bobcesca_go) January 20, 2017 I cannot believe (or maybe I can) how absolutely EMPTY the stands are for the #inauguration parade. That is amazing. \u2014 Daniel P. Horan, OFM (@DanHoranOFM) January 20, 2017 I find it interesting that there are so many empty stands at the parade. Completely empty. Seems very low energy. #TrumpInauguration \u2014 Brittany Pounders (@LibertyBritt) January 20, 2017 At least one person said the reason for the stands was that the parade was behind schedule.

The numbers suggest that rather than unifying a divided electorate, his transition to power has continued the polarization from the campaign. Polls released on Tuesday by CNN and ORC and by The Washington Post and ABC News found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of the job Mr. Trump has been doing during the transition.

More than 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives said they would not attend the ceremony \u2014 many of them citing Mr. Trump\u2019s recent criticism of Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The Security A well-armed security bubble has encircled much of downtown Washington, as almost 30,000 local, state and federal officials work to ensure that the transfer of power goes off without a hitch. The authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, and other road closings around the region followed. Only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter. No civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter, where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot. To assure security, many items , including backpacks and posters, are prohibited on the Capitol grounds, along the parade route and at the inaugural balls. The National Park Service decided on Thursday to allow small umbrellas onto the National Mall and parade route because of rain in the forecast. The Swearing-In The official swearing-in ceremony began on Friday on the West Front of the Capitol overlooking the Mall. Most of the nation\u2019s dignitaries were on hand, including Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

The Parade After they officially review the armed services Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence will lead a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. A tradition since Thomas Jefferson\u2019s inauguration in 1801, the parade is one of the inauguration\u2019s highlights and typically draws large crowds and TV viewers around the country. More than 8,000 people will march behind the president and vice president, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, including representatives of each branch of the American armed services, as well as high school, college and police bands that have volunteered to perform . This year\u2019s parade is expected to be considerably shorter \u2014 about 90 minutes \u2014 than those celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s recent predecessors. It will also pass a certain conspicuous building that bears the name of the 45th president. The Inaugural Balls Come nightfall, many of the inaugural revelers will dress in their best evening wear to attend balls across the capital \u2014 including some to galvanize resistance to Mr. Trump. All in all, the night should be tamer than eight years ago, when the Obamas attended 10 official inaugural balls and supporters held scores of others. Mr. Trump will attend just three official balls himself. Two of those, \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cFreedom,\u201d will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and are available to supporters who donated to his inauguration or purchased tickets. The third, the \u201cSalute to Our Armed Services Ball,\u201d will be at the National Building Museum for active duty and reserve military members, wounded veterans, emergency medical workers and Medal of Honor recipients. Mr. Trump will deliver remarks at all three balls and, as is customary, he will oblige the attendees with a ceremonial first dance with his wife, Melania. The Protests Protesters are not unusual at an inauguration, but Mr. Trump\u2019s is expected to attract many more than usual . Law enforcement officials said they were expecting 99 groups to carry out demonstrations of all sorts over the inaugural period, including 63 on Friday. The largest event by far will be the Women\u2019s March on Washington , which is on Saturday and is expected to attract several hundred thousand people. Beginning with a rally at 10 a.m. at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the Capitol, the march is intended to raise awareness about a variety of social issues . Here\u2019s what you need to know . Other protests will be scattered throughout the city. Two of the largest are Inaugurate the Resistance and #DisruptJ20 .

By Theresa Vargas , Taylor Hartz and Peter Hermann By Theresa Vargas , Taylor Hartz and Peter Hermann January 20 at 7:20 PM Follow @TheresaVargas1 Follow @phscoop (Dalton Bennett,Bastien Inzaurralde,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Protesters made themselves heard in the nation\u2019s capital Friday, leaving a trail of damage along some city blocks, disrupting security checkpoints at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, and clashing with police as Trump supporters tried to celebrate. As people poured into the city to watch Trump sworn in as the 45th president, they encountered protesters across the area throughout the day. Many of the demonstrations were nonviolent, with people holding signs that spoke to their causes and concerns. One protest even took on a carnival atmosphere, with puppets, stilt walkers and a giant inflatable elephant wearing a sign that read \u201cracism.\u201d But other groups tried to disrupt the day\u2019s events by burning flags, throwing bricks and rioting en masse, leading to injuries and 217 arrests by Friday evening. Six people intent on interrupting the presidential swearing-in ceremony made it into the closest section of seats to Trump. They wore shirts that spelled out \u201cR-E-S-I-S-T\u201d and got up and started shouting \u201cWe the people!\u201d as Trump took the oath of office at noon. As authorities removed them from the area, they raised their fists and shouted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d One woman yelled, \u201cWe\u2019re for an America for all of us.\u201d Some in the crowd responded with taunts: \u201cNa, na, na, na, hey, hey, hey, good bye.\u201d [ See the Post\u2019s Live Blog on Inauguration Day news ] After the swearing in, protesters arrived at the Franklin Square area and clashed with police. The protesters were throwing rocks, bricks and chunks of concrete and taking newspaper boxes and barriers and putting them on the streets. Meanwhile police appeared to be using a flurry of flash-bang grenades and chemical spray to hold the protesters back, pushing them block-by-block west along K Street, from 12th Street toward 14th Street. During the afternoon clash, the protesters started a fire in the middle of the street using garbage bins and newspaper boxes, and some climbed trees and light poles. About 100 officers in riot gear, carrying shields, stood in a line blocking off K Street. \u201cIt\u2019s a little jarring when you\u2019re in a peaceful march with drumming and chanting and the next thing you know flash bangs are going off around you,\u201d said Daniel Hultquist, a protester from Rhode Island. \u201cPeople that throw rocks and bricks are undermining the cause.\u201d When one police SUV tried to drive through the crowd, several protesters dressed in all black tried to block it; when the SUV sped up, pushing the protesters aside, one picked up a rock, threw it, and smashed the vehicle\u2019s rear window. At about 4:15 p.m., as the inaugural parade took place blocks away, protesters set a car on fire along K Street, sending plumes of dark smoke through downtown. 1 of 34 Photos of the anti-Trump protests on Inauguration Day View Photos Demonstrators descend on the nation\u2019s capital.

Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Trump supporters and protesters clashed throughout the day at several locations, and it sometimes turned violent. Three officers were injured during an earlier protest along the K Street corridor, including an officer who was struck by an object that had been thrown, said Doug Buchanan, a spokesman for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services. A fourth officer was struck by a thrown object on K Street in the late afternoon and was taken to a hospital. During the morning protest, a large group of black-clad protesters \u2014 self-described as anti-capitalist and antifascist \u2014 made their way south on 13th Street near K Street, throwing newspaper boxes and garbage cans into the street and trying to set them on fire, leaving them smoldering. They also threw fireworks and broke glass at bus stops, businesses and on the windows of a limousine. Police cleaned up behind them as they marched, and authorities used chemical spray in an attempt to disrupt the vandalism. They ultimately herded the group away from the inauguration parade route with a large number of police vehicles and officers in riot gear, and they used concussion grenades \u2014 which make a loud noise \u2014 to break up the crowd. D.C. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said officers arrested 217 people in connection with protests that turned violent and caused \u201csignificant damage to a number of blocks in our city.\u201d He said the department is investigating whether officers handling the protests deployed either flash-bang or percussion grenades \u2014 used to disorient people in crowds \u2014 and he said that protesters had their own. Numerous Washington Post reporters saw officers use such grenades. Newsham said a \u201ca very small percentage\u201d of the thousands who came to demonstrate the inauguration resorted to violence. Police said those arrested were charged with rioting. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it had to happen,\u201d Newsham said, praising how officers responded. \u201cWe knew this was going to be a long day . . . Anyone who thinks they can come here and break the law, we will take them into custody.\u201d A man is pepper sprayed at the corner of 12th and I St. N.W. in Washington D.C. on Jan. 20, 2017, as police responded to a vandalizing group of protesters. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) Protesters chant, \u201cNot my president!\u201d at the entrance to a security checkpoint before the inauguration ceremony. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post) At least one bystander, a middle-aged man, was injured when the grenades went off; he was hit in the head, which was cut and bleeding. Another man, Robert Hrifko, 62, who rode his Harley Davidson motorcycle up from St. Augustine, Fla., to join the Bikers for Trump group, approached several firemen and asked: \u201cDo you think I need stitches?\u201d A welt on his cheekbone dribbled blood. He said a man hit him with rock after he tackled a protester who was attempting to throw an aluminum chair at a police officer. \u201cBam \u2014 just waylaid me,\u201d he said. The firemen offered him a Band-Aid and said he would be all right. \u201cGood, I ain\u2019t got insurance anymore, because I can\u2019t afford Obamacare.\u201d Mayor Muriel E. Bowser tweeted that she respects the rights of protesters but \u201cwill not condone crime and vandalism which are the antithesis of what we hope to accomplish today.\u201d She also wrote: \u201cTo those of you visiting Washington, D.C. we welcome you but we cannot allow you to destroy our neighborhoods.\u201d Protesters jammed city streets and also aimed to jam checkpoints to the inauguration, at times successfully. \u201cShut it down!\u201d protesters shouted at the checkpoint at John Marshall Park early Friday morning. There, five black men stood at the front of the crowd, chained together, blocking the path. Hailing from different parts of the country, the men were protesting on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement. As they stood together, they shouted that by demonstrating, \u201call we have to lose is our chains.\u201d Police began redirecting people to other entrances at about 8:30 a.m. As protesters there shouted, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d a Trump supporter countered. He pointed to the other side of the fence and said, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like, but I can\u2019t get to it because of you!\u201d Michael Henning came from Dalton, Ohio, to see the events on the Mall and expressed frustration with how police handled the situation. \u201cWe drove 20 hours, and now we can\u2019t get in,\u201d Henning said. \u201cEveryone should have just brought guns and had it out, I\u2019d be happy if they just dropped a bomb on them.\u201d Protesters march down K Street on Inauguration Day. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) One protester was arrested after sprinting up 13th Street and taunting a small group of officers chasing him. As he passed a D.C. fire station, cheers could be heard behind the glass of the garage doors: \u201cGet him! Get him!\u201d When a young man in a hoodie \u2014 apparently an undercover police officer \u2014 bolted from the side and brought the protester down on the sidewalk with a flying tackle, a cheer arose from inside the station. \u201cI\u2019m not resisting, I\u2019m not resisting,\u201d the protester said from beneath a pile of three officers. \u201cHow are you all doing today?\u201d he said, just before being helped to his feet, his hand in restraints. It is unclear how many protesters descended on the nation\u2019s capital for the inauguration, but law enforcement officials were bracing for more than 60 demonstration groups, both in support of and against Trump. About two dozen groups have received permits for specific gathering spaces for Friday and Saturday, when the Women\u2019s March will take over the streets. According to their permit requests, some of those groups Friday were anticipating as few as 20 participants; others were planning for tens of thousands. (Thomas LeGro/The Washington Post) In the days leading up to the inauguration, protests started with one group shutting down K Street in downtown Washington and gay rights advocates holding a dance party near the temporary home of Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Chevy Chase, complete with biodegradable glitter and the hashtags #WeAreQueer #WeAreHere #WeWillDance. Thursday night, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the National Press Club in downtown Washington, where the \u201cDeploraBall\u201d was being held. They shouted obscenities and insults such as \u201cracist\u201d and Nazi\u201d at those attending the celebratory ball on the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration, and at one point someone threw an object that hit a counter protester in the head. Officers directed chemical spray at the crowd multiple times after protesters began throwing trash at Trump supporters who were leaving the building. Many protesters participated in nonviolent demonstrations Friday. One man brought three llamas named Shay, Tragically Cute, and Thaddeus from a farm in Lancaster, Pa. Other groups protested silently, letting their signs speak for them. \u201cI just wanted my voice to be heard,\u201d said Sharae Cloak, who stood quietly with two friends. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in America, in the world. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those people who complains and sits at home.\u201d But at least one organization had vowed to try to shut down the city. Organized under activist collective Disrupt J20, that group arranged to have different organizations gather at each of the dozen checkpoints that inauguration ticket holders had to pass through to view the ceremony. Each aimed to speak to a different cause, organized under names that include: Future is Feminist, Movement for Black Lives, Standing Rock for Native Lives, Economic Justice and Communities under Attack. At one checkpoint, a group of LBGT protesters held a banner that read: \u201cOut of the Closet. Into the Streets\u201d and danced along to Abba and Madonna. They blew whistles and horns and filled the wet pavement with blue and purple glitter. \u201cWe are here as a celebration of all the rights we have achieved as a movement and to stand up for ourselves,\u201d said Mike Mcvicker-Weaver, 40, an HIV health care worker from Baltimore. At a checkpoint near 10th and E streets, a group of women early in the morning tied themselves together with purple yarn and sat down, blocking people from passing. \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho! Donald Trump has to go!\u201d the group of about 100 mostly young protesters said. \u201cEnd white supremacy!\u201d Clashes broke out at the location throughout the morning, and the line appeared at a standstill less than an hour before Trump was expected to take the oath of office. Police corral a group of protesters at the intersection of L and 15th Streets N.W. on Inauguration Day. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Disrupt J20 describes its plans online as \u201ca series of massive direct actions that will shut down the Inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations \u2014 the Inaugural parade, the Inaugural balls, you name it. We\u2019re also planning to paralyze the city itself, using blockades and marches to stop traffic and even public transit.\u201d Not all of the demonstrations on Friday were anti-Trump. Among those groups that requested permits for space were two organizations that support him: Bikers for Trump and Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump. The latter shared Dupont Circle with a group that did not request a permit but set up there early Friday \u2014 DCMJ, which was formerly known as the D.C. Cannabis Campaign and was behind the successful effort to legalize marijuana in the District in 2015. The group, which started rolling joints this month, plans to hand out 4,200 before marching to the Mall. Once there, those who get through the security checkpoints \u2014 a problem because it is illegal to possess marijuana on federal land, which includes the Mall \u2014 plan to light up four minutes and 20 seconds into Trump\u2019s speech. A 40-year-old pot grower named Josh stood near Dupont Circle Friday morning, controlling the line, which stretched up Massachusetts Avenue. He said he had donated a half-pound of his own weed for the giveaway. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you don\u2019t do any illegal here,\u201d Josh told the crowd. \u201cIf you want to do something illegal, take it down the block.\u201d Nikolas Schiller, co-founder of DCMJ, said the demonstration is not a protest of Trump but a signal of wanting to work with him on fully legalizing cannabis in all 50 states and the District. \u201cThis is about demonstrating to Trump that he has the power to change the law and do what Obama was not able to do,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cWe believe cannabis legalization will create jobs, it will increase tax revenue, and it will also help fix the broken criminal justice\u201d system. As for the bikers they will be sharing space with Friday, he said, \u201cWe hope some come on over and get a free joint.\u201d Another organization, the ANSWER Coalition, planned to host a large gathering at the U.S. Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue. Ben Becker of ANSWER said that more than 45,000 people indicated through social media an interest in joining the group\u2019s protest near the U.S. Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue. The group, which stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, had a 28-foot stage and large sound system set up there and plans to showcase speakers and performers throughout the morning and afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re considering it the counterinauguration,\u201d Becker, 33, said. \u201cThe main message is that there is going to be a grass-roots movement of resistance to the Trump agenda from Day One of his presidency.\u201d The group had thousands of signs ready to hand out. Among them: \u201cSay no to racism,\u201d \u201cStop the Trump Agenda\u201d and \u201cInaugurate the Resistance.\u201d Becker said his hope for the day, regardless of how many people show up, is that they leave feeling confident in their ability to stand up, fight back and organize. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-day event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it Day One of a larger resistance movement.\u201d Tara Bahrampour, Michael Alison Chandler, Steve Hendrix, Arelis R.

    "text": "WATCH Syria and Defeating ISIS: What Will Trump Do? 0 Shares Email Even though President Obama leaves office today with the leaders of ISIS and al-Qaeda still alive and operational, efforts underway by the U.S. military's Joint Special Operations Command and the CIA may give Trump an early opportunity to take out at least one of the terrorist leaders, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS, in Iraq . A senior national security official in the Obama administration told ABC News that President Obama often hesitated to authorize air strikes when there was a chance of significant \"collateral damage\" \u2013 or civilians being killed. The official said Trump may operate under a different standard. \u201cWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth,\u201d Trump said minutes after taking the oath of office on Friday. As ABC News has reported, al-Baghdadi has been assessed by senior military intelligence analysts for the past few months of being hunkered down in Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, occupied by ISIS since June 2014 and the scene of his only appearance ever on video, delivering a sermon that summer from a mosque's pulpit against the West and proclaiming himself caliph, the leader of all Muslims. Even with Iraqi government special forces units retaking eastern Mosul since the fall in a slow campaign backed by the United States, al-Baghdadi is believed not to have fled to the de facto ISIS capital of Raqqa in Syria, counterterrorism officials told ABC News this week. Killing the No. 1 \"high-value target\" on the U.S. kill list has been a top priority for Obama but accomplishing that in a densely-populated city of an estimated 1 million or more civilians was a challenge that seems to have eluded the outgoing president. Trump may be less hesitant than Obama to launch a strike in Mosul if intelligence operatives pinpoint al-Baghdadi's lair, in the view of many hopeful counterterrorism officials, who say they are eager to exterminate a terrorist who oversaw the butchering of tens of thousands including American and western hostages beheaded on video. Still, a currently serving career intelligence official suggested Trump may be constrained by long-held legal restrictions on armed conflict, which limit foreseeable civilian deaths. \"Lawyers are lawyers,\" the official said. Seamus Hughes, a former National Counter-Terrorism Center official and adviser to former Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Ct.), agreed but said the Obama National Security Council inside the White House had an complex process for approving strikes against terrorist commanders despite its record of eliminating many top leaders. \"Trump is probably more likely to make decisions quicker when it comes to military actions, whereas the Obama NSC has been much more deliberative,\" said Hughes, now the deputy director of the Program on Extremism. In a number of major special operations aimed at killing top leaders of terrorist groups or raids to free American hostages of terrorists, some career officials have said Obama's team waited too long and missed opportunities. The White House has consistently denied such charges. Al-Qaeda remains a threat to the U.S. as well, and its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri , who succeeded Osama Bin Laden after Obama sent Navy SEALs and Army Nightstalker special operations aviators to kill him inside Pakistan in 2011, has long been suspected by the CIA of living not in a remote mountain hideout but in a populated urban area. His move to an urban area may have occurred after a 2006 drone strike in Bajaur, Pakistan narrowly missed killing al-Zawahiri, as ABC News reported exclusively at the time. Top intelligence officials have said privately that al-Zawahiri is believed to have received help from current or retired Pakistani military intelligence officers. Al-Zawahiri has issued dozens of video and audio speeches since then, including as recently as this week. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump takes office as 45th president, pledging to empower America's 'forgotten men and women' The presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Tribune news services Contact Reporter Pledging emphatically to empower America's \"forgotten men and women,\" Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States Friday, taking command of a riven nation facing an unpredictable era under his assertive but untested leadership. Under cloudy, threatening skies at the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, Trump painted a bleak picture of the America he now leads, declaring as he had throughout the election campaign that it is beset by crime, poverty and a lack of bold action. The billionaire businessman and reality television star \u2014 the first president to have never held political office or high military rank \u2014 promised to stir a \"new national pride\" and protect America from the \"ravages\" of countries he says have stolen U.S. jobs. \"This American carnage stops right here,\" Trump declared. In a warning to the world, he said, \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America first.\" The crowd that spread out before him on the National Mall was notably smaller than at past inaugurals, reflecting both the divisiveness of last year's campaign and the unpopularity of the incoming president compared to modern predecessors.

(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Caption President Trump's Inauguration Speech President Donald Trump delivers his inauguration speech after being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. (Jan. 20, 2017)\u00a0 President Donald Trump delivers his inauguration speech after being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. (Jan. 20, 2017)\u00a0 Demonstrations unfolded at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through. After the swearing-in, more protesters registered their rage in the streets of Washington. Police in riot gear deployed pepper spray and made numerous arrests after protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses, denouncing capitalism and the new president. At least one vehicle was set afire. Short and pointed, Trump's 16-minute address in the heart of Washington was a blistering rebuke of many who listened from privileged seats only feet away. Surrounded by men and women who have long filled the government's corridors of power, the new president said that for too long, \"a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\" His predecessor, President Barack Obama, sat stoically as Trump pledged to push the country in a dramatically different direction.

    "text": "Jan 20 2017, 1:32 pm ET Five Obamacare Provisions Trump Could Change Right Away by Maggie Fox advertisement The Trump administration is in place, and one of the new president's first targets is his predecessor's signature policy. The Republican-led Congress has already started work on dismantling the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Right now there's nothing about Obamacare on the Whitehouse.gov website, which switched over at the moment Trump took the oath of office Friday. But there are a few things Trump could do right away, via executive order or through the Health and Human Services Department's regulations. Anti-abortion rights advocates cheer in front of the Supreme Court after the decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores was announced June 30, 2014 in Washington, DC. The high court ruled 5-4 that requiring family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act violated a federal law protecting religious freedom. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images It depends on whether he wants to disrupt or strengthen the healthcare system, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Conceivably, blowing up the system early on could allow the Trump administration to point to the fact that the Affordable Care Act is collapsing and needs to be replaced \u2014 even if the collapse was caused by actions they took,\" Levitt said. \"They have a lot of tools at their disposal to put new rules in place quickly,\" he added. Here are five that would be easy to change: Free Birth Control The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance to cover preventive services without a co-pay for all customers, including birth control . It's been one of the most controversial provisions and the subject of high-profile lawsuits. And it's one the new Trump administration could end on day one. \"They could end free contraceptive coverage entirely,\" Levitt said. That's because the Health and Human Services Department defines counts as \"preventive services.\" \"There are also women's services that are left up to HHS to determine and that includes free contraception,\" Levitt said. \"That's something that could end pretty quickly.\" They could also make it easier for employers like Hobby Lobby , which pressed a lengthy lawsuit against providing birth control to employees, to stop providing the coverage. Free preventive care \"The law lays out 10 categories of essential benefits that insurers have to provide,\" Levitt said. \"The details of the required benefits are left up to HHS. So for example, it's pretty clear from the statute that insurers have to cover hospital care, physician visits, drugs and other services.\" But it doesn't say insurance companies have to pay for every single one. So the new administration could move quickly to allow more flexibility and let insurance companies decide they will only pay for a certain number of visits, or limit how many days they'll pay for in a hospital \u2014 no matter how sick someone is. \"There is nothing in the law that says hospital care has to be unlimited,\" Levitt said. Cost Sharing One thing the new administration could do immediately is stop paying insurance companies to help keep health insurance costs down for low-income clients, and that could create immediate chaos, Levitt said. The federal subsidies to pay premiums are enshrined in the law, but the cost-sharing reductions reimburse health insurers for charging lower co-pays and deductibles for more than 60 percent of Obamacare customers. Congress has refused to allocate money to do that, but Obama's HHS kept paying them anyway. \"Insurers would still have to provide coverage with low copayments and deductions but they wouldn't get paid for doing so,\" Levitt said. \"Their contracts with the federal marketplace allows them to get out of those contracts if the subsidies end.\" Insurers could just dump customers who thought they were covered, he said. \"That would really be destroying the bridge behind you. There would be no turning back,\" Levitt said. The Mandate One aspect of the law that the GOP has spoken out against most strongly is the mandate requiring almost everyone to have some kind of health insurance or pay a tax. \"The Trump administration could virtually end the individual mandate all on their own by using their authority to grant hardship waivers,\" Levitt said. \"There is no definition of hardship in the law.\" Trump could just redefine hardship to include anyone who had to pay anything, for example. Obama did the same thing himself when he said people living in states that didn't expand Medicaid could be exempt from the requirement \u2014 because it left the very poorest people out in the cold. Obama had planned for all 50 states to expand their Medicaid programs, but when many Republican-led states defied him, people who didn't make enough money to qualify for subsidies were left with no help in buying health insurance. But it would enrage insurance companies, who demanded a mandate in return for the new provisions forcing them to cover all customers, including people who were already sick. For many Republicans, the individual mandate amounts to significant government overreach. However, \"it also protects insurers and provides stability to the market,\" Levitt said. One possible replacement would take time: allowing people who are already sick to get coverage if they've kept steady health insurance coverage for at least 18 months. That would stop people from hurrying to buy health insurance only when they get sick. Counting the numbers The Obama administration kept trumpeting its ACA signup numbers right up to the end, and that was one of the most obvious successes of Obamacare: getting health insurance to 20 million people. ACA enrollment surges forward as concerned over ACA repeal floods CMS call center, CMS says https://t.co/O8Q3WPrsfa \u2014 Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) January 19, 2017 The new administration could stop reporting those numbers. \"All the final reports of how many people have signed up will be put out by the Trump administration,\" Levitt said. \"There is a certain irony in that. There's nothing that requires them to put out those reports.\" Maggie Fox ",

Guzman, 59, arrived overnight from Mexico , where he'd escaped prison twice before authorities agreed to ship him north. Federal grand juries in a half-dozen American cities have indicted him over the years, but the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn is getting the first crack at prosecution ?\u2014 with help from counterparts in Miami. Related: A History of the Notorious Sinaloa Cartel Guzman stood unshackled before a federal judge and pleaded not guilty to 17 counts covering nearly a quarter-century of drug trafficking, including the operation of a continuing criminal enterprise. He said through an interpreter that he understood the charges, and left the courtroom without looking to the gallery packed with law enforcement agents. Officials declined to say where Guzman was being held. Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman appears before a judge in this courtroom sketch from Jan. 20, 2017. Christine Cornell Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said he made a special trip to MacArthur Airport on Long Island to see Guzman get off the plane. \"As you looked into his eyes you could see the surprise, you could see the shock, and to a certain extent you could actually see the fear as the realization began to kick in that he's about to face American justice,\" Melendez said. Authorities said that if Guzman went to trial, they'd call about 40 witnesses who'd paint a detailed portrait of how the Sinaloa organization operated. Guzman's court-appointed lawyers said they would work to ensure he got a fair trial, and suggested they'd challenge the methods by which he was brought to the United States. \"We look forward to addressing the allegations, that will include whether Mr. Chapo was extradited appropriately,\" one of the lawyers, Michael Schneider, said. U.S. authorities first sought to extradite Guzman in 2014, when he was arrested after more than a decade on the lam. Mexico resisted, saying national sovereignty compelled the country to deliver justice itself. Related: Who is 'El Chapo?' A Look at the Master of the Underground Tunnel That changed after Guzman, who'd escaped a Mexican prison in 2001 by hiding in a laundry cart, humiliated authorities again by tunneling out of the maximum security Altiplano prison in July 2015. Guzman was recaptured six months later, undone by an uncharacteristically reckless move: seeking out filmmakers, including Sean Penn, to help make a biographical film. Related: Rare Courting of Hollywood Spelled Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman's Doom U.S. and Mexican authorities have worked closely in recent years to capture Guzman, with the Obama administration sharing sophisticated intelligence and law-enforcement firepower, including satellites and wiretaps. But U.S. officials remained concerned about sharing too much information with Mexican authorities in light of documented evidence that some have secretly fed that intelligence back to Mexico's powerful drug trafficking organizations \u2014 including the Sinaloa cartel.

Assistant Deputy Fire Commissioner John McNicholas speaks to the media following an emergency call. (WGN-TV / Chicago Tribune) Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Six Chicago police officers have been given suspensions for giving favorable treatment to a high-ranking Chicago Fire Department official who was allegedly driving drunk when he crashed his city-issued vehicle off North Lake Shore Drive last April, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. The officers, including three supervisors, were suspended by police Superintendent Eddie Johnson for \"improper processing and reporting procedures\" for mishandling the crash involving then-Deputy Fire Commissioner John McNicholas, the source said. Word of the suspensions come about a week after the U.S. Justice Department issued a scathing report that criticized Chicago police for, among other things, of failing to hold officers accountable for wrongdoing. The suspensions for the six officers ranged from five to 20 days without pay, but four of the officers are appealing their suspensions. The crash took place a little before 1 a.m. on April 20 on LaSalle Street just west of Lake Shore Drive while McNicholas was off-duty. McNicholas had a blood-alcohol content of 0.154 percent -- nearly twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent, according to city records obtained by the Tribune under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. But internal investigators with the Fire Department didn't conduct the Breathalyzer test until 4:32 a.m., more than three hours after the crash, the records show. Initially, police only issued a traffic ticket to McNicholas for failing to reduce speed. But in June, he was ticketed for driving under the influence of alcohol after the Cook County state's attorney's office declined to charge McNicholas with a felony. ",

In this photo provided U.S. law enforcement, authorities escort Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman from a private plane to a waiting caravan of SUVs at MacArthur Airport on Long Island on Jan. 19, 2017. (U.S. law enforcement via AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter In a scene U.S. authorities had dreamed of for decades, Mexican drug lord and escape artist Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman was hauled into an American courtroom Friday and then taken away to an ultra-secure jail that has held some of the world's most dangerous terrorists and mobsters. Holding his unshackled hands behind his back, a dazed-looking Guzman quietly entered a not-guilty plea to drug trafficking and other charges at a Brooklyn courthouse ringed by squad cars, officers with assault rifles, and bomb-sniffing dogs. \"He's a man known for a life of crime, violence, death and destruction, and now he'll have to answer for that,\" Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said at a news conference. The court appearance came hours after Guzman's Thursday night extradition from Mexico, where he had become something of a folk hero for two brazen prison escapes. Mexico extradites 'El Chapo' SEGOB A photo made available by the Mexican Secretariat of the Interior shows alleged drug trafficker Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman being escorted by security officials during his transfer to the United States at the airport in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. A photo made available by the Mexican Secretariat of the Interior shows alleged drug trafficker Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman being escorted by security officials during his transfer to the United States at the airport in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. (SEGOB) Guzman, who is in his 50s, was ordered held without bail in a special Manhattan jail unit where other high-risk inmates \u2014 including Mafia boss John Gotti and several close associates of Osama bin Laden \u2014 spent their time awaiting trial. \"It is difficult to imagine another person with a greater risk of fleeing prosecution,\" prosecutors wrote in court papers. Prosecutors described Guzman as the murderous overseer of a three-decade campaign of smuggling, brutality and corruption that made his Sinaloa cartel a fortune while fueling an epidemic of cocaine abuse and related violence in the U.S. in the 1980s and '90s. Guzman faces the possibility of life in prison. To get Mexico to hand him over, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. They are also demanding he forfeit $14 billion in assets. Outside court, Guzman defense attorney Michael Schneider said: \"I haven't seen any evidence that indicates to me that Mr. Guzman's done anything wrong.\" He also said he would look into whether his client was extradited properly to New York. Mexico extradites 'El Chapo' SEGOB A photo made available by the Mexican Secretariat of the Interior shows Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman arriving in Long Island from Mexico, where he is received by U.S. authorities on Jan. 19, 2017. A photo made available by the Mexican Secretariat of the Interior shows Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman arriving in Long Island from Mexico, where he is received by U.S. authorities on Jan. 19, 2017. (SEGOB) The U.S. has been trying to get custody of Guzman since he was first indicted in California in the early 1990s. American authorities finally got their wish on the eve of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration, though it was not clear if the timing of the extradition was intended as a sign of respect to the Republican or some kind of slap, perhaps an effort to let outgoing President Barack Obama take the credit. When Guzman got off a plane in New York, \"as you looked into his eyes, you could see the surprise, you could see the shock, and to a certain extent, you could see the fear, as the realization kicked in that he's about to face American justice,\" said Angel Melendez, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. While Guzman faces federal charges in several U.S. states, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn won the jockeying to get the case. The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn has substantial experience prosecuting international drug cartel cases and was once led by outgoing U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. New York City also boasts one of the most secure lockups in the United States, the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. The drab-looking building is protected by steel barricades that can stop up to 7 1/2 tons of speeding truck, and the area is watched by cameras capable of reading a newspaper a block away.

See more videos The jail's inmates have included Ramzi Yousef, who was the architect of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Ponzi king Bernard Madoff. In the special high-security wing for the riskiest inmates, around a dozen prisoners spend 23 hours a day in roughly 20-by-12-foot cells, prohibited from communicating with one another. Meals are eaten in cells, and exercise is in a recreation area specifically for these inmates. Only a limited number of carefully vetted jailers would be allowed access to an inmate with Guzman's wealth and potential to corrupt people, said Catherine Linaweaver, a former Metropolitan Correction Center warden who retired in 2014. The special unit's strict confinement drew criticism from the human rights group Amnesty International in 2011. The jail saw an audacious escape attempt in 1982, when two armed people in a hijacked sightseeing helicopter tried to pluck an inmate off a roof. Four years earlier, three prisoners broke out by cutting through window bars. Guzman, whose nickname means \"Shorty,\" presided over a syndicate that funneled tons of cocaine from South America into the U.S. via tunnels, tanker trucks, planes, container ships, speedboats and even submarines, prosecutors said. Initially arrested in 1993, he broke out of a maximum-security Mexican prison in 2001, apparently in a laundry cart, and became a folk legend among some Mexicans, immortalized in song. He was caught in 2014 but escaped again, this time through a hole in his prison cell shower. A specially rigged motorcycle on rails whisked him to freedom through a mile-long tunnel. He was recaptured in a January 2016 shootout that killed five associates. Associated Press ",

Apparently,\u00a0 according to the folks over at Slate, the background picture initially posted above was from Obama's 2009 inauguration. That image was quickly\u00a0switched out for a seemingly\u00a0generic American flag, which was then swapped out for a picture of Trump. It's official: President Donald Trump Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to President Trump. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas swore in Vice President Pence. \"Together, we will determine the course of America and the world, for many many years to come,\" Trump said, adding that despite obstacles ahead, \"We will get the job done.\" He went on to rip Washington elites and said the transfer of power was not just from one administration and one party to another but from Washington to the people. \"The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans,\" he said. The newly minted president pledged that \"from this day forward, it's going to be only\u00a0America first, America first ... every decision ... will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\" Read the full speech here . The what? There was one particular turn of phrase that sparked something of a maelstrom on Twitter. As Trump was describing families trapped in poverty, rusted-out factories, an education system \"flushed with cash\" but failing students, and crime and gangs and drugs, he backed it up with this line. \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" he said. \u2014 James Pethokoukis (@JimPethokoukis) January 20, 2017 George W.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2017 Trump\u2019s backstage surprise Twenty-four-year-old Shane Bouvet is a FedEx courier from Illinois who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign and is wearing a suit purchased by a friend and donated shoes for the inaugural festivities, according to The Washington Post, whose profile of Bouvet prompted\u00a0Trump to invite\u00a0him backstage at a dinner event Thursday. What happened next is kind of awesome. After @realDonaldTrump read this story in the @washingtonpost by @jjouvenal https://t.co/E7qoM19p74 - watch who he invited backstage today. pic.twitter.com/8GamUvLjq3 \u2014 Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) January 20, 2017 Not the 45th! Our David Jackson, White House reporter extraordinaire, emails with one of his \"pet peeves\": While Donald Trump will be the 45th president, he will be only the 44th person \u2014 the 44th male \u2014 to actually hold the job. Recall that President Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms: He won election in 1884, lost in 1888, and won again in 1892 \u2014 so he is considered both the 22nd and 24th president. OK, then. The ultimate inauguration reading list \u2022\u00a0Take a trip down memory lane (or back to history class) with Jackson's rundown of the best and worst inaugural addresses . Paul Singer takes a look at a\u00a0 new interactive from Google \u00a0that looks at common themes in inaugural addresses. \u2022 Assess Obama's legacy with this detailed tick-tock from\u00a0Rick Hampson\u00a0of Jan. 20, 2009, in the hours before Obama became president. \u2022 How the heck does the White House deal with logistics of one president moving out and the next president moving right in? Emily Brown has the details . \u2022\u00a0And, finally, take our quiz to find out how much you know about inauguration history (because obviously everyone remembers which poem Robert Frost recited at JFK's 1961\u00a0inauguration, right?).

MSF hide caption toggle caption MSF The aftermath of a bombing by the Nigerian military at an internally displaced person camps in Rann, Nigeria. MSF Doctors Without Borders says that the death toll has risen to \"about 90\" from a Nigerian military airstrike Tuesday on a displaced persons camps in the country's restive Borno state. Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari has said that the bombing happened during an operation targeting Boko Haram militants and was accidental. The aid group, also known by its French acronym MSF, initially counted 52 dead from the bombing. Now, it says the death toll may actually be significantly higher than its most recent count of 90, based on reports from residents and community leaders. \"The majority of the victims were women and children,\" it added.

Nigerian Military Strike Kills Dozens In Displaced Persons Camp The Rann camp houses some 25,000 people who have fled from their homes, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, amid a major ongoing military offensive against Boko Haram. Humanitarian organizations have evacuated some 100 injured people from the camp to Maiduguri city for further treatment, according to the ICRC. An ICRC surgeon said in a statement that some 68 patients were expected to be operated on by tomorrow. \"People had sought safety in what they thought was a protected site\u2014instead they were bombed by those who were meant to safeguard them,\" Jochum added. Since the military airstrike, the camp has seen more violence \u2013 this time from the militants. According to the Associated Press, \"More than 100 Boko Haram fighters launched the attack Thursday evening, and soldiers battled for hours trying to repel them.\" The extent of the damage is not yet clear.

    "text": "Delaware Welcomes Joe Biden Home After Decades in Washington By randall chase, associated press WILMINGTON, Del. \u0097 Jan 20, 2017, 6:34 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Former VP Joe Biden Addresses Hometown Crowd 0 Shares Email On his last day as vice president, Joe Biden briefly revived a tradition he had followed faithfully as a U.S. senator for Delaware : He rode the commuter train home from Washington. Biden and his wife, Jill, hopped aboard an Amtrak train bound for Wilmington after attending the inauguration of President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday. Marching band members and alumni from Biden's alma mater, the University of Delaware, joined scores of uniformed Delaware National Guard troops, schoolchildren and hundreds of other well-wishers to greet the Bidens at a celebration on Wilmington's riverfront, a stone's throw from the Amtrak station that bears his name. \"We never thought we left home,\" a subdued Biden said as he began his speech, quickly becoming emotional. \"When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,\" he added, wiping away tears. Delawareans, in turn, have embraced the man they know simply as \"Joe,\" who stayed long after Friday's ceremony to press the flesh, sign autographs and take dozens of selfies with enthusiastic supporters. \"It's amazing how the state has embraced my family,\" he told the Associated Press in an interview afterward. \"I was proud to be elected vice president, but nothing as proud as seven times, the people of Delaware voted for me for the Senate. ... They know me, warts and all.\" Johanna Peet, 32, said people are obsessed with Biden and his family. \"I think it's because he's vulnerable as a man, and as a leader and as a politician,\" she said, adding that the Bidens \"make the effort to connect and make the effort to get to know you as an individual.\" After 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president, the 74-year-old Biden finds himself stepping away from the spotlight after almost half a century of public service, starting with his election to county council in 1970. \"I'm not going to go back to being a private citizen,\" he told the AP. \"I'm going to keep going full bore on all the things I cared about, ... both in foreign policy, domestic policy as well as the cancer moonshot.\" Biden's eldest son, Beau, died of cancer in 2015. Biden thanked the crowd for their support over the years, not just in politics, but in times of tragedy, including the death of his wife and infant daughter in a car crash just weeks after his election to the Senate. \"You've been with me in victory. You've been with me in defeat. You've all stayed with me,\" he said. 0 Shares ",

While the release of tax returns is not required by law, Trump has defied 40 years of presidential tradition by refusing to voluntarily release his, saying that it would be inappropriate while they're under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. \"The only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters,\" Trump said in a news conference in New York this month. The Trump administration retained Obama's rules for the petition site: If a petition gathers\u00a0100,000 signature in 30 days, the White House will review the\u00a0petition, make sure and issue an official response. As of Friday evening, it already had more than 25,000 signatures. A second petition had a similar theme: \"Divest or put in a blind trust all of the President's business and financial assets.\" Read more: A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
