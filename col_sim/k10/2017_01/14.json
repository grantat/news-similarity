    "text": "Protesters planning to blockade inauguration checkpoints, 'party' outside Pence home By Cristina Corbin Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 An anti-Donald Trump group is planning massive disruptions for next week's inauguration covering everything from \"blockades\" at security checkpoints to a \"dance party\" outside VP-elect Mike Pence's house, according to group leaders as well as newly obtained audio of their apparent plans.\u00a0 The organization #DisruptJ20\u00a0already announced at a press conference Thursday its various plans to wreak havoc at Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration and in the days leading up to it. A conservative group also shared with FoxNews.com what it said was audio from a Jan. 8\u00a0#DisruptJ20 meeting at a Washington church,\u00a0giving even greater insight into the group's planned D.C. \"shutdown.\"\u00a0 The audio, recorded by Trevor Loudon with Capital Research Center, purports to show a female member detailing plans to \"do everything we can to try and stop people\u00a0from being able to access the inauguration.\"\u00a0 This begins with what was described as a \"pure dance party at Mike Pence\u2019s house\" on Jan. 18.\u00a0 \"It\u2019s his last few days living in\u00a0Chevy Chase before he moves into the vice presidential residence, and\u00a0we\u2019re going to send him off with a bang,\" the woman says in the audio.\u00a0 Then she says the group is turning its attention toward the pro-Trump \"DeploraBall\" the following day, which she describes as the \"alt-right neo-Nazi ... party to celebrate Trump.\" \"We're gonna crash it,\" she says.\u00a0 That takes the group into inauguration morning, when members say they plan to block entrance points as well as roads and transportation.\u00a0 \"We\u2019re\u00a0going to be doing blockades,\" the woman says in the audio. \"We\u2019re going to [be] blockading checkpoints\u00a0into the security zones. We're also going to\u00a0be\u00a0blockading roads\u00a0and\u00a0other modes of transit into the city.\"\u00a0 At 10 a.m. that day, the group is planning an \"anti-Capitalist, anti-fascist bloc\" that \"will be an unpermitted march\u00a0that will be leaving from Logan Square.\"\u00a0 A #DisruptJ20 spokeswoman confirmed to FoxNews.com on Friday that the group laid out these plans at the Jan. 8 meeting, which she described as public and well-attended.\u00a0 Defending the group's agenda, she said: \"We're exercising our freedom of speech and really want to set a tone for the next few years that there's a massive body of people ... who are very concerned about the dangerous direction Donald Trump is taking our country in.\"\u00a0 The Jan. 8 remarks also track with what members said at Thursday's press conference.\u00a0 #DisruptJ20 members openly described plans to blockade checkpoints. One organizer told Fox News he hopes to \u201cturn the inauguration into as big of a clusterf--- as possible.\u201d Another group,\u00a0ANSWER Coalition, is also planning to protest the inauguration but with a somewhat different agenda. The group said it's galvanizing tens of thousands of people at permitted locations -- like Freedom Plaza and the Navy Memorial -- to march and protest in a more traditional way. The #DisruptJ20 audio was obtained by Dangerous Documentaries, a project of the Capital Research Center, as part of its upcoming documentary on left-wing protesters, \"America Under Siege: Civil War 2017.\" The film is set for release before Inauguration Day. \u00a0 Fox News' Griff Jenkins contributed to this report.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

According to the DOJ, Takata -- which supplies airbag parts to Honda, Toyota and other auto manufacturers \u2013- falsified reports to conceal failures during testing, including repeated ruptures of ammonium nitrate inflators, which can spew shrapnel into the cab of a vehicle. Even after the ruptures began to cause injury and deaths on the roadways, the DOJ said company executives continued to withhold accurate testing data. \"Takata was supposed to be selling products that saved lives, not pushing into the marketplace products that increased the risk of harm to consumers,\" said Sandra Moser, of the Justice Department Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section. \"Time and again, it put profit and production schedules ahead of people's safety.\" Takata will have to pay $150 million -- $125 million in victim compensation and another $25 million in criminal fines -\u2013 in the next 30 days. The remainder -- $850 million \u2013- will be distributed over time to the automakers forced to replace the faulty inflators. \"If it\u2019s true, shame on them,\" said Corey Burdick, who lost his eye after the driver\u2019s side airbag in his Honda Accord ruptured, sending a 3-inch long jagged piece of metal into his face. \"They killed a lot of people and they hurt a lot of people.\" Some victim advocates are concerned the settlement pays too much to the automakers, and doesn\u2019t set aside enough for those injured by the inflators \u2013 especially because the number of victims could increase as long as defective products remain unrepaired in cars. More than 60 million inflators in 42 million vehicles either have been or will be recalled, but due to a scarcity of replacement parts, just 12.5 million have been repaired to date, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Three of the company\u2019s top executives -- Shinichi Tanaka, Hideo Nakajima and Tsuneo Chikaraishi \u2013 were indicted for their role in the scandal. Today\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of another major auto industry settlement: On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced Volkswagen will pay $4.3 billion and plead guilty in its diesel emissions scandal. The company has admitted they installed \"defeat devices\" designed to cheat U.S. emissions tests in about half a million cars nationwide. 0 Shares ",

The Caucus of Working Educators, a faction of the teachers union, is developing lessons plans and curriculum ideas for teachers of grades from kindergarten through high school for the week of Jan. 23. The plans, distilled from the movement's 13 guiding principles, such as embracing diversity and globalism, will be available online , organizers said Friday. \"The vast majority of students that we serve are black, and it's important to affirm the lives of our students,\" said co-organizer Charlie McGeehan, who is white and teaches high school humanities at The U School, where students work on solving real-world problems. The organizers said more and more educators are signing on every day, but they don't have an exact number of participating teachers. \"We had 500 buttons and shirts and distributed those and ordered more,\" McGeehan said. Amy Roat, who teaches English as a Second Language at Feltonville School of Arts and Sciences, said the idea is to engage students in current events and help them learn about other people. Most of her students are Latino, Asian and Arab-American. \"We are a school that is very inclusive and we talk about a lot of good, juicy stuff,\" she said. \"Black Lives Matter functions with 13 principles that I think are good and healthy for kids to learn about.\" She said she hasn't heard any complaints or gotten any blowback from teachers, principals or parents. Roat, who is white, said they planned the curriculum for a week after Martin Luther King Day , to build off the momentum of marches, protest and actions. Talk of developing the curriculum got started in October, after a school district in Seattle had a \"Black Lives Matter at School\" day, McGeehan said. \"We were inspired,\" he said. A school district spokesman didn't comment directly on the caucus's plans but said the district provides regular avenues for students to learn and express themselves. A spokesman for the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, the main teachers union, said it couldn't comment on the plans because it wasn't a union-sponsored activity. The Black Lives Matter movement largely emerged in 2014 after several high-profile killings of unarmed black men and boys by police officers. It has since evolved from its social media presence and protests in multiple cities to a national platform with a policy agenda that also addresses issues including mass incarceration, and systemic inequality against African-Americans. For McGeehan, he plans to incorporate the materials during his 40-minute advisory period, and can see ways it could come up in English and social studies classes. \"We want to show the complexity and diversity of the Black Lives Matter movement,\" he said. \u2014\u2014\u2014 ",

Michael Lynton is stepping down as chief executive of Sony Entertainment to focus on his new role as chairman of Los Angeles-based Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. (Toshifumi Kitamura / AFP/Getty Images) Ryan Faughnder Contact Reporter Michael Lynton, who led Sony Pictures Entertainment through a massive cyberattack and a period of mounting struggles at the box office, is leaving his job. Lynton, 57, who has held the top spot at the Culver City movie and television studio for 13 years, will step down as Chief Executive of Sony Entertainment on Feb. 2 in order to focus his energies on social messaging service Snapchat , where he is chairman of the board, the company said Friday. The owner of the Los Angeles-based social media company is preparing for an initial public stock offering. Sony has not named a replacement. Lynton\u2019s exit is the latest corporate upheaval at Sony, which has spent the last two years recovering from a weak film slate and the massive 2014 cyberattack that exposed countless executive emails that contributed to the departure of leaders, including then-studio chief Amy Pascal. Sony film group business affairs executive Andrew Gumpert left the studio in November to become chief operating officer at rival Paramount Pictures. Last year, Sony underwent a big shakeup with the sudden departure of its longtime TV boss, Steve Mosko, and Columbia Pictures head Doug Belgrad. Lynton's departure was driven by the growing dissatisfaction of parent company Sony Corp. with the studio\u2019s weak box-office returns, a person close to the studio said. \"They are increasingly impatient with the poor performance of the studio,\" said the person, who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. \"I think they just had it.\u201d Sony executives also had repeatedly heard complaints from Sony executives about the sharp-elbowed management style of Tom Rothman, whom Lynton tapped in February 2015 to run the studio after the departure of Amy Pascal.\u00a0 Sony\u2019s recent release, \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk,\u201d used advanced technology and cost $40 million to make, but grossed less than $2 million in the U.S. and Canada. Last year, Sony ranked fifth out of the six major studios in terms of domestic box-office market share. \"Sony\u00a0as a company has been troubled during the last couple of years,\" said Jeffrey Cole, \u00a0director of the Center for the Digital Future at USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\u00a0\u201cWith the exception of their television unit, they just can't seem to get their footing.\" Lynton and Rothman were unavailable for comment. Once he leaves his post, Lynton will stay on as co-CEO for six months to work with Tokyo-based Sony Corp. CEO Kazuo Hirai to find a successor. Hirai, in a memo to employees obtained by The Times, praised Lynton\u2019s leadership of the company, but acknowledged the struggles that have hobbled the movie business. \u201cWe recognize current challenges in the motion pictures business and its turnaround will take some time,\u201d Hirai said. \u201cAs we look to the future, we feel strongly that our entertainment businesses are essential parts of Sony.\u201d Lynton has also had oversight of the Japanese company\u2019s record label Sony Music Entertainment for the last several years. Sony Music has also gone through big recent management changes. Longtime Sony Music CEO Doug Morris will transition to\u00a0a chairman role this year, making way for new chief Rob Stringer. Lynton\u2019s focus on Snapchat maker Snap Inc. could be increasing because the company is in a pivotal year. It has signaled an intention to hold an initial public offering of stock in the coming weeks. Showing investors the company can produce significant profit is no easy feat though. Snap now relies on advertising in a disappearing video-sharing app for revenue, with about $1 billion expected this year. Lynton could be playing a role in shaping Snap\u2019s ambitions and crafting its message to investors. For instance, the company is working with major TV production studios on shows exclusively streaming on Snapchat. Lynton has been on Snap\u2019s board for nearly four years and has long been an intermediary between the start-up and the worlds of finance and entertainment. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, 26, and Lynton became confidants after Lynton's wife, Jamie, was amazed by the addiction to Snapchat displayed by kids at a family wedding. She invited Spiegel to dinner one day in 2012 and subsequently invested in Snapchat. \u201cI have been involved with Evan and Snapchat since its early days, and given its growth since then, decided the time was right to transition and focus on my role as chairman of the board of Snap Inc.,\u201d Lynton said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cI leave Sony with great pride in all we have accomplished together.\u201d Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Caption Casey Affleck finds the words in 'Manchester by the Sea' Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Casey Affleck talks about the way Kenneth Lonergan uses everyday language to convey deep emotion in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Caption Natalie Portman on the importance of the infamous pink dress in 'Jackie' For her role as Jackie Kennedy, Natalie Portman says, \"It's not a fashion story,\" but the clothes do tell a story.

    "text": "By: MMAjunkie Staff | January 13, 2017 5:30 pm Follow @MMAjunkie That didn\u2019t take long: Floyd Mayweather didn\u2019t exactly give an outright \u201cNo deal\u201d to UFC President Dana White\u2019s $25 million offer to box Conor McGregor . But it\u2019s safe to assume the boxing legend is pretty far from signing on the dotted line for that number. TMZ today asked Mayweather if he had a response to White\u2019s offer, which also came today on \u201cThe Herd\u201d with Colin Cowherd on FS1. Mayweather called the UFC boss a \u201ccomedian,\u201d then invited TMZ to take a look at the watch he just bought \u2013 a Hublot Laferrari that\u00a0can hit the $350,000\u00a0range. When TMZ tried to get an answer from Mayweather a second time, he asked the site again to check out his watch, then had his driver pull away. (Editor\u2019s note: The video clip below contains strong language.) Earlier today, White said Mayweather\u2019s recent offer to have McGregor, the UFC\u2019s lightweight champion, get $15 million to Mayweather\u2019s $100 million for a boxing match was off base. Instead, he offered Mayweather $25 million for each fighter, plus a discussion about a portion of the pay-per-view buys. The fantasy crossover matchup had been considered just that \u2013\u00a0fantasy \u2013 until White today came out with his offer. At a pre-fight media scrum for UFC 207 in December, White said Mayweather and McGregor essentially each were keeping the discussion alive to promote themselves. White typically has indicated the fight never would happen, particularly because McGregor is under contract with the UFC. Mayweather recently retired from boxing undefeated at 49-0. McGregor in November won the UFC\u2019s lightweight title to become the first to hold two belts simultaneously. Two weeks later, the UFC removed his featherweight title, keeping him in the lightweight division. But with a baby on the way for his girlfriend, he is expected to sit out the better part 2017 \u2013 which led the UFC to put an interim lightweight title up for grabs at UFC 209 in March.

    "text": "WATCH Parents Who Found Missing Daughter on Backpage Fight for Justice: Part 1 0 Shares Email \u201cThose children were sold, and they simply tried to sanitize it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the definition of evil\ufffd?, said Sen. Claire McCaskill , glaring at the five company executives sitting in front of her. Jan. 10 was a day of reckoning on Capitol Hill for the controversial classified site Backpage.com, as the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a new report saying that Backpage had knowingly facilitated underage trafficking on its site by actively editing ads posted in the \u201cadult services\ufffd? section. The website\u2019s top executives were subpoenaed to attend a hearing where the Subcommittee, led by Sen. Rob Portman , R-Ohio, and McCaskill, D-Missouri, laid out their findings, which were based on over a million pages of internal company documents. For parents Tom and Nacole, this was a day they dreamed would come. Their daughter, who ABC News is calling \"Natalie,\" was repeatedly sold for sex on Backpage.com when she was only 15 years old. \u201cThey took everything from my little girl,\ufffd? said Tom, who asked that ABC News not use his family\u2019s surname. Tom and Nacole traveled halfway across the country to testify at this Senate hearing, hoping that sharing their story may lead to Backpage being held accountable. High Court Won't Hear Appeal Over Backpage.com Escort Ads Based in Dallas, Backpage.com is a basic classifieds ad website where people can sell cars, furniture and other items, but the vast majority of their revenue comes from their racy adult section, with categories like \u201cescorts\ufffd? and \u201cbody rubs\ufffd? -- technically legal services that law enforcement describes as a thinly veiled code for prostitution. For over a year, ABC News \u201cNightline\ufffd? has been conducting an investigation into the problem of underage sex trafficking through ads on Backpage.com and the efforts to stop it. \u201cNightline\ufffd? first met Tom, Nacole and their daughter Natalie last spring. Natalie ran away from home at age 15, and ended up falling into the hands of a pimp. She says she was forced into prostitution over 100 times, and believes that Backpage.com made it possible for her pimp to sell her for sex over and over again. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. It\u2019s too simple\ufffd? she said. \u201c[Backpage] asks if you\u2019re eighteen or older. I mean a simple yes click was about as far as that went.\ufffd? The U.S. Senate has been investigating underage trafficking on Backpage for years and this week, the hearing marked a major breakthrough. The Subcommittee found that Backpage wasn\u2019t just hosting adult ads people posted on their site, it was actively editing them -- erasing words that would indicate underage trafficking. Through their automatic word filtering system, the site would erase terms like \u201cLolita, \u201cLittle Girl\ufffd? and even \u201c Amber Alert \ufffd? from ads posted in the \u2018adult\u2019 section. They would then post the \"cleaned up\" ads to the site anyway. \u201cThe fact that these terms were stripped out through this screening process does not mean that that girls age was magically changed,\" Sen. Portman told Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer during the hearing. \u201cIn fact, what you have done, of course, is to cover up the fact that many underage girls were sold on your site, making it harder for law enforcement, parents and committed aid groups to find those kids who need help.\ufffd? One by one, Ferrer, co-founders Jim Larkin and Mike Lacey, and other Backpage executives refused to testify at the hearing. On their social media accounts, Backpage called the Senate investigation a violation of their First Amendment rights. Backpage\u2019s argument is based on a law called the Communications Decency Act, or CDA. The law protects all internet hosting companies, including Backpage, from being held legally responsible for what users post on their websites. \u201c[The law] protects freedom of speech on the internet,\ufffd? explained ABC News senior legal correspondent Sunny Hostin. \u201cIf you have someone selling a stolen car on your website and you don\u2019t know that the car is stolen, you are not responsible for the selling of a stolen vehicle.\ufffd? In the past, many underage girls who say they were trafficked on Backpage have tried suing the site. But so far, nearly every lawsuit has been dismissed under the CDA. However, many believe the Senate\u2019s findings could mean that Backpage would no longer be protected by this law because they engaged in actively changing content. \u201cI think it potentially means liability,\" Hostin said. \"When you proactively, and actively decide to filter out certain terms, that\u2019s a game changer because you\u2019re talking about active participation.\" Just hours before the hearing, Backpage shut down its entire adult services section, replacing the pages with a banner saying, \u201cThe government has unconstitutionally censored this content.\ufffd? \u201cIn terms of their action last night to shut down their adult section\u2026 obviously that was a vindication of our report. And it was not censorship. No one told them to do that,\ufffd? Portman told \u201cNightline.\ufffd? Backpage has repeatedly claimed that they are part of the solution, not the problem. The company told ABC News in a previous statement that it employs moderators who diligently screen ads to stop underage trafficking on its site. They added that they have voluntarily undertaken a multi-tiered \"policing system to prohibit and report attempts at human exploitation and the advertisement of prostitution\" that screens for words and phrases that might \"suggest illegal activity.\" The company also said it actively cooperates with law enforcement and reports suspicious ads to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC. In 2012, their attorney Liz McDougall told \u201cNightline,\ufffd? that \u201conline human trafficking exists\u2026 and the best tools to fight it are online, and Backpage.com is currently one of the very best tools to fight it.\ufffd? But NCMEC Senior Counsel Yiota Souras takes issue with Backpage\u2019s claim. \u201cI don't think you can be in the business of providing basically an online bazaar for escort ads that includes the purchase and sale of children for sex, and say that you are online to help fight the problem\ufffd? she said. Backpage, which was owned by Village Voice media until 2012, was sold to an \u201cunnamed Dutch holding company\ufffd? in December 2014, according to news articles at the time. It was later revealed that this mysterious holding company was owned by Ferrer. \u201cNightline\ufffd? discovered that he seemed to be running several similar websites from Amsterdam, like NakedCity.com and EvilEmpire.com. \u201cNightline\ufffd? also discovered he was running a site called \u201cCracker\ufffd? that was extremely similar to Backpage and available almost everywhere except the United States. Ferrer has declined \u201cNightline\u2019s\ufffd? repeated requests for interview, and when we tracked Ferrer to a classified ad industry conference in Amsterdam last year, he again refused to speak with us. One former Backpage employee agreed to speak with \u201cNightline\" under the condition that her identity not be revealed. Her account echoed the testimony of other employees interviewed for the Senate report. Her job was to moderate ads to make sure they didn\u2019t contain pictures or certain terms indicating prostitution or underage trafficking. \u201cThe way they described the job as a moderating is that we would be monitoring ads that came through the site for our adult content section,\ufffd? she said. \u201cThe ads were basically, \u2018Hey come have a good time with honey\u2026 \u2018no rain coats,\u2019 would be code word for \u2018no condoms\u2026 \u2018in town for one night only, come see me.\u2019\ufffd? \u201cAnd these ads would be so cheap that they would post them constantly,\ufffd? she continued. \u201cSo if the ad did get deleted, they would take $5 and post five more ads of the same one. So it becomes really frustrating because you know you just deleted this ad and 10 minutes later, you\u2019re seeing it again.\ufffd? At the Senate hearing, both Tom and Nacole took the witness stand to tell their story. \u201cI can only tell you that when we finally got Natalie back for good, months later, the young girl we found wasn't the same Natalie that had left our home months earlier,\ufffd? Nacole testified. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s simple\ufffd? Tom said. \u201cWhat happened to my daughter on Backpage.com is criminal.\ufffd? At the hearing, Souras told \"Nightline\" that the hearing was \"a game changer.\" \"I think it lays bare [Backpage\u2019s] level of knowledge about what they were dealing with. And how they chose to deal with criminal acts-- the selling of children for sex,\ufffd? she said. As far as Backpage\u2019s self-imposed shutdown, Souras is skeptical. \u201cWho knows what that means, who knows if they\u2019ll be back up tomorrow,\ufffd? she said. In fact, \u201cNightline\ufffd? discovered that very quickly after Backpage\u2019s adult section was shuttered, ads began springing up in the \u2018men seeking women\u2019 dating section of the site that looked very similar to the ads that were usually posted in the escort section. Some sex trafficking groups have spoken out against Backpage\u2019s shutdown. Dr, Lois Lee, the founder and president of Children of the Night, said in a statement that Backpage \u201cwas a critical investigative took depended on by America\u2019s vice detectives and agents in the field to locate and recover missing children.\ufffd? Other groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation take exception to the Senate going after the website\u2019s hosting operations, saying the \u201cinvasive inquiry into Backpage.com\u2019s editorial practices\u2026 creates an intense chilling effect\u2026 for any website operator seeking to define their own\u2026 moderation procedures for the third-party content they host.\ufffd? Legal questions may still be up for debate. The Senate Subcommittee is considering referring the case to the Department of Justice. \u201cEven under current law, I believe that this evidence of illegality should lead to a successful prosecution,\ufffd? Sen. Portman said. Last October, the California Attorney General charged Carl Ferrer, James Larkin, and Mike Lacey with pimping -- charges which were later dismissed due to the Communications Decency Act. They have now filed new charges against Backpage, citing new evidence. The site\u2019s attorneys say they will fight these charges. As for Tom, Nacole, and their daughter Natalie, they\u2019re also waiting for their day in court. Natalie is part of a civil lawsuit against Backpage, one that focuses on the claim that Backpage was editing ads. Her lawyers hope that the revelations in the new Senate report could help them to win her case. After the hearing, Tom told \u201cNightline\ufffd? their fight against Backpage is far from over. \u201cNot until they\u2019re indicted and go to jail,\ufffd? he said. 0 Shares ",

USA TODAY NETWORK House Speaker Paul Ryan walks to the House floor on Jan. 13, 2017. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON \u2014 House members passed a\u00a0resolution Friday paving the way for a swift repeal of Obamacare, following Senate passage on Thursday. The House voted 227-198 to approve the\u00a02017 budget resolution that instructs committees to write legislation repealing the law. No Democrats voted for the resolution. The repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- one of President Obama's signature accomplishments --\u00a0is a top goal for President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who point to rising premiums, high deductibles and fewer choices for patients as insurers pull out of the program. \"This\u00a0law is collapsing while we speak,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin on Friday. \"We have to step in before things get worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission.\" Leading up to the vote, some Republicans had expressed concerns about repealing the law without agreeing on a\u00a0replacement. But lawmakers voted almost entirely\u00a0along party lines, with only nine Republicans opposing the measure. Democrats repeatedly slammed Republicans for having no alternative plan, and they said\u00a0a repeal will jeopardize the health care of 30 million Americans. They\u00a0argue that a repeal will leave people with pre-existing medical conditions unable to find coverage, and increase the nation's budget deficit by $353 billion over the next 10 years as the tax and fee provisions that pay for Obamacare are gutted.

A Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy wears a picture of Sgt. Steve Owen, who was gunned down in Lancaster last month. The Sheriff's Department has arrested five people and accused them of helping the alleged gunman evade capture. (Brian van der Burg / Los Angeles Times) James Queally Contact Reporter Sheriff\u2019s detectives have arrested five people who they say helped a man evade police after he shot and killed a Los Angeles County Sheriff \u2019s sergeant last year. The suspects are accused of helping 27-year-old Trenton Trevon Lovell duck a massive police dragnet after he allegedly shot and killed Sgt. Steve Owen in Lancaster while he was responding to a burglary call on Oct. 5, according to a news release issued by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Owen, a 29-year department veteran, was responding to what appeared to be a routine burglary call on West Avenue J-7 in Lancaster when he confronted Lovell. Sheriff Jim McDonnell has said Lovell wounded Owen, then stood over his bloodied frame and fired an additional four shots.\u00a0 \u201cThis was a calculated execution,\u201d the sheriff said after the shooting. After the shooting, investigators say Lovell tried to steal Owen\u2019s patrol cruiser, causing a car crash. He then fled into a nearby home and held two teenagers hostage. One of the teens managed to get a message out to his family, and Lovell was arrested after fleeing out the home\u2019s back door. Lovell was also wounded in the shooting, police have said. \u201cThis was a calculated execution,\u201d the sheriff said. The gunman was carrying...

All five were captured on Thursday near their residences, authorities said. Investigators did not specify how the five attempted to aid in Lovell\u2019s escape.

For millions of Americans that means slippery highways, downed trees, lightning strikes and widespread power outages across the heartland, the National Weather Service warned. In icy Oklahoma, Gov. Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency in all 77 counties. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens did so on Thursday, calling up the National Guard and activating the state's Emergency Operations Center. State police said it was investigating a fatal traffic accident blamed on the weather south of Crystal City Friday. And the NFL announced it was moving Sunday's playoff game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Pittsburgh Steelers, which is being played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, from 1:05 p.m. ET to 8:20 p.m. ET to \"provide local authorities more time to clear roads in the area as the weather is expected to improve.\" Overnight Friday, the icy conditions were expected to spread across the Ohio Valley and over the Appalachians to the nation's capital, where preparations are already underway for President-elect Trump's inauguration next week. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) While not in the path of the nasty weather, dozens of flights in and out of Chicago's O'Hare Airport were cancelled Thursday due to icy conditions in the region. Blame the ice on a combination of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico sliding over the sub-freezing air currently blanketing the Midwest and Northeast, The Weather Channel reported. Meanwhile in Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency after it was buried by snowfall. \"As snow continues to accumulate and local authorities respond to provide core services and clear roadways, all available state resources will be made available to ensure the safety of communities throughout Oregon,\" Gov. Brown said. \"I urge all Oregonians to follow the recommendations of local authorities, and avoid travel.\" Eastern Oregon has been hit especially hard. More than two feet fell in Bend as of Wednesday, setting a new record, according to the NWS . Corky Siemaszko ",

During his Senate confirmation hearing Rex Tillerson, Trump's pick for Secretary of State, likened China's activities reclaiming land in disputed regions of the South China Sea to Russia's annexation of Ukraine. A man looks at a newsstand with a copy of the nationalistic Global Times tabloid displayed on a basket in Beijing, China, on April 5, 2016. Ng Han Guan / AP, file He added: \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" The prospect of the U.S. blocking China from accessing the islands it has built in the region drew a predictably furious response from the Global Times, a state-run newspaper and website that frequently publishes nationalistic and bombastic editorials on international affairs. \"Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories,\" the paper wrote in an editorial Friday . It added: \"Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.\" The paper's response was notable, both for its attention-grabbing threats, but also for how strongly it differed in tone from Beijing's official response. Chinese foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang paraphrased some of Tillerson's other remarks, saying: \"China and the U.S. have some differences but also share a lot of common interests and consensus, and we should see the positive dimensions in our relationship rather than let disagreements over other issues exclude areas for productive partnership.\" Chinese construction teams work on Johnson South Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Armed Forces Of The Philippines via The New York Times So how closely do the provocative editorials in the Global Times reflect the thinking inside the ruling party? \"The Global Times as a newspaper has its own way to respond to issues like this,\" Dr. Xin Xin, a reader at the Communication and Media Research Institute at the U.K.'s University of Westminster told NBC News. She added: \"Though it is part of a party organ \u2014 it follows different rules ... In terms of how it formulates the party's view, they have more flexibility. In order to generate readership it does adopt techniques you would be familiar with in Western newspapers.\" The paper's editor-in-chief, former army officer and Chinese Communist Party member Hu Xijin, claims the discrepancy can be attributed to his paper publishing what party officials privately think, but don't express publicly. In an interview with online news outlet Quartz , Hu said that he regularly spends time with officials from the foreign and security ministries, and that their views aligned with his paper's editorial stance. Other experts suggest that Global Times' controversial editorials should not be seen as a direct statement of the positions or intentions of the Chinese government, but as communications that reflect, and speak to, certain sections of both China's general population, as well as the ruling party and military. China's Liaoning aircraft carrier conducts a drill in the South China Sea in December. China Stringer Network / Reuters, file \"Global Times' editorials are used to assuage a nationalist demographic, which is generally young and extremely hawkish, at a time when nationalist passions are inflamed,\" Dr. Jonathan Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham told NBC News. \"What Tillerson said is effectively calling for a blockade \u2014 an action usually interpreted as an act of war. The Chinese government would be inviting trouble from this demographic if it didn't respond.\" Experts told NBC News that the Global Times has a \"substantial\" readership in China and that the paper would not pursue such an extreme editorial line if there was no demand for it. Estimates suggest that the Chinese-language edition of the paper sells between 1.5 and 2 million copies a day, while its English-language edition sells around 100,000. Its websites reportedly attract around 15 million visitors a day. The English-language edition of the paper is widely read by foreigners in China and beyond, resulting in its controversial pronouncements generating significant column inches in overseas media compared to other Chinese media outlets. Some commentators, however, suggest that Western media has an outsized perception of the paper's actual influence. A 2014 report by a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Western Australia found that only 0.8 percent of over 1,400 respondents in five Chinese cities said they got their information on the South China Sea dispute from the Global Times. Sullivan predicted that the Global Times will be an increasingly useful tool for China's government in the coming months. \"Beijing is still not sure how to interpret Team Trump, and does not want to respond with actions that could spiral,\" he said. \"It also still holds some hope that Trump's pronouncements are negotiating tactics rather than actual policy. Thus a response within the rhetorical arena is, for now, a useful tactic for China; which is where Global Times serves very well.\" Mark Hanrahan ",

    "text": "YouTube How much criticism can a single half-hour episode of television sustain before it gets the ax? On Friday, we may have gotten our answer: An episode of the British comedy series Urban Myths \u2014 which drew widespread complaints for featuring the white actor Joseph Fiennes as Michael Jackson \u2014 has been canceled by Sky TV before it could air. \"We have taken the decision not to broadcast 'Elizabeth, Michael and Marlon,' a half-hour episode from the Sky Arts 'Urban Myths' series, in light of the concerns expressed by Michael Jackson's immediate family,\" the European pay-TV company said in a statement . \"We set out to take a light-hearted look at reportedly true events and never intended to cause any offence. Joseph Fiennes fully supports our decision.\" Those \"concerns\" had been expressed quite bluntly by the late singer's family on Twitter. For instance: The proposed show \"honestly makes me want to vomit,\" Jackson's daugher, Paris, wrote . @TheMJCast i'm so incredibly offended by it, as i'm sure plenty of people are as well, and it honestly makes me want to vomit. \u2014 Paris-Michael K. J. (@ParisJackson) January 11, 2017 \"No words could express the blatant disrespect,\" tweeted his nephew, Taj. @soledadobrien Unfortunately this is what my family has to deal with. No words could express the blatant disrespect. https://t.co/WKCiwOqPpN \u2014 Taj Jackson (@tajjackson3) January 11, 2017 The episode was to depict Jackson on a post-Sept. 11 road trip across the U.S. in 2001, with Elizabeth Taylor, played by Stockard Channing, and Marlon Brando, played by Brian Cox. Intended to be a \"light-hearted look\" at an event rumored to have actually taken place, the episode had been positioned as a satire by its creators. Article continues after sponsorship \"It's a sketch about a story that could have been a legend or could have been true,\" Fiennes told AFPTV in Rome early last year, though he, too, admitted he \"was shocked\" that he was cast in the role of Jackson: \"You have to ask them as to why they would want to cast me.\" The director of the episode, Ben Palmer, told The Guardian this week that the casting was based partly on the challenge of matching physical resemblance, partly on the basis of Fiennes' performance. \"We were really looking for the performance that could unlock the spirit, and we really think Joe Fiennes has done that,\" Palmer said. \"He's given a really sweet, nuanced, characterful performance.\" To be sure, though, the questions came fast and furious \u2014 especially since the announcement was made smack in the middle of last year's #OscarsSoWhite controversy over a lack of diversity in the entertainment industry. And the release of the trailer for the upcoming season, which as you can see above features footage from the Jackson episode and others, did nothing to stem the criticism. It appears that trailer is the only glimpse we'll get of the now-notorious episode. ",

(Cliff Owen / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Democratic Rep. John Lewis says he's doesn't consider Donald Trump a \"legitimate president,\" blaming the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House. The Georgia congressman and leader in the civil rights movement of the 1960s said he will skip next week's inauguration of Trump at the Capitol, joining several other Democrats who have decided to boycott the historic event. \"You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that will air on Sunday. \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton ,\" Lewis said.

(Karoun Demirjian) U.S. Intelligence agencies have said Russia meddled in the election to help Trump win. After spending weeks challenging that assessment, Trump finally accepted that the Russians were behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. However, he also emphasized that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" Lewis explained his decision to stay away from the inauguration as \"you cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.\" He said it will be the first inauguration he has missed in three decades, a time that includes Democrats and Republicans taking the oath of office. The 16-term congressman testified earlier this week against Trump's choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, citing the Alabama Republican's record on ensuring minorities have the right to vote. Lewis was beaten and bloodied during the fight for civil and voting rights. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who met with Trump Friday, said he considered Lewis a friend and great man, but \"the idea of constantly looking for ways to delegitimize the results of an election, no matter how unhappy you are about it, isn't the best example we set.\" ",

By Lisa Rein January 13 at 3:32 PM Follow @Reinlwapo President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his global business empire has provoked a showdown in Washington over government ethics, pitting a small federal agency tasked with preventing conflicts of interest against the incoming administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill. The dispute erupted Friday after a top House Republican demanded to question the director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, who took the unusual step this week of denouncing Trump for retaining ownership of his businesses while transferring management to his sons. With Republicans and Democrats weighing in, the episode has brought unprecedented attention to a usually obscure office and its director, Walter Shaub Jr., who became an instant sensation on Twitter and in news headlines this week. He blasted Trump\u2019s plan as \u201cmeaningless\u201d and said the president-elect is not meeting the standards set by \u201cthe best of his nominees.\u201d House Republicans reacted swiftly, summoning Shaub to appear before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to answer questions about his office and his public criticism of Trump. Shaub made the remarks at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday, hours after the president-elect and his attorneys had laid out the business plan at a news conference. By late Thursday, Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) had sent Shaub a letter summoning him to appear before lawmakers in a closed-door, transcribed interview much like a deposition. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) But ethics experts and Democrats on Capitol Hill said the letter, by noting that the ethics office is up for reauthorization by Congress, was a veiled threat to slash its budget unless Shaub changes his rhetoric. [ Federal ethics chief blasts Trump\u2019s plan to break from businesses, calling it \u2018meaningless\u2019 ] \u201cI want to talk about the whole department,\u201d Chaffetz said in an interview. \u201cMr. Shaub has taken a very aggressive stance on issues he\u2019s never looked at. He\u2019s raised a bunch of eyebrows.\u201d He called Shaub, appointed by President Obama to a five-year term that ends in a year, \u201ca bit of a hothead.\u201d The lawmaker said he has not yet decided whether to ask Shaub to testify at a public committee hearing; he said that he first wants to hear what Shaub says during the upcoming closed-door hearing, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) came to Shaub\u2019s defense, accusing Chaffetz of an \u201cattempt to intimidate\u201d Shaub and his agency. (Alice Li/The Washington Post) \u201cMr. Chaffetz\u2019s attempt to intimidate the office is deplorable and would be a distraction that would make it harder for OGE to do its already difficult job,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cIt is totally out of line when Americans want clean and accountable government. Mr. Chaffetz should instead focus on his job and let Mr. Shaub and OGE focus on theirs.\u201d Shaub\u2019s supporters are calling him a hero, pushed by Trump\u2019s tangle of potential conflicts to uphold his duty as a public official and call out a plan he believes is unethical, if legal. \u201cHe\u2019s put ethics front and center on the policy agenda,\u201d said Norm Eisen, who served as ethics counselor to Obama, on Thursday. \u201cNo one has taken a more courageous action, especially given that he\u2019s going to be working for Trump in eight days.\u201d The nonpartisan ethics office, with just 75 employees and a $16 million budget, has always been seen and not heard as its lawyers advise incoming presidents, their Cabinet nominees and other officials on how to avoid conflicts of interest. In the swirl of controversy over potential conflicts related to Trump\u2019s real estate and branding business, Shaub is presenting himself as an unlikely counterweight to the power of the incoming president. His first foray into resistance came on Twitter a few weeks after the election. Shaub, 57, is a career ethics lawyer whose outspokenness during the presidential transition has caught colleagues by surprise. He is neither flashy nor attention-seeking, they say, but cautious by nature and concerned with protecting the confidentiality of the public officials he works with. Shaub is known to crack corny jokes. His expertise in federal ethics conflicts is unchallenged, say those who have worked with him. He is described as a workaholic who started his legal career in government at the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services and worked briefly in the private sector before climbing the ranks in the ethics office. \u201cWalt is brainy,\u201d said Don W. Fox, Shaub\u2019s predecessor under President George W. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s very circumspect. No one has ever seen him as a partisan.\u201d Weeks earlier, Shaub had sent the discreet, behind-the-scenes world of federal ethics experts into a frenzy with a stream of unorthodox declarations on Twitter. His Nov. 30 tweet storm , in superlatives designed to parrot Trump\u2019s use of social media, gushed \u2014 prematurely and wrongly \u2014 over his decision to divest himself of his holdings. Reporters thought that the ethics office\u2019s Twitter account had been hacked. The public wondered whether someone over at the little-known agency at 1201 New York Ave. had lost their mind. Before nomination hearings for Trump\u2019s Cabinet began this week, Shaub accused Republicans of rushing through some nominees before his staff had finished vetting their financial disclosure documents. He sent a letter to Senate Democrats and did not include Republicans, further raising GOP suspicions about his motives. Shaub, through a spokesman, declined a request for an interview. Shaub was not on the schedule to speak at a long-planned ethics forum at Brookings on Wednesday. He accepted a pending invitation at the last minute, writing his extraordinary public admonishment in a few hours. It lasted 13 minutes. \u201cI wish circumstances were different and I didn\u2019t feel the need to make public remarks\u201d were his first words at the lectern. He then made a detailed case for why the steps Trump outlined to allow his sons to run his businesses were \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d protections against potential conflicts. Shaub urged Trump to sell his assets and put them in a blind trust instead, no matter how complicated the transaction. \u201cThis is not a blind trust,\u201d Shaub said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close.\u201d He also praised former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, for putting his vast retirement package into a trust that will be independently managed and prohibited from investing in the company he headed. \u201cIt\u2019s a sterling model for what we\u2019d like to see with other nominees,\u201d he said. Shaub\u2019s candor has transformed him into a political target for Republicans. Richard Painter, who was ethics adviser to George W. Bush, said Chaffetz\u2019s letter amounts to a \u201cclear threat to pull the funding of the Office of Government Ethics\u201d unless the agency follows the wishes of Trump and the Republican leadership. \u201cThey are saying lay off Trump and push through these nominees or we\u2019ll kill the funding of OGE,\u201d Painter said. He and other ethics lawyers from both parties said the agency plays an important role, and killing it or reducing its authority would be a blow to avoiding conflicts of interest in a new administration and enforcing basic standards of ethics and transparency. But Republicans say that Shaub\u2019s $500 campaign contribution to Obama\u2019s reelection committee, public criticism of Trump and lighter hand for Hillary Clinton regarding her paid speeches have raised legitimate concerns that he is acting as a partisan. Among his critics is America Rising, a GOP super PAC that does rapid response and opposition research. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the ethics office in search of communications it believes may show that Shaub coordinated with Democrats during the transition to hurt the incoming Trump administration. America Rising also accused Shaub of silence on potential conflicts of interest for Clinton as she accepted speaking fees for speeches, money that went to the Clinton Foundation. Shaub told the Oversight Committee at the time that the law did not require disclosure. \u201cHe was not assuming the prominent role [then] that he is now,\u201d America Rising executive director Colin Reed said of Shaub. \u201cThe timing is certainly perplexing.\u201d The federal ethics office traditionally has kept such a low profile that some lawyers in the field had never heard of Shaub until he showed up on Twitter. \u201cThe director of OGE has never gone out and made these types of public statements about any government official,\u201d said Jan Baran, an ethics expert at the Wiley Rein law firm, who served on President George H.W. Bush\u2019s ethics commission. \u201cHe certainly has damaged his own reputation.\u201d Shaub is a political appointee, but because the post is filled for a five-year term, Trump would have to show cause to fire him. And Shaub is still a civil servant, having kept his status as a senior executive even as he assumed a political post. In his letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, Chaffetz wrote, \u201cYour agency\u2019s mission is to provide clear ethics guidance, not engage in public relations.\u201d \u201cThe Committee is thus continuing its examination of OGE\u2019s operations,\u201d Chaffetz wrote. \u201c[The office\u2019s] statutory authorization lapsed at the end of fiscal year 2007 and the Committee has jurisdiction in the House of Representatives for reauthorizing the office.\u201d Mike DeBonis and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.

Prior to attending the Inauguration, the White House said the president and first lady Michelle Obama will host President-elect Trump and incoming first lady Melania Trump at the White House for tea and a reception. After the Obamas depart the Inauguration by helicopter, there will be send-off with a group of White House staff at Joint Base Andrews before the outgoing first couple departs to a location that has yet to be announced. President Obama has previously said he is taking the first lady on a vacation to a \"warm\" location. Following the vacation, the Obamas will reside in Washington D.C. in a rented home while their youngest daughter, Sasha, finishes high school locally. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "advertisement Back in 1979 he was known as Barry and he had a beef with his basketball coach. \"He made an appointment to see me one day and he brought along a couple other guys who wanted more playing time,\" Chris McLachlin recalled. As he listened, McLachlin never dreamed that one day this determined young man, who had spent most of that season warming the bench while the Punahou High School varsity basketball team was marching on to win the Hawaii state championship, would grow up to be Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States. But he was impressed. \"He showed leadership and caring for his teammates ,\" McLachlin said. \"Those are qualities a president should have. Standing up for your buddies. Having their back. Speaking up for yourself.\" And the upshot? \"I gave them more playing time,\" McLachlin chuckled. \"He represented them in a very dignified, respectful way. Made a strong case for them.\" Barack Obama, #23, during his senior year at Punahou School, Honolulu. Seth Poppel / Yearbook Library With Obama just days away from turning over the reins to Donald Trump, Coach Mac and some of the guys young Barry played ball with at their Honolulu prep school reflected on his presidency \u2014 and their playing years \u2014 with pride. To them, the characteristics Obama displayed on the hardwood as one of the \"Sons of Oahu\" were evident in the way he handled the daunting responsibilities as leader of the free world. \"I always knew he would do something, of course we never expected he'd be in the White House,\" teammate and lifelong friend Greg Orme said. \"He was always very focused.\" And they have cheered Obama on even when they disagreed with him. \"I'm a Republican, but I'll endorse Barry for anything he wants,\" said Tom Topolinski, who backed his old buddy twice and voted this time for Trump. \"I think he's done great with all the stuff he inherited, like the recession and the two wars. He took out (Osama) Bin Laden. You gotta give him that.\" In a May 21, 2008 Sports Illustrated interview, Obama spoke of the importance of basketball in his life. \"Basketball was a refuge, a place where I made a lot of my closest friends, and picked up a lot of my sense of competition and fair play,\" he said. \"It was very important to me all the way through my teenage years.\" Here is how some of Obama's former teammates and coaches remember those years: Darin Maurer \"To understand President Obama, you have to understand his Hawaiian roots,\" Maurer said. \"Hawaii is a melting pot, a very intense place if you're a kid. It can be very racially hostile, especially if you're white or black. We're the minorities here.\" Obama, the son of a black father and white mother, stood out. So did Maurer, who is now a pastor in Houston. \"Basketball was the great equalizer,\" he said. \"I would go out there and be the only white person. Barry would be the only black person. We had to prove ourselves, focus on playing good ball. And once you started playing well, contributing on the court, pretty much the racial aspect goes away.\" Obama, he said, was especially adept at \"knowing how to build relationships.\" He said it puzzles him that, as president, Obama was often accused of failing to reach out to political opponents. \"I don't know why people have slammed him like that,\" said Maurer. \"He can really relate to people. I think if people were one-on-one with him, they'd see things his way\u2026 Look at how he's treated President-elect Trump. He's been so gracious to him.\" Maurer, who played ball with Obama from the seventh grade through their senior year, said Julius Erving, better known as Dr. J, was their basketball hero. He said they adored his slam-dunking style and no-look passing, but their coaches were not fans. \"Our coaches were much more conservative,\" he said. While Obama got saddled with the nickname Barry O'Bomber, Maurer said he also \"got teased a lot for taking hard to make shots.\" Darin Maurer and then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. Darin Maurer Maurer, who mostly played guard, said he and Obama were no slouches but they were on teams with some really strong jocks. \"So neither of us ever started\u2026 and that was hard,\" he said. But after practice they'd hit the public courts. \"We'd drive around in my van listening to Earth, Wind & Fire and looking for places to play,\" he said. After graduating in 1979, Maurer wound up at Stanford where he made the team as a walk on and found God. It wasn't until 2008, when Obama was making his first run for president, that they saw each other again at a fundraiser. \"This is my man!\" a delighted Obama said, Maurer recalled. \"I hadn't seen him for 30 years.\" Because he's a pastor, Maurer said he prefers not to weigh-in on politics. But asked what he believes Obama's biggest accomplishment was, he had a ready answer. \"One of the neatest things is that he has promoted family,\" he said. \"His love for Michelle and Sasha and Malia is outstanding. One of his incredible legacies will be how he modeled being a family man. We have had presidents who have not modeled that super well.\" Gregory Orme \"We had a long basketball career together,\" Orme recalled in a telephone interview from his home in Eugene, Oregon. \"We played a lot of playground ball.\" For much of their childhoods, Orme and Obama were more like brothers than buddies, constant companions both on and off the basketball court who even double-dated on senior prom night. Their friendship continues to this day. \"We get together for golf,\" he said. \"We have this tradition to head home to Hawaii for Christmas. That's when we see each other. In his day, he was a better basketball player than a golfer. Now, I think he's a better golfer.\" Orme and Obama became pals not long after the future president arrived at Punahou as a fifth grader. \"He was a good player inside and out,\" Orme recalled. \"He was tenacious.\" Young Barack Obama in a 7th grade photo in 1974 at Punahou School, Honolulu, Hawaii. Darin Maurer For Orme, the Obama he saw on the court was a lot like the Obama who occupied the White House \u2014 a team player who liked to win. He said Obama may have come across as easy going, but he was no pushover. \"The same as in Washington,\" Orme said. \"He is unyielding in the things he believes in.\" Orme said Obama \"is one of my heroes.\" \"I think he's done an unbelievable job as president,\" he said. \"He's exhibited class and dignity all the way through it. I guarantee he would have won a third term if he could have run again. I'm incredibly proud of my friend.\" Mark Bendix \"I've known Barry since the fifth grade,\" he said. \"But we didn't really become good friends until the seventh grade. Right around then, we really started getting into basketball.\" Obama was all business when it came to \"the game.\" \"We would be like, 'Hey let's go to the beach',\" Bendix recalled. \"And he would be going to the gym to work on his strength and conditioning.\" Bendix said he and Obama learned most of their basketball moves on the playground. \"When you're on a school team, there's more discipline involved,\" he said. Still, Bendix said, his old pal should have been a starter at Punahou \u2014 and insisted he was not just being loyal to an old friend. \"I loved his game,\" he said. \"He had a pretty good shot and really handled the ball well.\" Bendix said he and Obama stayed in touch and he was at his 2008 inauguration. \"Hopefully now that he's done we'll get to see each other more,\" he said. Bendix added that he was not shocked when Obama was elected president. \"I remember when we were seniors in high school, somebody said Barry would be on the Supreme Court,\" he said. \"We didn't aim high enough.\" Tom Topolinksi \"Every time I see him on television it's surreal,\" said Topolinski. \"His character, the way he conducts himself, that's always been his footprint. He was always very calm, very level-headed, very rational. This is the Barry I remember.\" Like Obama, Topolinski had to straddle a racial divide. He has ethnic Chinese mother and his father was Polish. And like Obama, he found his place on the basketball court. \"That's what we did to fit in,\" he said. \"Barry was a very confident player who liked to drive to the basket. He also liked to take outside shots and sometimes he got really hot.\" And when tempers flared, Barry was the peacemaker. \"We could all be hotheads at times, but he was very diplomatic,\" he said. \"He'd tell us to move on if we got into it with another player. Topolinski said neither he nor Obama were stars on their high school team. But Obama did get to play in the game when the school clinched the state title. \"He even scored a basket,\" he said. \"We were champions and I think it helped him become the man he is today. The experience of being part of a winning team was important to Barry, to all of us.\" Topolinski, who now lives in Washington state, said he lost touch with Obama after high school and they moved into different political camps. \"Barry did a good job but I think we needed a change,\" he said. \"We live in a world of bullies and the U.S. has been bullied around. Even though Trump is a loose cannon at least he will stick up for what he believes.\" Topolinski laughed when he recalled how they both tried out for the school's football team. \"His spelling wasn't too good either,\" he said, referring to the note Obama wrote in his high school year book. Yearbook note Obama left for classmate Tom Topolinski when they graduated in 1979 from the Punahou school. Courtesy of Tom Topolinski Speedy Bailey Bailey, who coached Obama during his junior year and now runs an ambulance service, said young Barry was a \"gym rat.\" \"Every day after practice he'd stay to play pickup games against the coaching staff,\" he said. \"He challenged the coaches.\" Bailey, who owes his nickname to his quickness on a court, said he's been \"impressed by the way Obama handled himself as president.\" And having a Hawaiian in the White House made them all proud. \"He was one of us,\" he said. Chris McLachlin \"He would have started on any other high school team on the state,\" McLachlin said of Obama. \"But we had a lot of very good players... I know that was hard for him.\" But Obama never gave up and his work ethic was second to none on this team. Chris McLachlin is seen at his house on Jan. 4 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Marco Garcia / for NBC News \"He would carry his books in one hand and his ball in the other,\" he said. \"He lived across the street from school and before classes he'd shoot baskets on the outside courts, then at lunch he'd shoot more baskets, then I'd have him for three hours, then he'd go home, eat supper, and then be outside again shooting baskets.\" McLachlin said he survived a severe stroke shortly before Obama was elected president in 2008. And when Obama came for Christmas, he got invited to join the new president at a pickup basketball game. \"Every time out he'd come over and chat with me about my stroke, my health,\" he said. \"As you know, he made getting better health care for Americans one of his missions.\" McLachlin said he told Obama he was volunteering for the American Heart Association and the president urged him to keep in touch. \"He didn't have to see me, but he was a man of his word,\" he said. \"He always made time to see his old coach\u2026 I didn't play him as much as I should have and he had every right to say 'I'll show you coach'. But he took the high road and showed a lot of integrity. I really admire that.\" Corky Siemaszko ",

    "text": "(Alexandra Zavis) \u00a0 Gutierrez\u00a0has lived in Costa Rica since November, trying to regain his health and earn money for the next leg of his journey, which he planned to resume in a few weeks.\u00a0 He has been getting\u00a0paid under the table for work as a handyman\u00a0and looked forward to the days when he had enough spare change to call home to Cuba. His wife and two daughters are there. A third daughter, from a previous marriage, lives in Texas.\u00a0 Gutierrez\u2019s dream was supposed to end there, in Texas, with a green card and the legal right to bring the rest of\u00a0his family to join him. It was not supposed to end in Costa Rica, paying to live in\u00a0a flophouse among\u00a0strangers. An evangelical pastor, Gutierrez says he left Cuba because of lack of religious freedom on the island.\u00a0 Although the communist government has widened its tolerance of some faiths, Gutierrez said it has cracked down on certain evangelical religions, in some cases destroying chapels. This summer, Gutierrez kissed his wife and daughters goodbye as\u00a0he and another pastor paid a smuggler to help them get to the U.S. \u00a0 They were part of a wave of roughly 100,000 Cubans who have fled the island since 2014 out of fear\u00a0that Cubans might lose\u00a0their special immigration status amid waning tensions between the old Cold War adversaries.\u00a0 Over 11 months ending in August, 38,573 Cubans showed up at the southwestern border without visas, according to federal statistics. That\u2019s six times the number of Cubans who arrived in 2009. For years, many Cubans traveled to Florida in rickety boats. If they landed on U.S. shores, they were allowed to stay. If intercepted at sea, they were sent back to Cuba, and the policy became known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot.\u201d In recent years, though, more Cubans traveled by land. The coyote hired by Gutierrez and his pastor friend promised he could help smuggle them into Panama, much nearer to the U.S. than Ecuador or Guyana, which Cubans could easily reach without visas.\u00a0 The smuggler gave Gutierrez clear instructions: Book a flight to Guyana with a stop in Panama. At the airport in Panama City, buy a\u00a0SIM card\u00a0and dial this number. The person on the other end will give instructions on how to escape the airport. Marcelino Quintana, left, and Gutierrez, center, both from Cuba, get off a ferry in Cargurgana, Colombia, to begin their walk with other migrants to Panama. Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times Marcelino Quintana, left, and Gutierrez, center, both from Cuba, get off a ferry in Cargurgana, Colombia, to begin their walk with other migrants to Panama. Marcelino Quintana, left, and Gutierrez, center, both from Cuba, get off a ferry in Cargurgana, Colombia, to begin their walk with other migrants to Panama. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) Gutierrez followed his orders. But when he dialed the number, the phone rang and rang. Nobody answered. \u201cThat is how my calamity began,\u201d he said. The two pastors had no choice but to go on to Guyana, adding some 1,000 miles to their trek.\u00a0Along the way, he said, they were\u00a0kidnapped by highway thieves and robbed by\u00a0rogue police officers who stole their phones, money and even eyeglasses. \u201cWhat I have learned on this journey is that there are good people and bad people,\u201d Gutierrez said\u00a0in an interview last fall. He was sitting at a $4-a-night hotel in Turbo, Colombia, a rough-and-tumble port city that in recent years has become a way station \u00a0for a growing number of\u00a0migrants from all over the world traveling to\u00a0the U.S. \u00a0Babies wailed as migrants from Haiti, Africa and Bangladesh lined up to use the hotel\u2019s single shower. Gutierrez and his friend, like other Cubans on the road, tended to stick to themselves. After all, \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d made them different. Other migrants knew this too, and they sometimes uttered resentful comments under their breath.\u00a0 Migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nepal and African nations rest in a shelter in Panama City in September 2016. Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times Migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nepal and African nations rest in a shelter in Panama City in September 2016. Migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nepal and African nations rest in a shelter in Panama City in September 2016. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) One afternoon in Turbo, Gutierrez and his friend\u00a0haggled for rain boots and lanterns.\u00a0The next day, the two of them with\u00a0another Cuban began their passage by foot through the Darien Gap, a stretch of jungle on the Panamanian border so thick no roads have ever traversed it. He had\u00a0heard stories about other migrants who had died \u2014 \u00a0by jungle snake, or\u00a0at the hands of the drug traffickers and militants \u2014 so he bowed his head in prayer.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death,\u201d he said, his bottom lip quivering. \u201cI\u2019m just afraid of never seeing my family again.\u201d\u00a0 When they emerged days later from the sticky, buggy jungle, they\u00a0took their bleeding feet and mosquito-bitten legs\u00a0to a Catholic church in Panama City that has become known as a refuge for Cubans on the road.\u00a0 Gutierrez was worried they would be turned away because of their evangelical faith, but the first question the priest asked when they arrived at the stately old church\u00a0was: \u201cWhat can we feed you? \u201cIt was a special moment,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cI thought we were enemies. But they treated us like kings.\u201d He stayed there for weeks, sleeping shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other migrants and eating meals of beans and rice.\u00a0 By then, Gutierrez\u2019s body was covered in lichen planus, a skin rash that can be triggered by infection or stress.\u00a0He and his friends managed to cross\u00a0into Costa Rica, but Gutierrez didn't think he was well enough to\u00a0go on\u00a0to Nicaragua, another notorious and lawless passage. Gutierrez\u2019s friends went on without him, eventually spending two weeks in a Mexican migrant detention center before they were released. Mexico, which also has cracked down on illegal immigration, often tolerated Cubans passing through the country because the U.S. would readily\u00a0accept them.\u00a0How the country will view Cubans now is uncertain.\u00a0 Gutierrez later learned his companions crossed into Texas on Dec. 9.\u00a0Soon, they will be issued work permits, and within a year, they will be allowed to apply for green cards.\u00a0 One of them, Marcelino Quintana, is living with extended family members in Austin, where the size of the homes and the number of restaurants at first put him in a state of\u00a0shock.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m trying to adopt to the liberty of this great nation,\u201d he said Thursday.

He sees few options: ask for political asylum in Costa Rica, or return to Cuba, where he worries he might be punished by the government.\u00a0The Cuban government has said it\u00a0will take back those who left. He would never cross illegally into the U.S., he said, and though he could ask for asylum based on his religious beliefs,\u00a0asylum claims are notoriously hard\u00a0to win.\u00a0 On Thursday and Friday, he stayed close\u00a0to a wi-fi hot spot, scrolling for updates on the policy change. He messaged to panicked\u00a0friends also on their way to the U.S. but who have only made it to Panama or Peru.\u00a0He kept hoping he would find news\u00a0articles saying President-elect Donald Trump vowed to overturn Obama\u2019s decision. Trump, he said, is the only hope for Cubans like him.\u00a0 He knows he should, but he still hasn\u2019t\u00a0called his family in Cuba to tell them what he plans to\u00a0do next. It\u2019s because, he said, he has absolutely no idea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. (Alexei Druzhinin / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The Senate Intelligence Committee will investigate possible contacts between Russia and the people associated with U.S. political campaigns as part of a broader investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In a statement late Friday , Sens. Richard Burr. R-N.C., the committee's chairman, and Mark Warner, D-Va., the panel's top Democrat, said the panel would review \"any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns\" \u2014 a scope that includes allegations of ties between president-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. Burr and Warner said that as part of the investigation they will interview senior officials from the Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration. They said subpoenas would be issued \"if necessary to compel testimony.\" \"The Committee will follow the intelligence wherever it leads,\" the senator said. \"We will conduct this inquiry expeditiously, and we will get it right.\" Their announcement came as additional\u00a0House Democrats called for FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s resignation, following a closed-door briefing from spy chiefs about Russia\u2019s alleged election-related hacking in which they say Comey stonewalled members about whether the FBI is investigating links between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin. A declassified intelligence report released last week said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the election to favor President-elect Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton, revelations that have roiled Washington.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 13, 2017 7:14 PM EST The Senate intelligence committee announced late Friday an investigation of Russian interference with the U.S. election. Many Democrats believe Russian hacking cost Hillary Clinton the presidency. Separately, many Democrats also blame FBI Director James Comey -- for re-opening an investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails -- just 10 days before the election. And on Friday, Congressional Democrats let loose on him. Democrats stormed out of a briefing on Russian hacking -- furious with one of the briefers, Comey.\u00a0 James Comey spoke before Congress on January 13, 2017. Close CBS News \u201cThe FBI director has no credibility,\u201d said Rep. Maxine Waters of California. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy confidence in the FBI director\u2019s ability to lead this agency has been shaken,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia.\u00a0 \u201cThe FBI director has no credibility,\u201d said Rep. Maxine Waters of California said Friday, Jan. 13, 2017.&nbsp; &nbsp; Close CBS News The closed-door briefing for all House members was confidential. But multiple lawmakers tell CBS News that the former chair of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, asked Comey repeatedly why he never called her personally to inform her that the DNC\u2019s servers may have been breached by the Russians. Comey balked, eventually admitting \u201cno, we didnt.\u201d \u201cThere was some heat. There was some heat,\u201d said Rep. Johnson.\u00a0 The FBI and President-elect Trump have suggested the DNC was lax and uncooperative. \u201cThey did a very poor job,\u201d Mr. Trump has said. \u00a0 DNC officials tell CBS News that from September 2015 until April 2016, the only person the FBI spoke to at the DNC was an outside vendor who provided IT services. Hackers began posting the stolen emails online in June. The unguarded exchanges cost Wasserman Schultz her chairmanship. Clinton campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s emails were posted three months later. \u201cI don\u2019t see the president-elect as a legitimate president,\u201d said Rep. John Lewis of Georgia to NBC. \u201cI think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\u201d U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia. Close CBS News He and at least at least seven other Democrats have announced they will boycott the inauguration. One of them is Arizona\u2019s Raul Grijalva. \u201dI will at home, in Arizona,\u201d said Rep. Grijalva.\u00a0 Democrats on Friday accused Comey of a double standard: Speaking publicly pre-election about the Clinton investigation even as he stayed mum about Russia\u2019s attempts to help Mr. Trump. But they have been reluctant to call for him to step down, because some worry about who Mr. Trump will appoint if he leaves. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story In the weeks after the election, Mr. Kushner has grappled with many questions over Oscar Health. The company, which is one of Mr. Kushner\u2019s most prominent investments, sells health insurance to individuals under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. That is a law that Jared Kushner is uniquely positioned to influence now that he is a senior adviser to the president-elect , which puts his younger brother and the start-up in an awkward position. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the same time, Joshua Kushner has had to deal with queries from investors in his venture capital funds who have asked him how Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension would affect his work. Some wondered whether he would join the White House. Others worried that the presidential circus would be a distraction, especially since ties with his brother might make it difficult to maintain a distance. Mr. Kushner has had to reassure investors that he remains committed to Thrive, which is based in New York and has amassed nearly $1.5 billion from wealthy individuals, foundations and the endowments of universities like Princeton, Harvard and Yale. (Oscar Health was founded in the offices of Thrive.) For some money managers, even a loose connection to an incoming president could open doors that might otherwise be closed, but Mr. Kushner has told his investors that he is determined to avoid involvement in politics. \u201cJosh doesn\u2019t want a public profile,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, which is an investor in Thrive. \u201cHe assured us that he would remain focused on Thrive.\u201d So far, Mr. Kushner has largely succeeded in taking a different path from the rest of his family. While Jared and one of their sisters, Nicole, went into the family business, real estate , Joshua broke from that mold by founding technology start-ups and then getting into venture capital. To date, money from Mr. Kushner\u2019s immediate family members represents less than $5 million of his venture funds. Jared is now divesting his shares in Thrive because of his move into the White House. The Trump family has not invested. That is not to say that Joshua Kushner is not close with his family. He is tight with his parents and two sisters, as well as with Jared (who is four years his senior) and with Ms. Trump , whom he refers to as his sister, not his in-law. While the brothers are known by friends and colleagues as ambitious workaholics with ties to power brokers on both coasts, in many ways their paths have diverged. Jared Kushner has emerged as an increasingly public figure since becoming the face of the family\u2019s real estate firm, Kushner Companies, and buying the publisher Observer Media. That company\u2019s newspaper, The New York Observer, has mythologized the city\u2019s media, real estate and political power brokers for a generation of New Yorkers. Jared is also often photographed at society events with Ms. Trump, and is now frequently seen in the background of meetings with the president-elect. But Joshua Kushner has maintained a lower profile. While he has dated the model Karlie Kloss for four years, he is rarely seen out with her. He does not party or drink. Unlike most venture capitalists, Mr. Kushner also does not blog, and he posts to Twitter infrequently. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cMost moguls love to name-drop and tell you about their vacations and appeal to you with how celestial their orbit is, but that\u2019s not Josh,\u201d said Patrick Collison, the chief executive of Stripe, a mobile payments start-up in San Francisco that Mr. Kushner has invested in. Mr. Kushner declined to speak on the record for this article, and a spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment. In an interview, Ms. Trump said that \u201cJared and Josh have a very special relationship defined by tremendous love, admiration and mutual respect.\u201d She declined to talk about politics. An Investor\u2019s Roots Joshua Kushner grew up in New Jersey, where his grandparents, Holocaust survivors who immigrated from Europe in 1949, had built apartments. Their properties turned into a $1 billion apartment development business under his father, Charles, who was sentenced to two years in prison in 2005 for making illegal campaign donations, witness tampering and tax evasion. Jared later expanded the family business and bought luxury office properties in Manhattan. Mr. Kushner and his siblings grew up spending nights and weekends at work with their father, visiting properties, looking at financial data and sometimes skipping school to attend business meetings. In 2004, Mr. Kushner was accepted to Harvard, which Jared had also attended. At Harvard, Mr. Kushner roomed with Alexander Blankfein , the son of the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein. His circle also included Alexander de Carvalho, an heir to the Heineken beer fortune. Mr. Kushner dipped into media when he became the executive editor of a short-lived society magazine for Harvard students called Scene , which was founded by the children of Citigroup and Lehman Brothers executives. During the summers, Mr. Kushner interned at Goldman\u2019s real estate banking division and at the real estate giants Vornado and SL Green with an eye toward working in the industry. But in his junior year of college, he started a company, Vostu, that made video games for social media networks like Facebook. He founded Vostu with two classmates, including Mario Schlosser, who is now the chief executive of Oscar Health. Mr. Kushner graduated in 2008. The next year, he became a founder of a nonprofit start-up called Unithrive , which helped Harvard students secure loans from alumni. \u201cJosh stepped away from the family business,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Harvard classmate who now runs Cadre, a real estate start-up that lets wealthy individuals buy pieces of commercial property developments. The company was started in the offices of Thrive. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Neither Vostu nor Unithrive was a runaway success. Vostu has since laid off most of its employees, and Unithrive is defunct. So, using money generated from Vostu, Mr. Kushner turned away from founding businesses and began investing in them instead, beginning with small investments in companies like the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. His investments caught the attention of others in the tech industry, including Joel Cutler, a venture capitalist at General Catalyst. \u201cJosh had been able to get into investment pools with the best and smartest in the industry,\u201d Mr. Cutler said. \u201cI encouraged him to start a firm.\u201d In 2010, while at Harvard Business School, Mr. Kushner started Thrive. He was 25. In an interview in 2011, while juggling business school with working at Vostu and meeting with start-ups, Mr. Kushner said his job as an investor was to look for new ideas that could change industries through technology. \u201cAny market yet to be disrupted by modern technology will be at some point in time,\u201d he said. Mr. Kushner said that he would not be content to simply invest in companies, and that he wanted to nurture some from scratch himself. \u201cBeing satisfied is not a good thing,\u201d he said. Personal Connections Mr. Kushner set about building Thrive in a methodical way, drawing on his constellation of connections. His mentors include Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist in New York best known for investing in Twitter, and Jon Winkelried, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm TPG. Mr. Kushner also befriended Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. Peter Thiel , a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential team, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, was also an early Thrive investor and supporter. Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder of LionTree, a merchant bank that specializes in tech and media deals, said he was impressed by Mr. Kushner\u2019s focus when the young investor spoke at an event Mr. Bourkoff held in 2011. Mr. Kushner argued before a roomful of media executives that online video would create more upheaval than the cable industry anticipated. Many in the room disagreed with that idea at the time but said he made a compelling case. By the spring of 2012, Mr. Kushner had scored his first investment hit. He had become friends with a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Kevin Systrom, who had started Instagram. Mr. Systrom said he had met Mr. Kushner long before he was thinking about raising large sums of money for the app, and the two had stayed in touch. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That year, Mr. Systrom let Mr. Kushner invest in Instagram alongside the prestigious venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners, illustrating how much personal connections matter. The funding pegged Instagram\u2019s valuation at $500 million. Three days later, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion and Mr. Kushner instantly doubled his money. Mr. Systrom and Mr. Kushner have remained close. When the Instagram chief married at a Napa Valley winery in late 2015, Mr. Kushner attended with Ms. Kloss . Mr. Kushner has developed a reputation among entrepreneurs for an eye for detail. When he was considering investing in Zola, a wedding registry company founded by Shan-Lyn Ma and Kevin Ryan, Mr. Kushner and his team put together their own study of the wedding registry market and what was missing. \u201cMost other investors I met with said that they\u2019d asked their wives or girlfriends about whether they\u2019d use Zola,\u201d Ms. Ma said. \u201cThat was generally their only data point.\u201d Thrive led a $5.85 million investment in Zola in 2013. Since then, the company has raised more than $40 million. Thrive\u2019s other investment successes include Twitch, a live-streaming video site for gamers that Amazon.com bought for $970 million, and the e-commerce site Jet.com, which Walmart agreed to acquire for $3 billion. Thrive also owns stakes in hot start-ups like the workplace messaging company Slack and the streaming music service Spotify, each of which are valued at billions of dollars. Not all of Mr. Kushner\u2019s investments have worked out. It can take a decade or more to determine whether a private company becomes the next Facebook, a failure or something in between. While Instagram was a rare overnight success story for investors, Mr. Kushner has also invested in flops such as Fab.com, a high-profile online retail company that went bust and was later purchased by a manufacturing company in a fire sale. Oscar Health, too, has not been a smooth ride. Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s election and the uncertain state of the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance start-up had been criticized for its hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and executive departures. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company has raised about $400 million at a $2.7 billion valuation, with investors including Goldman Sachs, multi-billionaire Li Ka-shing, and Ping An Insurance, a Chinese company with ties to former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. Oscar Health has scaled back parts of its business, saying it will no longer sell insurance to individuals in Dallas and New Jersey . The company plans to sell insurance to corporations. In November, Mr. Kushner took the unusual step of publicly defending Oscar Health by writing a blog post with the company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Schlosser. While they did not take a position on Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms of the Affordable Care Act, they said both political parties had failed to fix flaws in the health care law . They hoped a Republican Congress would do better, they added. No matter the outcome, they wrote, \u201cwe\u2019re in this for the long haul.\u201d It is unclear if Joshua and Jared Kushner have discussed how a health care overhaul could affect Oscar Health. Representatives of the brothers declined to comment on any conversations they have had about the company. Mr. Kushner\u2019s work is not totally separate from his family\u2019s. Thrive\u2019s offices are in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan, in the historic Puck Building, which is owned by Kushner Companies. Some start-ups that Thrive has incubated, including Cadre and Oscar, are housed there, too. The brothers have also made investments together. They founded Cadre with Mr. Williams, invested in it and are advisers to the company. A Neutral Stance Even outside of work, Mr. Kushner is earnest about his pursuits. At his 30th birthday celebration in 2015 at the Brush Creek Ranch , a luxury dude ranch in Saratoga, Wyo., where rooms start at around $800 a night, Mr. Kushner talked about goals and values, attendees said. Mr. Kushner has not been vocal about his political beliefs. Over the years, he has donated about $100,000 to Democratic candidates and causes. Federal Election Commission data shows he has been giving to the Democratic Party since 1999, when he financially supported Bill Bradley and, later, Al Gore for president. He made his last donations in 2014. Over the 2016 presidential election cycle, Mr. Kushner kept quiet as his brother and Ms. Trump became some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most powerful strategists and surrogates on the campaign trail. In August, Esquire reported that Joshua Kushner was a lifelong Democrat and would not vote for Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Kushner said he is a registered independent. In November, Ms. Kloss posed in a photograph on Instagram voting for Hillary Clinton. \u201cPeople who are different from you, you can learn something from them,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in the 2011 interview. \u201cAt least, I think I can.\u201d Doris Burke contributed research.

The report condemns Chicago police for excessive force, lax discipline and bad training. (Chicago Tribune) After a year-long investigation of the Chicago Police Department, the U.S. Department of Justice released a 164-page report on Jan. 13, 2017. The report condemns Chicago police for excessive force, lax discipline and bad training. (Chicago Tribune) Jason Meisner , Annie Sweeney , Dan Hinkel and Jeremy Gorner Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune In perhaps the most damning, sweeping critique ever of the Chicago Police Department , the U.S. Department of Justice concluded Friday that the city's police officers are poorly trained and quick to turn to excessive and even deadly force, most often against blacks and Latino residents, without facing consequences. The 164-page report, the product of more than a year of investigation, paints the picture of a department flawed from top to bottom, although many of the problems it cites have, for decades, been the subject of complaints from citizens, lawsuits by attorneys and investigations by news organizations. As such, the report is an indictment of sorts of city officials who, the report said, have paid lip service to the community's complaints as well as the need for reform of the Police Department and the various city agencies responsible for its oversight. Taken together, the Chicago Police Department's flaws have \"helped create a culture in which officers expect to use force and not be questioned about the need for or propriety of that use,\" the Justice Department said in its report, made public Friday by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Read the story In response to the federal investigation, Mayor Rahm Emanuel agreed to enter a court-enforced agreement with the Justice Department on a wide range of reforms, Lynch and other officials announced. While the report lauds some of the changes Emanuel has made to policing in recent months, it cautions that further reforms are needed and that real change is unlikely to last without outside monitoring. What's more, the report takes Emanuel to task for his efforts to get ahead of the report, saying some efforts have been insufficient. For his part, the mayor continued to voice his backing of the federal investigation while at the same time insisting the report's findings of systemic problems don't portray most cops. \"The incidents described in this report are sobering to all of us,\" he said. \"Police misconduct will not be tolerated anywhere in the city of Chicago, and those who break the rules will be held accountable for their actions. Misconduct not only harms the individuals affected, it damages the reputation of the Chicago Police Department. Kim Foxx reacts to DOJ report Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx reacts to this mornings Dept of Justice report on the Chgo Police Dept. Jan. 13, 2017. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx reacts to this mornings Dept of Justice report on the Chgo Police Dept. Jan. 13, 2017. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"At the same time, it is important to recognize that the incidents of misconduct cited in this report do not represent the values of the city of Chicago. And I believe firmly they do not represent the good work of the vast majority of the men and women of the Chicago Police Department, I said it earlier, who put their lives on the line every day.\" At a news conference, Lynch said the department's pattern of excessive force \"is in no small part the result of severely deficient training procedures and accountability systems.\" \"CPD does not give its officers the training they need to do their jobs safely, effectively and lawfully,\" Lynch said. \"It fails to properly collect and analyze data, including data on misconduct complaints and training deficiencies, and it does not adequately review use-of-force incidents to determine whether force was appropriate or lawful or whether the use of force could've been avoided altogether.\" All of these issues, she said, have led to \"low officer morale and erosion of officer accountability.\" More than two years after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke, the fallout continues to spread. Van Dyke faces murder charges, sustained protests have taken place across the city after a dashcam video shows Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times,... (Nausheen Husain) The investigation was launched after the court-ordered release of a video showing a white police officer shoot black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. The incident became a flashpoint in police-community relations after Emanuel and city officials worked to keep the video from the public for about a year. In its findings, the Justice Department was particularly critical of foot pursuits by officers \u2014 the subject of a recent Tribune investigation. The report said the foot chases too often end with unarmed individuals being shot. The Justice Department also faulted officers for shooting at vehicles without justification. The report hammered hard at how officers fail to de-escalate tense situations, often resulting in shootings that were avoidable and unnecessarily endangered officers as well. The Justice Department ripped officials responsible for investigating police shootings and other uses of force for failing to hold officers accountable or issue meaningful discipline. The report cited a pervasive \"code of silence\" that leads officers to lie to protect themselves and colleagues. Disciplinary authorities, in turn, have rarely brought cases against officers who lied, even when their statements were contradicted by video, while officers are almost never held accountable for even the worst shootings, it found. Although the vast majority of the report was critical of the police, it also suggested that officers were victims of a sort \u2014 desperate for change but poorly served by a lack of training that often put them in harm's way. But as much as the Justice Department suggested that most of the city's 12,000 officers wanted to do better, it chronicled so many abuses that the report is yet another black eye for a department with a long, controversial history that includes torturing suspects and dozens of wrongful convictions. Indeed, the Justice Department's report offered confirmation of a story often told about Chicago police \u2014 that they take gang members into rival territory to threaten them into cooperating. Besides addressing police shootings, it dealt with other police issues, such as how officers target minorities in enforcement and, in many instances, treat them badly and, in some cases, unconstitutionally: manhandling even children and holding them unless they can produce a gun, for instance. One of the report's key findings echoed a contention black and Hispanic Chicagoans have made for decades \u2014 that police unfairly target minorities. The report said DOJ investigators had \"serious concerns about the prevalence of racially discriminatory conduct by some CPD officers.\" Statistics cited by the DOJ show that CPD has used force almost 10 times more often against blacks than against whites. Justice Department officials tracked the Police Department's problems all the way to the police academy, where officers learn to be police but end up shooting people who pose no threat and using a Taser on people who simply didn't follow spoken commands. The report criticized use-of-force training at the academy, noting that Justice Department investigators observed a training video made decades before that \"was inconsistent with both current law and CPD's own policies.\" When officials spoke to recent academy graduates, only 1 in 6 \"came close to properly articulating the legal standard for use of force.\" The report said that while Emanuel has widely expanded the department's stock of Tasers, too many officers have been run through training programs too quickly, \"without proper curriculum, staff or equipment.\" As a result, according to the report, many officers are \"uncomfortable with how to use Tasers effectively as a less-lethal force option \u2014 the very skill the training was supposed to teach.\" The report's release marks a landmark for the country's second-largest local police department and one of the last acts of President Barack Obama's Justice Department. But the report comes as serious questions loom about the future of police reform nationwide. President-elect Donald Trump has supported aggressive law enforcement, and his nominee for attorney general, Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, has criticized consent decrees. Local activists and lawyers have voiced fears that Emanuel's resolve to change policing will wane if Trump's Justice Department relaxes its stance, but the mayor has said he's committed to improving the 12,000-strong police force. During the 13-month investigation, Emanuel pressed changes in line with reforms that federal authorities have tended to seek in other departments: tightening use-of-force policies and stepping up training and discipline. The report's release answered a key lingering question as to whether Emanuel would agree to formal court supervision of reforms. In her statement, Lynch said the city had signed an agreement to work with federal officials on a consent decree. An independent monitor will oversee the process. Winning the trust of the community, however, will not be easy. Chicago police, the report states, must show \"communities racked with violence that their police force cares about them and has not abandoned them, regardless of where they live or the color of their skin.\" \"That confidence is broken in many neighborhoods in Chicago,\" the report said. Getting buy-in from rank-and-file officers, many of them overwhelmed by surging violence and weary of constant criticism, also will be difficult. But Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the department was working hard to regain the community's trust and would continue to do so. He noted how the department has boosted its training of officers in the past year, including in crisis intervention, and how it solicited input from the public on a new use-of-force policy. \"Quite simply, as a department, we need to do better,\" he said. \"And you have my promise and commitment that we will do better.\" Chicago Tribune's John Byrne and Steve Schmadeke contributed. jmeisner@chicagotribune.com ",

Jackson lives in a multimillion-dollar mansion in Detroit and drives luxury cars. He preaches that being rich is not bad and that Trump's wealth shows he is \"blessed by God.\" Such teachings exemplify the \" prosperity gospel ,\" which holds that God rewards faithful Christians with financial success. It is a faith tradition with which Trump long has been associated. His \"spiritual adviser\" is Paula White , who as the leader of New Destiny Christian Center near Orlando, Fla., is perhaps the best known prosperity preacher in the country. Article continues after sponsorship True Believer? Why Donald Trump Is The Choice Of The Religious Right \"Every day you're [living] your destiny, designed by God and discovered by you,\" White said in a recent sermon . \"You're either in a position of abundance, you're in a position of prosperity, or you're in a position of poverty. Now that's in every area of your life. ... You're living abundant in your affairs of life \u2014 and that includes your financial conditions \u2014 or you're living in poverty.\" Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is drawn to those preachers who say that one's wealth is a sign of God's approval. Paula White has her critics in the evangelical world, some of whom consider her a heretic , but she endorsed Trump's candidacy, and he reciprocated by inviting White to pray at his swearing-in ceremony. Another pro-Trump evangelist who will be praying at the inauguration is Franklin Graham. During a recent interview with Lou Dobbs on the Fox Business Network, Graham said \"the hand of God\" was evident in Trump's election. Enlarge this image Evangelist Franklin Graham will follow his family's tradition of praying at presidential inaugurations when he prays during the ceremony for President-elect Donald Trump. He prayed previously at the 2001 inauguration of George W. Bush, and Graham's father, Billy, prayed at the inauguration of several presidents. Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images Evangelist Franklin Graham will follow his family's tradition of praying at presidential inaugurations when he prays during the ceremony for President-elect Donald Trump. He prayed previously at the 2001 inauguration of George W. Bush, and Graham's father, Billy, prayed at the inauguration of several presidents. Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images \"I think God intervened and put his hand on Donald Trump for some reason,\" Graham told Dobbs. \"It's obvious that there was something behind this, and it was more than people understand. I just think it was God.\" By appearing at Trump's swearing-in, Franklin Graham will be following family tradition: His 98-year-old father, Billy , prayed at the inauguration of several presidents, from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton, and Franklin prayed at the inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001. His inclusion as a prayer leader may also signal Trump's comfort with Graham's political positions. During his campaign, Trump focused a lot of attention on the threat from \"radical Islam,\" a theme Franklin Graham also has emphasized. Shared political views may also explain Trump's invitation to Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founding president of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. In a recent television interview , Hier said it was \"outrageous\" that the Obama administration chose not to veto a recent United Nations resolution condemning Israel's settlement policy, echoing Trump's own criticism. Evangelical Leader Under Attack For Criticizing Trump Supporters Hier, the first rabbi asked to pray at a presidential inauguration since 1985, says he will hit \"modern themes\" during his inauguration appearance. \"It will be a short prayer, but it will reflect on the 21st century,\" he says. Hier also has ties to the Trump world through Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and close adviser. Kushner's parents are old friends with Hier and his wife. One indication of Trump's unorthodox approach in choosing inauguration prayer leaders is the absence of any representative of mainline Protestantism, the dominant faith tradition of U.S. presidents throughout the country's history. On the other hand, Trump is the first to invite a Hispanic evangelical leader, the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and senior pastor at New Season Christian Worship Center, an Assemblies of God congregation in Sacramento, Calif. Rodriguez accepted the invitation despite some misgivings about Trump's hard-line immigration views. \"There was a bit of angst due to the fact that throughout the course of this campaign, the rhetoric and tone, as it pertained particularly to the immigrant community, did not line up with the ethos or the values of the NHCLC,\" Rodriguez told NPR. He agreed to come to Washington for the inauguration after \"prayerful deliberation and discussion\" and a conclusion that he could not pass up an opportunity to pray on \"the quintessential political platform on the planet.\" Here Is What Donald Trump Wants To Do In His First 100 Days Among Hispanic evangelicals, Rodriguez is one of the more conservative leaders. While he did not endorse Trump, he told NPR that he has heard a \"change of tone\" from Trump in the past few weeks, and now has high hopes for better relations between Hispanics and the Trump administration. \" Thirty percent of Latinos voted for Donald Trump ,\" Rodriguez points out. \"There's a great possibility that the president-elect and his team have come to the realization that this constituency could be engaged successfully.\" Generally, Trump's selection of inauguration prayer leaders reflects his tendency to break with mainstream thinking \u2014 and the importance he places on loyalty. With his invitations, he has rewarded clergy members who support him politically, endorse his views, or even offer a religious approval of his great wealth. The least surprising prayer leader choice is Cardinal Dolan. Most U.S. presidents in recent years have asked a prominent Catholic bishop or theologian to pray at their inaugurations, and as fellow New Yorkers, Dolan and Trump have known each other for a long time.

    "text": "5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing By Morgan Winsor Jan 13, 2017, 3:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Feds Release Report on Chicago Police Abuse 0 Shares Email Federal investigators have determined that the Chicago Police Department has routinely violated the constitutional rights of citizens for years in numerous ways, such as using excessive force, permitting racially discriminatory conduct and shooting individuals who posed no immediate threats, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today. \u201cOne of my highest priorities as attorney general has been to ensure that every American enjoys police protection that is lawful, responsive and transparent,\u201d Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement today in announcing the findings. \u201cSadly, our thorough investigation into the Chicago Police Department found that far too many residents of this proud city have not received that kind of policing.\u201d After a year-long probe into the city\u2019s 12,000-officer police force, which began in December 2015 after the release of a dashcam video of a white officer\u2019s shooting a black teen, the Justice Department \u2019s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the North District of Illinois today released a scathing 161-page report that details their findings of \u201csystemic deficiencies\u201d in training and accountability that investigators say have led to a pattern or practice of using force in violation of the Constitution. CPD Officer Charged With Murder of Teen Hired by Police Union The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois said \u201cthese findings are not new\u201d and should come as no surprise to Chicago residents. After the report\u2019s release, officials from the Justice Department and the city of Chicago said today they have signed an agreement in principle to work together, with community input, to create a federal court-enforceable consent decree addressing the deficiencies uncovered during the investigation. An independent monitor, who has yet to be chosen, will oversee compliance with the consent decree, according to the Justice Department. \u201cWhile the Chicago Police Department has made real progress and achieved meaningful reforms, the incidents described in this report are sobering to all of us,\u201d Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters today. \u201cPolice misconduct will not be tolerated anywhere in this city and those who break the rules will be held accountable for their actions.\u201d Here are some highlights from the report: CPD Uses Deadly Force in Violation of Constitution According to the report, federal investigators found that the Chicago Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of using force that is unreasonable and unconstitutional, including the following: shooting at fleeing suspects who presented no immediate threat; shooting at vehicles without justification; using less-lethal force, including Tasers, against people who pose no threat; using force to retaliate against and punish individuals; and using excessive force against juveniles. \u201cThis pattern is largely attributable to systemic deficiencies within CPD and the City,\u201d the report stated, citing, among other shortcomings, the department\u2019s historical failure to train its officers in de-escalation and failure to conduct meaningful investigations of uses of force. For instance, federal investigators observed police academy training on deadly force that consisted of a video made decades ago, which the report said was inconsistent with both current law and the Chicago Police Department\u2019s own policies. \u201cThe impact of this poor training was apparent when we interviewed recruits who recently graduated from the Academy: only one in six recruits we spoke with came close to properly articulating the legal standard for use of force,\u201d the report stated. \u201cPost-Academy field training is equally flawed.\u201d The deficiencies in officer training are exacerbated by the lack of adequate supervision provided to officers in the field, the report said. The Majority of Cases Are Not Investigated The report found the city of Chicago fails to investigate the majority of cases it is required to by law, including misconduct allegations filed against police officers. The ones that are investigated, \u201cwith rare exception, suffer from entrenched investigative deficiencies and biased techniques,\u201d and discipline taken against the accused officers is \u201chaphazard,\u201d \u201cunpredictable\u201d and \u201cdoes little to deter misconduct,\u201d according to the report. Federal investigators, who reviewed hundreds of investigative files, found that civilian and officer witnesses \u2013 and even the accused officers \u2013 are frequently not interviewed during an investigation. The city investigators also frequently failed to collect basic evidence and have allowed union representatives and attorneys to \u201ccoach officers in the middle of recorded interviews -- with official protocols actually prohibiting investigators from preventing this, or even referring to it on tape,\u201d the report stated. The report also detailed a lack of transparency regarding officer misconduct complaints, saying the \u201ccomplainants themselves are often kept in the dark about the status of their cases\u201d and the city investigators do not provide periodic updates to individuals complaining of officer misconduct. \u201cSeveral complainants told us that they were left unaware of what was happening with their complaint for months, or even years \u2013 and some never heard back at all,\u201d the report stated. CPD \ufffd?Tolerated Racially Discriminatory Conduct\u2019 The report called on the city of Chicago to address \u201cserious concerns\u201d about systemic deficiencies within the police department that disproportionately affect black and Latino communities. According to the report, statistics show the Chicago Police Department uses force almost 10 times more often against blacks than against whites. \u201cCPD\u2019s pattern or practice of unreasonable force and systemic deficiencies fall heaviest on the predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods on the South and West Sides of Chicago, which are also experiencing higher crime,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAs a result, residents in black neighborhoods suffer more of the harms caused by breakdowns in uses of force, training, supervision, accountability and community policing.\u201d According to the report, the Chicago Police Department \u201ctolerated racially discriminatory conduct\u201d that federal investigators say contributes to its pattern of unreasonable force. Federal investigators reviewed the police department\u2019s complaint database, which showed 980 police misconduct complaints coded as discriminatory verbal abuse on the basis of race or ethnicity from 2011 to March 2016. Just 13 of those complaints, or 1.3 percent, were sustained, generally when there was audio, video or other irrefutable evidence, the report said. Federal investigators found 354 complaints for the use of the word \u201cn-----\u201c or one of its variations. Only four, or 1.1 percent, of these complaints were sustained, according to the report. Federal investigators also found that some officers expressed discriminatory views and intolerance with regard to race, religion, gender and national origin in public social media forums. Meanwhile, the police department failed to take sufficient steps to prevent or appropriately respond to this issue, the report said. The report urged the city to restore its police-community trust by addressing both discriminatory conduct and the disproportionality of illegal and unconstitutional patterns of force on minority communities. \u201cWe have serious concerns about the prevalence of racially discriminatory conduct by some CPD officers and the degree to which that conduct is tolerated and in some respects caused by deficiencies in CPD's systems of training, supervision and accountability,\u201d the report stated. CPD\u2019s Promotions System Viewed as Political and Unfair According to the report, officers in the Chicago Police Department can be promoted to detective, sergeant or lieutenant based on test scores or evaluation of other merit-based criteria. Legal challenges of discriminatory impact and allegations of improper exam procedures have prompted several significant reforms to the department\u2019s promotions system. However, the report said, federal investigators spoke to officers who continued to express skepticism. \u201cOne of the major complaints from officers we interviewed is that CPD\u2019s promotions system lacks transparency regarding the nomination and qualification process for merit promotions. This has led many officers to believe that merit promotions are a reward for cronyism, rather than a recognition of excellence that was overlooked by the testing process,\u201d the report stated. \u201cMany of the officers we spoke with \u2014 minority and non-minority alike \u2014 told us that they feel merit promotions are not truly based on \ufffd?merit,\u2019 but rather the \ufffd?clout\u2019 you hold in the Department or \ufffd?who you know.\u2019\u201d The report continues: \u201cIn reality, there are documented instructions and guidance for merit promotion nominators and decision makers, but this information is not widely known.\u201d Insufficient Support for Officer Wellness and Safety The federal investigation found that the acute stress and pressure Chicago police officers face each day weigh heavily on them. For instance, the report found that the rising levels of gun violence in Chicago neighborhoods where the relationship between officers and the communities they serve is strained, making it difficult to police effectively. \u201cOur investigation found that these stressors can, and do, play out in harmful ways for CPD officers,\u201d the report stated. \u201cCPD deals with officer alcoholism, domestic violence and suicide. And as explained elsewhere in this Report, CPD officers engage in a pattern or practice of using force that is unjustified, disproportionate and otherwise excessive.\u201d The report continued: \u201cAlthough the pressure CPD officers are under is by no means an excuse for violating the constitutional rights of the citizens they serve, high levels of unaddressed stress can compromise officer well-being and impact an officer\u2019s demeanor and judgment, which in turn impacts how that officer interacts with the public.\u201d The report said Chicago officers need greater support from both the police department\u2019s leadership as well as the city, adding that both parties \u201cshould think meaningfully about how to better address the stressors\u201d these offices face.

A San Diego Chargers fan holds up a sign in front of Chargers headquarters after the team announced that it will move to Los Angeles. (Denis Poroy / AP) Natalie Kitroeff and Daniel Miller Contact Reporters The Chargers \u2019 dramatic split from the city of San Diego may be a sign that California is officially done\u00a0spending public money on sports franchises. California voters have grown more skeptical of pouring billions of dollars into football stadiums, which have been shown to generate less of an economic boom than the National Football League has advertised. That\u2019s upending the traditional relationship between billionaire franchise owners and their hometowns. \u201cGone are the days where there is broad public support for taxpayer-funded stadiums. It\u2019s very difficult to find a rate of return in that investment,\u201d said Kristin Gaspar, who was elected as a county supervisor in San Diego in November. After haggling with the city of San Diego for years to secure tax money to build a new stadium, and getting snubbed by voters, the Chargers announced \u00a0Thursday that the team would move to Los Angeles. The team will share a privately funded new stadium in Inglewood with the Rams when it opens in 2019. Football stadiums aren\u2019t spurring local economies, a growing body of new research shows, because they\u2019re used infrequently and don\u2019t offer consistent, year-round employment. The facilities are also becoming more expensive, especially over the past two decades as owners have pushed for renovations, contending that their stadiums need\u00a0luxury boxes and other niceties to stay\u00a0competitive. \u201cStadiums that used to cost $300 or $400 million, now it\u2019s $1.2 or $1.3 billion,\u201d said Marc Ganis, president and founder of the Chicago-based sports consulting firm SportsCorp. \u201cThey cost more and have a shorter life cycle.\u201d The Chargers budgeted $1.8 billion for a new stadium and convention center annex in San Diego, and sponsored a measure asking for $1.15 billion in taxpayer funding, via a hotel tax. Voters who went to the polls in November overwhelmingly rejected that measure, 57% to 43%. Since 2000, most of the major new stadiums in California have been built or are being planned without any direct subsidy from the public. No taxpayer money went to constructing AT&T Park, where the San Francisco Giants play; Avaya Stadium, where the San Jose Earthquakes are based; or the StubHub Center, which houses the LA Galaxy and, for the next two years, the Chargers. Santa Clara took on only 9% of the costs of building Levi\u2019s Stadium, the new home of the San Francisco 49ers football team that opened in 2014. And the NBA \u2019s Golden State\u00a0Warriors are privately financing the Chase Arena, set to break ground next week in\u00a0San Francisco\u2019s\u00a0Mission Bay.\u00a0In many of these\u00a0cases, cities chipped in either directly or through tax breaks for infrastructure surrounding the buildings.\u00a0 The Sacramento Kings \u2019s\u00a0Golden 1 Center opened in September as a notable exception to the trend; the city covered more than 40% of an estimated $556.6 million for the facility, mostly with revenue from parking.\u00a0The City Council voted for the hefty subsidies after a years-long fight with Kings ownership and the NBA to keep the team from leaving Sacramento, which has no other major professional sports teams. For decades, Angelenos went without a hometown NFL team in part because they were notoriously\u00a0loath\u00a0to spend taxes on one. Rams owner Stan Kroenke , worth $7.4 billion according to Forbes, made the league\u2019s return to Los Angeles possible\u00a0because he was game to use his own money to develop the $2.66-billion Inglewood stadium that, starting in 2019, will be home base of his team\u00a0and the Chargers. Inglewood will ultimately pay the project an estimated $60 million as a reimbursement for the\u00a0development of roadwork, utilities\u00a0and public parks on the site of the property. James T. Butts Jr., mayor of Inglewood, said he would not have agreed to a new NFL stadium if it required fans to chip in.\u00a0 \u201cFrom our first talks, we made it clear that was not something we were going to do,\u201d Butts said.\u00a0\u201cWe wanted a model that basically insulated the city from the buffeting winds of both the economy and ticket sales, and we have that now.\u201d But analysts say\u00a0there could be a more straightforward reason that Southern Californians, rather than, say, Philadelphians,\u00a0don\u2019t want to spend much on their teams\u2019 digs: They have more entertainment options and aren\u2019t as die-hard fans. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we care as much about our franchises as other cities,\u201d said David Carter , the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the USC Marshall School of Business. A fancy new stadium \u201cisn\u2019t as much of a must-have as it is in some of these other cities and towns that have been willing to throw public dollars at their franchises,\u201d he said. Chargers fans haven\u2019t been shy about expressing their anger at the team\u2019s relocation, and sports business experts say they probably would vote the same way on the subsidy proposal if they had the chance to do it again. San Diegans were still bitter over Chargers\u2019 owner Dean Spanos\u2019 2015 proposal to move the team to Carson\u00a0in a privately financed stadium shared with the Raiders . \u201cPeople got emotional not just about spending taxpayer money\u00a0but about the way he had alienated the San Diego people,\u201d said Jim Lackritz, co-founder of the San Diego State Sports Business M.B.A. program. There\u2019s a large group of voters, Lackritz said, who \u201cIf you put a gun to their head they are going to say, \u2018Screw it, we don\u2019t need you that bad. Go;\u00a0don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out.\u2019\u201d Whether the move to Los Angeles pays off for the Chargers remains to be seen. Like the Rams, the Chargers are required to pay a $650-million relocation fee, to be split among owners of other NFL teams,\u00a0over 10 years. But the value of the former San Diego franchise is also expected to increase dramatically in L.A., the second biggest television market in the U.S., according to analysts.\u00a0The team will pay $1 a year as a tenant in the Inglewood stadium and will help finance the project with a $200-million loan from the NFL, in addition to contributing revenue generated by the sale of personal seat licenses. \u00a0\u00a0 The NFL has suggested that the Chargers and the Rams could each pocket 18.75% of the revenue from the naming rights for the stadium along with revenue from any other sponsorship deals. The rest of that money would go into financing the building\u2019s construction. Much has been made of Angelenos'\u00a0apathy toward the Chargers, but analysts said they don't think Spanos has done anything to permanently alienate fans, or stop them from paying for pricey tickets to watch them play in Los Angeles. Doug Allen, the former\u00a0assistant executive director of the NFL Players Assn. , noted that people were skeptical when two teams from New York \u2014 \u00a0the Giants and the Jets \u2014 \u00a0moved to the same stadium in New Jersey more than three decades ago. But the relocation was ultimately a success, and the two teams together poured $1.3 billion into the new MetLife Stadium , which opened in 2010. \"It hasn\u2019t been fatal for the team or the league for a franchise to move,\" Allen said. Times staff writer Samantha\u00a0Masunaga contributed to this report.

According to a Gallup poll released Friday, more than half of people (51 percent of those surveyed) said they \u201cdisapprove\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition performance. Just 44 percent expressed approval of the president-elect, who has faced a number of controversies in the weeks following his Nov. 8 win. That\u2019s a drop of four percentage points from the 48 percent of people that approved of the president-elect in early December. Four percent of those polled say they have no opinion on the issue. Those numbers are substantially lower than the ratings of other presidents-elect before him: In 2009, 83 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Obama in the days leading up to his inauguration. In 2001, 61 percent said the same of George W. Bush, while Bill Clinton had a 68 percent approval rate in 1993. Republicans and Democrats had differing views of how Mr. Trump has handled the transition, with 87 percent of Republicans saying they approved. Only 13 percent of Democrats said the same.\u00a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominations -- several of whom have already weathered Senate confirmation hearings -- are also facing low approval ratings. In sum, Americans rate Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet as worse than those chosen by Presidents-elect Obama, Bush, and Clinton. Fifty-two percent of people believe the president-elect\u2019s Cabinet nominees are \u201caverage\u201d or better -- a low number compared to 83 percent that believed that of Mr. Obama\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s, and 81 percent that thought that of Bush\u2019s picks. Forty-four percent viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees as \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d Just 13 percent of people believed that Bush\u2019s Cabinet was staffed with \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d picks. Twelve percent believed that of Clinton\u2019s and ten percent of Obama\u2019s. The Gallup poll was conducted from Jan. 4-8, 2017, with a random sample of 1,032 adults, The margin of error is four percentage points. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst - RTX20CBK Members at an exclusive Washington-area country club think President Obama is a real duffer when it comes to foreign policy \u2013 and the fairway furor could cost him one option for a post-presidency home course. Though it\u2019s unclear whether the outgoing president would even seek membership there, some at the Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md., are preemptively trying to keep Obama out of the predominantly Jewish club amid complaints about his stance on Israel, according to reports. The members have sent a barrage of emails to club President Barry Forman and General Manager Brian Pizzimenti\u00a0saying Obama is \"not welcome.\"\u00a0 The pushback stems from Obama\u2019s decision last month not to have the U.S. veto a U.N. Security Council resolution criticizing Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and from Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s speech two days later accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining the possibility of a two-state solution. \u201c[President Obama] has created a situation in the world where Israel\u2019s very existence is weakened and possibly threatened,\u201d longtime member Faith Goldstein wrote in a Dec. 26 email obtained by the Washington Post . \u201cHe is not welcome at Woodmont. His admittance would create a storm that could destroy our club. \u201d Expand / Contract Aug. 18, 2013: President Obama prepares to tee off while golfing at Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown, Mass. (AP) A Dec. 15 email to Forman from Bethesda attorney Marc B. Abrams reportedly said Obama\u2019s stance on Israel should make it \u201cinconceivable\u201d that club leaders would even think of granting him membership. \u201cIf you have views on this matter, I would urge you to make them known quickly,\u201d Abrams wrote. \u201cTiming is critical.\u201d During his eight years in the White House, the commander-in-chief racked up more than 300 days on the links with most rounds taking place at the course at Andrews Air Force Base or while on vacation in Hawaii. But with the Obama family staying in D.C. until their daughter Sasha finishes high school, the outgoing president will need to find a new club in the D.C. area. There has been no official indication Obama plans to apply for membership at Woodmont, but he has played at least four rounds at the course during his presidency and reports from last summer indicate Woodmont would be his club of choice when he leaves the Oval Office. Representatives from Woodmont did not return FoxNews.com\u2019s requests for comment, but the sentiments over the president\u2019s policies in the Middle East appear far from unanimous among the club\u2019s members and local Jewish activists. \u201cHow cool is it that the first African American president of the United States may well be joining a country club originally established because Jews couldn\u2019t get in anywhere else?\u201d Ron Halber, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, said in an article published over the summer by the Jewish newspaper The Forward . Halber is not a member at Woodmont. More on this... ",

    "text": "What would happen? The Republican bill is expected to eliminate the subsidies. This would make insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans and sharply reduce the number who buy their own health coverage. Advertisement Continue reading the main story With many fewer people buying coverage, the insurance markets are likely to become increasingly unstable . Many insurers will stop offering policies, and the remaining customers are likely to be sicker than current Obamacare buyers, a reality that will drive up the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it, and force more people out of the markets. The Urban Institute estimat e s that the change would cause a total of 22.5 million people to lose their health insurance. What might replace it? Separate legislation may include some new form of subsidy to help people afford insurance. Plans from House Speaker Paul Ryan and the budget committee chairman Tom Price , President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would both offer a flat tax credit to help buy insurance that varies by age. A proposal from the House Republican Study Committee would give all Americans a standard tax deduction to buy insurance. Photo Credit Leif Parsons 2) Obamacare insured millions more by expanding Medicaid. The health law provided federal funds for states to offer Medicaid coverage to anyone earning less than about $16,000 for a single person or $33,000 for a family of four. Not every state chose to expand, but most did. What would happen? The Republican plan is expected to eliminate federal funding for the expansion. An estimated 12.9 million people would lose Medicaid coverage, according to the Urban Institute\u2019s projections. What might replace it? Republican leaders have discussed reforming the remaining Medicaid program to give states more autonomy and to reduce future federal investment. Photo Credit Leif Parsons 3) Obamacare established consumer protections for health insurance. One of the law\u2019s signature features prevents insurance companies from denying coverage or charging a higher price to someone with a pre-existing health problem. The law included a host of other protections for all health plans: a ban on setting a lifetime limit on how much an insurer has to pay to cover someone; a requirement that insurers offer a minimum package of benefits; a guarantee that preventive health services be covered without a co-payment; a cap on insurance company profits; and limits on how much more insurers can charge older people than younger people. The law also required insurance plans to allow adult children to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until age 26. What would happen? These rules can\u2019t be changed using the special budget process, so they would stay in place for now. But eliminating some of the other provisions, like the subsidies, and leaving the insurance rules could create turmoil in the insurance markets, since sick customers would have a much stronger incentive to stay covered when premiums rise. . What might replace it? Mr. Trump has said that he\u2019d like to keep the law\u2019s policies on pre-existing conditions and family coverage for young adults, but Senate Republicans recently voted against nonbinding resolutions to preserve those measures, suggesting they may be less committed. Some of the other provisions would probably be on the table if there were new legislation. Republicans in Congress would probably eliminate rules that require a minimum package of benefits for all insurance plans and allow states to determine what insurers would have to include. Mr. Trump has said he\u2019d like to encourage the sale of insurance across state lines , a policy likely to make coverage more skimpy but less expensive for many customers. Republicans would also like to expand tax incentives for people to save money for health expenses. Advertisement Many of the Republican proposals would also establish so-called high-risk pools, which would provide subsidized insurance options for people with chronic health problems who wouldn\u2019t be able to buy insurance without rules forcing insurers to sell them coverage. Photo Credit Leif Parsons 4) Obamacare required individuals to have health insurance and companies to offer it to their workers. To ensure that enough healthy people entered insurance markets, the law included mandates to encourage broader coverage. Large employers that failed to offer affordable coverage, or individuals who failed to obtain insurance, could be charged a tax penalty. What would happen? The bill is expected to eliminate the mandates. Some experts think that eliminating the individual mandate, in particular, could destabilize insurance markets by reducing incentives for healthy people to buy coverage. The mandate had less of an impact on the employers, which had already been offering coverage. What might replace it? Some Republican plans would allow insurers to charge much higher rates to customers who allow their coverage to lapse than to those who renew their policies every year. Such a system might provide a different financial incentive for healthy people to stay insured. Photo Credit Leif Parsons 5) Obamacare raised taxes related to high incomes, prescription drugs, medical devices and health insurance. To help pay for the law\u2019s coverage expansion, it raised taxes on several players in the health industry and on high-income earners. What would happen? The G.O.P. package may roll back those tax increases, though there is some disagreement among Republican lawmakers about the deficit impact of such changes. What might replace it? Republicans have not discussed raising new taxes to replace those in the Affordable Care Act. But some of their plans would limit the tax benefits offered to people who get their health insurance through work. That change would increase tax revenues, but would increase the cost of health insurance for many people who get it through work. Photo Credit Leif Parsons 6) Obamacare made major reforms to Medicare payments. The law cut the annual pay raises Medicare gives hospitals and reduced the fees Medicare pays private insurance companies. It created new incentives for hospitals and doctors to improve quality. It also set up a special office to run experiments in how Medicare pays doctors and hospitals for health care services. Those experiments are now widespread and have begun changing the way medicine is practiced in some places. Advertisement Continue reading the main story What would happen? The new legislation is expected to leave these changes alone, even though many have come under criticism by Republicans in Congress over the years, including from Mr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon. Many of the experiments could be reshaped or eliminated through regulation or through a future budget process. What might replace it? Republicans in Congress have long talked about even more ambitious changes to Medicare, intended to move more beneficiaries into private insurance coverage. Mr. Trump has said that he does not want to make major changes to Medicare, so it is unclear if such a proposal would move forward. Photo Credit Leif Parsons 7) Obamacare made many smaller changes that will probably last. Obamacare had a range of policies meant to improve health and health care, including requirements that drug companies report payments made to physicians, a provision written by the Iowa senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican; a requirement that chain restaurants publish calorie counts on their menus; and a rule that large employers must provide a space for women to express breast milk. What would happen? When Republicans talk about repealing Obamacare, they tend to focus on the parts of the law that expanded insurance coverage and regulated health insurance products, not these ancillary parts. That means that portions of the Affordable Care Act that people don\u2019t associate with the word \u201cObamacare\u201d are likely to endure.

(Photo: Daily Times file photo) 937 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 52 COMMENTEMAILMORE FARMINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it will not pay more than $1.2 \u00a0billion in claims filed against it in response to the Gold King Mine spill . The EPA says the Federal Tort Claims Act prevents the agency from paying claims the result from \"discretionary\u201d government actions. Congress passed the law to allow government agencies \u2014\u00a0and in this case, contractors working on their behalf\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to act \"without the fear of paying damages in the event something went wrong while taking the action,\" according to a press release from the EPA. An EPA agency official said paying the claims would discourage such cleanup efforts in the future. The EPA says the work conducted at the Gold King Mine\u00a0near Silverton, Colo., is considered a \"discretionary function\"\u00a0under the law. Contractors on Aug. 5, 2015, breached the mine, which released more than three million\u00a0gallons of toxic wastewater into a tributary that feeds the Animas River, which ultimately flows into the San Juan River and Lake Powell. Federal lawmakers representing New Mexico decried the announcement, calling it a \"shameful legal interpretation of liability.\" Sens. Tom Udall\u00a0and\u00a0Martin Heinrich, New Mexico Democrats,\u00a0and Rep.\u00a0Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n\u00a0(D-N.M.) issued a joint statement saying they would continue pushing for legislation to hold the EPA accountable. They also said it would be up to the courts to determine whether the EPA's defense is legitimate. \"We are outraged at this last-ditch move by the federal government's lawyers to go back on the EPA's promise to the people of the state of New Mexico \u2014 and especially the Navajo Nation \u2014 that it would fully address this environmental disaster that still plagues the people of the Four Corners region,\u201d the statement reads. The statement points out that while the EPA has taken steps to clean up the mine, \"no farmer has received a dime of compensation over a year later.\" An EPA official says 73 claims related to the mine spill were filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Four were from governmental agencies and the rest were from individuals and companies. The mouth of the Gold King Mine, located north of Silverton, Colo., is pictured on Aug. 10, 2015, several days after a crew working on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency breached the mine, causing toxic wastewater to enter the Animas River. \u00a0(Photo: Daily Times file photo) The claims totaled more than $1.2 billion, though the official said the federal agency did not evaluate the legitimacy of the claims and some were vague and for \"extraordinarily\" large sums. The EPA official acknowledged the length of time it has taken the agency to make its announcement, adding \"we spent a lot of time trying to see if there was any other way to address this because this is obviously an answer that leaves a lot of people unhappy who have been hurt.\" Those who filed claims have six months from the date of denial to challenge the decision with the U.S. District Court. 937 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 52 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jFFHpI NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "National Security Adviser nominee Michael Flynn walks in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP National Security Adviser nominee Michael Flynn walks in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Evan Vucci/AP The man tapped to be national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, exchanged text messages and spoke with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, in December \u2014 around the time of the Obama administration's response to Russian interference during the presidential campaign, a spokesman for Trump acknowledged Friday. Trump's Cabinet Picks Break With Him On At Least 10 Major Issues But Sean Spicer, the spokesman and incoming White House press secretary, insisted all of this contact happened before President Obama announced the retaliation, and, as a result, Obama's move to expel 35 Russian diplomats wasn't a topic of conversation. This came in response to a Washington Post column from David Ignatius that raised serious questions about contact between Flynn and the ambassador. In the column, Ignatius writes he was told by a \"senior U.S. government official\" that Flynn had called the ambassador several times on the day of Obama's action. Ignatius then asks: \"What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions? The Logan Act (though never enforced) bars U.S. citizens from correspondence intending to influence a foreign government about 'disputes' with the United States. Was its spirit violated?\" And it comes in a week in which the focus on Russia and Trump's relationship with the country has been front and center. Spicer was asked about the column in a call with reporters, and that's when he confirmed that contact had happened, but he said it wasn't as described in the column. Here's the timeline as described by Spicer: Article continues after sponsorship CHART: Who's Who In The Future Trump Administration \u2014 \"Christmas Day, Gen. Flynn reached out to the ambassador, sent him a text and it said, 'I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I look forward to touching base with you and working with you, and I wish you all the best.' The ambassador texted him back wishing him a Merry Christmas as well,\" Spicer said. \u2014 \"And then subsequently on the 28th of December [the ambassador] texted [Flynn] and said, 'I'd like to give you a call, may I?' \" \u2014 \"[Flynn] then took that call on the 28th and the call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the president-elect after he was sworn in. And they exchanged logistical information on how to initiate and schedule that call. That was it, plain and simple.\" Donald Trump's Press Conference, Annotated President Obama ordered two Russian diplomatic compounds closed and 35 Russian diplomats expelled from the United States the next day, Dec. 29. Ignatius has updated his column to reflect what he was told by Trump's team, which initially hadn't responded to his request for comment. Here is what Ignatius wrote in the update: \"UPDATE: The Trump transition team did not respond Thursday night to a request for comment. But two team members called with information Friday morning. A first Trump official confirmed that Flynn had spoken with Kislyak by phone, but said the calls were before sanctions were announced and didn't cover that topic. This official later added that Flynn's initial call was to express condolences to Kislyak after the terrorist killing of the Russian ambassador to Ankara Dec. 19, and that Flynn made a second call Dec. 28 to express condolences for the shoot-down of a Russian plane carrying a choir to Syria. In that second call, Flynn also discussed plans for a Trump-Putin conversation sometime after the inauguration. In addition, a second Trump official said that Kislyak had initiated a call to Flynn to invite a representative of the Trump administration to a conference that would be taking place in Kazakhstan at the end of January; the official didn't provide a date for the Kazakhstan-related call.\" A transition official confirmed to NPR that in addition to talking about logistics for a post-inaugural phone call, the Russian ambassador also extended an invitation to the conference related to the conflict in Syria, which is set to take place in Kazakhstan. The transition official says no commitments about attending were made during the call. Additionally, the official couldn't say whether there had been any contact between Flynn and the ambassador since Dec. 28. This could all be a whole lot of nothing, or it could be something more serious. It isn't uncommon for ambassadors to try to reach out to incoming administrations. But critics have long raised concerns about Flynn's relationship with Russia and in particular RT, the Russian state-owned English-language network (considered by the U.S. intelligence community to be a propaganda tool). Flynn made appearances on the network and even sat next to Putin at an event celebrating its 10th anniversary. Russian President Vladimir Putin sits next to Flynn at an exhibition marking the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today) in Moscow on Dec. 10, 2015. Mikhail Klimentyev/AP hide caption toggle caption Mikhail Klimentyev/AP Russian President Vladimir Putin sits next to Flynn at an exhibition marking the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today) in Moscow on Dec. 10, 2015. Mikhail Klimentyev/AP It's been a week of intense focus on Russia First, there was the release of the unverified document claiming Russia has compromising material on the president-elect and that there had been contact between Trump's team and Russian officials during the campaign. Trump's team has strongly disputed these unverified (and in some cases verified to be false) claims calling the document and those who reported on it \"fake news.\" Trump's Plan To Shift His Businesses Is Lacking, Ethics Experts Say It came to dominate Trump's first news conference since winning the election. In that same news conference, Trump said he did think Russia was behind the campaign-related hacking and document releases, but he also said, \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what folks? That's called an asset, not a liability. Now I don't know that I am going to get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do, but there is a good chance I won't.\" Then there were the confirmation hearings for Trump's picks for national security positions. All expressed a harder line toward Russia and its leader than Trump has. And finally, there were two totally bizarre occurrences on Capitol Hill. Just as the man who hopes to become CIA chief was testifying and a senator was in the middle of asking him about Russian interference, the power went out in the building, cutting the feed to C-SPAN, which was televising the hearing. In A Surprise Send-Off, Obama Awards Biden Presidential Medal Of Freedom And, on the same day, as a congresswoman was making a speech on the House floor, again about Russia, the C-SPAN live stream online switched to a feed of RT. \"This afternoon the online feed for C-SPAN was briefly interrupted by RT programming,\" a C-SPAN spokesman said in a statement to NPR's Susan Davis. \"We are currently investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence. As RT is one of the networks we regularly monitor, we are operating under the assumption that it was an internal routing issue. If that changes we will certainly let you know.\" ",

Bruce Rauner's veto of a measure that would have provided $215 million in state aid. The furlough days will not interrupt classrooms because all are on previously scheduled staff professional development days. CPS officials said the effort was expected to save $35 million. Faced with an even larger budget gap last year, the district ordered three furlough days. In a letter sent Friday to district employees, CPS CEO Forrest Claypool took aim at Rauner and warned that without state action the district could be \"forced to take additional steps to reduce spending.\" The furlough days are Feb. 3, April 7, June 21 and June 22. Rauner's veto late last year has left CPS officials to weigh a number of cost-cutting steps because the district was counting on the $215 million to help balance the budget for this school year. The district has depleted its once substantial reserves and has relied on short-term borrowing to pay its bills. The district has said in financial disclosures that it will turn to budget cuts, unspecified legal action and borrowing in efforts to close budget gaps left by shortfalls in expected state assistance.

That's the question James E. Mitchell, psychologist and architect of the CIA\u2019s controversial \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d program, hopes the administration of incoming president Donald Trump takes on - and then opts for the less \u201cpolitically correct\u201d answer. During the presidential campaign, Trump sanctioned torture, suggesting that he would bring back techniques like waterboarding and \u201cmuch worse.\u201d However, his pick to head the Department of Defense, Gen. James Mattis, is an opponent of harsh interrogation methods \u2013 preferring more humanitarian means such as building rapport. Mitchell contends that rapport is more likely to work on regular jihadists, but that top-tier planners are ultimately counting on America\u2019s political correctness \u2013 and going soft on them \u2013 to make the terrorists\u2019 mission easier. \u201cKhalid Sheikh Mohammed (K.S.M.) really thought that Sept. 11 was a law enforcement matter that would get turned over to the FBI and would give him time to launch more attacks,\u201d Mitchell, 64, told FoxNews.com. \u201cHe was stunned when Bush said, \u2018No, this is a war.\u2019 He would froth at the mouth talking about \u2018that cowboy George W. Bush.\u2019\u201d Mitchell and fellow psychologist Bruce Jessen were brought on as CIA contractors after 9/11 to devise and carry out the enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs) used on the most high-value prisoners, including chief 9/11 planner K.S.M. and senior Al Qaeda member, Abu Zubaydah. Mitchell spent countless hours with these prisoners at a number of CIA \u201cblack sites.\u201d He also stressed to FoxNews.com that the full closure of Guantanamo Bay, where the likes of K.S.M. and Zubaydah are being held, would be a mistake. \u201cThe ones that are left are the worst of the worst,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cClosing Gitmo is one of those things some politicians believe will make the world like us more and give us the moral high ground. But in the mind of K.S.M., us seeking the moral high ground is a sign of weakness.\u201d Mitchell recalled one afternoon \u201csitting around\u201d with K.S.M. when the detainee admitted that while jihadist outfits do use Gitmo as a recruiting tool, if the off-shore prison were closed they would just find other fodder \u2013 such as \u201cthe treatment of Muslim women in Europe\u201d or the \u201cpresence of infidels in the Arabian peninsula.\u201d But what most surprised him about K.S.M. was how \u201ccharming\u201d and likable he could be. \u201cHe would hold your hand, trying to manipulate [you],\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt is easy to recognize evil when it looks evil and acts evil. It is harder to recognize evil when it looks appealing.\u201d Mitchell came under fire in late 2014 when the then Sen. Dianne Feinstein-led Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released an exhaustive report on interrogation techniques used on detainees. Feinstein called the program \u201ca stain on our values and our history.\u201d However, Mitchell argues that the Senate \u201ccherry-picked\u201d documents to suggest that the CIA\u2019s use of such harsh techniques was ineffective at collecting accurate intelligence. In his experience, Mitchell said, the agency gathered useful information not during the duress of an actual EIT but in the moments in-between, when detainees knew what was awaiting them. He also told FoxNews.com that the public unveiling of the indictment and banning of previously DOJ-approved techniques like waterboarding and sleep-deprivation plays into the terrorist playbook. \u201cIt made us look divided, that we are weak,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt signals to them that there are people in our government who are only concerned about preserving the moral high ground. And K.S.M. did say that (Americans) don\u2019t have the stomach to do what needs to be done, and that is what this signals.\u201d Mitchell has since sought to set the record straight about his involvement in the program and late last year released the book, \"Enhanced Interrogation: Inside the Minds and Motives of the Islamic Terrorists Trying to Destroy America,\" written in conjunction with former CIA spokesperson Bill Harlow. In 2015, two former detainees held at secret CIA prisons \u2013 Tanzanian Suleiman Abdullah Salim and Libyan Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud \u2013 as well as a representative of Afghan citizen Gul Rahman, who died in custody likely from hypothermia, filed a lawsuit against Mitchell and Jessen for allegedly violating their human rights. The plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\u00a0 Human rights groups also have called for the contractors to be prosecuted. While some CIA personnel may not have acted with government approval during interrogations, Mitchell said, he is adamant that he and Jessen are merely fall guys. The lawsuit trial is slated to begin in June and if they are found liable, it would be the first time that a U.S civilian court has held any individuals accountable for widely condemned interrogation methods like waterboarding. \u201cAnd the irony of this is that the only two people who really tried to get Rahman medical care,\u201d Mitchell stated, \u201cwere me and Bruce.\u201d Advertisement ",

    "text": "Feds Launch New Rail Crossing Safety Campaign With Striking Video By JEFFREY COOK Jan 13, 2017, 1:24 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Feds Launch New Rail Crossing Safety Campaign: \u2018Stop. Trains Can't.\u2019 0 Shares Email The Department of Transportation kicked off a new railroad crossing safety campaign on Friday with a striking new video . The ad, a collaborative effort between the Federal Railroad Administration and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, shows a freight train traveling through the outskirts of a city before crashing into the side of an SUV. The engineer appears to apply the brakes, but it cannot slow down quickly enough. The train travels some distance as the vehicle is violently dragged along the tracks. The ad's title is \"Stop. Trains Can't.\" According to the FRA, it takes a freight train traveling at 55 mph a mile to come to a complete stop even with the emergency brake applied. By law, a train always has the right of way. \u201cEducation is key here \u2013 sometimes a driver is distracted, or in an unfamiliar area. Other times, the state highway department has not done enough to warn drivers they are approaching a crossing,\u201d said FRA Administrator Sarah E. Feinberg. \u201cWe must do everything we can to give drivers the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe \u2013 and this ad helps us do just that.\" According to federal data, a person or vehicle is hit by a train in the United States approximately every three hours. \u201cToo many people are still taking unnecessary risks and needlessly paying with their lives,\u201d according to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx . \u201cThese deaths are preventable, and this ad campaign is a reminder for everyone that ignoring signage at railroad crossings or attempting to race or beat a train can have deadly consequences.\u201d Close Call on Camera: School Bus Narrowly Misses Train The Department of Transportation is spending $7 million to run the ad, which targets males between the ages of 18 and 49 in the areas where railroad crossing accidents are particularly problematic. The ads will run in California, Illinois, Texas, Louisiana, Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Mississippi, New Jersey, Arkansas and Arizona. Teamed up w/ @NHTSAgov to send a clear message in a new nationwide ad: STOP. Trains Can't. https://t.co/GG9a28MzZT pic.twitter.com/0KdJpSMmsQ \u2014 The FRA (@USDOTFRA) January 13, 2017 In April, the FRA listed the most troublesome railroad crossings in the United States. Using data from the last 10 years, four of the five crossings with the most incidents are in Arizona. There have been 24 incidents since 2006 at this Phoenix crossing. None of the incidents were fatal. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Woman Charged in Adopted Daughter's Death Fostered 30 Kids By maryclaire dale, associated press PHILADELPHIA \u0097 Jan 13, 2017, 7:38 PM ET 0 Shares Email A woman charged along with her boyfriend in the rape, murder and dismemberment of her adopted 14-year-old daughter took in 30 foster kids before her then-husband was deemed a sexual predator. Former adoption worker Sara Packer and her ex-husband fostered the children from 2000 to 2010, when they led a transient life in northeast Pennsylvania , state officials confirmed on Friday. The state's Department of Human Services said it was reviewing the family's history leading up to the torture death of adopted daughter Grace Packer. Sara Packer and her boyfriend, Jacob Sullivan, are charged with killing Grace in their Bucks County home before Packer reported her missing in July. Grace's body was found in a wooded area upstate in October, and the couple were charged with murder on Sunday after a joint suicide attempt. Packer and Sullivan are being held without bail until a preliminary hearing set for next week. Neither has a lawyer listed in court records. But Sullivan apologized as he was led into court, the Intelligencer newspaper reported. \"I'm sorry for what I did,\" Sullivan said. \"It was wrong.\" Packer's ex-husband, David Packer, was convicted in 2011 of raping a foster teen and molesting Grace between 2006 and 2010, when the family lived in Allentown. The foster teen, who was learning disabled, initially told police David Packer had had sex with her when she was 18 and Sara Parker knew about it, authorities said. \"As reprehensible as that may be, it isn't a crime ,\" said Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin, whose office prosecuted the case. However, the teen ultimately disclosed the sex had begun when she was 15. David Packer went to prison for about five years on statutory rape and indecent assault charges. Sara Packer was barred from taking in more foster children and lost her $44,000-a-year job as a Northampton County adoption supervisor over unspecified misconduct. But she kept her two adopted children: Grace and her biological younger brother. And there would have been no child welfare checks unless a new complaint was filed, since adoptive parents have the same rights as other parents, Martin said. \"Grace, who was subsequently raped and murdered, was an adopted child. That adoption was already a fait accompli,\" he said. \"It's a horrific story, but I don't know what else my office or the Allentown Police Department could have done at the time.\" Within a few years, Sara Packer and the two children were living with Sullivan, a draftsman, in Glenside, in Montgomery County. In the fall of 2015, they sent Grace to live with a relative in North Carolina , where she spent several happy months, prosecutors said. When she returned home, the couple started plotting her death, a police affidavit says. Sara Packer watched as Sullivan raped Grace on July 8 and then went out to buy Tylenol PM used to sedate Grace before they left her to die, bound and gagged, in a sweltering attic, the affidavit said. When they found her still alive the next day, Sullivan strangled her, police said. They packed her body in cat litter and hid it in the house for several months before they cut it up with a saw and dumped it in the woods, police said. The Packers had adopted Grace and her brother when she was 3, after a Berks County judge removed them from a home where they had been sexually abused by adults living with their parents. The Department of Human Services has opened a six-month review of the Packer family that will include checks on the welfare of the 30 former foster children, authorities said. \"If there is a systemic review that comes out of this horrible tragedy, at least we can take some solace in that ... so children like Grace are not forgotten, so they don't fall through the cracks,\" said Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub, whose office is leading the murder investigation. Court records show the Packers divorced last June. David Packer's lawyer from a 2010 case said this week he couldn't comment. A man who answered the phone at Sara Packer's father's home declined to comment and hung up. 0 Shares ",

By Mike DeBonis January 13 at 5:35 PM Follow @mikedebonis Congress took its first step toward rolling back President Obama\u2019s health-care reform law Friday, with the House voting along party lines to pass a crucial precursor to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s unraveling. It will now only get harder for Republicans. They must assemble a viable replacement for a law that has expanded health insurance coverage to roughly 20 million Americans and eliminated unpopular insurance industry practices, such as lifetime coverage caps and widespread refusal to cover already-sick individuals. Republican leaders have instead focused on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s flaws \u2014 rising premiums for plans sold in state marketplaces, high deductibles and burdensome taxes. GOP lawmakers are set to gather in Philadelphia later this month to hash out a more complete alternative. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Friday\u2019s nearly party-line vote would launch a \u201cthoughtful, step-by-step process\u201d including action by both Congress and the Trump administration. \u201cThis is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is a truly patient-centered system, which means more options to choose from, lower costs and greater control over your coverage. And as we work to get there, we will make sure that there is a stable transition period so that people don\u2019t have the rug pulled out from under them.\u201d The final vote was 227 to 198, with nine Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no. The budget measure, which was passed Thursday by the Senate, paves the way for Republicans to use special budget procedures to repeal major parts of the law without cooperation from Democrats. House Republicans from divergent wings of the party raised concerns this week about taking that initial step without having a more detailed plan in place for ultimately replacing Obamacare with a GOP alternative. [Anxious lawmakers to GOP leaders: What\u2019s the plan to replace Obamacare?] House leaders worked to address those concerns, even as President-elect Donald J. Trump made public statements setting out an ambitious timeline for action that many lawmakers see as unrealistic. During a nationally televised town hall meeting Thursday, Ryan said Congress would act \u201cdefinitely within these first 100 days\u201d on a replacement plan. [Why Obamacare is unlikely to die a swift death] Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-Wash.), House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), and Vice President-elect Mike Pence listen to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) during a Jan. 4 Republican press conference on Capitol Hill. House GOP lawmakers were set to vote Friday to start the process of rolling back the Affordable Care Act. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) The handful of House Republicans who opposed the budget measure Friday remained wary about the path ahead. About half were moderates, half hardline conservatives. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about the content than the timing,\u201d said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), a former insurance executive who voted no. \u201cI think we\u2019re going a little too fast. That said, I understand leadership\u2019s goals and I agree with them: We have to fix what is clearly broken with Obamacare.\u201d A number of skeptical Republicans polled Friday said they had gotten sufficient assurances on the process ahead that they would vote \u201cyes.\u201d One lawmaker familiar with behind-the-scenes GOP discussions said leaders pledged to hold a vote on a replacement bill alongside the ACA repeal legislation. Leaders also promised, the lawmaker said, to include in that repeal bill \u2014 which would be subject to the special budget procedures \u2014 major elements of a replacement plan. Under those procedures, known as reconciliation, only provisions with definitive budgetary impacts can be included in the bill, so it could not be used for a complete Obamacare alternative. \u201cWe\u2019ve been showing more of the details, but a lot of this is going to be done in committee,\u201d said Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the majority whip. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be like what [Democratic leader] Nancy Pelosi did, where she wrote the bill in a backroom, dumped it on the floor and said, \u2018Pass the bill to find out what\u2019s in it.\u2019 We\u2019re actually going to have our committees write the bill in open hearings. I think that\u2019s going to be refreshing.\u201d Pelosi (D-Calif.), who as House speaker muscled the Obamacare legislation through in 2009 and 2010, is now leading the opposition to its repeal as minority leader. On the House floor Friday, she dismissed the \u201cmythology\u201d surrounding the ACA \u2014 which did, in fact, move through congressional committees, though without GOP cooperation \u2014 and accused Republicans of \u201cfeeding their ideological obsession with repealing the ACA and dismantling the health and economic security of hardworking families\u201d without coming up with a workable alternative. \u201cThey talk about repeal and replacing,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cFor six years, they have had a chance to propose an alternative. We see nothing.\u201d Budget measures such as the one under consideration Friday are typically strictly partisan affairs. Republicans hold a 24-vote advantage over Democrats in the House; if more than a handful of Republicans had balked, GOP leaders would have faced an embarrassing delay. Republicans got a nudge this week from conservative activist groups, including the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, who called for the budget measure\u2019s passage. And Trump himself took to Twitter to hail its passage in the Senate. But for most rank-and-file Republicans, the choice was relatively simple: After running campaign after campaign against Obamacare, would they really pass up their first chance to unravel it? \u201cIf there\u2019s been one promise that Republicans have run on for the last six years, it is that we are going to do our best to repeal Obamacare,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \u201cI think that [the Friday vote] affirms our promise today.\u201d ",

(Jan. 13) AP Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson speaks during a news conference about security for the presidential inauguration on Jan. 13, 2017, at the Multi Agency Communications Center in Dulles, Va. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP) 6 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE DULLES, Va. \u2014 Federal authorities overseeing the far-flung security plan for next week's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump are fortifying a perimeter around the Capitol to account for the threat of deadly truck attacks similar to recent assaults in Germany and France that left dozens dead. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Friday that while there were \"no specific or credible threats'' targeting the inauguration events, security forces were \"doubling down'' to thwart the type of vehicle attacks that killed 12 last month at a Berlin Christmas market and left 86 dead at a July Bastille Day celebration in Nice. Johnson, who briefed reporters at a Northern Virginia command center,\u00a0said heavy construction equipment, dumpsters and other physical barriers were being strategically placed around the city. The barriers will restrict vehicle access to sensitive areas and assist with crowd control during three days of activities when up to 900,000 people are expected to flood the city. The 1.8 million people who attended the 2009 inauguration of President Obama stands as the record for inaugurations. \"The global terror environment is very different even from 2013,'' the secretary said, referring to the last inaugural ceremony marking Obama's second term. \"We have to be concerned about individual acts of violent extremism.'' Read more: Women's march an 'entry point' for a new activist wave \u00a0 Counter-terrorism officials have been increasingly concerned in recent years of the recruitment campaign waged by the Islamic State terror group, whose operatives have been urging sympathizers to lash out against domestic targets rather than risk travel to the battlefields in Syria and Iraq. Although terrorism and potential attacks from individual extremists remain top concerns of security planners charged with ensuring a peaceful transfer of power, the anticipated surge in demonstrations, both permitted and unsanctioned, also are figuring prominently. The security\u00a0operation involves 28,000 security officials, including 7,800 drawn from the ranks of the National Guard. Johnson said 99 protest groups, more than 10 times of the average number at past inaugurations, are expected. At least 63 of those groups are slated to demonstrate on Inauguration Day. D.C. police have said they are aware of the online boasts of some groups who have vowed to \"shut down'' events. Johnson said Friday that those threats have been factored in to the overall plan, though he declined to elaborate. The largest single group of demonstrators, up to 200,000, are expected to participate in the Women's March on Washington, a coalition of civil and human rights advocates, scheduled to parade through D.C. the day following Trump's Jan 20 swearing-in. \"We've got to be vigilant, we've got to plan, we've got to be prepared,'' Johnson said. \"As long as they are non-violent, (protesters) will be allowed to exercise their First Amendment rights.'' Some of the groups are the same ones who marched and protested during the summer political conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia, where authorities made few arrests despite early concerns about the possibility of violent clashes. Chris Geldart, director of D.C.'s\u00a0Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said last week that a delegation from the Washington\u00a0inaugural security team traveled to Cleveland and Philadelphia to discuss preparations and closely monitored operations in both cities. \"Dealing with protests and demonstrations is something we deal with all of the time,'' Geldart said, adding that local authorities have consistently applied a strategy of \"de-escalation'' to deal with potentially volatile groups. \"We will see more protesters here than we have seen in past inaugurations,'' Geldart said. \"But we will be ready.''

(Photo: Torin Halsey, AP) It happened again this week: headlines implied mammograms have been oversold to women. This time it was a study from Denmark that suggested one in three breast cancers found through the screening tests are \u201coverdiagnosed\u201d \u2014 meaning they never would have threatened a woman\u2019s life but still led to treatments such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Most studies have found routine mammograms lower the overall risk of dying from breast cancer, but one \u00a0published in 2014 did not. Mammograms are widely promoted, but the latest guidelines from major medical groups disagree on when and how often women should get them. It sounds like a recipe for confusion and doubt. Mammograms lead to unneeded treatment for some breast cancers Some doctors this week said they\u00a0hear\u00a0that confusion from women. Others said\u00a0their patients have started to tune out the noise. \u201cI think the controversy has been going on so long that women are getting kind of numb to it,\u201d said Mary Daly, chair of clinical genetics at Fox Chase Cancer Center in\u00a0Philadelphia. \u201cI think they\u2019ve heard this over and over again.\u201d Women in their 40s should consider mammogram every other year, group says Many women \"are sick of the headlines\" and are\u00a0not making decisions around them, said Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy at the American\u00a0Congress\u00a0of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Levy, who sees patients at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.,\u00a0said \u201cmost women in this country continue to believe that more testing is better,\u201d even when science says otherwise. \u201cEvery headline does cause some questioning,\u201d said Ruth Etzioni, a biostatistician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in\u00a0Seattle. Women definitely \u201care still trying to figure it out,\u201d and some are confused, she added. But Etzioni, who helped create mammogram screening guidelines for the American Cancer Society, said there\u2019s nothing about the latest study that should add to any confusion. x Share A new study finds that the amount of women receiving mammogram breast cancer screenings increased under Obamacare. Josh King reports. Buzz60 Previous studies, she said, found overdiagnosis\u00a0rates ranging from less than 5% to 50%. The real issue today, she said, is that doctors do not have all the tools they need to sort out which early tumors need treatment, especially in cases labeled ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS.\u00a0Research to see if some of these early or pre-cancers can be safely monitored without immediate treatment is starting now. Most women are not aware of the debate over DCIS and overtreatment\u00a0and that should change, Etzioni says. At least one survey found most women are aware that routine mammograms can raise false alarms that lead to biopsies and other follow-up tests.\u00a0But that survey also\u00a0found women did not consider that risk an important factor in making decisions about mammograms, said\u00a0Therese Bevers, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in\u00a0Houston. Most women who get a biopsy that turns out to be negative \u201care actually grateful the extra effort is being made,\u201d she said. Certain Hispanic women more likely to die of breast cancer than others Deborah Cassel, 64, of Harleysville, Pa, said that\u2019s how she felt about the three biopsies she\u2019s had since she started getting yearly mammograms at age 42 because of a strong family history of breast cancer.\u00a0After the negative results,\u00a0\u201cI could sleep at night,\u201d she said. Cassel said she does not hear much confusion about mammograms among women her age: \u201cOnce you\u2019ve reached my age, you\u2019ve made\u00a0your decision, you are doing what you do. It's the younger women who may be confused.\u201d That makes sense, because advice for younger women is where official guidelines differ most. The American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. The cancer society recommends annual screening from age\u00a045 to 54 and screening every two years after that. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every two years starting at age 50, though it says some women may choose to start in their 40s after\u00a0discussions with their doctors. Sen. Claire McCaskill discloses breast cancer diagnosis Michelle Baumann, 41, of Melissa, \u00a0Texas, had one of those discussions with her doctor when she was 39,\u00a0before any guideline recommends screening, She\u00a0ended up having a mammogram that led to the discovery of two small but invasive cancers in one\u00a0breast and a double mastectomy. She says she is glad she did not let cautionary studies dissuade her from either the mammogram or the aggressive treatment. \u201cIt really does upset me to think I\u2019d still be waiting and all the while something inside of me would have been growing and working against me,\u201d she said.

    "text": "'Exorcist' Author William Peter Blatty Dead at 89 By hillel italie, ap national writer NEW YORK \u0097 Jan 13, 2017, 12:10 PM ET 0 Shares Email Novelist and filmmaker William Peter Blatty, a former Jesuit school valedictorian who conjured a tale of demonic possession and gave millions the fright of their lives with the best-selling novel and Oscar-winning movie \"The Exorcist,\" has died. He was 89. Blatty died Thursday at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where he lived, his widow, Julie Alicia Blatty, told The Associated Press. The cause of death was multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer, she said. Inspired by an incident in a Washington suburb that Blatty had read about while in college, \"The Exorcist\" was published in 1971, followed two years later by the film of the same name. Blatty's story of a 12-year-old-girl inhabited by a satanic force spent more than a year on The New York Times fiction best-seller list and eventually sold more than 10 million copies. It reached a far wider audience through the movie version, directed by William Friedkin, produced and written by Blatty and starring Linda Blair as the young, bedeviled Regan. \"RIP William Peter Blatty, who wrote the great horror novel of our time,\" Stephen King tweeted Friday. \"So long, Old Bill.\" Even those who thought they had seen everything had never seen anything like the R-rated \"The Exorcist\" and its assault of vomit, blood, rotting teeth, ghastly eyes and whirlwind head-spinning \u2014 courtesy of makeup and special effects maestro Dick Smith. Fans didn't care that Vincent Canby of The New York Times found it a \"chunk of elegant occultist claptrap,\" or that the set burned down during production. They stood for hours in freezing weather for the winter release and kept coming even as the movie, with its omnipresent soundtrack theme, Mike Oldfield's chilly, tingly \"Tubular Bells,\" cast its own disturbing spell. From around the world came reports of fainting, puking, epileptic fits, audience members charging the screen and waving rosary beads, and, in England, a boy committing murder and blaming \"The Exorcist.\" The Rev. Billy Graham would allege that the film's very celluloid was evil. \"I was standing in the back of a theater in New York at the first public press screening of the film, too nervous to sit down,\" Blatty told IGN.com in 2000. \"And along came a woman who got up in about the fifth or sixth row. A young woman, who started walking up the aisle, slowly at first. She had her hand to her head. And then I could see her lips moving. She got close enough, and I could hear her murmuring, 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.'\" Named the scariest movie of all time by Entertainment Weekly, \"The Exorcist\" topped $400 million worldwide at the box office, among the highest at the time for an R-rated picture. Oscar voters also offered rare respect for a horror film: \"The Exorcist\" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and received two, for best sound and Blatty's screenplay. Imitations, parodies and sequels were inevitable, whether the Leslie Nielsen spoof \"Repossessed\"; the four subsequent \"Exorcist\" movies (only one of which, \"The Exorcist III,\" involved Blatty) or a stage version performed in 2012 at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. \"When I was writing the novel I thought of it as a super-natural detective story, and to this day I cannot recall having a conscious intention to terrifying anybody, which you may take, I suppose, as an admission of failure on an almost stupefying scale,\" Blatty told The Huffington Post in 2011. Blatty returned to the \"Exorcist\" setting in \"Legion,\" which he adapted into \"The Exorcist III.\" He also revised a novel from the 1960s, \"Twinkle, Twinkle, 'Killer Kane'''; renamed it \"The Ninth Configuration\" and wrote and directed a 1980 film version that brought Blatty a Golden Globe for best screenplay. In 2011, he worked in a new scene for a reissue of the 1971 novel, originally acquired by Bantam Books for a reported $250,000. More recently, Fox announced it would revive the story as a TV series, starring Geena Davis. Blatty was married four times and had eight children. \"He was an absolutely wonderful, kind, generous, faith-filled man, and I was very blessed to be his wife,\" Julie Blatty said. The son of Lebanese immigrants, Blatty was born in New York City and remembered a childhood of unpaid bills and nonstop evasion of rent collectors. He was a scholarship student at the Jesuit high school Brooklyn Preparatory (future Penn State football coach Joe Paterno was a year behind) and graduated as class valedictorian. He received another scholarship to attend Georgetown University and earned a master's in English literature from George Washington University. As recounted in his memoir \"I'll Tell Them I Remember You,\" he took many detours on his journey to the top. He sold vacuum cleaners, drove a beer truck, served in the Air Force, was stationed in Beirut by the United States Information Agency, tried and failed to get stories published in Collier's, and auditioned for a role in Cecil B. DeMille's Biblical epic \"The Ten Commandments.\" He alleged that he was turned down because his eyes were blue. For much of the 1960s, he turned out screenplays, including for the Blake Edwards films \"A Shot in the Dark\" and \"What Did You Do In the War, Daddy?\" By the end of the decade, he was in a state of \"financial desperation\" and finally got around to a novel he had been thinking about for years. He had remembered a Washington Post report from the late 1940s: A 14-year-old boy from Maryland was reportedly possessed, his condition defined by a visiting Duke University official as \"the most impressive example of poltergeist phenomena I have ever come across.\" \"Like so many Catholics, I've had so many little battles of wavering faith over the course of my life,\" Blatty, who would allege numerous mysterious events while working on the book, told IGN.com. \"And when I heard about this case and read the details, that seemed so compelling. I thought, 'My God, if someone were to investigate this and authenticate it, what a tremendous boost to faith it would be.' I thought, 'Someday I would like to see that happen. You know, I would like to do it.'\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writer Ben Nuckols in Washington contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

KWTV Email Last Updated Jan 13, 2017 4:23 PM EST ST. LOUIS -- A thick glaze of ice covered roads from Oklahoma to southern Illinois on Friday amid a winter storm that caused numerous wrecks, forced cancellation of schools, grounded flights and prompted dire warnings for people to stay home. Winter storms are typically associated with heavy snowfall, but the one hammering the southern Plains and Midwest dumped freezing rain, a condition even harder for road crews to treat. A slick roadway was suspected in a fatal wreck in Missouri, where long stretches of Interstate 44 and Interstate 55 were ice-covered. One of CBS Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV \u2019s cameras was rolling when a vehicle lost control on Interstate 40 as crews were responding to a wreck. \u00a0 News9.com - Oklahoma City, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports | More freezing precipitation was expected in parts of the nation\u2019s central corridor throughout most of the holiday weekend. \u201cThere\u2019s no mystery to driving on ice,\u201d Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Al Nothum said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do. You have to slow your speed down.\u201d Hundreds of schools were closed, including several college campuses. St. Louis closed all city operations as it braced for its worst ice storm in at least a decade. Several Missouri prisons halted visiting hours. The weather atmosphere was so turbulent that thunder rumbled as freezing rain fell in Joplin, Missouri. Several utility companies brought in all available crews who were working extended shifts in anticipation of heavy ice snapping trees and power lines. Scattered outages were reported, including about 2,500 in Springfield, Missouri. Forecasters issued ice storm warnings from the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles into southern Illinois, with up to 1 inch of ice expected in some locations. Precipitation is forecast to fall in waves Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Residents were taking the warnings seriously. Grocery stores were selling out of bread, milk and other necessities, and hardware stores were running out of flashlights, batteries and alternative energy sources. \u201cThey\u2019re grabbing generators, and I\u2019m sold out,\u201d said Raymond Bopp, assistant manager of the Woodward Ace Hardware store in Woodward, Oklahoma, about 140 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. Several states activated emergency management procedures. In Oklahoma, Gov. Mary Fallin declared a disaster emergency. The state set up generators and supplies at temporary shelters in the northern part of the state. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens and top Cabinet officials manned an emergency operations center. Kansas officials were still waiting for the worst of it, with freezing rain in much of the state expected to arrive Saturday. Missouri Department of Transportation crews were working 12-hour shifts to treat roads and highways, though as some of the freezing rain melted, it washed the chemicals away, said Linda Wilson Horn, a spokeswoman for MoDOT. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a long, constant battle for our crews,\u201d Horn said. A driver was killed Friday morning when her SUV veered off of Interstate 55 near Festus, Missouri, south of St. Louis. The Highway Patrol said Tiffany Jackson, 33, died when her Chevy Trailblazer slid out of control on an icy overpass and struck several trees. The highway patrol said two other people were hurt in weather-related wrecks. Lambert Airport spokesman Jeff Lea said that by late morning, 60 arriving flights and 48 departing flights at Missouri\u2019s largest airport have been canceled due to the ice. A handful of flights were canceled at Oklahoma City\u2019s Will Rogers World Airport, but the airport remained open, according to a spokesman. The storm began in California, dumping heavy snowfall in higher elevations that led to the evacuation of thousands of people as rivers surged. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Russian Ambassador Invited Trump Administration to Syria Peace Talks as US Issued Sanctions By Arlette Saenz Jan 13, 2017, 1:42 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Michael Flynn: Everything You Need to Know 0 Shares Email Russia's ambassador to the U.S. invited the Trump administration to Syrian peace talks during a phone call in December -- on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia in retaliation for its hacking during the U.S. election -- a Trump spokesperson said Friday. Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak extended the invitation to the talks, which are scheduled for later this month, during a phone call with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn on December 29th, the day the U.S. issued sanctions and expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the country. The Obama administration was unsuccessful in securing a seat in Syria peace negotiations during talks with Russia and other regional powers and has been excluded from the most recent rounds. The next talks about Syria are scheduled for January 23rd in Astana, Kazakhstan, three days after Trump takes office. Spicer initially told reporters the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak only focused on arranging a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump after the Inauguration. \"They exchanged logistical information on how to initiate and schedule that call,\" Spicer said. \"That was it. Plain and simple.\" But Spicer later told ABC News the phone call included an invitation from the Russian ambassador to the Syrian peace talks. He emphasized that the topic of U.S. sanctions against Russia did not come up during the conversation. Spicer said that Flynn and Kislyak exchanged text messages greetings on Christmas day. On December 29th, the same day the Obama administration announced its response to Russia's election-related hacking, Kislyak sent Flynn a text message asking if they could speak by phone. Flynn accepted the invitation, Spicer said. Spicer initially told reporters they spoke on the phone on December 28th, but later told ABC News he misspoke and clarified the call occurred on December 29th. The Russian embassy declined to comment specifically on the call, but confirmed the ambassador will attend Trump's inauguration. \"The Embassy does not comment on multiple contacts, which are carried out on a daily basis with local interlocutors,\" a spokesperson for the Russian embassy told ABC News. \"According to the practice and protocol rules, foreign ambassadors are invited to the U.S. president\u2019s inauguration. The invitation to the event addressed to Russia\u2019s ambassador Sergey Kislyak was received from the State Department. The ambassador will participate in the event.\" The Washington Post previously reported Flynn spoke with Kislyak multiple times on December 29th, the same day the Obama administration formally announced sanctions and kicked 35 Russian diplomats out of the country. The State Department and the White House both agreed today that there's nothing wrong with the incoming administration making contact with diplomats, but White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he could neither raise an objection to this specific call nor deem it appropriate without knowing exactly what was said. \"As a general matter, you know on principle, you can imagine why these kinds of interactions may have taken place, why the incoming national security advisor may have the need to contact the representative of a foreign government based here in Washington D.C.,\" Earnest told reporters at the White House briefing today. \"It depends on what they discussed. It depends on what he said, in terms of whether or not we would have significant objections about those conversations.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Jan 13 2017, 3:59 pm ET Congressional GOP Complete First Step of Obamacare Repeal by Leigh Ann Caldwell advertisement The House passed a bill Friday that starts the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, officially completing the first step of the two-step process of repealing the health care legislation. The measure passed 227 to 198 with no Democrats supporting it and nine GOP members voting against it. Leadership was able to gain the support of enough Republicans to pass the bill, despite concerns among members worried there was no plan to replace Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Play How quickly will GOP replace Obamacare? 3:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170114003315if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/850747459849\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke on the floor before the vote, urging his colleagues to support the first stage of the repeal effort. \"By taking this first step toward repealing Obamacare, we are closer to giving Americans relief from the problems this law has caused,\" Ryan said in a statement after the vote. \"This resolution gives us the tools we need for a step-by-step approach to fix these problems and put Americans back in control of their health care.\" The Senate approved the bill during a marathon voting session early Thursday with only Republican support. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, was the only Republican to vote against the Senate measure, in part, because the measure, which is a component of the budget, increases the federal deficit and also because of his concerns about the lack of a health care replacement plan. Leadership's evolution on a timeline to repeal and replace Obamacare has given assurance to members who were nervous about repealing the health care law with no plan to replace it. As recently as last week, Republican leadership said that it would take time \u2014 weeks or even months \u2014 to replace the massive health care law that currently gave coverage to an additional 20 million people and impacts one-sixth of the nation's economy. But after hearing from rank-and-file Republicans across the conservative spectrum, and after President-elect Donald Trump publicly said - through tweets, an interview with the New York Times and in his press conference - that repeal and replace would happen \"almost simultaneously,\" Republican leaders became more bullish about the timeline. The \"Unaffordable\" Care Act will soon be history! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday, for the first time, that parts of the bill would be replaced \"concurrently.\" And then on Thursday during a CNN town hall, Ryan said, \"So, without getting into all of the legislative mumbo jumbo, we want to do this at the same time and in some cases in the same bill.\" And a Republican aide said Ryan has personally committed to jittery Republicans that replace would happen quickly. The change of tune helped members like Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, to vote for the bill. \"While serious concerns remain, I have been please to hear the speaker commit to bringing up a healthcare replacement bill within days, now weeks, of a repeal measure,\" Meadows said in a statement. But House Republicans saw nine defections from both the most conservative wings of the party, like Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., to the more moderate, like Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Penn. Dent said that he's concerned that Republicans are rushing forward without having a \"deliberate and thoughtful\" replacement plan at the ready. He said Republican leaders and the Trump administration needs to \"fully develop and articulate a comprehensive and achievable replacement plan that meets the health needs of the people in our districts,\" Dent said in a phone interview. The House's vote Friday completes the first step for repeal. The bill now directs four committees - two in the House and two in the Senate - to write the legislation to repeal the ACA. The self-imposed deadline is January 27 but leadership aides admit that is an unreasonable date and repeal legislation could take weeks. While Ryan now insists that repeal and parts of replace will be done at the same time, the reality is complicated. Because the Republicans are using a budget gimmick known as reconciliation, a process that enables legislation to pass the Senate by a simple majority, the only things that can be addressed in the legislation are tax and spend components. Now that the timeline has sped up, Republicans are going to have to determine what can be repealed and what can be replaced under reconciliation's strict guidelines. Everything else will likely need the support of 60 votes in the Senate. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

John Lewis (D-Ga.) said he does not believe Donald Trump is a \"legitimate president,\" citing Russian interference in last year's election. Asked whether he would try to forge a relationship with the president-elect, Lewis said that he believes in forgiveness, but added, \"it's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president.\" When pressed to explain why, he cited allegations of Russian hacks during the campaign that led to the release of internal documents from the Democratic National Committee, and Hillary Clinton's campaign co-chairman, John Podesta. \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,\" Lewis told NBC News' Chuck Todd. Trump appeared to acknowledge this week that Russia did engage in hacking during the campaign, but he has vigorously argued that any foreign interference had no impact on the election's outcome. The long-serving Georgia Congressman and civil rights leader also said that he would not attend President-elect Trump's swearing-in. \"I don't plan to attend the inauguration. It will be the first one that I miss since I've been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.\" For more, tune into \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday morning. Chuck Todd ",

Bean, a board member and co-owner of the family-owned outdoor retailer and the granddaughter of company founder Leon Leonwood Bean, says she gave money to a PAC supporting Trump. The Associated Press reported that her donations totaled $30,000 \u2014 exceeding limits on individual contributions in a single year. (The news service says the PAC, Making Maine Great Again, initially reported Bean contributed $60,000 but amended its filings.) Her political stance drew criticism and spurred calls for a boycott of the company under the hashtag #Grabyourwallet. That prompted the company to respond, noting that Linda Bean's views did not reflect on the company or the views of other Bean family members. Article continues after sponsorship ",

It is unclear how the U.S. government became aware of the call, which was first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who said there were multiple calls and raised the question of whether the conversations violated the \"spirit\" of a law that bars private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.

Frank Milstead, director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said after he met with the seriously injured trooper at the hospital. Thanks for the thoughts and prayers this morning for our Trooper that was shot. Looks like he will be okay after some recovery @Arizona_DPS \u2014 Col. Frank Milstead (@frank_milstead) January 12, 2017 The trooper \u2014 a 27-year veteran who hasn't been identified but was reported as stable with gunshot wounds in his chest and right shoulder \u2014 was responding to reports that shots had been fired at about 4 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) on Interstate 10 about 40 miles west of Phoenix, Milstead said. On the way, the trooper spotted a rollover accident, stopped to investigate and began blocking off the scene. A woman who was believed to have been ejected from the vehicle was later determined to have died at the scene, authorities said. Emergency personnel at the scene where an Arizona state trooper was shot Thursday morning on Interstate 10 near Tonopah. Mark Henle / AP \"As the trooper exited his vehicle and began to lay out flares, it appears at this point that he was ambushed by the suspect,\" Milstead said. \"In the initial confrontation, the suspect shoots the trooper in the shoulder [and] right chest area at least one time, possibly twice, disabling the use of the trooper's right hand and right arm.\" The gunman then attacked the trooper with his hands, bashing his head into the pavement, Milstead said. That's when the passing motorist stopped. \"The trooper says, 'Please help me,' and asks the uninvolved third party for help,\" Milstead said. \"That person retreats back to his vehicle, removes his own weapon from the vehicle, confronts the suspect, giving him orders to stop assaulting the officer. The suspect refuses. The uninvolved third party fires, striking and killing the suspect.\" The hero driver was identified only as a man who was traveling to California with his wife. A second motorist who also stopped at the scene ran to the trooper's vehicle, grabbed its radio and called for help. Emergency personnel at the scene where an Arizona state trooper was shot Thursday morning on Interstate 10 near Tonopah. Mark Henle / AP \"My concern was his life,\" that second motorist, Brian Schober, of Scottsdale, Arizona, told NBC News on Thursday. He wouldn't give any other details except to say he and the man who shot the suspect had been able to meet each other and say thank you. According to a recording of the police radio exchange, Schober told a dispatcher: \"Hello, officer down, officer down outside Tonopah. Come in, please. This is a civilian. He's shot on I-10 on the eastbound lane \u2014 sorry, westbound lane.\" Schober continued: \"He's in real bad shape. Please send air support, helicopter, please. There are also two civilians on \u2014 off \u2014 [the] road also laying [in] unknown condition.\" The dispatcher began coordinating an emergency response, keeping Schober on the radio before asking for a status report. \"I believe he was in an altercation with a motorist,\" he responded. \"There's a lady laying on the road, uh, still moving, not dead. The other gentleman was shot by a passerby who, uh, stopped the altercation after the officer was shot. ... \"The suspect is occasionally snorting or breathing. He's been shot by the passerby. He's laying right next to the officer,\" Schober reported. Emergency personnel at the scene where an Arizona state trooper was shot Thursday morning on Interstate 10 near Tonopah. KPNX-TV via NBC News Channel Milstead said few other details were immediately available because the investigation was still in its early stages. \"We don't know what the story is, and we'll figure that out as time goes on,\" he said. But one thing was clear, he said: \"In our worst hour, we may need your help, and this was today. ... Thank you. Thank you for the support.\" Alex Johnson ",

(Will Dickey / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Stolen from a hospital just hours after she was born, an 18-year-old woman finally learned her true identity and was reunited Friday with her birth family, by video chat. The woman she thought was her mother was charged with her kidnapping. Thanks to DNA analysis, the 18-year-old now knows her birth name: Kamiyah Mobley. She's in good health but understandably overwhelmed, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said. Gloria Williams, 51, was arrested at her home in Walterboro, South Carolina, early Friday on charges of kidnapping and interference with custody.

Williams is a suspect in the kidnapping of a baby girl in Jacksonville, Fla., 18 years ago. (AP) Mobley \u2014 who was raised under her given name, Alexis Manigo \u2014 was allowed to spend a few emotional moments with Williams on Friday. She cried \"Momma\" through the caged window of a security door after Williams waived extradition to Florida, according to WXJT-TV , which posted a video online. A much different scene was described by the young woman's birth family. They cried \"tears of joy\" after a detective told them their baby had been found. Within hours Friday, they were able to reconnect over FaceTime. \"She looks just like her daddy,\" her paternal grandmother, Velma Aiken of Jacksonville, told The Associated Press after they were able to see each other for the first time. \"She act like she been talking to us all the time. She told us she'd be here soon to see us.\" Mobley was only eight hours old when she was taken from her young mother by a woman posing as a nurse at University Medical Center. A massive search ensued, with helicopters circling the hospital and the city on high alert. Thousands of tips came in over the years, but she had disappeared. All that time, Kamiyah's neighbors in Walterboro knew her as Gloria Williams' daughter.

Craig Aiken, father of Kamiyah Mobley, who was kidnapped as an infant 18 years ago, talks about his feelings after his daughter was found safe in South Carolina, Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, in Jacksonville, Fla. (Will Dickey-- / AP) \"She wasn't an abused child or a child who got in trouble. But she grew up with a lie for 18 years,\" Joseph Jenkins, who lives across the street, told the AP. Some months ago, the young woman \"had an inclination\" that she may have been kidnapped, the sheriff said. Authorities didn't say why she suspected this. The case broke thanks to a tip received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Robert Lowery, a center vice president. He would not say from whom the tip came. But the center soon reached out to the cold case detectives at the sheriff's office, and Mobley provided a swab of her cheek for DNA analysis that proved the match, the sheriff said. \"This was something brand new to all of us,\" said Tesha Stephens, a cousin of Williams', who spoke to reporters outside their home Friday evening. The center has tracked 308 infant abductions since 1983 by nonfamily members in the U.S. Of those cases, 12 were still missing at the end of last month. That's now one number smaller.

(Bob Mack / AP) \"Right now she's holding up,\" Stephens said. \"She's processing everything and she's probably going to have to take this day-by-day.\" The woman has been provided with counseling, the sheriff said. Meanwhile, Aiken is thrilled to know that they can speak with each other as much as they want. \"I always prayed, 'Don't let me die before I see my grandbaby',\" said Aiken. \"My prayer was answered.\" The family never forgot the little girl ripped from her mother's arms that day in 1998. Her mother, Shanara Mobley, told the Florida Times-Union newspaper on the 10th anniversary of the kidnapping that on every one of Kamiyah's birthdays, she wrapped a piece of birthday cake in foil and stuck it in her freezer. \"It's stressful to wake up every day, knowing that your child is out there and you have no way to reach her or talk to her,\" Mobley told the paper in 2008. News moved quickly through the community of about 5,100 people early Friday after police cars swarmed Williams' home. Joseph Jenkins said he awoke to see officers searching the house and the shed around back. \"At the fish market, the hair dresser, the gas station, they're all talking about it,\" said Ruben Boatwright, who said he's known Williams for about 15 years. Lakeshia Jenkins, Joseph's wife, said Williams and the girl would often come over for cookouts in the yard, or join their family at a nearby water park. Kamiyah seemed to be well cared for, and \"Ms. Williams, she seemed like a normal person,\" Jenkins said. \"She went to work, came back here and went to church every Sunday,\" she said. Williams also worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs' hospital in Charleston, volunteered in the area for Habitat for Humanity and lead the youth program at a Methodist church, she said. \"She's very intelligent, smart as a whip,\" Boatwright said. \"All I can say are good things about her.\" The center's Lowery said this case shines a beacon to many other parents still missing children. \"We have a lot of parents out there looking for their children, and have been for many years, and this provides them with additional hope that one day they may find their child,\" he said.

    "text": "Jan 12 2017, 6:31 pm ET One of These Drones Could Save Your Life by Steven Ashley A delivery drops from a Zipline drone. Zipline Share advertisement You've just exited a scenic stretch of twisty mountain roads when suddenly the view's no longer scenic: A tourist bus has tipped over and slipped into a gully, evidently just minutes before. After pulling over, you call 911. Soon after, as you're searching your car for supplies, a flashing light appears overhead, accompanied by a buzzing sound. You look skyward to see that a helping hand has come to the rescue; an EMS response drone drops from the heavens deux ex machina. The 3-feet-tall, 6-feet-diameter octo-copter has been automatically guided to your location using your smartphone's GPS coordinates. An EMS response drone Dennis Lott / Hinds Community College It lands nearby, carrying a kit stuffed with meds, gauze and bandages, a chest seal, clotting sponges, scissors, and tourniquets. As you rummage through it, a video screen inside lights up and a face appears. \"I'm an emergency care physician. I'm here to help.\" EMS Response Drones Such a futuristic scenario will become reality soon if Dr. Italo Subbarao, senior associate dean at William Carey University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Hattiesburg, Miss., has anything to do with it. In December, Subbarao and a medical student demonstrated how two new disaster drones they've developed could deliver 'telemedical' packages to victims and rescue personnel in a simulated mass-casualty event . EMS response drones can land in places that EMS ground vehicles either cannot get to or take too long to reach, says Subbarao, a recognized expert in disaster and emergency medicine: \"Immediate communications with the victims and reaching them rapidly with aid are both critical to improve outcomes.\" A user demonstrates Google Glass. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images file \"A telemedical drone is the bridge that can deliver life-saving treatment directly to the victims, giving remote physicians eyes, ears, and voice to instruct anyone on site.\" Through Google Glass, Subbarao states, the physician can see what a wound looks like, the exact nature of the injury, and then guide willing bystanders through the appropriate treatments in real time. \"Drones have been used for awhile to get eyes on disaster scenes fast, so we thought, 'Why not integrate medical intervention as well?' he says. \"Why can't we use drones to deliver telemedical packages? Not just bandages and blood, or even a defibrillator, but on-site medical expertise, to give people on the scene a real medical intervention capability?\" One HiRO (Health Integrated Rescue Operations) package is designed to provide help for a severely injured victim, another is intended for up to 100 people with significant to minor injuries, the kind that characterizes mass-casualty events. Related: This App is Revolutionizing Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Drone experts from nearby Hinds Community College, with advice from the researchers, designed and built the disaster drones, which are equipped to fly in bad weather. \"These drones have impressive lift and distance capability, and can carry a variety of sensors, including infrared devices, to help locate victims in the dark,\" says Dennis Lott , director of Hinds CC's unmanned aerial vehicle program. Lott notes that any progress toward EMS response drone technology remains limited by Federal Aviation Administration 'Part 107' regulations that currently restrict most privately owned drones to a maximum weight of 55 pounds, an altitude ceiling of 400 feet, and line-of-sight operations, that is, within visible range. The FAA, which favors a gradual approach, is granting more operational waivers of late, but, he concedes, \"we need to get beyond line-of-sight to using GPS guidance to direct the drones to the coordinates of the emergency call.\" Related: Will the Future of Tech Be a 'Disaster' Under Trump? Lott believes some progress was made recently when the FAA finally defined the regulations, \"but it's still early days,\" he says. On the technical side, \"the drones need to be able to sense and avoid obstacles on their own, to detect and evade any problems\" that might arise far from home base. \"In any case, we think it's just a matter of time before drone technology is universally adopted for emergency and disaster response.\" The Mississippi telemedi-drone team is not the only one thinking about the potentially life-saving technology. Last April, Google received a U.S. patent that outlines a device that can deploy drones to handle specific medical emergencies by carrying specific medical equipment to victims. Users need only press a button to call for help. Flying Zipline For Blood Supplies Along the same lines, Zipline International of Half Moon Bay, Calif., in partnership with the Rwanda government, has begun the \"world's first\" drone delivery of blood supplies and drugs across the heavily forested and mountainous East African country, says company spokesman Justin Hamilton. Zipline co-founder Keller Rinaudo, who started the company some five years ago, got the idea when he visited a Tanzanian health institute. A researcher there had a database that enabled rural health stations to send text alerts whenever they needed blood or other medical supplies. \"Sadly, it was really just a 'database of death' because few of the requests could be filled in time due to bad roads, particularly during the rainy season,\" Hamilton explains. Members of the Zipline team pose with the company's drones. Zipline Rinaudo and his co-founders thereafter set out to invent a way to deliver meds to remote clinics and hospitals on demand. The Silicon Valley start-up tasked its team of top aerospace engineers and military drone specialists with developing fast, long-range, airplane-type drones. The current aircraft can transport a 3-pound, parachute-equipped cardboard box more than 95 miles on a single battery charge. \"That's two units of blood plus meds \u2014 enough to save a life,\" Hamilton says. \"One of the engineers told me: 'I used to build drones that drop bombs, now I build drones that drop blood.' \" Today, several hospitals can order blood or meds via text and have it delivered within 30 minutes. Zipline gets a fee for each delivery. The drones, which operate like military UAVs, navigate using GPS and Rwanda's cellular network. \"Each drone, which is about the size of an adult with arms outstretched, will soon be making 50 to 150 transfusion deliveries a day to 21 clinics across the western half of Rwanda,\" Hamilton says. More Medical Drones in the Air Other similar medical drone efforts exist. Menlo Park, Calif.-based Matternet, for example, collaborated with UNICEF to deliver HIV-testing kits using drones, which shortened the time required to test infants living in rural Malawi. And Flirtey, an Australian drone maker , partnered up with NASA to fly a drone carrying medicine to a pop-up clinic in Virginia run by the Remote Area Medical program. It made three trips in 30 minutes and transported 10 pounds of medicine. Two years ago engineers at TU Delft in the Netherlands tested a medical drone designed to promptly deliver an AED defibrillator directly to heart attack victims who make an emergency phone call, whereas UPS and other big commercial delivery drone developers are experimenting with adding medical drops to their regular routes. Medevac Ambulance Drone Still other drone pioneers are thinking even bigger. Veteran aerospace engineer and inventor, Rafi Yoeli, had always wanted to build a flying car, but when he finally started his own company in 2001, he realized that modeling the concept as an aerial rescue vehicle would make for a much more marketable product. Another decade or so later, Yoeli, now CEO of Urban Aeronautics in Israel, is nearly five years and some 200 flights into testing the Cormorant UAV, an unmanned flying ambulance (or flying jeep) prototype designed to deliver supplies to hard-to-reach or hazardous locations, and then medevac battle casualties and disaster victims out of danger. \"The concept of flying jeeps had always been undoable for lack of lightweight engine power,\" says Rafi Yoeli's wife, Janina Frankel Yoeli, who serves as the company's VP for marketing. But small turbine engines have become much more powerful over time. Add in her husband's innovation and determination, and the result is the Cormorant UAV. The compact, ducted-fan drone design can get in and out of tight spaces inaccessible to helicopters because its rotors are enclosed in protective cylindrical cowls that keep them from striking trees or power lines, she explains. The ducts also muffle rotor noise, making the flying ambulance quieter than an equivalent helicopter. The UAV's novel layout features a central patient's cabin sandwiched between powerful gas turbine engines. The engines drive an electric generator that powers electric motors in the large-diameter, fore and aft vertical rotors, and in two rear-mounted drive fans, making it a hybrid-electric vehicle not unlike a flying Toyota Prius. Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future Special vanes on the ducts, Janina says, provide thrust outlets for creating control power in hover \u2014 the side forces that maintain stability and orientation. \"In forward motion, the vehicle gains lift because the front duct vanes act like wings as does the fuselage which serves as a lifting body.\" The Cormorant UAV is now ready for full-scale development and production, she states. The Israeli military and other defense and emergency medical organizations have shown interest. \"We're doing flight-control refinements now,\" she says, \"we expect to begin deliveries within 4 years.\" Disposable Delivery-Drones Then there are DARPA's paper-airplane delivery drones that melt away into the countryside after landing. The ICARUS program (for Inbound, Controlled, Air-Releasable, Unrecoverable Systems) envisions small unpowered and unmanned gliders made of cardboard to air-drop small critical packages for forward-deployed forces. During the summer, DARPA selected the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in California, and DZYNE Technologies in Fairfax, Va., to manufacture the disposable, disappearing drones. The vanishing UAVs will be able to deliver a 3-pound package containing meds, food, supplies, or ammo to a GPS-programmed location with a 33-foot accuracy. The programmed aircraft, which will be developed to operate at night, must be able to vanish within four hours of arrival, leaving only unrecognizable remnants no larger than 100 microns \u2014 or about the width of a human hair.

Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner speaks to reporters Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, in Springfield, Ill. (Seth Perlman, AP) Privacy Policy Illinois' largest public employee union moved one step closer to a confrontation with Gov. Bruce Rauner , scheduling votes that could authorize a state worker strike if the union and the Republican governor are unable to reach a deal on new contract terms. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31 announced the strike vote plan in a letter to union members, scheduling votes starting Jan. 30 and ending mid-February. Even if a majority of union members vote \"yes,\" it does not mean a strike will occur. The vote allows AFSCME's bargaining committee the authority to call a strike in the future, and that power would put the union on stronger footing as it tries to pressure Rauner back to the bargaining table. Late last year, the Illinois Labor Relations Board sided with Rauner by declaring that the two sides had reached impasse \u2014 a technical stage in negotiations in which the administration can try to impose its own contract terms on workers. Rauner's team quickly moved to start implementing some of those terms, including a provision that would raise how many hours state employees must work before they start collecting overtime from 37.5 hours per week to 40 hours. AFSCME filed a lawsuit, though, that resulted in a temporary halt to the implementation, so the administration is not currently imposing any of its new terms on union workers. \"It is disappointing that AFSCME refuses to respect the state labor board's bipartisan ruling and work with us to implement a contract that is fair to taxpayers and state employees alike,\" Dennis Murashko, a lawyer in the governor's office, said in a statement responding to the union's strike vote plans.

    "text": "13 things you probably never knew about Martin Luther King's college years By Holly Epstein Ojalvo 5:16 pm EST January 13, 2017 95    shares SEND EMAIL Have you ever wondered what Martin Luther King Jr. was like in college? Here\u2019s a peek at the college years of the young man who went on to become the most important and influential civil rights leader in American history. 1. King started college when he was only 15 US clergyman, civil rights leader and future Nobel Peace Prize winner Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking in London on Sept. 21, 1964. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) As King skipped two grades in high school, he started at Morehouse College in Atlanta \u2014 the only college on the planet for black men \u2014 at age 15, without formally graduating from high school. That was in 1944, according to Biography.com . 2. He was a legacy at Morehouse King\u2019s grandfather and father had also gone to Morehouse . Later, so did his brother as well as his two sons, Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King. 3. He got his bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology It\u2019s the study of \u201chow the social world works,\u201d according to the Morehouse sociology department . 4. A class he took junior year set him on his path According to Biography.com , he wasn\u2019t all that interested in following in his father\u2019s footsteps into the ministry until he took a Bible class as a junior. He was ordained and then first became an assistant pastor as a student, in 1948, according to Washington State University . 5. After college he went to a seminary Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he became both class valedictorian and elected student body president. There, he got a second bachelor\u2019s degree , in divinity. 6. He wasn\u2019t the best undergrad student His grades were only so-so, according to Stanford\u2019s King Encyclopedia . And though he later became famous as a Baptist minister, in college he drank beer and played pool \u2014 considered by many at the time to be a vice. 7. But he was actively involved in extracurriculars According to the Stanford King Encyclopedia, at Morehouse King was \u201ca member of the debate team, student council, glee club, and minister\u2019s union,\u201d as well as the local NAACP chapter. He also played on a YMCA basketball team and twice won second place in a speech competition. 8. King started speaking out for civil rights in college In the summer between his sophomore and junior years, he published a letter to the editor in the Atlanta Constitution about what black Americans wanted: \u201cWe want and are entitled to the basic rights and opportunities of American citizens: The right to earn a living at work for which we are fitted by training and ability; equal opportunities in education, health, recreation, and similar public services; the right to vote; equality before the law; some of the same courtesy and good manners that we ourselves bring to all human relations.\u201d 9. He wrote an article in the student newspaper As an 18-year-old senior, King wrote a piece in the Maroon Tiger, the student paper, about the value of education : \u201cWe must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character \u2014 that is the goal of true education.\u201d He concluded , \u201cIf we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, \u2018brethren!\u2019 Be careful, teachers!\u201d 10. He seriously dated a white woman during seminary school As Salon reported , while he was at Crozer seminary, he \u201cfell in love with a German cafeteria employee named Betty,\u201d and his friends, knowing his father wouldn\u2019t approve of his interracial relationship, tried to talk him into breaking it off. (This was the 1940s; the Supreme Court didn\u2019t rule in favor of interracial marriage until 1967.) 11. He got his Ph.D. at Boston University He was accepted at Yale and other schools, but he chose BU for his doctorate, which he earned at age 25. 12. His doctorate was in \u2018systematic theology\u2019 And History.com says his wrote his dissertation on \u201cA Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.\u201d 13. He got his first job as a pastor while still working on his dissertation ",

The video, taken by a tow truck traveling in the opposite direction, shows a semi-truck attempting to pass the snow plow on U.S. Highway 6 in Spanish Fork Canyon, about an hour south of Salt Lake City. The driver of the semi-truck \"got too close\" as he was attempting to pass on the snow plow's right side, said John Gleason, public information officer for the Utah Department of Transportation. As the semi-truck passed, the driver became blinded by the wash coming off the snow plow, and he lost visibility, Gleason said. The semi-truck driver then veered into the left lane, clipping the snow plow. \"It's something that we caution against all the time,\" he said, adding that a professional should be \"especially\" aware to \"never pass a snow plow, especially on the right side.\" The snow plow then rolled 300 feet down the hill to the ground below, Gleason said. Several witnesses who saw the crash stopped, including one man who hiked down to make sure the driver was OK. \"It was pretty incredible,\" Gleason said. \"And to see the pictures...of the aftermath, it's amazing that anyone lived.\" UDOT media availability re: snow plow crash in SF Canyon yesterday and being safe around plows. 10 AM at Cal Rampton Building. #Utah pic.twitter.com/PmqpmkgVSk ",

    "text": "After 'pretty extraordinary' snowfall, Sierra Nevada braces for another battering from atmospheric river Snow in South Lake Tahoe Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times The recent storm dropped large amounts of snow along Ski Run Boulevard in South Lake Tahoe. The recent storm dropped large amounts of snow along Ski Run Boulevard in South Lake Tahoe. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) Rong-Gong Lin II and Joseph Serna Contact Reporter Across the Sierra Nevada  this weekend, residents and officials are assessing the damage from a series of powerful storms before a new round from the atmospheric river arrives next week. Some homes in northern Sierra communities have been left without power for more than a week because of this week\u2019s blizzard, which locals say has been the worst in a decade. \u201cWe had over 10 feet of snow in portions of the community. Everyone had at least 3 to 5 feet of snow, all in about a two-day period. And that\u2019s a pretty extraordinary level of snow,\u201d said Truckee Donner Public Utility District spokesman Steven Poncelet. The culprit was a moment in the middle of the week when the storm became warmer. Instead of causing nice, dry powder that comes with colder storms, this system dumped slushy, dripping, heavy snow, which locals call \u201cSierra cement.\u201d\u00a0 That wet slop stuck to electrical lines and tree limbs. When branches weighed down by snow snapped, they took out power lines with them.\u00a0Combined with high winds, it was a recipe for problems. For Truckee, the series of blizzards has been so bad that the schools have been closed because of  snow  for eight consecutive days, something locals can\u2019t remember happening in decades. Some\u00a0residents have been trapped in their snowbound homes for three days, with some roads only plowed Friday since the last storm began. \u00a0Even the U.S. Postal Service was forced to close  nine post offices Thursday, citing the lack of power and access. National Weather Service to issue a flood advisory for much of Los Angeles County through 9:15 a.m. Forecasters said southern and eastern Los Angeles County would be hardest hit by the storm.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latest of a series... A new rainstorm moved into Southern California on Thursday, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a flood advisory for much of Los Angeles County through 9:15 a.m. Forecasters said southern and eastern Los Angeles County would be hardest hit by the storm.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latest of a series... (Sarah Parvini, Joseph Serna, Shelby Grad) Poncelet warned that people returning to their second homes in Lake Tahoe for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend could find downed trees and power lines, and a lot of snow to shovel just to get to their doorway. But the predicted arrival of another big storm next week could pose problems in Truckee, where rain could cause flooding problems. \"You're going to have now a massive amount of snow on the ground that the rain is going to essentially melt, so the chances of flooding and mudslides is going to be pretty high,\u201d Poncelet said.\u00a0 This week\u2019s storms cut off mountain passes \u00a0and contributed to at least four deaths, and forecasters say there\u2019s no sign of a prolonged dry spell anytime soon. Months of intense rain and snow ended a five-year drought for much of Northern California, though the south of the state is still dealing with water shortages. \u201cAtmospheric rivers happen every year. And for whatever reason, they have been missing California for the last several years,\u201d said Tom Dang, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento. \u201cAnd they are just aimed at us one right after another this year.\u201d The next storm is expected by Wednesday. \u201cTaking any kind of action to be prepared is better than taking no action and just thinking about it,\u201d said Brad Alexander, spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. \u201cIf people were impacted by these last storms \u2026 they need to quickly get their emergency plans together. This last one is proof that you need to have one right in front of you.\u201d At least 20 towns, cities and counties have declared states of emergency as a result of the most recent set of storms, Alexander said. Dramatically, all of Truckee and the California side of Lake Tahoe lost power for more than 12 hours after a large tree fell on the main electricity transmission line in the region.\u00a0 California drought finally calling it quits? Yes. Or at least maybe.... The state\u2019s biggest reservoirs are swelling. The Sierra Nevada have\u00a0seen as much snow, sleet, hail and rain as during the wettest years on record. Rainy Los Angeles feels more like London than Southern California. So is the great California drought finally calling it quits? Yes. Or at least maybe.... (Bettina Boxall) Rural residents in the Napa and Sacramento valleys were flooded out of their homes when\u00a0heavy rain and snowmelt\u00a0overwhelmed local rivers.\u00a0 Major highways that were damaged by rock- and mudslides or flooded may be eligible for federal aid, Alexander said. State officials are going door to door to assess the damage but will have their work slowed by next week\u2019s storms. \u201cIt would be like one major fire series happening right after another major fire series,\u201d Alexander said. With the biggest blizzard in a decade under their belt, Californians need to work for the next few dry days to clear snow- and leaf-clogged storm drains before the next system hits, the National Weather Service warned.\u00a0 \u201cFlooding is definitely a concern,\u201d said Dawn Johnson, meteorologist with the weather service\u2019s\u00a0Reno office. There is\u00a0so much precipitation across the Sierra Nevada \u2014 at 163% of its historical average Friday, with nearly 20 feet of snow accumulated at Mammoth Mountain and more than 23 feet at Northstar.\u00a0Flooding is a risk especially at creeks, streams, ditches, low-lying areas and anywhere that has poor drainage.\u00a0 \u201cBecause we\u2019re so saturated, all these smaller streams could flood easily,\u201d Johnson said.\u00a0 Next week\u2019s version is shaping to be a weaker relative of an unusually warm storm that struck the Sierra last weekend, which dumped 8 to 12 inches of rain on the high Sierra crest before the midweek blizzard. But the latest forecast has some reason for optimism \u2014 it\u2019s more cold,\u00a0less wet and not as\u00a0powerful: only\u00a02 to 4 inches of rain is currently expected to fall on the crest of the mountain range. Rain is expected at elevations lower than 8,000 feet, meaning rain could arrive at the base of some ski resorts while snow falls\u00a0at the peaks.\u00a0 Next week\u2019s storm\u00a0will melt some snow, but not the entire snowpack, Johnson said.\u00a0 California\u2019s water year \u2014 which runs\u00a0from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 \u2014 started off remarkably, with four times October\u2019s average rainfall, according to the Department of Water Resources. Though November lagged behind, storms in the last two months have helped the northern half of the state bounce back from years of drought. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor\u2019s report released Thursday, more than 40% of California is out of drought conditions, all of it in the northern half of the state. Southern California\u2019s conditions have also improved, but it would take at least another year of above-average rainfall to replenish reservoirs and groundwater basins, officials said. Southern California could receive up to 2 inches of rain with next week\u2019s storms, forecasters say. Despite the weather headaches, many were still celebrating the best snow year in recent memory. At the Donner State Memorial State Park Visitor Center on Friday, there was already 4 to 5 feet of snow on the ground \u2014 and it\u2019s only the middle of January, marveled Nikki Combs, a park interpreter. During drought years, there were only 2 to 3 feet of snow. The roads into Tahoe were already getting jammed Friday, even though snow chain restrictions had been lifted. With blue skies forecast, Combs predicted, \u201ceveryone is going to be here.\u201d For locals, there has been a mix of excitement over\u00a0the snow and weariness from\u00a0having to deal with power outages and constant snow shoveling. \u201cThose of us who are here because we love the mountains, this is wonderful. Everybody loves it,\u201d said Kim Szczurek, administrative services director for the town of Truckee. But with all the fallen trees, damage to roads and drainage systems and difficulty plowing the streets, \u201cit\u2019s just difficult to deal with.\u201d Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? \u00a0 A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree .\u00a0 Who should discipline police officers? \u00a0 Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. \u00a0 A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung .

Evanczyk has had his hands full lately performing avalanche mitigation, given the large amount of recent snowfall. (AP Photo/P. Solomon Banda) AP Email ARAPAHOE BASIN SKI AREA, Colo. \u2014 For ski resorts in Colorado and the Sierra Nevada, it\u2019s a good problem to have: too much snow. Recent storms walloping mountains across the West dropped up to 10 feet of snow, creating thrilling powdery runs. But once avalanche danger emerged on roads and at the slopes, several resorts made the unusual move of shutting down. A series of powerful storms have been drenching the West Coast and easing drought conditions. WPEC meteorologist Jeff Berardelli joins CBSN to di... While the closures cost resorts income from lift tickets, the businesses will likely make it up in the long run by promoting the fresh snow on Twitter and getting more people excited to come up and carve powder turns. \u201cIt\u2019s like you just go out and get barreled, you drop in and come up, an\u2019 pah! Drop back down. Powder everywhere in your face, you know? ... Mashed potato powder,\u201d said John Lencki, a New Hampshire native skiing Thursday at Arapahoe Basin Ski Area. It\u2019s a change from previous years beleaguered by drought . Even this season, the Colorado snowpack got off to its worst start in more than 30 years, forcing some ski areas to push back opening day this fall. Some resorts dug out in time for the holiday weekend, though the forecast in Colorado calls for more snow Friday and Sunday. Here\u2019s a look at the problems - and joy - a thick blanket of snow can bring to ski resorts in the West: How often do resorts close because of too much snow? Heavy snow typically does not affect resort operations, but it often creates problems on the roads leading to the slopes, said Chris Linsmayer, a spokesman for Colorado Ski Country USA, an industry group representing more than 20 resorts. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely rare (for snow to close a resort). I\u2019ve been skiing my whole life and it\u2019s never happened to me,\u201d he said. It\u2019s hard to say how often resorts close because of heavy snow, but most agree it\u2019s unusual. Dan Lavely, who has lived in the Lake Tahoe area for decades, was looking forward to heading to the Mount Rose ski resort southwest of Reno. More than 10 feet of snow fell in about a week at some area resorts. \u201cIn all my years, it\u2019s so rare to have too much snow,\u201d Lavely said Wednesday. \u201cHaving a season pass - you pretty much live for these conditions. You want 2 or 3 feet of fresh powder, and you want to go play in it.\u201d Wintry conditions close resorts in the Sierra Nevada, the mountains spanning California and Nevada, more often than those in Colorado because they get massive amounts of snow all at once, said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association. Why were the resorts in Colorado closed? Avalanches pose problems, more so on roads than at the resorts. Ski patrollers use explosives to mitigate slides every day and close portions of resorts that are at risk. \u201cWe have closures and we have ropes. We have gates, and we really try to steer people to specific areas of the hill to keep them out of avalanche terrain,\u201d said Ryan Evanczyk, a ski patroller at Arapahoe Basin. But \u201cthe big message here is not necessarily the mountain is unsafe, but the roads to get to and from the mountain were unsafe,\u201d Linsmayer said. Despite the closures, the snow led to bragging rights. Crested Butte Mountain Resort in western Colorado shut down its lifts late Monday out of concern for guests and employees because of high winds and heavy, wet snow. Officials tweeted a photo of it piled high at a measuring station with the line, \u201cWe officially #buriedthebutte.\u201d \u201cIt has definitely helped our publicity, this week for sure,\u201d spokeswoman Erica Mueller said. Monarch Mountain ski area closed for a day this week because of work to control avalanches on a nearby mountain pass, tweeting a photo of powder stacked next to its sign with the hashtag #toomuchsnow. And after Arapahoe Basin closed because of slide danger on another highway, it simply posted, \u201cSnow, Snow, Snow.\u201d In the Sierra Nevada, road closures and the threat of avalanches closed resorts around Lake Tahoe closed for several days this week. Some reopened Thursday. ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook TV host Steve Harvey says he believes Donald Trump \"wants to help with the situation in the inner cities.\" (Photo: ALBIN LOHR-JONES / POOL, EPA) TV host Steve Harvey was the latest celebrity to drop in for a meeting at Trump Tower on Friday. And now he's explaining what it was all about. \"Our president (Obama) asked that all of us sit down and talk to one another in order to move our country forward,\" the host of Family Feud and The Steve Harvey Show noted in a statement posted to Twitter . \u00a0\"The transition teams on both sides asked me to meet and I'm glad I did.\" Harvey said that Trump \"immediately got (HUD secretary nominee) Dr. Ben Carson on the phone to begin dialog in looking for programs and housing to help our inner cities.\" He added that the president-elect \"seems very open to my mentoring efforts across the country.\" He added, \"I walked away feeling like I had just talked with a man who genuinely wants to make a difference in this area. I feel that something really great could come out of this.\" Harvey's bottom line? \"I would sit with him anytime.\" \u2014 Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) January 13, 2017 Harvey, who has been weathering a blowback over racial comments about Asian men on his talk show, told reporters after the meeting, \u201cThey're kind of beating me up on the Internet right now for no reason, but that's life, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (That situation is not likely to improve dramatically after Friday's meeting.) Carson: Can't promise HUD programs won't benefit Trump \u201cThese government-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality create consequences that often make matters worse,\" Carson wrote in a 2015\u00a0 Washington Times \u00a0op-ed. \"There are reasonable ways to use housing policy to enhance the opportunities available to lower-income citizens, but based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous.\u201d The 65-year-old rose from an impoverished youth in Detroit to attend Yale and the University of Michigan Medical School,\u00a0lead the pediatric neurosurgery department at John Hopkins University and later contend for the Republican presidential nomination. After Trump won the election, Carson demurred when initially asked about a possible cabinet post, citing his lack of experience in government or running a federal agency. When probed by Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown, Carson explained,\u201cMy philosophy is that we can increase people\u2019s minimum wages by increasing opportunities for them and creating an environment where those opportunities exist rather than artificially trying to change it.\u201d When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked if Carson could assure her that Trump's real-estate businesses would not profit from HUD projects, he\u00a0argued, \u201cIf there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that\u2019s working for millions of people and it turns out that someone that you\u2019re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say \u2018no,' the rest of Americans can\u2019t have it?\u201d 1399 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 29 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jG0Xf6 NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

William Peter Blatty on the Georgetown University campus around 1980. (Warner Bros.) By Matt Schudel January 13 at 11:20 AM William Peter Blatty, an author whose novel \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and his later screenplay for the 1973 film about a demonic possession became a phenomenon and stirred fierce public debate about the occult, died Jan. 12 at a hospital near his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 89. The cause was a form of multiple myeloma, said his wife, Julie Witbrodt Blatty. Mr. Blatty was a junior at Georgetown University when, in 1949, he became mesmerized by a Washington Post story detailing the alleged exorcism by a Jesuit priest of a 14-year-old boy from Mount Rainier, Md. who was believed to be possessed by a demon. For decades, as Mr. Blatty went on to a varied career as a vacuum-cleaner salesman, psychological warfare specialist in the Air Force, U.S. Information Agency magazine editor and university public relations specialist, he continued to explore the topic of what he called \u201cdisembodied intelligences,\u201d following stories of exorcism and alleged demonic possession. He later became a novelist and screenwriter, earning a writing credit on \u201cA Shot in the Dark\u201d (1964), one of the first entries in Blake Edwards\u2019s slapstick Pink Panther film series starring Peter Sellers. 1 of 21 Looking back at \u2018The Exorcist\u2019 and the real story it\u2019s based on View Photos The film still captivates 40 years after its debut, in part because it draws on the real-life story of a Prince George\u2019s County boy. Its screenwriter and author, William Peter Blatty, died yesterday. Caption The film still captivates 40 years after its debut, in part because it draws on the real-life story of a Prince George\u2019s County boy. Its screenwriter and author, William Peter Blatty, died yesterday. \u00a0 William Peter Blatty, author and screenwriter of \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d based his book on a real-life exorcism conducted on a boy, known as Roland Doe, who lived in this house in Prince George\u2019s County. It is where his reported possession began in 1949. That winter, according to the boy\u2019s parents and several books on the case, Roland\u2019s bed began to shake violently, furniture moved across the room, and scratching noises were heard in the walls. After having Roland evaluated at Georgetown University Hospital, his parents met with the Rev. Albert Hughes, a Roman Catholic priest at St. James Parish, near their Maryland home. Hughes said he believed the boy was possessed and sought permission from the archbishop of Washington to begin the rite of exorcism. Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. He wrote several novels, to lukewarm reviews and modest sales, and screenplays for other films, including \u201cWhat Did You Do in the War, Daddy?\u201d (1966) and the espionage musical \u201cDarling Lili\u201d (1970), both directed by Edwards, before the monumental success of \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d which appeared in 1971. In Mr. Blatty\u2019s tale, the bizarre, vile behavior of a 12-year-old girl cannot be explained by medicine or rational means, until a young priest concludes that she is possessed by a demon. Despite critical, even mocking reviews, \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d became a blockbuster, selling 13 million copies in the United States. Mr. Blatty wrote the screenplay of the film, directed by William Friedkin and starring Linda Blair as the demonically possessed child. The movie became a runaway box-office hit and helped usher in a series of graphic horror films that thrilled and frightened audiences and kept the cash registers ringing. Mr. Blatty wrote other screenplays and was the producer and director of later horror films, but his reputation was forever connected to \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d The book and movie also prompted a continuing debate about exorcism and demonic possession within the Catholic Church and among the public. In later years, Mr. Blatty returned to Washington to live and had occasional public disagreements with the church and Georgetown, his alma mater. \u201cI can\u2019t regret \u2018The Exorcist,\u2019 \u201d he told The Washington Post in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s done so much for me and for my family. And it\u2019s given me a great deal of freedom to write what I want.\u201d ",

    "text": "House Takes First Step to Repeal Obamacare By MaryAlice Parks Jan 13, 2017, 3:58 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH House Takes First Step to Repeal Obamacare 0 Shares Email Republicans moved one step closer to repealing Obamacare after the House passed a measure this afternoon directing committees to begin working on legislation to repeal major pieces of the law. The resolution cleared the House 227-198. Ten members didn't vote. Similar legislation passed in the Senate Thursday morning largely along party lines. A group of nine moderate and conservative House Republicans voted against the bill with concerns that Republicans would end up repealing the law without clearly laying out and presenting their replacement. \"The only thing I've ever asked for is that the replacement plan be fully developed before we take on the repeal issue,\" Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, a leading moderate who voted against the measure, said in an interview. \u201cI want to make [sure] people who have pre-existing conditions don\u2019t get frozen out of the market,\u201d Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, said after voting against the resolution. \u201cI am getting a lot of calls. People are concerned about fixing health care. They are much more concerned about the substance of the fix than the timing of the fix.\u201d Republican leaders expect to enact a repeal as early as next month; House Speaker Paul Ryan said it would \"definitely\" come in the first 100 days. Democrats criticized the vote and accused the GOP of playing politics. \"It's being done for political reasons,\" said Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, on the House floor. Next Steps Ryan has emphasized that the House would move any legislation repealing the law through the committee process. \u201cWe are not going to swap one 2700-page monstrosity for another \u2026 we are going to do this the right way. We are going to do this the way it was designed through the congressional committee system,\u201d he said during his press conference earlier today. Democrats say they will counter Republicans' efforts by bringing Americans whose lives have been positively affected by the law to these hearings. Several members are holding rallies in their districts this weekend to tout the law's benefits. Democrats will also make the argument that that Republicans cannot realistically \u201crepeal\u201d parts of the law without excluding popular provisions like protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cHere is the problem that they have,\u201d Congresswomen Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, said during a press conference today with Democratic House members. \u201cAll of the parts are like a puzzle that was carefully crafted and put together and you take a piece out and it no longer works. And that is what they are coming to realize. They have had six years to come up with something and they have come up with exactly nothing.\" Ryan and his office remain unwilling to talk policy details. According to Ryan, proposals and legislative strategy will be discussed at the retreat for Republican lawmakers later this month. But Republican leadership acknowledges that the longer it waits to offer a replacement, the more scrutiny it will face from Americans and lawmakers alike. 0 Shares ",

Jemal Countess/Getty Images for AWRT Email PERKASIE, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania high school is apologizing after students were given a math homework assignment that asked which family member had sexually assaulted a girl. The assignment focused on Maya Angelou and her autobiography \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\u201d It provided an algebra formula that asked: \u201cAngelou was sexually abused by her mother\u2019s ___ at age 8, which shaped her career choices and motivation for writing.\u201d Pennridge High School students needed to solve the formula before deciding whether the answer was boyfriend, brother or father. Screenshots of the homework posted by news organizations showed the subsequent question reads: \u201cTrying to support her son as a single mother, she worked as a pimp, prostitute and ___.\u201d Another formula must be solved to determine if the answer was bookie, drug dealer or nightclub dancer. The homework was coupled with a word puzzle about the book and author, The Intelligencer newspaper reported Friday. The assignment was from a website that allows teachers around the world to share resources. \u201cWe apologize to anyone who was offended by the content of the assignment and have taken steps to avoid such occurrences in the future,\u201d Pennridge Superintendent Jacqueline Rattigan said in a statement, adding the district had received complaints. A similar homework assignment caused controversy in Fort Myers, Florida, in 2015. In that case, a middle school teacher also downloaded the algebra homework from an external website. The district said the veteran teacher didn\u2019t carefully examine the homework and called it an oversight that wouldn\u2019t be repeated. \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\u201d published in 1969, is assigned reading in many high schools, but is also occasionally attacked for its content. Angelou\u2019s passages about her rape and teen pregnancy have made it a perennial on the American Library Association\u2019s list of works that draw complaints from parents and educators. \u201cI thought that it was a mild book. There\u2019s no profanity,\u201d Angelou, who died in 2014, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt speaks about surviving, and it really doesn\u2019t make ogres of many people. I was shocked to find there were people who really wanted it banned, and I still believe people who are against the book have never read the book.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Among other findings, the report found city police used excessive force and that \u201cthis pattern is largely attributable to systemic deficiencies within CPD and the City.\u201d It also cited insufficient training and a failure to hold bad officers accountable.\u00a0 Federal authorities and city officials have signed an agreement that offers a broad outline for reform, including commitments to improved transparency, training and accountability for bad officers. The Justice Department and the city will negotiate a final settlement to be enforced by the courts. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the report lays \u201cthe groundwork for the difficult but necessary work of building a stronger, safer, and more united Chicago for all who call it home.\u201d\u00a0 Vanita Gupta, head of the DOJ Civil Rights Division, says the Chicago PD's excessive force not only harms residents, but endangers officers. It a... In assembling the 161-page report, investigators reviewed more than 170 shootings involving officers and more than 425 examples of less lethal force. They also spoke with more than 340 officers and accompanied some on patrol, according to the report. \u00a0\u00a0 The report found instances of police shooting at people who pose no immediate threat, said Vanita Gupta, head of the DOJ civil rights division. Police used stun guns on people for no other reason than they did not obey officers\u2019 verbal commands, Gupta said. Officers endangered civilians, caused avoidable injuries and deaths, and eroded community trust that is \u201cthe cornerstone of public safety,\u201d Gupta said.\u00a0 The federal government\u2019s recommendations follow an especially bloody year on Chicago streets. The city logged 762 homicides in 2016, the highest tally in 20 years and more than the combined total of the two largest U.S. cities - New York and Los Angeles. Gupta acknowledged that Chicago is experiencing a drastic uptick in gun violence, but said \u201cthis context only heightens the importance and the urgency of our findings.\u201d The findings say officers often don\u2019t fully report use of force incidents and supervisors don\u2019t adequately review them. It found that officers are too rarely held accountable for misconduct, and when complaints against officers are investigated, those probes are often \u201cglacially slow,\u201d Gupta said.\u00a0 Attorney General Loretta Lynch says the Chicago Police Department uses excessive force regularly, violating the Constitution. The Justice Departm... Chicago has spent more than half a billion dollars to settle claims of police misconduct since 2004, but police did not conduct disciplinary investigations in half of those cases, according to the federal report. Of 409 police shootings that happened over a five-year period, police found only two were unjustified. The Justice Department criticized the city for setting up barriers to getting to the bottom of police misconduct, including provisions in union agreements, a failure to investigate anonymous complaints or those submitted without a supporting affidavit, and a \u201cpervasive cover-up culture.\u201d It said that witnesses and accused officers were frequently never interviewed at all, that evidence went uncollected and that witnesses were routinely coached by union lawyers - \u201ca dynamic neither we nor our law enforcement experts had seen to nearly such an extent in other agencies.\u201d \u201cThe procedures surrounding investigations allow for ample opportunity for collusion among officers and are devoid of any rules prohibiting such coordination,\u201d the report said. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the issues highlighted in the report can be solved by what most Chicago officers are \u201cdoing right every day.\u201d\u00a0 He called reform the \u201cpath of progress\u201d and called for the community to support the department as they adopt the changes. \u201cOur officers know they need to earn the trust of the residents they serve and the community they police \u2013 they don\u2019t get a blank check,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cBut when they do, they need to hear from all of us that they are appreciated and their work is important.\u201d The mayor said Friday that the city has already made some of the recommended changes, citing de-escalation training and stricter use-of-force polices. Emanuel also addressed the Justice Department\u2019s concern that officers do not have nearly enough supervision. He pointed to his decision to increase the number of lieutenants and other supervisors.\u00a0 The perception that Emanuel badly mishandled the Laquan McDonald shooting hurt the former Obama chief of staff politically and he may feel pressure to address all, or nearly all, of the Justice Department\u2019s findings to restore his political fortunes.\u00a0 Superintendent Eddie Johnson acknowledged the work needed to restore the trust between the police and the community and said his department needs to do a better job \u201cmentoring, supporting and training\u201d officers. He announced every officer would be equipped with a body camera by the end of the year and would be trained in a new use-of-force policy. \u201cQuite simply, as a department, we need to do better,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou have my promise and commitment that we will do better.\u201d ",

    "text": "Rosemary Regina Sobol Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune A man who was already in jail on a criminal sexual abuse case is accused of trying to arrange the murders of the 15-year-old victim and her mother, prosecutors said. Ivan Flores appeared before Judge James Brown at the Leighton Criminal Court Building on Friday where a $500,000 bail was set on the new charges of solicitation of murder and solicitation for murder for hire, prosecutors said. Flores, 21, was originally booked into jail on March 17 after being ordered held on $100,000 bond on an aggravated criminal sexual abuse case, records show. But from July to September, Flores spoke with two confidential sources at the Cook County Corrections Department, telling them that it \u201cwould be better for his case if the victim didn\u2019t come to court against him\u2019\u2019 and asked if they knew any \u201cmotorcycle gangs who could kill the victim,\u2019\u2019 prosecutors said.\u00a0 Flores provided addresses, schedules and personal information and in September said: \u201ckill them both then,\u2019\u2019 in a recorded conversation to an undercover officer, for a price of $5,000, prosecutors said. Around July 22, a confidential source who is an inmate at the Cook County Department of Corrections met with investigators telling them Flores said it \u201cwould be better for his case if the victim didn\u2019t come to court against him,\u2019\u2019 and asked if the source if they had any connections with any \u201cmotorcycle gangs who could kill the victim,\u2019\u2019 prosecutors said. Flores gave the source a handwritten piece of paper with the victim's name and address and a name of a public park where the victim could often be found, prosecutors said. On Aug. 2, a second source told investigators that Flores told him he was a Satan Disciple from the South Side, locked up for a sexual assault of a minor who was 15 and that he\u2019d committed the crime in the victim\u2019s basement in January but wasn\u2019t arrested until March. \u00a0 Additionally, he told the source he was upset at the victim's mother and called her a \u201cb---- a--''for pursuing the case against him. Later that month he told the source that he wanted the mother \u201cgone,\u2019\u2019 prosecutors said. After several more August meetings, the source gave police more information saying that Flores wanted the mother killed and asked the source if any of his gang friends could help him. The source told Flores \u2018His guy charges $5,000 a head\u2019\u2019 and Flores told he had no money but would make payment when he got out. Flores also wondered if it would be better if they \"do this\" before or after his September 15th court date and told the source the girl attended Curie High School and what time she left for school. In September Flores was recorded on a phone call saying, \u201cWe good with what , five?\u2019\u2019 which the undercover officer understood to mean $5,000 and went on to describe exactly what the 15-year-old looked like and what kind of car her parents drive. Then, the officer asked Flores: \u201cIf I find them then I\u2019m going to make her and her momma disappear - you good with that? \u2018\u2019 to which Flores responded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good\u2019\u2019 and later, \u201cKill them both then,\u2019\u2019 prosecutors said. Flores admitted in a videotaped statement that he offered the undercover officer $5,000 to kill the teen and her mom, prosecutors said. ",

Mike Haley, a lifelong Cubs fan, helped start the Left Field Bleacher Bums, a group that inspired a play and a made-for-TV movie. (Family photo) Joan Giangrasse KatesChicago Tribune Mike Haley, a lifelong Cubs fan who helped start the Left Field Bleacher Bums, would sometimes challenge future Hall of Fame pitcher Ferguson \"Fergie\" Jenkins to arm wrestling before a game. \"And he was strong,\" Jenkins recalled. \"I'd win a few, he'd win a few. I've got a lot of great memories from back in those days.\" Haley, a fixture in the group of Wrigley Field fans immortalized in print, onstage and television, forged a connection with players that was exceptional even among the loyal fans who called themselves Bleacher Bums. \"We met in one of those bars across from the park, where I got to know a lot of the Bleacher Bums,\" said Jenkins, who pitched for the Cubs from 1966 to 1973. \"What I liked about Mike was that, win or lose, he'd be there after every game, giving me a pat on the back. I really appreciated that. It meant a lot. \"He was quick with a joke and down-to-earth, the kind of guy that was fun to be around.\" Haley, 67, died of natural causes Dec. 31 at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago. He lived long enough to see his team finally break a more than centurylong World Series title drought. \"When they finally won, Mike was watching it on TV from his home,\" said his sister, Debbie Data. \"People were calling and sending him texts during the game and well into the night. It made him so happy.\" The coterie of characters often referred to as \"The Bums,\" beloved by many and an irritant to some, particularly members of the opposing team, was the subject of a 1977 play spearheaded by actor Joe Mantegna and written by the Organic Theater Company. A PBS production aired of a 1979 performance, and the play also inspired a made-for-TV movie. Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities with Chicago ties who died in 2016. \"Mike was a wonderful fellow, a gentle giant and do-anything-for-you kind of guy,\" said Mike Murphy, a sports radio talk show host on WMVP-AM 1000 and a fellow co-founder of the Bleacher Bums. \"He was funny as hell, a great ad-libber and storyteller, with a ton of memorable one-liners. One of the toughest things was trying to get him to laugh, to get him going and watch him double over. \"When that happened, it'd make my day.\" Born in Chicago and raised in Hillside, Haley grew up attending Cubs game with his family, sometimes sitting in the bleachers. \"Even as a kid, he was a big Cubs fan and understood the game backward and forwards,\" his sister said. \"He knew all the players their stats, and where the team was in the standings at any given point.\" A graduate of St. Joseph Catholic High School in Westchester, Haley enlisted in the Marines during the Vietnam War, and did a stint as a radio technician on a U.S. military base in the South Pacific. Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2016. Following his military discharge, he moved to Chicago's North Side and held a variety of jobs while taking evening courses toward a bachelor's degree in education at Lewis University in Romeoville. He lived in an apartment above Bernie's Tap and Grill on North Clark Street, across from Wrigley Field. \"Mike was someone who really enjoyed a good game,\" Jenkins said. \"It was all about the level of playing and making sure that the fans weren't getting short-changed.\" In the late 1960s, Haley and fellow fans whose preferred seating was in the outfield formed the Left Field Bleacher Bums. \"He was a very astute fan and extremely knowledgeable,\" Murphy said. \"He could be as critical of the Cubs as he could be supportive. He was a realist. He'd call it the way he saw it.\" The idea for the group's signature yellow helmets reportedly came after Haley was struck in the head by an opposing team's home run. \"Supposedly it just skimmed his head, but he threw the ball back,\" his sister said. Haley served as the group's vice president and helped create chants aimed at the opposing team and coordinate after-game activities. \"He was a former Marine, a natural leader,\" Murphy said. \"When it came to organizing, he was the guy. Everybody just kind of gravitated to him.\" \"The Bums usually ended up at Bernie's, where Mike manned the jukebox,\" Data said. \"He was the one getting everybody up and out of their seats, singing and dancing.\" In the early 1980s, Haley moved to Minooka, where he taught English at Minooka High School. He left teaching in 1990 and began working for Amtrak as the manager of food and beverages on the Empire Builder, a daily passenger train that runs between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. He retired in 2005, and up until a year ago, was still attending home games whenever possible, his sister said. \"Mike was a good friend,\" Jenkins said, \"and a great Cubs fan.\" He leaves no other immediate survivors. Services were held. ",

That's a fancy title for, well, Ross isn't entirely sure. He retired as a player Nov. 2, the moment Anthony Rizzo squeezed Kris Bryant 's throw in the 10th inning of Game 7 in Cleveland, 15 years in the big leagues capped with his second World Series title. \"It's a lot of me listening, taking in different parts of the organization, things I don't know anything about,\" Ross said. \"Get some background on what it takes to run an organization.\" Ross, who turns 40 in March, plans to study scouting and player development and \"listen to the wealth of knowledge they have in the front office.\" He also will help evaluate amateur players before the draft in June. Cubs third baseman and National League MVP Kris Bryant said he's happy Ross will remain attached to the team. But he jokingly warned that he better know his place. \"I think we can still call him 'Grandpa,'\" Bryant said. \"We were giving him a hard time at (Rizzo's charity event Thursday). There was a section that said, 'players.' We told him, 'You can't be in here. Players only.' We love to have fun with him.\" Ross batted .229 with 106 home runs and 314 RBIs while playing in 883 regular-season games for seven teams. He also helped the Red Sox win the World Series in 2013. Photos from the 2017 Cubs Convention at the Sheraton Grand Chicago. Baez item: Javier Baez isn't worried about playing time with the return of Kyle Schwarber in left field resulting in Ben Zobrist's potential return to second base. \"I already have a ring,\" Baez said. \"There's nothing to be worried about. We have to see how everything goes.\" Despite starting every postseason game at second base, Baez is prepared to return to his super-utility role. Baez, who batted .273 with 14 home runs in his first full major-league season, is certain of his status. \"I'm 100 percent an everyday player,\" Baez said. Baez is the only Cub committed to play in the World Baseball Classic , for his native Puerto Rico. He said it wasn't a tough decision to leave his teammates temporarily during spring training . \"I've been resting a lot and feel good,\" Baez said. Special visit: Monday's visit to the White House will be a repeat for President Theo Epstein, who won two Series with the Red Sox. \"I'm happiest for our players,\" Epstein said. \"It's a really special part of winning the World Series. It feels like you finally made it. You feel like you're in the most precious building in the country and get to strut around as world champs and meet the president. It doesn't get any better than that. \"It's very fitting we're seeing a Chicagoan (President Barack Obama) in his last week in office. That makes it more special.\" Photos of Chicago sports teams visiting the White House through the years. Memory lane: Recently married Kris Bryant said he and his wife, Jessica, will go on their honeymoon next offseason, \"hopefully after a World Series win.\" Bryant said he barely has had time to relive his 2016 National League MVP season. \"I've honestly been thinking about the last game and how unbelievable that was,\" Bryant said. \"One of the greatest baseball games ever to be played. And I feel honored to be a part of that.\" Down to one: Jake Arrieta ($15.6375 million), Hector Rondon ($5.8 million) and Justin Grimm ($1.825 million) agreed to terms, leaving reliever Pedro Strop as the only arbitration-eligible unsigned player. Strop is seeking $6 million; the Cubs submitted a $4.6 million offer. Arrieta's agreement was revealed shortly after free-agent right-hander Tyson Ross, a Cubs target, reportedly agreed to a one-year deal with the Rangers . \"(Ross) made a decision he sees in his best interest to come back from his (thoracic outlet syndrome) injury and put himself in a position to pitch again there,\" Epstein said. \"We wish him well.\" ",

Sky Arts said it has decided not to broadcast the program \u201cin light of the concerns expressed by Michael Jackson\u2019s immediate family.\u201d It said Fiennes \u201cfully supports our decision.\u201d See Joseph Fiennes play Michael Jackson in new trailer for \u201cUrban Myths\u201d Sky had been criticized for casting the white \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d star as the King of Pop in \u201cElizabeth, Michael and Marlon.\u201d The half-hour program also features Stockard Channing as Elizabeth Taylor and British actor Brian Cox as Marlon Brando. Jackson\u2019s daughter Paris tweeted that she felt angry after watching a trailer for the show, which was due to be broadcast next week. \u201cI\u2019m so incredibly offended by it, as I\u2019m sure plenty of people are as well, and it honestly makes me want to vomit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt angers me to see how obviously intentional it was for them to be this insulting, not just towards my father, but my godmother Liz as well.\u201d @TheMJCast i'm so incredibly offended by it, as i'm sure plenty of people are as well, and it honestly makes me want to vomit. \u2014 Paris-Michael K.

    "text": "By Ashley Welch CBS News January 13, 2017, 5:18 PM Woman died from superbug resistant to all available antibiotics in U.S. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) bacteria is pictured in this medical illustration provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reuters/CDC Email A Nevada woman has died from an infection resistant to all available antibiotics in the United States, public health officials report. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the woman\u2019s condition was deemed incurable after being tested against 26 different antibiotics. Though this isn\u2019t the first case of pan-resistant bacteria in the U.S., at this time it is still uncommon. Still, experts note that antibiotic resistance is a growing health concern globally and call the newly reported case \u201ca wake up call.\u201d \u201cThis is the latest reminder that yes, antibiotic resistance is real,\u201d Dr. James Johnson, a professor specializing in infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota Medical School, told CBS News. \u201cThis is not some future, fantasized armageddon threat that maybe will happen after our lifetime. This is now, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s here.\u201d According to the report, the woman from Washoe County was in her 70s and had recently returned to America after an extended trip to India. She had been hospitalized there several times before being admitted to an acute care hospital in Nevada in mid-August. Doctors discovered the woman was infected with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) , which is a family of germs that CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden has called \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d due to the danger it poses for spreading antibiotic resistance. The woman had a specific type of CRE, called Klebsiella pneumoniae, which can lead to a number of illnesses, including pneumonia, blood stream infections, and meningitis. In early September, she developed septic shock and died. The authors of the report say the case highlights the need for doctors and hospitals to ask incoming patients about recent travel and if they have been hospitalized elsewhere. Other experts say it underscores the need for the medical community, the government and the public to take antibiotic resistance more seriously. According to the CDC, at least two million people become infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria each year, and at least 23,000 die as a direct result of these infections. The World Health Organization calls antibiotic resistance \u201cone of the biggest threats to global health.\u201d A grim report released last year suggests that if bacteria keep evolving at the current rate, by 2050, superbugs will kill 10 million people a year. \u00a0 While scientists are working to develop new antibiotics, that takes time, and experts encourage doctors and the public to focus on prevention efforts. One of the most important ways to prevent antibiotic resistance is to only take antibiotics only when they\u2019re necessary . \u201cDrug resistance like this [case] generally develops from too much exposure to antibiotics,\u201d assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Pediatric Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, told CBS News. \u201cEvery time you\u2019re placed on an antibiotic it\u2019s important to question if it\u2019s absolutely necessary and what\u2019s the shortest amount of time you can take this antibiotic for it to still be effective.\u201d Johnson notes that medical tourism \u2013 the practice of traveling to another country to obtain medical treatment, typically at lower cost \u2013 may no longer be worth the risk. \u201cWith this [antibiotic] resistance issue, the risk/benefit of this approach really changes and I think that people really need to be aware and seriously consider if it\u2019s a good idea given the possibility of this kind of thing,\u201d he said. Frequent hand washing, particularly in healthcare settings, is also extremely important in preventing the spread of germs. Finally, Johnson says the public can play an important role in advocating for prevention of antibiotic resistance. While important to develop new antibiotics, \u201cthe efforts are not as strong for helping us use our existing antibiotics intelligently,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something sexy about the notion of developing the \u2018new super antibiotic\u2019 to fight the superbug . It\u2019s like a cartoon with our mega hero against our mega villain,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut really we have a lot of great antibiotics right now but we\u2019re using them in silly ways. There are organized, systematic ways that public health systems, healthcare systems, and for that matter veterinary and animal food production systems, can roll out to use our existing drugs more sensibly to slow down the freight train that is heading toward \u2013 or partly going off -- the cliff with antibiotic resistance.\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images After President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state made strong statements about China's actions in the South China Sea, Chinese officials have responded with muted, measured statements \u2014 while state-run media have warned of the potential for conflict and retaliation. 5 Top Moments From Rex Tillerson's Hearing To Be Secretary Of State Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO nominated to lead the U.S. State Department, had a confirmation hearing Wednesday. He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China's actions in the South China Sea were \"extremely worrisome\" and compared them to Russia's annexation of Crimea. Beijing has claimed most of the South China Sea as its territory, a stance rejected by an international tribunal . China has also built artificial islands with military capabilities in the disputed territory. The U.S. has declined to take an official position on the competing claims, but periodically patrols the waters and emphasizes the need for international freedom of movement. Tillerson said the situation was a potential \"threat to the entire global economy.\" Article continues after sponsorship In South China Sea Islands, Anti-Aircraft And Radar Systems Emerge In Full Color Asked Wednesday whether he supports a more aggressive U.S. posture in the South China Sea, Tillerson said, \"You're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed.\" Tillerson also sharply criticized China for failing to dissuade North Korea over its nuclear program. He said the U.S. \"cannot continue to accept empty promises like the ones China has made to pressure North Korea to reform.\" ",

(Photo: Lacey Faeh via Instagram) The White House on Friday chose not to confirm or deny a report\u00a0the Obama family's Portuguese water dog Sunny bit a guest on the face at an event earlier this week. Press Secretary Josh Earnest side-stepped the question in a Friday press briefing, saying, \"I don't have a whole lot more light to shed on that particular situation.\" He added\u00a0he's not aware of a\u00a0similar incident occurring\u00a0in the past. TMZ posted a story on Thursday saying Sunny bit an 18-year-old woman on the face during a White House visit on Monday. TMZ reported through \"sources connected to the girl\" that she was a family friend who\u00a0tried to pet and kiss the dog. The website also posted a photo of the woman with a gash under her left eye. TMZ added the family's physician, \"Checked her out and decided she needed stitches.\" Multiple news sources reported the story on Thursday, most citing TMZ. USA TODAY contacted the White House\u00a0but did not receive a response. Earnest,\u00a0however, said Sunny and the Obama family's other Portuguese water dog, Bo, represented America \"quite well in their status as the First Dogs.\" Both pups will move out of the White House next week when President Barack Obama leaves office. \"Both Bo and Sunny have been genuine ambassadors to the American people,\" said Earnest to a chuckling White House press corps. \"Thousands of people have had the opportunity to interact, play with those dogs, pet with those dogs.\" Posted!

Video provided by AFP Newslook Alberto Vilches (center) prepares to take the oath of allegiance to become a U.S. citizen at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Miami on Jan. 13, 2017. The Havana native benefited from the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy. (Photo: Alan Gomez, USA TODAY) MIAMI\u00a0\u2014 President Obama's decision to end the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy that has allowed tens of thousands of Cubans to enter the U.S. has roiled the Cuban-American community, leaving even those who benefited directly from the policy with mixed emotions. Obama made the surprise announcement on Thursday to end the policy, first enacted by President Clinton in 1995 to stop a growing wave of Cuban rafters that was flooding into South Florida. Under the new directive, Cubans who reached U.S. soil would be allowed to stay in the country and become legal permanent residents after one year. Those caught at sea were returned to Cuba. Alberto Vilches was paddling north with five friends through the Florida Straits on a boat they made\u00a0out of Styrofoam when, unknown to them, Clinton made his announcement. On Friday, Vilches finally completed his long journey, swearing his oath of allegiance to become a U.S. citizen thanks to the preferential treatment afforded to Cubans under the policy. Even though he benefited from \"wet foot, dry foot,\" the Havana native said its time had passed. He said when he arrived, Cubans were fleeing political persecution and the horrors inflicted on them by the communist Cuban regime. But now, he said Cubans are\u00a0taking advantage of the program and coming only for economic gains. \"So many people who have come in these last few years come for different reasons,\" said Vilches, 68, a retired factory worker. \"They come with a different mentality now.\" Obama ends 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cubans That kind of response has angered other beneficiaries of \"wet foot, dry foot.\" Daniel Gil made 11 attempts to reach the U.S. by sea \u2014 Cuban authorities stopped him eight times and the U.S. Coast Guard caught him three times. He eventually found his way to Mexico and entered the U.S. through the southwest border in 2005, simply showing his Cuban passport to U.S. border officials as countless other migrants from other countries were trying to sneak past those officials. Gil said it was unfair for Cubans who came earlier to close the door behind them, arguing that the same communist regime runs the country and causes\u00a0the same level of misery for its people. \"The economic problem in Cuba is a political one,\" Gil said. \"There are people on the water right now trying to get here. They are on their way through Mexico. The U.S. is a symbol to them.\u00a0It is freedom, and now we've taken that away from them.\" In some cases, Cuban-Americans have appeared to be arguing with themselves. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., have tried to change Cuban immigration for years. They say many newcomers are economic migrants who return to Cuba as soon as they receive their green cards in the U.S. On Thursday, both members of Congress\u00a0agreed changes were needed. \"Although our country's immigration policy toward Cuba has granted many of the dictatorship's victims refuge, it has also been grossly abused and exploited by many Cuban nationals, while also inadvertently bolstering the Cuban regime,\" Curbelo said. \"A change to the policy was inevitable.\" Cubans rush to U.S. shores before easy entry ends Yet both of the Cuban-American members of Congress also bashed Obama. Curbelo complained that the policy change was \"coordinated with anti-American dictators\" and Rubio said it could leave real victims of political persecution without any options. \"While some changes were needed, we must work to ensure that Cubans who arrive here to escape political persecution are not summarily returned to the regime, and they are given a fair opportunity to apply for and receive political asylum,\" Rubio said. Augusto Maxwell, a partner with the Akerman law firm, teaches a class about Cuba at Columbia Law School and is now struggling to come up with a way to explain the complexities to his next class. He said he was at a wedding over the weekend as someone casually explained how they paid $10,000 per person to get their family out of Cuba and onto U.S. soil to gain legal status under \"wet foot, dry foot.\" \"I wondered how I would translate that to students in New York,\" said Maxwell, whose parents are Cuban. \"It's been so normalized that we've lost track of how unusual it is for us to incentivize people to risk their lives in such a dramatic way to escape Cuba. \"It's with great conflict that I think people are processing this.\" 90 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 29 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2itve33 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Ryan (R-Wis.) opposes the ACA House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) opposes the ACA (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images) Lisa Mascaro Contact Reporter The Republican-led Congress passed a plan Friday to start the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act , but the road ahead remains unclear.\u00a0 House Republicans approved the budget blueprint, 227-198, following a similar party-line vote earlier this week in the Senate , which sets a month-end timetable to draft a repeal bill. But leaders warned the process could take longer. The week was full of theatrics as Republicans struggled to fulfill one of their major campaign promises. One by one, Republicans rose at their desks to criticize Obamacare \u2014 Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.)\u00a0compared the ACA\u00a0to a goat ransacking the interior of a house. \u201cI have to get the goat out,\u201d he said. And after each GOP speech, Democrats reminded lawmakers of how many hundreds of thousands of Americans might\u00a0lose their healthcare coverage in that lawmaker\u2019s state if Obamacare is repealed \u2014\u00a0more than 580,000, for example, in Georgia. But launching\u00a0the repeal process was the easy part.\u00a0Republicans aren\u2019t any closer to fulfilling their longtime promise to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d even though they will now control the House, Senate and White House. President-elect Donald Trump said this week that he expects Congress to act swiftly, promising that a plan will be coming as soon as his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), is confirmed for the Cabinet. \u201cIt'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.\u201d Republican leaders, though, know that is a promise easier made than kept. Trump and the GOP are charging forward with Obamacare repeal, but few are eager to follow \u00bb Ever since President Obama signed the healthcare bill into law in 2010, Republicans have been unable to coalesce around a viable option. Friday\u2019s vote showed the trouble ahead as nine\u00a0Republicans, a mix of the most conservative and most moderate, declined to back the first step.\u00a0 \u201cWe're not holding hard deadlines, only because we want to get it right,\u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). He has committed to having repeal and replace done \u201cthis year.\u201d But without a clear path forward, rank-and-file GOP lawmakers are becoming increasingly nervous that constituents back home will lose their healthcare coverage if the ACA is repealed before a replacement is enacted. In closed-door meetings over the past two weeks, Republicans have expressed much \u201chand-wringing,\u201d as one lawmaker put it. One congressman quoted scripture in asking colleagues to ensure they had a sturdy foundation before pressing ahead with the\u00a0repeal. \u201cWe do have members who feel if we don\u2019t do them together, the replacement plan will never happen,\u201d acknowledged Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), an early Trump supporter. \u201cPeople will, I hope, fall in line with our new president, make sure we are supportive of him coming right out of the gate.\u201d As voting was underway this week, Republican aides were increasingly suggesting another course of action. They say the Obamacare replacement will not be a single bill, but a series of actions \u2014 \u00a0some made through regulatory changes by Price at Health and Human Services, others by Trump's executive actions, and some in legislation \u2014 to build a new healthcare system. That process could drag throughout 2017, with many of the changes not expected to be phased in for several years to ease the transition. \u201cWe're not going to swap one 2,700-page monstrosity for another,\u201d Ryan said, referring to the Obamacare law. Republicans have promised their plan will lower the consumer costs of health insurance premiums and deductibles, and give people more choices in choosing coverage. They have floated ideas for expanding tax-exempt health savings accounts and giving lower-income Americans refundable tax credits toward buying their own coverage. They want to end the mandate that all Americans have insurance. But without legislation, those ideas remain only works in progress. Meanwhile, more than 20 million people are now benefiting from Obamacare, either by purchasing private insurance on the ACA exchanges or receiving health coverage through the Medicaid expansion. Many people receive government subsidies to defray the costs.\u00a0 Trump made promises to blue-collar voters. Democrats plan to make sure he follows through \u00bb Repealing Obamacare threatens to wipe out that system without providing a new one. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they have a remedy?\u201d said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). \u201cThey\u2019re not going to have anything better than the ACA.\u201d Approval of the budget package Friday sends instructions to various congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal Obamacare by Jan. 27. But aides cautioned that deadline is not binding, and may slip. Republicans have approved countless bills to repeal Obamacare before, but their off-the-shelf model needs some fine-tuning now that it has a chance under Trump to become law, they said. Both Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hope some of the replacement elements can be tucked into the repeal bill, providing a safety net as they dismantle Obamacare. But because the repeal bill is part of the budget process, it must hew to budgetary provisions, which throws into question some of the most popular parts of Obamacare \u2014 such as allowing young people to remain on parents plans until they are 26 years old or prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage for those with preexisting conditions. Meanwhile, lawmakers are wedged between constituents who want them to keep their promise to gut Obamacare, and those worried about what will happen to their healthcare coverage if they do. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting calls,\u201d said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.). \u201cSome people feel a little uncomfortable.\u201d Caption President Obama's farewell address President Obama delivered his farewell speech Tuesday in Chicago.

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s the great port-a-potty cover-up for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration . Workers preparing for the inauguration Jan. 20 have taped over the name of the company \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019s Johns\u201d \u2014 that has long supplied portable restrooms for major outdoor events in the nation\u2019s capital. Virginia-based Don\u2019s Johns calls itself the Washington area\u2019s top provider of portable toilet rentals. But the name apparently strikes too close to home for inaugural organizers. Workers have placed blue tape over the company name on dozens of portable restrooms installed near the Capitol for the inauguration. The company\u2019s name is clearly visible upon close inspection, but is blocked for a wide-angle view by a TV or still camera. The inauguration will take place on the west side of the Capitol facing the National Mall. Portable toilets set up on the east side, near Senate office buildings, do not have taped-over logos. Robert Weghorst, chief operating officer for Don\u2019s Johns, said he did not know the logos were covered up until the AP reported on it, lighting up his company switchboard and \u201cblowing up\u201d its social media accounts. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why it\u2019s being done. We didn\u2019t tell someone to do it,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to have our name on the units.\u201d Don\u2019s Johns has provided portable toilets for many large events in Washington, including the 2009 and 2013 inauguration ceremonies for President Barack Obama, Weghorst said. No logos were taped over during those events, he said. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the Presidential Inaugural Committee had no immediate comment Friday. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "By Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller January 13 at 4:34 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @gregpmiller Russia has invited the incoming Trump administration to Syrian peace talks it is sponsoring later this month with Turkey and Iran, part of a process from which the Obama administration pointedly has been excluded. U.S. participation, especially if an agreement is reached, would be the first indication of the enhanced U.S.-Russia cooperation that President Vladi\u00admir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump have forecast under a Trump administration. The invitation, extended to Trump\u2019s designated national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn , came in a Dec.\u00a028 phone call to Flynn by Sergey Kislyak , Russia\u2019s ambassador in Washington, according to a transition official. The official said that \u201cno decision was made\u201d during the call and that \u201cI don\u2019t have anything additional on U.S. attendance at this time.\u201d The official spoke on the condition of anonymity based on ground rules set by the transition team. A spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that the United States would attend the talks, according to Turkish media. To be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, the talks are tentatively scheduled to begin Jan.\u00a023, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Syrian government and opposition representatives are also expected to attend. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser, arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 3. (Andrew Harnik/AP) [ Defense nominee warns of Kremlin attempts to \u2018break\u2019 NATO ] The Astana meeting will follow an unsuccessful year-long attempt, spearheaded by the Obama administration and Russia, to implement a cease-fire and begin peace talks in Syria. Moscow and Washington have accused each other of sabotaging that effort. Russia initiated the new process, aiming to demonstrate its own leadership role on the regional and global stages. Meanwhile, the timing of the Flynn-Kislyak call has prompted questions about whether they also discussed sanctions on Russia that President Obama was widely reported to be preparing \u2014 and announced the next day \u2014 and whether Trump, as president, will enforce them or even allow them to stand. The transition official said Friday that he did not know whether Flynn was aware at the time of the call that sanctions were about to be announced. But \u201cI can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever,\u201d the official said. Trump conceded at a news conference this week that \u201cI think it was Russia\u201d that was responsible for hacking Democratic email accounts during the presidential campaign. He had previously questioned a U.S. intelligence assessment of Russian responsibility. But he continues to reject the intelligence conclusion that Russia leaked the hacked information to promote his candidacy over that of Hillary Clinton. The Senate Intelligence Committee will \u201cexpeditiously\u201d conduct an investigation of the intelligence conclusions, the chairman and ranking Democrat announced Friday. Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said in a statement that the scope of the inquiry would include, but would not be limited to, Russian activities and intentions, as well as \u201cany intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns.\u201d It said the committee would, when possible, hold open hearings; issue subpoenas for testimony, if necessary; and produce classified and unclassified reports of its findings. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Trump and Flynn have called for increased cooperation with Russia on a number of fronts, and both have criticized the current administration, alleging missed opportunities and weak leadership. The Flynn-Kislyak call was first reported Friday by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius , who said transition officials described two separate conversations between them, both initiated by Flynn. The first call, on Dec.\u00a019, was to express condolences for the terrorist killing of the Russian ambassador to Turkey. The second, on Dec.\u00a028, was to express condolences for the crash of a Russian plane carrying a choir to Syria, to discuss a Putin-Trump telephone call after the inauguration, and to discuss a Russian invitation for a Trump administration official to visit Kazakhstan in late January. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, asked about Ignatius\u2019s column in a conference call with reporters, offered a somewhat different account of communications between the two. Flynn and Kislyak exchanged Christmas greetings via text on Dec.\u00a025, Spicer said, and a subsequent call on Dec.\u00a028 began with a text message from Kislyak to Flynn asking for a phone conversation. Flynn responded positively, and Kislyak placed the call, which \u201ccentered on the logistics\u201d of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin, Spicer said. \u201cThat was it, plain and simple,\u201d he added. Russia and Iran have provided decisive military support for \u00adSyrian President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against U.S.-backed rebel forces, as well as al-Qaeda-allied fighters. Trump has been critical of Iran while calling for a counterterrorism alliance with Russia and saying Assad\u2019s ouster should not be a primary U.S. interest. Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that \u201cRussia, Syria, Turkey and Iran are dictating the terms of how things are going to play out in Syria today, absent our participation,\u201d and called for increased U.S. engagement in the conflict. But, he said, any cooperation with Iran in Syria \u201cis contrary to American interests.\u201d Although the United States and Turkey are NATO allies and both members of the coalition against the Islamic State, their interests have diverged somewhat in Syria and over the circumstances surrounding and following an unsuccessful coup attempt in Turkey this past summer. Russia, seeing an opportunity for advantage, has patched up differences with Turkey that began with the Turkish downing of a Russian plane that skirted its airspace while in action over Syria. Over the past several months, Putin and Erdogan have spoken frequently and began late last year to plan the Astana conference, along with Iran. It remains unclear which of the non-terrorist opposition groups, variously backed by the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and others in the region, will attend the talks. A cease-fire, to be implemented in anticipation of the negotiations, has been only partially observed, with Assad\u2019s forces attacking long-held rebel positions on the outskirts of Damascus. While many Obama administration officials have thrown up their hands at the intractability of the Syria problem, the administration gave its public approval to the Astana meeting, even without an invitation. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said earlier this month that the administration was \u201cencouraging\u201d the talks. \u201cWe hope that could produce a step forward,\u201d he said during a final news conference at the State Department. But the greater objective, Kerry said, was beginning separate, U.N.-sponsored talks among all the Syrian players in Geneva. Those talks \u2014 a resumption of a failed earlier effort last year under U.S.-Russia auspices \u2014 are scheduled to begin Feb.\u00a08 in Geneva. Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. envoy in charge of that process, said Wednesday that \u201cthe U.N. is supportive\u201d of the Kazakhstan meeting. \u201cThe U.N. is being kept informed, and . . . [is] ready to contribute and support so that we have a successful Astana meeting,\u201d which, he said, could be a steppingstone to a successful Geneva meeting. While Turkey has closely coordinated with Russia on the meeting, the Turkish government has also been anxious over the absence of the United States and has pushed for its inclusion. \u201cThe United States should definitely be invited, and that is what we agreed with Russia,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday, according to Turkish media reports. \u201cNobody can ignore the role of the United States.\u201d world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",

    "text": "Continue reading the main story Republicans have repeatedly pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now they say they are intent on keeping their promise to Americans who have been crushed by soaring premiums and other unintended effects of the law, which was adopted without any Republican votes. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThis is a critical first step toward delivering relief to Americans who are struggling under this law,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said, adding of the health care law, \u201cThis experiment has failed.\u201d Democrats warned that repeal of the health law would cause hardship for millions of Americans and create chaos in insurance markets and in the health care system, which accounts for about 18 percent of the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cIf we go down this path, we won\u2019t have repeal and replace,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll have is repeal and repent, because we\u2019re going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that we cause.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s still no plan for what comes next, threatening massive disruption to the entire health care system\u201d said Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington. The House vote generally adhered to party lines, with the debate highlighting the striking gulf between the two parties over the future of health care. The Senate had approved the budget blueprint early Thursday by a vote of 51 to 48. The Times would like to hear from Americans who purchased health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. In the days before the House vote, some conservative Republicans as well as moderates expressed discomfort about signing off on the budget measure without having a clearer picture of how and when Republican leaders planned to go about replacing the health care law. Nine House Republicans ended up voting against the budget blueprint on Friday. No Democrats voted for it. The votes this week \u2014 essentially procedural steps \u2014 represented the first of several moves that Republicans plan to make as they demolish the law that Mr. Obama so frequently lauded. In the next few weeks, they say, they will try to devise a replacement, working closely with Mr. Trump and the man he has chosen to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Four committees \u2014 two in the Senate, two in the House \u2014 will write language repealing major provisions of the 2010 health law. The resulting legislation can be passed with simple majorities in both chambers and will be immune to a filibuster in the Senate. Then, Republicans say, they will pass one or more free-standing bills to replace selected provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats, they will need 60 votes to pass such legislation and will therefore need help from Democrats. Mr. Trump voiced support this week for repealing and replacing the health care law nearly simultaneously, though it remained to be seen how Republicans in the Senate would be able to win over enough Democratic support to put in place a robust replacement for the existing health care law, given the need for those 60 votes. In the House debate Friday, Republicans and Democrats offered wildly differing views of health care and health insurance. Representative Jason Lewis, a freshman Republican from Minnesota, said he had firsthand experience with the Affordable Care Act. \u201cMinnesotans have seen their health insurance choices shrink while their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cI should know. For the last, in fact, over five years, I\u2019ve been in the individual market, and my own insurance premiums have nearly tripled, and I\u2019ve gone through three insurers. Minnesotans have seen a 50 to 67 percent increase in the premium cost this year alone.\u201d The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who engineered passage of the health law in the House in 2010, defended it on Friday, saying that every American benefited.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 BROWNSVILLE, Texas \u2013 \u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to build a U.S.-Mexico wall has touched off a fierce debate in the U.S. border towns that would be most affected \u2013\u00a0with local Democrats vowing to fight Trump tooth and nail if he proceeds.\u00a0 \u201cMexico is an ally, not an enemy,\u201d Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt is our second-largest trading partner, and building a wall between two countries with such important ties is a senseless and wasteful exercise.\" Vela is a colorful Trump critic. He made headlines after calling the president-elect's illegal immigrant policies \u201chateful, dehumanizing, and frankly shameful.\u201d In a public letter, he also advised Trump to \u201ctake your border wall and shove it up your ass.\u201d Vela is part of a growing number of Democratic lawmakers bracing for a fight with Trump over his proposed 1,933-mile border wall with Mexico -- one of several big immigration clashes on the horizon. Many Democratic officials in \"sanctuary cities\" also are preparing to battle Trump over his threat to cut their federal funding.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Trump stood by his promise that the U.S. would begin building the wall immediately after he takes office and force Mexico to pay for it, whether by tax or direct payment.\u00a0 \"It's not a fence -- it's a wall,\" he stressed at a press conference, citing support he heard during his campaign rallies for the plan. \"I don't want to wait.\"\u00a0 Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, in an interview with The Guardian, insisted Mexico \"absolutely\" will not pay for the project.\u00a0 Stateside, Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar told FoxNews.com he thinks the wall is an antiquated idea.\u00a0 \u201cI think we need to secure our border. I just want to do it in a smart way \u2013 in a way that\u2019s efficient, it\u2019s effective, it\u2019s something that works instead of just saying a wall,\u201d Cuellar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem.\u201d Trump\u2019s own pick for secretary of Homeland Security testified Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing that a border wall isn\u2019t the only answer.\u00a0 \u201cA physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job,\u201d retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly said. He pushed for a \u201clayered defense\u201d that includes deploying drones to patrol the gaps in the existing wall as well as an increase in Border Patrol agents. House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, has indicated he\u2019ll offer a bill later this month that supports more fencing and resources to prohibit illegal entry into the United States. In Brownsville, Texas, which shares a border with Matamoros, Mexico, Democratic Mayor Tony Martinez argues Washington is out of touch with conditions on the ground. A trial lawyer by trade, he believes the wall sends the wrong message.\u00a0 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the source of the problem?\u201d Martinez said. \u201cLet\u2019s address real immigration reform.\u201d\u00a0 Republicans for years have argued that border security should come before other aspects of immigration reform.\u00a0 Martinez advocates for bi-national talks between the United States and Mexico. The two nations already collaborate closely on security issues and often share intelligence through a partnership forged in 2007 to help stem drug trafficking. Martinez has been invited to Mexico City in February to discuss options between the neighboring countries. As for the wall, Martinez calls it \u201can illusion.\u201d Trump still has allies in Congress who support his goal of constructing a complete physical barrier, parts of which already exist. GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, in a FoxNews.com column , urged Trump to follow through on the campaign promise.\u00a0 Local law enforcement, meanwhile, are waiting to see how the debate shakes out.\u00a0 In Cameron County, Sheriff Omar Lucio dislikes the wall idea and blames the media for trumping up security fears. Lucio and his staff of around 100 are responsible for securing 60-70 miles on the most southern tip of Texas. Lucio, who was just elected to his fifth term as sheriff, told FoxNews.com he found it \u201cinsulting\u201d that the majority of Washington lawmakers have never set foot in Texas. He noted his county already has a border barrier in spots and suggested it hasn't helped.\u00a0 \u201cPerception becomes reality,\u201d he said. \u201cCome down here and see for yourself.\u201d Advertisement ",

Later, she appeared to trip a migrant carrying a child. \" 'It was all over within two seconds,' Laszlo said. 'Everybody was shouting. It was very frightening.' \" The court convicted her after a \"frame-by-frame examination of Laszlo's actions,\" the AP writes. YouTube Laszlo was fired after the video went public.

By Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky January 13 at 7:11 PM Follow @sarihorwitz Follow @mattzap Attorney General Loretta Lynch will step down without the Justice Department having charged or cleared police officers in the death of Eric Garner, whose videotaped takedown by New York City officers sparked national outrage, people familiar with the matter said. Lynch authorized the department to move forward with the case, but made that decision so late in her tenure that lawyers and investigators could not take all the necessary steps to procure an indictment. That would entail assembling the evidence in the case and presenting it to a grand jury in order to convince the panel to return criminal charges. The controversial case will now pass to the administration of Donald Trump and likely leave expected future attorney general Jeff Sessions with ultimate decision making authority. Sessions has said publicly he is wary of police being judged unfairly, and he is viewed as less likely to press for charges against officers involved in Garner\u2019s death. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The people familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal case. [ Even the feds can\u2019t agree whether an officer should face charges in Eric Garner\u2019s death ] Garner died in 2014 after he was taken to the ground by New York City police officers and put in what appeared to be a chokehold. The incident, which was caught on tape , ignited protests across the country, and Garner\u2019s gasping \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d became a rallying cry for those angered by the treatment of African Americans by police. Exactly why the nearly two-and-a-half year old case could not be resolved before Lynch will leave remains unclear. The matter was initially left to state authorities \u2014 with the Justice Department watching behind them \u2014 but in late 2014, a Staten Island grand jury declined to bring charges. Early in 2016, federal authorities began presenting the case to a grand jury, but the matter soon languished in part because of a dispute inside the Justice Department. It is possible that grand jury has now expired, and a new one would have needed to be empaneled. At least some prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Eastern District of New York felt that civil rights charges were not appropriate, while attorneys in the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department in D.C. thought they were, according to people familiar with the case. The Justice Department then removed New York FBI agents from the team of investigators, though others pressed forward, people familiar with the matter said. Lynch made police reform a centerpiece of her tenure, and in the waning days of her administration, she seemed to push to cement her legacy. On Thursday, she traveled to Baltimore to announce a court-enforceable agreement that would mandate broad changes at the police department in that city, where the 2015 death of another black man sparked riots. The next day, she flew to Chicago, making public a scathing report about the police department\u2019s pattern or practice of using excessive force on suspects and revealing that city leaders had agreed in principle to a set of improvements. The lack of a resolution in the Garner case, though, is a glaring omission, particularly given the time Lynch had to resolve it. [ Federal grand jury begins hearing evidence in Eric Garner\u2019s death ] Garner initially drew the attention of police for selling loose cigarettes, and the city of New York reached a civil settlement with his family last year for $5.9 million. Though the matter was caught on videotape, convicting officers on federal charges in the matter would not necessarily be easy. Substantiating civil rights charges requires prosecutors to meet a heavy burden of proof and present evidence that might speak to an officer\u2019s intent at the time of the incident. In the high-profile case of Darren Wilson, the white police officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, the Justice Department found there was \u201cno evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson\u2019s stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety.\u201d Prosecutors came to a similar conclusion in the 2015 shooting of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis, describing in a lengthy news release the exacting standard they would have had to meet. \u201cIt is not enough to show that the officer made a mistake, acted negligently, acted by accident or mistake or even exercised bad judgment,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in the release. \u201cAlthough Clark\u2019s death is undeniably tragic, the evidence is insufficient to meet these substantial evidentiary requirements.\u201d Sessions is a former U.S. Attorney who at his confirmation hearing this week insisted he will follow the law, and his political views will have no impact on his decision making. But he also presented himself a friend to local police, wary of actions that paint them unfairly with a broad brush. \u201cIn the last several years, law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey believe the political leadership of this country abandoned them.\u201d Lawyer Jonathan C. Moore, who represents Garner\u2019s family, said in an interview earlier Friday that he had sent an email to Vanita Gupta, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, on Jan. 6, asking for a status update in the case, and she had not responded. He said his last conversation with Justice Department officials came in early December, and they told him they were still investigating. \u201cOur position is that whether it\u2019s now, next week, two weeks, or four months from now, that there should be an indictment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen that happens, obviously the sooner the better.\u201d Stuart London, who is representing the officer who on the video seems to be putting Garner in a chokehold, said he, too, had not heard anything from the Justice Department. \u201cI\u2019ve always said from the beginning that the standard needed to indict my client under a federal statute is even greater than under a state statute, and he was exonerated by a state grand jury,\u201d London said. London said his client, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, remains a police officer on desk duty. world Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 ",
