Paul Singer , USA TODAY Published 4:16 p.m. ET Jan. 19, 2017 | Updated 43 minutes ago 55 Shares x Share A host of myths, enduring traditions and presidential foibles fill the history of presidential inaugurations. Historian Jim Bendat recalls the history and meaning of the ceremony, along with some memorable speeches. (Jan. 18) AP If Donald Trump's inaugural address is anything like his predecessors', there will be\u00a0a lot of God in it. A new interactive built by GoogleNews Labs shows that God was\u00a0the most common theme mentioned by presidents in the 11 most searched inaugural\u00a0addresses. Trump has been unconventional in many ways, including the fact that unlike many politicians, he does not habitually end his speeches with \"... and God bless the United States of America.\" But for the inaugural address, a reference to the almighty is pretty much a baseline requirement, particularly since Trump was elected with strong support from evangelical voters. The Google interactive is fascinating, if a bit daunting. It includes 11 full addresses (Trump will be added Friday shortly after he speaks), which have been tagged by topics ranging from \"courage\" and \"loyalty\" to \"liberty\" and \"wealth.\" It also shows which topics were most mention within each speech. For example, \"money\" dominated Franklin Roosevelt's 1933 inaugural address, because, in the heart of the Great Depression, nobody had any. By contrast, the top topic of Ronald Reagan's 1981 inaugural address was \"freedom\" \u2014 not surprising for a man whose presidency helped force\u00a0the collapse of the Soviet Union. And \"God\" was the top topic of Abraham Lincoln's 1865 inaugural address, which was laced with references to the raging Civil War in which both sides prayed to God for assistance. Read more: Posted!

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 19, 2017 4:27 PM EST After time in the intensive care unit of a Texas hospital, former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s health is improving, according to a family spokesman. \u201cThe news is good \u2014 all the prayers and good wishes are having a good effect,\u201d Jim McGrath told CBS News Thursday, giving an update on the health of Mr. Bush and his wife Barbara. \u201cThey both got a good night\u2019s sleep and are on the upswing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYesterday was not a good day, but they have bounced back,\u201d he added, noting that \u201cright now things are pointing up.\u201d The 41st president will not be attending the Friday inauguration of Donald Trump, but his son and 43rd President George W. Bush is still slated to attend.\u00a0 George H.W. Bush in ICU, will not attend inauguration Mr. Bush has been in intensive care at Houston Methodist Hospital, where he\u2019s been fighting off an \u201cacute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia,\u201d CBS News\u2019 Omar Villafranca reported. He also suffers from vascular parkinsonism, a rare syndrome that mimics Parkinson\u2019s disease. The 92-year-old Mr. Bush also broke a vertebra in 2015 and has used a motorized scooter or a wheelchair in recent years. Doctors intubated the 41st president on Wednesday for a procedure to protect and clear his airway. His wife, 91-year-old Barbara Bush , is also in the hospital with bronchitis. She is not in the ICU. This is the former president\u2019s fourth hospital stay in five years, but McGrath says he is a fighter. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious situation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s 92. He has pneumonia. He\u2019s in the ICU. But again, you don\u2019t bet against George Bush.\u201d In a Facebook post on Thursday, the younger Mr. Bush thanked those who sent supportive messages for his parents. \u201cYour prayers are working: 41 and Mom are doing much better today and fighting on,\u201d the former president said. Here are some answers to common questions about the former president\u2019s health: What are the risks of pneumonia?\u00a0 Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be mild or severe. Elderly patients are at risk of deadly complications. The former president wrote to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 10, saying that he would be unable to attend Friday\u2019s inauguration because of doctor\u2019s orders : \u201cMy doctor says if I sit outside in January, it will likely put me six feet under. Same for Barbara. So I guess we\u2019re stuck in Texas.\u201d What is vascular parkinsonism? People diagnosed with the condition walk with shuffling steps, and brain scans suggest they have suffered small strokes. However, they do not have the characteristic tremors of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and they do not respond to drugs for Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cThey look like Parkinson\u2019s from the waist down. From the waist up, they look very expressive,\u201d said Dr. Alberto Espay of the University of Cincinnati\u2019s Gardner Neuroscience Institute. Is it different from Parkinson\u2019s disease? Yes. It does not get steadily worse in the same way Parkinson\u2019s does. Classic Parkinson\u2019s disease develops when cells that produce one of the brain\u2019s chemical messengers, called dopamine, begin to deteriorate and die. Dopamine transports signals to parts of the brain that control movement. Parkinson\u2019s symptoms appear after enough dopamine-producing cells die that there\u2019s too little of this neurotransmitter in the brain. Vascular parkinsonism can closely mimic a number of other disorders, including classic Parkinson\u2019s, progressive supranuclear palsy and excessive fluid on the brain. What has President Bush said about the condition? In a 2012 interview with Parade magazine, Mr. Bush said: \u201cIt just affects the legs. It\u2019s not painful. You tell your legs to move and they don\u2019t move. It\u2019s strange, but if you have to have some bad-sounding disease, this is a good one to get.\u201d Mr. Bush said the symptoms have been difficult for him, \u201cbecause I love being active, (playing) sports, being in the game. But you just face the reality and make the best of it.\u201d Who gets it? People in their 70s and older are most likely be diagnosed, said Dr. Tanya Simuni who conducts research on Parkinson\u2019s and other movement disorders at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. She calls it a \u201cdifficult diagnosis\u201d because of the lack of accurate diagnostic tests. The risk factors are the same as for stroke and heart disease: history of smoking , lack of exercise and poor diet. It\u2019s rarer than Parkinson\u2019s disease, which affects about 1 million Americans. In contrast, roughly 20,000 people have been told they have vascular parkinsonism. How is it treated? Since the condition does not respond well to drugs used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, treatment relies on lowering the risk factors for stroke . That means quitting smoking, exercising, eating a healthy diet and perhaps taking a daily aspirin. Preventing falls is important, so a patient may receive physical therapy to improve balance. What causes the disease? This is where answers get tricky. Conventional thinking says the disease is caused by strokes. But without a perfect test, lots of problems get lumped under the umbrella. Espay has written a paper questioning whether most parkinsonism is related to vascular disease. He\u2019s also debated the topic at a recent neurology conference. Is there a cure? Physical therapy can help with balance and walking, but the damage cannot be reversed, said Dr. Corneliu Luca, assistant professor of neurology at University of Miami. \u201cIf you do not control risk factors for stroke, they can have another stroke, and the walking can get even worse,\u201d Luca said. What complications are most worrisome? Falls are the biggest concern because they can lead to fractures, Simuni said. Mr. Bush took a spill in 2015 and fractured his C2 vertebra, the second one below the skull. It\u2019s not known whether that fall was directly related to parkinsonism. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

By Maura Judkis By Maura Judkis January 18 at 3:53 PM Follow @MauraJudkis Thousands of guests joined an unofficial inaugural ball hosted by The Root at the National Museum of American History in 2009. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) The Arkansas State Society has a grand tradition of throwing elegant inaugural affairs. In 1953, when President Eisenhower was sworn in, it hosted a ball, a reception and a square dance. The 1993 celebration for President Clinton featured a performance by first brother Roger Clinton and his blues band, Politics. In 2009, 1,000 guests turned out for the society\u2019s party to celebrate the first inauguration of President Obama, who lost the state by nearly 20 points. This year, the Arkansas ball was canceled due to lack of interest, organizers told Little Rock\u2019s Democrat-Gazette. Veteran Washington party-hoppers know that the \u201cofficial\u201d balls \u2014 where the new president and his wife make an appearance \u2014 are generally just a small part of the inauguration party scene. Every four years, the city comes alive with a flurry of unofficial celebrations, ranging from chummy state-society affairs to exclusive corporate shindigs to cash-bar mixers open to anyone. But although it\u2019s hard to predict the size of the crowds that will greet President-elect Donald Trump at his public events this week, it seems increasingly clear that the after-hours revelry will be markedly muted. Not only is Trump hosting only three official balls \u2014 far fewer than his predecessors at their first inaugurals \u2014 but the spillover festivities appear smaller and fewer. Several of the city\u2019s great halls are going unrented. Far fewer big-name celebrities are headed to town. And while many events are reportedly sold out, others are still looking to fill their rooms. (Lee Powell/The Washington Post) Meanwhile, many of the parties that are carrying on are sending messages that are somewhat confusing. There\u2019s a PETA-sponsored vegan feast marking the arrival of our steak-loving president-elect (who, in fairness, did ban mule-diving at his Atlantic City hotels, the invitation notes). There\u2019s the Latino Coalition\u2019s morose invitation , which ponders \u201cwhether this is the best of times or worst of times for Hispanics in America. . . . The answer to that question has at times been mixed.\u201d Then there\u2019s \u201cDardanella: A Great Gatsby Inaugural Ball\u201d hosted by a retro party-planning company that, for $450, is offering guests the chance to travel back in time to an era when Trump did not yet exist and the stock market was poised to collapse. \u201cWe stress that this is a celebration of the United States presidency as an institution,\u201d said organizer Paul Erwin, who said ticket sales plunged after the election and left him briefly worried they might have to cancel. Now, they are close to selling out, but \u201cit has been a fine line and it definitely has been a bit of a straddling act.\u201d Trump\u2019s high-profile struggle to attract celebrities to perform at his inauguration has trickled down to the unofficial balls. The Recording Industry Association of America got superstar Rihanna to play its ball in 2009 . For Trump, it\u2019s trotting out Big & Rich . Even a Bruce Springsteen cover band that played the Garden State Presidential Inaugural Gala for both Obama inaugurations has dropped out . [ So, have Trump inauguration planners just given up on trying to get celebrities? ] The overall low wattage of the weekend may reflect the president-elect\u2019s drooping approval ratings; it may not help that he drew a mere 4 percent of the vote in the District of Columbia \u2014 historically low even in a strongly Democrat-dominated city. Locals aren\u2019t exactly eager to raise a glass to toast our new president. But people don\u2019t even want to drink to forget him, either. Party planners Brightest Young Things hosted all-day inauguration extravaganzas in 2009 and 2013. But even though they\u2019d have the prime audience for a massive anti-Trump blowout, they decided to sit this year out. \u201cI felt the energy is going to be kind of weird,\u201d said BYT organizer Svetlana Legetic. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like, \u2018Come hide with us and get wasted and deny what\u2019s happening.\u2019 That seems like the wrong attitude. I\u2019m officially a grown-up.\u201d Legetic agreed to help promote Busboys & Poets\u2019 star-studded Peace Ball , because it was \u201cbilled as a safe space.\u201d But the idea of dressing up in gowns and tuxes to complain about Trump held no appeal to her. \u201cI would hope that people realize that it is in bad taste,\u201d she said. Bars aren\u2019t expecting a wild night, either. Only 108 of them registered for extended hours with D.C.\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration, down from 160 in 2013, and 280 in 2009, the first year that extended hours were permitted for inauguration weekend. Nightclub owner Ian Hilton procured late-night hours for the bars and restaurants he owns with his brother, Eric \u2014 including Marvin and the Gibson \u2014 but he\u2019s keeping his expectations low. \u201cObviously in [2009], U Street blew up,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d He hosted parties for the last two inaugurations but said that he\u2019s had zero requests from groups looking to hold events in any of his bars. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t had anyone coming into town who\u2019s looking to have private space, and we haven\u2019t had any opposition people, groups of women, saying they wanted to meet up and organize,\u201d Hilton said. So, \u201cwe\u2019re treating it like business as usual.\u201d The inauguration is usually an excellent boost for Washington restaurants during the otherwise slow month of January. But not necessarily this year. The restaurant 701 is generally a hot spot, given its location on the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route, typically booked a month before Inauguration Day. But owner Ashok Bajaj said that evening reservations are still rolling in, and he\u2019s less certain that this inauguration will be as profitable for him as years past. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to tell right now what\u2019s going to happen, because all of these things started very late,\u201d Bajaj said. \u201cHopefully it will be as good.\u201d His private rooms are fully booked, including an Inauguration Day reception hosted by Republican Govs. Rick Scott of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. And yet: \u201cGenerally there is an excitement about the new administration,\u201d Bajaj said. \u201cEverything feels different this time around.\u201d (Claritza Jimenez,Danielle Kunitz,Julio Negron/The Washington Post) [ Don\u2019t gloat, don\u2019t pout: The Golden Rule of elite Washington inaugural parties ] For many hosts, the Trump inauguration will be like any other. The Embassy of Canada has hosted a parade viewing party ever since 1993, the first inauguration after it moved to its current Pennsylvania Avenue perch. A spokesman said the invitation-only event will be comparable to 2013\u2019s in prestige and size, with over 1,000 invited guests. But will they show up? Not only do Washingtonians seem uneager to celebrate the Trump administration, many want to pretend it\u2019s not even happening. Legetic noted a striking lack of bars and restaurants opening early for viewing parties this year. Instead, people are getting out of town. People are sheltering in place. People are sitting shiva. \u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of emails about cocktail parties or small get-togethers with friends,\u201d Legetic said. \u201cPeople are really kind of turning to people they know and love.\u201d There\u2019s one part of the city \u2014 a particular corridor of wealth and clubby conservatism \u2014 that might seem a little livelier, though. \u201cI feel like Georgetown might be real busy ,\u201d said Hilton. He\u2019s right. Franco Nuschese, owner of Cafe Milano, said his reservations for private parties were full \u201cimmediately after the election, as expected.\u201d \u201cIn a very humble way, we knew it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is usually the case.\u201d lifestyle ",

The plane carrying Guzman landed at MacArthur Airport in Islip, Long Island, Thursday evening after about a four-hour flight from Mexico. Mexico\u2019s Foreign Relations Department announced Guzman was handed over to U.S. authorities for transportation to the U.S. on Thursday, the last day of President Obama\u2019s administration and a day before Donald Trump is to be inaugurated. Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman arrived at New York\u2019s MacArthur Airport on Jan. 19, 2017. Close CBS News A senior law enforcement official said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration took custody of Guzman in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, and a plane carrying him departed for New York at 5:31 p.m. Eastern time. The officials agreed to give the information only if not quoted by name because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\u00a0 CBS News obtained exclusive photos of his arrival.\u00a0 The charges against him were developed by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the DEA. \u00a0 He was flown on a Mexican jet accompanied by DEA agents, medics and mechanics, law enforcement sources told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton. He was\u00a0expected to be transported under heavy security by caravan to Brooklyn from MacArthur Airport. He is due to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn Friday morning, Milton reported.\u00a0 \"El Chapo's\" son kidnapped New York is one of several U.S. jurisdictions where Guzman faces charges.\u00a0 The DOJ most recently indicted him on a new set of charges in Brooklyn in May 2016 on 16 drug related counts, CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid reported. Guzman will face trial in Brooklyn, the DOJ said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman while being extradited to the United States from Mexico on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017.&nbsp; Close Mexican Federal Prosecutor \u201cThe Justice Department extends its gratitude to the Government of Mexico for their extensive cooperation and assistance in securing the extradition of Guzman Loera to the United States,\u201d the DOJ said in a statement.\u00a0 The convicted Sinaloa cartel boss has been held most recently in a prison near the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez.\u00a0 The leader of the Sinaloa cartel has twice escaped from maximum-security prisons in Mexico, most recently in 2015.

    "text": "Rick Perry Forgets 'Department of Energy,' Which He Also Wanted to Eliminate 1:05 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170120014100if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/831973955631\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Perry, of course, is perhaps best remembered as a two-time presidential candidate for failing to recommend the elimination of the agency. During the 2012 campaign, he botched a debate question about the federal agencies that he believed should be abolished, famously saying \"oops\" when he could not remember the name of the Energy Department. The incident marked the end of his campaign. As energy secretary, Perry pledged Thursday to modernize the country's nuclear stockpile, promote and develop American energy \"in all forms,\" protect the agency's science and technology mission and carefully dispose of nuclear waste. Energy Secretary-designate, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Jan. 19, 2017, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Carolyn Kaster / AP He also promised to rely on scientific data when making decisions about climate change, which he said is occurring, in part, by man-made activity. \"I believe the climate is changing,\" Perry said. \"I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is caused by man-made activity. The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn't compromise economic growth, it affects the affordability of energy, or American jobs.\" Perry largely stuck to that script when grilled by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont about whether he would work to dramatically cut carbon emissions. Asked in a testy round of questioning whether he agreed with the scientific community that climate change is a global crisis, Perry repeatedly pointed to his record of balancing environmental and economic concerns in his home state. \"Don't you think that is a good thing?\" Perry said, referring to carbon cuts in Texas. \"What would be a better thing for you to say right now is that we have a global crisis and that the U.S. should help lead the world,\" Sanders said. Perry was introduced to the committee Thursday by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, both of whom championed the cabinet nominee for his \"all of the above\" approach to energy policy during his 14 year tenure as governor of the Lone Star State. Critics have called Perry unprepared and unqualified for the job, but Manchin expressed faith he would learn fast and succeed. \"No one gave us a manual when we became governor,\" said Manchin, who served as governor of West Virginia from 2005 to 2010. \"I have no doubt that Rick is not only going to be able to do the job; he's going to excel in the job.\" Perry faced tough questions from Democratic lawmakers on the committee about whether he'd protect the agency's scientific budget and preserve continuity at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), whose top officials have not yet been invited to continue their service beyond Jan. 20, according to Gizmodo .

(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) The departing head of the Transportation Security Administration counted the creation of a training academy for workers, the shortening of hours-long checkpoint lines for last summer's travel season and the addition of technology at checkpoints among his accomplishments during his year-and-a-half tenure. But TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger, who arrived at Brussels airport last March on the day of a fatal bombing that he called a \"visceral experience,\" said Thursday that developing better security for public areas of airports is perhaps the\u00a0biggest challenge facing governments and the industry. \"It's a really important mission,\" Neffenger told USA TODAY.\u00a0\u201cI really like missions that matter.\u00a0I think a big surprise is how much I enjoyed the job.\" Neffenger, who led the agency best known for airport security screening since July 2015, leaves Friday as President Obama\u2019s administration ends. President-elect Donald Trump has chosen a secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine Corps general John Kelly, but not yet a new TSA chief. Homeland nominee backs enhanced scrutiny of travelers overseas TSA, an agency with 60,000 workers,\u00a0can be a controversial assignment because of high-profile complaints about long checkpoint lines or how officers treat travelers in line. Neffenger arrived after a leaked inspector general\u2019s report revealed that TSA officers missed 67 of 70 mock explosives and weapons in bags during testing. \u201cIt really knocked down public confidence in our ability to do the job,\" Neffenger said. \u201cThat gives you a chance to take a hard look at how you do your job.\" After taking office, he ordered refresher training for all TSA workers after the critical report. He created the TSA Academy, which opened in January 2015\u00a0in Glynco, Ga., to train all workers. Neffenger had spent 34 years in the Coast Guard where he was deputy national incident commander for the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. He departs to widespread praise from the travel industry. \u201cThe hallmark of his tenure has been a vision to increase security while optimizing the travel experience, a strong level of collaboration and an unprecedented attitude of positive problem-solving with stakeholders,\u201d said Nicholas Calio, CEO of Airlines for America, a trade group that represents most of the largest carriers. A serious test for Neffenger came a year ago\u00a0when checkpoint lines delayed passengers for hours at the largest airports from a confluence of more travelers, a reduction of 5,800 TSA officers since 2011 and tighter security after the inspector general\u2019s report. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t meet peak demands at the top 30 airports,\" Neffenger said. American Airlines said 70,000 passengers missed flights during the first five months of last year. Airport officials in New York and Atlanta threatened to hire private screeners. TSA boasts of shortened airport lines for summer The response that Calio praised included TSA asking Congress to shift $62 million to hire 1,368 more officers and move 1,865 part-timers to full-time positions. Airlines and airports contributed 600 workers for non-security duties at checkpoints such as replacing bins. \u201cThankfully, his quick actions to address the problem averted what could have been a major economic and security catastrophe,\u201d said Roger Dow, CEO of U.S. Travel Association. \u201cMr. Neffenger's advocacy for redirected resources, as well as his willingness to collaborate across agencies and with the private sector on smart solutions to congestion at TSA checkpoints, swiftly cut down wait times and instituted enduring improvements to the security process.\u201d By Labor Day, about 98% of fliers waited 30 minutes or less for screening, and 92% waited less than 15 minutes. The seven busiest airports clocked wait times averaging less than 10 minutes. \"While at the helm of the TSA, Administrator Neffenger ushered in a new era of efficiency and collaboration that has strengthened aviation security,\" said Kevin Burke, CEO of Airports Council International-North America, which represents 95% of U.S. and Canadian airports. TSA finds record 3,391 guns at checkpoints in 2016 Despite the shorter lines, TSA officers caught a record 3,391 guns at checkpoints, 83% of which were loaded. TSA screened 738 million travelers last year, or more than 2 million per day. One way Neffenger helped shorten checkpoint lines was by encouraging the installation of automated lanes that were already in use in London and Amsterdam. With 60 automated lines nationwide, which airlines and airports have bought and then given to TSA, the equipment allows five travelers to place\u00a0carry-on bags in bins at the same time, so faster people can move around slower ones. The bins are shuttled through screening machines automatically, like a cafeteria conveyor. Since Delta Air Lines installed the first two lanes in Atlanta in May, there are now 26 automated lanes at airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Newark. Another 20 to 30 lanes are expected by March, and then TSA will evaluate how they are working before further expansion. The lanes are a result from an innovation task force of TSA working with airlines and airports to develop new technology. Some of the ideas that the group is studying include rapidly checking fingerprints or iris scans for identification or less-intrusive scanning equipment for people and bags. \u201cWe want to move at the speed of threat, not at the speed of obsolescence,\" Neffenger said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in entrepreneurial government.\" Fatal bombings last year at Brussels airport in March and at Istanbul airport in June served as a reminder of the vulnerability of huge crowds in open areas. The challenge at airports is thorny because moving TSA checkpoints to airport doors would push crowds outdoors, where they might be easier targets. But local governments are often unable to provide enough police to patrol entire airports. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think differently about public areas,\" Neffenger said. \"You can\u2019t just say you\u2019re on your own. There is a very real concern.\" TSA has held two meetings called security summits since November and plans more with law enforcement officials, airlines, airports and unions to discuss how to better protect public areas. \u201cSadly there\u2019s no silver-bullet answer for public areas,\u201d Neffenger said. \u201cBut I will say that is going to be one of the biggest challenges for the foreseeable future: How do you protect big, open places where people gather?\u201d ",

Christian Torres/AP Mexico has extradited to the United States its most notorious drug trafficker, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera, according to statements from officials of both countries. A statement by the U.S. Justice Department says Guzman faces six separate indictments around the country for crimes \"in connection with his leadership of the Mexican organized crime syndicate known as the Sinaloa Cartel.\" Charges against Guzman in the U.S. include murder, drug trafficking and money-laundering. Guzman is both reviled and storied among Mexicans. In his home region in northwest Mexico, some see him as a success story from a poor background. More widely, he is seen as a symbol of the ruthless drug trade that has killed tens of thousands of Mexicans and helped empower corrupt police and politicians. ",

Trump inaugural Brendan Smialowski / Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump and wife Melania look at the Abraham Lincoln statue as they arrive for a welcome celebration on Jan. 19, 2017, at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. President-elect Donald Trump and wife Melania look at the Abraham Lincoln statue as they arrive for a welcome celebration on Jan. 19, 2017, at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. (Brendan Smialowski / Getty Images) John Kass Contact Reporter I really wouldn't want Donald Trump as my next door neighbor. He's too loud, too showy and aggressively vulgar. And I just know that he'd look over the fence at my rusty charcoal grills, make that frowning Trump face of his and say: \"Disastah.\" Then again, if Hillary and Bill Clinton had moved in on the other side of us, I'd be the one requiring psychiatric care before fleeing to Canada, Belize, or maybe New Zealand to become a trout fishing hermit. At least, that's how I feel about it, not thrilled about Trump but horrified at what could have been the alternative. Many feel this way. And many think the exact opposite. But Trump wasn't elected to be your neighbor, or mine. He wasn't elected to give us hugs. And by the time some of you read this, he'll have been sworn in as president of the United States. So what should we expect of a President Trump? A trade war with China, that huge wall he promised to build along our Mexican border, more mud wrestling with the media and CIA, change within bankrupt big city school systems, a federalized street war on crime? He was elected, and legitimately so, to secure the borders and build the wall, to repeal Obamacare, and bring work and jobs to the American people. (Tribune news services) If he doesn't begin the wall and bring the jobs, he's out in four years. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare quickly, but that's not smart politics. Smart politics would be to allow health premiums to continue rising, allowing pain to grow among voters so they join Republicans in blaming Democrats, and then change it. But he's not much of a politician. Trump was also elected to attack the status quo and that moist hive of courtiers in and around Washington that feed in the trough of big government and Wall Street. It's what was attractive about him. But will he do that, or has he already been co-opted? Over the past few days, there have been enough Goldman Sachs types moving into his administration that it's now being called Trump's Goldman Sachs cabinet. Years ago, before the economy imploded and Goldman Sachs walked, such people were called \"Masters of the Universe.\" I don't know what they're called now, except perhaps, Mr. Secretary. But I'm reminded of what some wise guys told me at Gene & Georgetti after an election in Chicago. They weren't bankers and they wore too much gold but they understood politics. A guy said: When they're in, we're in. And when they're out, we're in. We're always in. It is how power politics works. If you don't like it, well, you can always play video games or watch \"Tiny Houses\" on HGTV. Even members of the so-called Never Trump crowd are crawling forward now, on their knees, begging favor. It's all preamble. We haven't seen him govern. So we don't know what he'll do. One thing I hope the American people guard against is believing in a president, or any senator or congressman. But of course my hopes will be dashed. Sometimes you can see the tears in their eyes of the true believers. We saw it with President Obama. We'll see it with President Trump. They invest, deeply, emotionally, and for good cause. It's not some game for them. They're hurting and they need help and that's when politicians grab them. Partisans aren't the only true believers. There are many in the media, childlike in their devotion one day, searching for heretics to burn the next. Oddly enough though, presidents are not gods. I stopped believing in politicians years ago, after too many broken promises and lizardy looks. If we should believe in anything in government it's the Constitution, and not as some malleable document to fit our whims of the moment, but as a guide to guard our liberty, especially in times of uncertainty. And right now, we're in one of those times. What we do know about Trump is that he's done a lot of talking, and much of it has been angry, and that combative style will wear thin. But all presidents talk a great game as they move into the White House. Until they actually begin governing, we just don't know. So what will President Trump do? Is it the economy, stupid? That was a winning line of another administration years ago. People want to work again, they want a raise, they want their children to move out of the basement and get jobs of their own. An old-time newspaper guy told me years ago that presidential elections have nothing to do with great ideas. Instead, he said, it's all about the wallets. I didn't appreciate it then. I do now. If Trump can cut those federal regulations to free business and capital to invest, the economy will grow. The economy has limped along at a pathetic annual 1.9 percent growth rate for years. People vote their wallets. Will he build his huge wall along the Mexican border? He says he will. If you take the angry rhetoric out of it, a nation without borders isn't much of a nation. Trump will take the oath and push one way, and Congress and the courts will push in other directions, and voters will be pushing and pulling too. It's something we've been doing in America for more than 200 years. It's how Americans make a nation.

Immigrants lead hundreds protesting against President-elect Donald Trump in Los Angeles last week. (Mike Nelson / European Pressphoto Agency) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Los Angeles Times Aides are clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to take the first steps toward transforming the immigration system as soon as he takes office Friday, fulfilling a major campaign pledge while deepening the fears of immigration advocates about what\u2019s to come. Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally. In their place, expect to see images on the evening news of workplace raids as Trump sends a message that he is wasting no time on his promised crackdown. In addition to the high-profile raids, Trump will also widen the range of people singled out for deportation, focusing on those with criminal convictions, and he could move immediately to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the U.S., according to interviews with immigration advocates and with people familiar with his plans. He may also limit who can come into the country as a security measure, making good on a sweeping vow to stop immigrants \u201cfrom any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.\u201d \u201cWe need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system, and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community,\u201d Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday. Other changes will unfold more slowly but are designed to have wide-ranging effects. People who have committed even minor crimes are expected to be deported, along with about 800,000 people who were ordered removed but may still be in the U.S. Donald Trump . \u201cIf this individual came down here to... From her stall\u00a0featuring regional delicacies \u2014 chile-infused dried grasshoppers, juicy white worms from the maguey plant and handmade chocolates, among other edible fare \u2014 63-year-old Eufenia Hernandez issued a challenge to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump . \u201cIf this individual came down here to... (Patrick J. McDonnell) More immigration agents will be sent to local jails to look for violators, prosecutions of immigration violations will increase, and fewer people will be eligible to request protection in the U.S. as the definition of what constitutes a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning home probably will be narrowed. Taken together, the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced, which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U.S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other big-ticket plans, such as replacing Obamacare, Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president\u2019s wide legal authority to control borders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to move very quickly on the border,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday, saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge \u2014 building a wall along the border with Mexico. Next year\u2019s Homeland Security budget includes about $175 million set aside for upgrading Border Patrol buildings and adding new equipment, which along with other funds could be diverted quickly to start construction on a wall while Congress considers proposals to increase funding. Trump\u2019s transition team has planned a \u201cvery robust few weeks\u201d of executive actions on immigration, energy policy, crime and combating terrorism, Spicer told reporters Wednesday. He said Trump will sign \u201cfour or five\u201d executive orders within hours of taking the oath of office Friday and plans additional actions Monday. With a stroke of his pen, Trump could also end Obama\u2019s move to protect from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. More than 740,000 people subjected themselves to a background check and received two-year work permits under that program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. If the program is canceled, those permits could be allowed to expire during Trump\u2019s first two years in office. Obama vowed to fight any effort by the incoming administration to track down and deport those who applied for protection under the program. (Tribune news services) The president said Wednesday during his final news conference that he plans to keep a low profile right after he leaves the White House, but that he will speak out if he sees evidence of \u201cefforts to round up kids who have grown up here and who are, for all intents and purposes, American kids.\u201d Trump has already hinted he will work with the Republican-led Congress to revamp the work visa system, reduce the flow of legal immigration and revive a proposal, formerly called the Dream Act , that would give some form of legal status to those immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children. In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, Trump said he would be \u201cworking on a plan\u201d over the next few months that could help some people stay in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan that\u2019s going to be very firm, but it\u2019s going to be a lot of heart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have great people coming into our country, people that love our country.\u201d Nevertheless, advocates for immigrants expect to see Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raid workplaces to detain people in the U.S. illegally, and are preparing to counsel children who have seen their fathers or mothers handcuffed and driven away to an immigration detention center. \u201cTrump and his team have demagogued immigrants from Day One on his campaign, and we are bracing for the worst,\u201d said Frank Sharry, head of America\u2019s Voice, an immigration advocacy group. In a Gallup survey this month, 41% of Americans were satisfied with the current level of immigration, a higher percentage than at any time since Gallup began tracking the issue in 2001. Amid the contentious debate over the issue in the last year, the percentage of people wanting less immigration fell to just 36%. They\u2019re part of a majority, 53%, that are dissatisfied on the issue, though some in that group want to see more immigration or for levels to remain the same. The Obama administration limited deportations to recent arrivals, repeat immigration violators and people with multiple criminal convictions. If Trump sweeps away those restrictions, many of them enshrined in a November 2014 memo from outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson , immigration agents will be free to begin deporting more people. They could quickly boost removals by 75%, to levels last seen in 2012 at the end of Obama\u2019s first term, when more than 400,000 people were deported. Last year, the Obama administration deported 235,000 people. ",

Advertisement Continue reading the main story There has never been a president crossing over so directly from the pop-culture world as Mr. Trump, who remains an executive producer of \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d and has cultivated big names in Hollywood for decades (even making a \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d cameo). Yet those big names are shunning his inauguration, including Thursday\u2019s event, unlike the Lincoln Memorial concert in 2009 for Barack Obama that featured Beyonc\u00e9 and other stars. The artists who are showing up are reflective of the cross-section of the United States that buoyed Mr. Trump to victory in November, while belying the opulence he is known for. The concert \u2014 the \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration\u201d \u2014 will have a distinct country feel to it, with performances by Toby Keith, the biggest act on the bill, and Lee Greenwood, best known for \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s walk-on song during the campaign. Also on the bill are Sam Moore, one half of the soul duo Sam & Dave, and 3 Doors Down, an alternative rock band that hasn\u2019t made the Billboard Top 10 chart since 2003. The Piano Guys, a group that includes one pianist and one cellist, are likely to regale the audience with spirited and eclectic covers of pop songs. Kenny and Katherine Dunham decided to make the four-hour drive from Kinston, N.C., after hearing that Representative John Lewis of Georgia would boycott Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. The Dunhams were sitting on a blanket without a ticket, and neither seemed fazed by the lack of top-flight entertainers. (Visitors without tickets were able to view the show on the National Mall; those with tickets had seats near the concert stage.) \u201cI think if they don\u2019t want to perform, they shouldn\u2019t perform,\u201d Mr. Dunham, 60, said. \u201cBut at the same time, my understanding is they weren\u2019t asked to. Toby Keith is going to perform. Lee Greenwood is going to perform.\u201d His wife of 19 years agreed. Photo There was plenty for sale. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that they chose not to perform, like Jennifer Holliday,\u201d Ms. Dunham added. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s an honor to be here in our capital.\u201d Lines to get into the show began forming in the morning. About 5,000 tickets were available, and the crowd by the memorial and on the mall was expected to be smaller than the hundreds of thousands of people who turned out for the preinaugural concert in 2009. That celebration for Mr. Obama also featured Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks, Jamie Foxx and Steve Carell. For Mr. Trump\u2019s concert, the highest-profile actor scheduled to appear is Jon Voight. Along the streets leading to the memorial, people pulled wagons full of homemade Trump merchandise, including Make America Great Again hats and Trump scarves.

The impact of the viral video on TMZ.com was immediate and powerful on\u00a0the Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m-directed film. PETA calls for boycott of 'A Dog's Purpose' after disturbing video surfaces \"This is about as bad as it gets,\" says Jeff Bock, box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations.\u00a0\"No mistake about it, this is the worst thing to happen to a film a week before it hits theaters.\u00a0A Dog's Purpose was set up as the perfect family film, wrapped up in a message around people's love of\u00a0dogs. And this video\u00a0instantly sabotaged\u00a0everything the movie promotes.\" The dog Bailey in the film 'A Dog's Purpose.' \u00a0(Photo: Storyteller Distribution Co. and Walden Media, LLC) Even the film's voice star, Josh Gad, who recorded the\u00a0dog narration\u00a0in a sound studio and was\u00a0not on the film set,\u00a0said he was \"shaken and sad\" by the \"disturbing video.\"\u00a0The hand-held camera video\u00a0shows the German Shepherd, identified later as Hercules, during a water rescue scene standing nervously over\u00a0a pool with rapidly-churning water. Hercules resists, clawing\u00a0to stay out, while a set trainer appears to force the dog\u00a0into the water. The edited video then shows what appears to be a later scene of the paddling Hercules submerging in the pool as crew members yell\u00a0\"Cut it!\" and rush over to help. The American Humane Association, which monitors animal treatment on movie sets, immediately placed\u00a0the set safety representative on administrative leave Wednesday after being \"disturbed and concerned by the footage,\"\u00a0according to a statement released to USA TODAY. \"When the dog showed signs of resistance to jumping in the water, the scene should have been stopped,\" the statement read, adding\u00a0that an independent third party would conduct an investigation. I have been promised that a thorough investigation into this situation is underway and that any wrongdoing will be reported and punished. \u2014 lasse hallstrom (@HallstromLasse) January 19, 2017 Director Hallstr\u00f6m\u00a0tweeted that he \"did not witness\" the actions in the video which made him\u00a0\"very disturbed.\" \"I have been promised that a thorough investigation into this situation is underway and that any wrongdoing will be reported and punished,\" Hallstr\u00f6m\u00a0tweeted. \"We were all committed to providing a loving, respectful and safe environment for all the animals in the film.\" A Dog's Purpose's production company, the Steven Spielberg-founded Amblin Entertainment, attempted to quell the growing storm, releasing\u00a0a joint\u00a0statement late Wednesday with distributor Universal Studios saying it was continuing to conduct an investigation into the events around the \"edited footage.\" The statement made clear that Hercules \"is happy and healthy.\" There were \"several days of rehearsal of the water scenes to ensure Hercules was comfortable with all of the stunts,\" the statement read. \"On the day of the shoot,\u00a0\u202aHercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape so the Amblin production team did not proceed with filming that shot.\" Juliet Rylance and Bryce Gheisar play with the dog Bailey in 'A Dog\u0092's Purpose.' \u00a0(Photo: Joe Lederer,) Amblin said it was \"confident that great care and concern was shown for the German Shepherd Hercules, as well as for all of the other dogs\" in the film. But the fall-out looks to\u00a0be overwhelming for A Dog's Purpose. More than 20 petitions have sprung up on Change.org calling for a film boycott (an Australian petition has close to 10,000 signatures ) or further investigation. Bock says A Dog's Purpose\u00a0could have filled a movie market void for family films and opened as strong as $20 million at the box office. \"But now it's anyone's guess how this movie is going to do,\" says Bock. \"I've never seen anything like this so close to a movie's release. I don't know if audiences can get their head around all of this.\" 2817 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jEeLKx NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

The Mount Holly Police Department \"received more than 30 calls from various parts of the city and even neighboring communities\" about the noise on Tuesday evening, said Chief of Police Don Roper. \"People were saying they heard a very loud boom or explosion or loud bang, and some folks said it shook their houses and rattled the windows,\" Roper told ABC News today. \"It sounded like a bomb just went off outside our house,\" one caller said, according to 911 audio obtained by ABC's affiliate WSOC in Charlotte, North Carolina.

    "text": "advertisement US President Barack Obama departs the Brady Press Briefing Room after his last press conference as president at the White House in Washington on Jan. 18, 2017. Obama spoke about the incoming Trump Administration, as well as his commutation of Chelsea Manning. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA It was for President Obama a day of thank you calls, farewells, wrapping up loose ends \u2014 and business as usual. Obama began his last full day on the job Thursday the way he did some 2,920 times before \u2014 with the Daily Presidential Briefing. It was held in the usual location, which is the Oval Office. And, as is typical, Vice President Joe Biden was in attendance, according to a schedule released by the White House. The only other thing on Obama's official agenda was a last lunch as president with Biden in the private dining room. But while the rest of the First Family was bracing and preparing for the Friday departure from what's been their home for the last eight years, Obama still had a country to run. The White House released a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate underscoring that while his administration has transferred nearly 200 detainees from the facility at Guantanamo Bay, 41 remain. He commuted the sentences of 330 prisoners. Picture frames that once displayed photographs of President Barack Obama now sit empty in the West Wing of the White House in Washington, on Jan. 19, 2017. Jim Lo Scalzo / EPA President Obama's final call with a foreign leader was with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, fitting, as they've spent the last eight years together as world leaders dealing with the financial crisis, the rise of ISIS and the new nationalist movement sweeping the world. Obama called Merkel a \"strong, courageous, and steady\" leader and \"acknowledged a \"personal friendship\" and that they've forged a \"deeper partnership between Germany and the United States\". In a break from usual protocol, First Lady Michelle Obama joined the call as did Merkel's husband, Professor Joachim Sauer. Related: Obama in Letter to America: 'You Made Me a Better Man' \"We know he will be spending a lot of time reviewing clemency cases and signing clemency documents,\" Terry Sullivan of the White House Transition Project told NBC News. \"Then there will probably be some administrative things he has to do.\" The average work day of a U.S. President is 14 hours a day, seven days a week, Sullivan said. And up to a quarter of that day is spent \"taking care of presidential clerkships.\" \"That means signing a lot of documents,\" Sullivan said. \"It's a vast government. There are lots of things that a president has to review and sign off on.\" What else will Obama be doing? \"My guess is he will spend a fair amount of time calling important people in his administration and thanking them for their service,\" Sullivan said. \"He'll probably be calling some members of the Senate to encourage them and to tell them they can count on him to continue fighting for things important to his legacy. That's part of what a leader does.\" The White House press staff office of the West Wing of the White House in Washington, on Jan. 19, 2017. Only a skeleton staff remained at the White House on Thursday, creating an eerily quiet feeling in the normally bustling West Wing. Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP White House aides told NBC News that Obama has also been calling some key foreign leaders. One thing Obama is not likely to be doing is doing any serious packing, Sullivan said. \"He's not boxing stuff up,\" he said. \"He's still the leader of the free world.\" The contents of the Oval Office will be packed up by workers from the National Archives. Movers will handle the rest while Obama is handing over the reins to Trump at the inauguration on Friday. But in recent days, Obama has personally packed up some personal items that will travel with him to his new digs some two miles away in Washington, D.C., aides say. Already the White House feels emptier. Many staffers are gone and most of the photos of Obama, his family and staff that lined the West Wing walls have been taken down as workers prepare for the arrival of Donald Trump. The First Family will say thanks and farewell to the White House staff at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. Two hours later, they will depart via the North Portico and head by limousine to the Capitol. \"It's a nostalgic day,\" said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College. \"The only thing that upsets this routine is friction between incoming and outgoing presidents.\" For example, Franklin Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover barely spoke to each other. Things were also tense between Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. And George H.W. Bush was miffed when the Clintons showed up late for the traditional pre-Inaugural coffee, Maney said. Obama, however, has gone to great lengths to smooth the transfer of power to Trump, a man who until recently publicly questioned whether the president was even an American. \"What happens tomorrow will be very interesting, \" Sullivan said.

    "text": "Trump\u2019s 10 Foreign Deals With Those Close to Power By Derek Kravitz and Al Shaw, ProPublica, and John Kelly, USA TODAY Incoming President Donald Trump\u2019s business deals span the globe. Trump-branded skyscrapers, golf courses and hotels stretch from Dubai to Azerbaijan to the Philippines. Government ethics experts have strongly criticized Trump\u2019s refusal to divest ownership of any of his businesses. But they point to his ongoing foreign deals with those connected to power as the most troubling. Trump\u2019s Byzantine business structures and his lack of disclosures \u2013 he has released neither his tax returns nor details of his foreign deals \u2013 make it difficult to get a full picture of the incoming president\u2019s business relationships. But using government records, Trump\u2019s own local disclosures and press reports, we\u2019ve identified 10 Trump deals in which he has partnered with power players abroad. We asked the Trump Organization about each of these deals. We\u2019ve included its responses. 1 One of Trump\u2019s partners for his Mumbai tower is a top official with India\u2019s ruling political party Lodha Group, India's largest real-estate developer, licensed Trump\u2019s name in 2011 for the Trump Tower Mumbai, a 75-story luxury apartment complex in the southern part of Mumbai. Lodha Group's chairman and founder, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, is a vice president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a member of the legislative assembly representing southern Mumbai .(Continued dealings with state-owned enterprises or foreign leaders may violate the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause.)In a statement , the Trump Organization said its partnership with the Lodha Group would continue: The \u201cdevelopments will proceed as planned. They will remain under the Trump brand.\u201d 2 Among Trump\u2019s other partners in India are two brothers who are big players in the country\u2019s progressive political party The Trump Towers Pune is a branding partnership started in 2012 with Panchshil Realty and its co-founders, brothers Atul and Sagar Chordia. The two 23-story towers in Pune, an industrial city in western India, were completed in 2015.The brothers are active in the Nationalist Congress Party and their family business has partnered with prominent members of the party. Trump received between $100,000 and $1 million in royalties in 2015 from the project, according to his federal financial disclosures. He received no royalties from the project in 2016.The Trump Organization was \"involved quite keenly\" in the project and given monthly progress reports during construction, the Times of India reported. The project was being investigated by police and the state government last fall for building permit issues. The status of that investigation isn\u2019t clear. Referring to its work in India generally, the Trump Organization said , \u201cWe are incredibly proud of the projects in Pune and Mumbai.\u201d 3 Another one of Trump\u2019s India partners is the brother-in-law of a leader of India\u2019s ruling political party India\u2019s largest private-equity firm, IREO, licensed Trump\u2019s name in April 2016 for an office tower in the city of Gurgaon. IREO\u2019s vice chairman and managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the brother-in-law of Sudhanshu Mittal, one of the leaders of India\u2019s ruling BJP. In 2010, the offices of IREO and Mittal were raided as part of a government probe into offshore tax havens; Mittal said the inquiry was politically motivated . 4&5 Trump\u2019s Indonesian partner started his own political party and plans to run for president Trump partnered with Indonesian billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo on management and branding deals for a resort and residential complex in Bali and a 1,700-acre resort in West Java. Hary Tanoe, as he\u2019s known locally, has his sights set on becoming Indonesia\u2019s president. He launched his own political party in 2015, proclaiming he was \u201cready to fix Indonesia so that it can be better.\u201d Hary has been active in opposition parties against President Joko Widodo. He lost a vice presidential bid in 2014. As the New York Times has detailed, Hary has introduced Trump to several prominent Indonesian politicians, including the deputy speaker of the country\u2019s parliament and another who is at the center of a corruption scandal. Trump\u2019s deals with Hary also involve Chinese and South Korean state-controlled companies. Sinosure, a Chinese state company, is putting $425 million into the West Java project. The funding is for a theme park, which will be built by a Chinese state-owned company. Part of the development will also be a \"smart city,\u201d which will be funded in part by a South Korean state-owned firm. 6 Trump\u2019s deal in the Philippines is with President Duterte\u2019s new U.S. trade envoy The Trump Tower at Century City in Manila is a $150 million, 57-story apartment building, which opened in November after years of delays. The developer of the Manila tower is Century City Properties Group, whose chairman, Jose E.B. Antonio, was named as an informal, unpaid economic envoy to the U.S. by President Rodrigo Duterte shortly before Election Day. Antonio visited New York City\u2019s Trump Tower after the election, but he didn\u2019t meet with Trump. Antonio told Bloomberg that he viewed his role as helping \u201cenlarge the relationship between the two countries.\u201d He said his business ties to Trump would be an \u201casset.\u201d \u201cCentury City officials said in a statement that Antonio will serve as a liaison between U.S. and Philippines companies, and not on behalf of the respective countries\u2019 governments. They also said no new deals are being brokered. 7 Trump\u2019s Dubai partner works closely with the Emirati government In 2013, Trump began working with billionaire developer Hussain Ali Sajwani. Among their projects: the 18-hole Trump International Golf Club billed in promotional materials as the \u201cBeverly Hills of Dubai\u201d and branding for a $6 billion development in Dubai, with villas selling for as much as $9.5 million each. A second golf course, designed by Tiger Woods and named the Trump World Golf Club Dubai, is set for completion in 2018 . Sajwani has engaged in several controversial land deals with senior government officials in the United Arab Emirates. The Emirati government owns most of the land in Dubai and land sales are a key source of revenue. During Trump\u2019s recent press conference, he said Sajwani had offered him $2 billion worth of development deals in Dubai, which Trump turned down. Officials at Sajwani\u2019s firm, DAMAC Properties, confirmed such an offer had been made. 8 A partner of Trump\u2019s in Istanbul is an (uneasy) ally of Turkish President Erdo\u011fan. Trump Towers Istanbul opened in 2012 after a branding deal between Trump and Turkey\u2019s largest media magnate, Ayd\u0131n Do\u011fan. Dogan and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have clashed at times. In 2009, Do\u011fan\u2019s company was fined $2.5 billion in a tax case, and Erdo\u011fan called for his supporters to boycott the company\u2019s television stations and newspapers. But they\u2019ve recently enjoyed a detente. The Turkish government praised Do\u011fan\u2019s media group for helping Erdo\u011fan broadcast a message to the Turkish people during last year\u2019s failed military coup. Trump worked on the tower deal with Do\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law Mehmet Ali Yal\u00e7\u0131nda\u011f. In a post-Election Day phone call with Erdo\u011fan , Trump reportedly referred to Yal\u00e7\u0131nda\u011f as a \u201cclose friend\u201d and told Erdo\u011fan that Yal\u00e7\u0131nda\u011f is \u201cyour great admirer.\u201d 9 Trump\u2019s Argentina partner is the brother-in-law of the country\u2019s finance minister Uruguay\u2019s Trump Tower Punta del Este, the only property in South America to bear Trump\u2019s name, is part of a licensing deal between Trump and Argentina-based YY Development. Trump earned between $100,000 and $1 million in royalties from the deal in 2015 and 2016, according to his financial disclosures. One of the heads of YY Development acted as a \u201cgo-between\u201d between the government of Argentine President Mauricio Macri and Trump after his Election Day win , according to Argentine press accounts. Another partner on the deal is the brother-in-law of Argentina\u2019s newly-appointed minister of finance . A proposed deal between YY Development and Trump for another Trump-branded tower in Buenos Aires has been cancelled, Trump officials say, despite the Argentine developers\u2019 public pronouncements following the election that a deal was imminent 10 Trump has profited from a century-long land lease with the government of St. Vincent. Canouan, a small island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, has been described by Businessweek as the place \" where the billionaires go to get away from the millionaires .\" Luxury development began in 1994, when a company called Canouan Resorts Development signed a 99-year lease with the country's government to develop 1,200 acres on the island. In 2003, Trump partnered with the company to operate a resort casino, called Trump Club Privee, and to develop 25 villas and a championship golf course designed by professional golfer Jim Fazio. Trump earned $3 million from Canouan in 2016, from land sales, according to his federal financial disclosure. But the affiliated casino and resort faltered, and the golf course is no longer branded with Trump\u2019s name. Canouan Resorts Development did not respond to requests for comment.

Dastagir , USA TODAY Published 3:50 p.m. ET Jan. 19, 2017 | Updated 4 minutes ago CLOSE x Share The day after Trump's inauguration, thousands of women have organized to march on Washington in support of women's rights and affordable healthcare. USA TODAY NETWORK The women's movement prepares for one of its most challenging chapters. A woman protests Donald Trump in front of Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 10, 2016. (Photo: Kena Betancur, AFP/Getty Images) 1699 CONNECT TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 37 COMMENTEMAILMORE For the American women who believed the future was imminently female, Donald Trump's inauguration Friday marks the end of mourning and the beginning of resistance. One day later, after the transfer of power is complete, more than 200,000 women and men are expected to unite\u00a0for the Women's March on Washington, offering the nation its first glimpse into what feminism will look like under President Trump. \"A lot of women are going to literally die because of this administration,\" Jaclyn Friedman, a feminist activist and co-editor of Yes Means Yes: Visions of Sexual Power and a World Without Rape, said about threats to the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0Trump and Republicans want to repeal it, while feminists fight to preserve the law that made it impossible for women to be denied coverage because of their gender. It is one of many battles ahead in what promises to be another challenging chapter\u00a0for the women's movement. If America had elected its first female president, feminists say they would have continued to fight deeply entrenched sexism. But under Trump, who won the presidency\u00a0after accusations of serial sexual assault and bragging he groped women's genitals,\u00a0they worry about a more permissible culture of misogyny, as well as the\u00a0potential loss of federal protections. Women's advocates say now more than ever, feminism needs to stop being seen as a dispensable fad\u00a0and start being understood as fundamental to democracy. The stakes are high Trump has vowed to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, which guarantees women the right to have an abortion, even though\u00a0seven-in-10 Americans support upholding the decision. Congressional Republicans are committed to defunding Planned Parenthood, which provides critical health services to women, many of them low-income , even though in 2015 the public by a wide margin said any congressional budget agreement must maintain funding for the group. Trump's pick for secretary of the Labor Department, Andrew Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, which runs Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, has vocally opposed\u00a0raising the minimum wage. \u00a0According to the National Women's Law Center, nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. are women. Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, offered few details during her Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday on how she would combat campus rape .\u00a0She said it would be \"premature\" to commit to upholding the Obama administration's Title IX guidance, which requires colleges and universities to be more responsible for cracking down on sexual assaults. The scope of these concerns is broad, because feminism is multifaceted. The movement embodies everything from\u00a0human rights to reproductive rights to voting rights to ending sexual violence.\u00a0It's wage equality and economic mobility and fair representation.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2013 Nearly 1,000 Transportation Security Administration officers will help screen visitors Friday for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The Secret Service oversees security for the event, but TSA officers who are typically seen at airport checkpoints will be screening visitors to inaugural events around town. The TSA officers who volunteered for the national security force poured into the city from 50 airports\u00a0so that no single airport was left understaffed. \u201cIt\u2019s always impressive to see how you handle these very large crowds of people and still give people access,\" TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger told USA TODAY on Thursday. About 28,000 federal, state and local security officials will be working directly or indirectly on the inauguration, according to Jeh Johnson, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA. About 700,000 to 900,000 people are expected in the National Mall area on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, he said. \u201cSecurity will be enormous,\u201d Johnson said Thursday on Morning Joe\u00a0on MSNBC. His biggest concern is a lone-wolf terrorist or a vehicle loaded with explosives, such as the December truck attack in Berlin and the July truck attack in Nice, France. Roads surrounding the U.S. Capitol and the White House will be closed, with dump trucks and heavily armored vehicles blocking access. \u201cWe see no specific credible threat directed against the inauguration,\u201d Johnson said. VIDEO: Take an #InsideLook at how TSA supports the @SecretService with security preparations for #InaugurationDay : https://t.co/TRpRDBqOYR \u2014 TSA (@TSA) January 19, 2017 TSA officers will screen spectators for the inauguration along the National Mall and at the Capitol, along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route to the White House\u00a0and at the Pentagon. Johnson and Neffenger met with security officials Thursday morning near Dulles airport. Then Johnson and Neffenger visited the Capitol and walked the parade route to inspect security provisions in place. When asked whether\u00a0they were ready, Neffenger told USA TODAY, \"Absolutely.\" Besides guns and explosives, items prohibited by the Secret Service include: bags larger than 18 inches by 13 inches by 7 inches, coolers, laser pointers and aerosols. Washington Reagan National Airport will have more TSA officers to handle the influx of travelers. More than a dozen teams with bomb-sniffing dogs were added to the airport\u2019s screening to ease the glut of departures after the inauguration. Once a trained dog has sniffed a line of travelers in regular screening lines, they are eligible for expedited screening such as\u00a0the Precheck program. That status allows travelers to keep on their shoes and light jackets\u00a0and to leave laptops and small containers of fluids in carry-on bags. \u201cIt\u2019s actually on the outbound side that it gets more crowded,\" Neffenger said. \"People kind of stagger in, and they all leave at once.\" Additional teams of armed officers, called Visible Intermodal Protection and Response (VIPR), will patrol at National, Washington Dulles and Baltimore-Washington airports, at Union Station for Amtrak and at subway stations.

    "text": "By Marc Fisher By Marc Fisher January 19 at 6:00 AM Follow @mffisher Ice skaters on the rink in Central Park in 2013. (Smita Sharma/For The Washington Post) From his picture window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park, Donald Trump could see the public ice rink that the city government had spent six years and $12 million trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to repair. Most people saw the shuttered rink as a maddening waste of public dollars. Trump saw an opportunity to lead. In 1986, Trump, then a brash newcomer in the New York real estate industry, offered to fix the rink in six months at his own expense. Trump\u2019s move was at once bold, magnanimous and biting. In the same letter in which he made his offer to New York Mayor Ed Koch, Trump reminded the mayor that the \u201cincompetence\u201d the city had demonstrated in the rink project had to be \u201cone of the great embarrassments of your administration.\u201d Trump got the job done two months ahead of schedule and $800,000 under budget. The city paid for the work \u2014 the mayor insisted on that \u2014 but Trump slapped his name all over the place and generated months of adoring press. For decades to follow, the story of how he swooped in like Superman to save the day became a bedrock foundation of the Trump mythos, his carefully polished narrative of the billionaire who led by smashing through rules and expectations. The man who now moves from his very own gilded skyscraper on Fifth Avenue to noticeably smaller and less lavish quarters in Northwest Washington is the most unusual leader Americans have ever elected to manage their nation. He is a salesman, not a diplomat; a master marketer, not a bureaucratic manager. He is an entrepreneur who has always thrived on controversy and confrontation, bucking up against the establishment types who often sneered at him. As president, Trump seems eager to lead in very much the same ways as he has through four decades as frontman for his personal brand. America, he promised in the campaign, will \u201cwin so much, you\u2019ll get tired of winning.\u201d Already, he has launched what he hopes will be a cavalcade of victories. Just three weeks after his November win, the president-elect reached into his box of finely honed tools and pulled out his favorites \u2014 surprise and showmanship \u2014 to craft a small triumph for workers at a Carrier plant in Indiana: 800 jobs now wouldn\u2019t be moved to Mexico. Critics contended that the number of workers involved was insignificant in a nation of more than 300 million people, but Trump accomplished just what he\u2019d achieved in the ice rink incident 30 years earlier: He burnished his reputation as a leader who makes deals happen, even if the process isn\u2019t pretty, even if egos and precedents get smashed. And Trump demonstrated that he intends to govern as much by anecdote as by principles or policies. Donald Trump, Mayor Ed Koch and Roy Cohn attend the Trump Tower opening in October 1983. (Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images) Trump brings to Washington a leadership style built on his father\u2019s success in the rough-and-tumble world of developing apartment buildings in New York\u2019s outer boroughs, and refined under the tutelage of Roy Cohn , the infamous Manhattan lawyer who taught young Donald that all publicity is good publicity and that victory comes only to those who fight back a hundred times harder than any hit they might absorb. Trump built a real estate empire that morphed into a casino gambling business, which largely failed, driving the struggling mogul to pivot into a period of leasing his name to all manner of luxury and not-so-fancy products. Through it all, Trump spent much of his time not on the finances of his initiatives or on their daily management, but rather on cultivating his own image as a playboy billionaire who was bluntly decisive, refreshingly impolitic and singularly devoted to all things Trump. He rewarded loyalty (he called himself \u201ca loyalty freak\u201d), summarily sacked those who showed him up, and won fame and sometimes fortune as he put himself center stage in all his enterprises. \u201cThe show is Trump and it is sold-out performances everywhere,\u201d he said in 1990, soon after he appeared on the cover of Playboy, brushing against a cover girl who eyed him adoringly. The show \u2014 Trump has often called himself a \u201cratings machine\u201d \u2014 is very much at odds with the private nature of the man, a loner who says he has few, if any, close friends, an insomniac who often leaves social events as quickly as possible, returning to his apartment to watch TV by himself through the small hours of the night. In public, though, Trump is all business and all show, blending the two in ways that have now shattered the boundary between politics and celebrity. Media assemble outside Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Taking Manhattan As he launched his career in real estate, Trump broke with his father, who had warned him against taking on debt or working in the tough market of Manhattan. Donald longed to reach for the next level and build in midtown, and he did it by creating a business that looked bigger, bolder and brasher than the competition. He led that business into the big time with tough, loud, showy tactics that he would hone through the decades, methods that became familiar to all Americans through the 2016 campaign and into the presidential transition. Trump led by creating an image of himself as a rich playboy with fabulous connections in media, politics and entertainment \u2014 and by parlaying that image into actual deals with the city\u2019s rich and powerful. He led by making competitors, government regulators and bankers believe he was farther along than he really was. And he led by neutralizing or even winning over his opponents by attacking, threatening, wooing and even hiring them. During his very first project, the rehab of New York\u2019s decrepit Commodore Hotel in the mid-1970s, Trump persuaded a New York Times reporter to write about him as \u201ca major New York builder,\u201d though he had never built a thing and had no financing. Trump needed top New York politicians\u2019 cooperation to get his hotel project underway, and so he hired Gov. Hugh Carey\u2019s chief fundraiser, who had key political connections. It didn\u2019t hurt that Trump and his father had donated more money to the governor\u2019s campaign than anyone but the candidate\u2019s brother. Trump wasn\u2019t shy about touting his ties to power. He took the head of New York\u2019s Port Authority, a major landowner in the city, to lunch and asked for his help. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last in your job very long if Governor Carey decided you weren\u2019t doing the right thing,\u201d Trump told Port Authority director Peter Goldmark, according to Goldmark. \u201cYou should know I have a lot of weight in Albany.\u201d Trump denied Goldmark\u2019s account, saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t talk that way.\u201d Similarly, in the push for the same project, Trump sought a tax exemption from a state authority created to build racially integrated housing. The agency\u2019s chairman, Richard Ravitch, had grown up in the real estate business; Trump\u2019s father had hired Ravitch\u2019s father\u2019s construction firm to build Trump\u2019s largest apartment complex. Now Donald met with Ravitch and told him, as Ravitch recalled, \u201cI want you to give me a tax exemption.\u201d Ravitch declined. Trump repeated the request, and when Ravitch declined again, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have you fired.\u201d Trump, in an interview last summer, denied that account and called Ravitch \u201ca highly overrated person.\u201d Trump wasn\u2019t done. When city politicians who were opposed to the tax incentive called a news conference outside the shuttered hotel, Trump showed up and threatened to abandon the project if the city didn\u2019t give him tax relief. Trump had prepared for the event by directing his workers to replace the clean boards over the once-grand hotel\u2019s windows with dirty scrap wood, dramatizing the state of the midtown eyesore. The theatrical flourish had the desired impact. Trump got the exemption. Trump speaks at a campaign event at in North Charleston, S.C., last February. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \u2018Truthful hyperbole\u2019 For four decades, Trump led his business empire through triumphs and disasters, through domination of the Atlantic City casino world and through six corporate bankruptcies, devoting his time and energy perhaps above all to his dealings with the news media. The \u201ckey to the way I promote is bravado,\u201d he wrote in his best-selling book, \u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts. . . . I call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201d In business and in the 2016 campaign, he alternately bashed reporters and privately treated them to praise and access. \u201cFrom a pure business point of view,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe benefits of being written about have far outweighed the drawbacks. . . . Even a critical story, which may be hurtful personally, can be very valuable to your business.\u201d Reporters who covered Trump through the years told stories of his abusive, epithet-packed phone calls, sometimes in the same day as his generous, complimentary offers of juicy scoops. His longtime construction executive Barbara Res said that \u201cDonald had a way of getting to print whatever he would say, even if it weren\u2019t necessarily the whole and honest truth. He managed to say what he would say, and people would write it, and then it would be the truth. That was the thing with him that they call the big lie. You say something enough times, it becomes the truth.\u201d Asked how he shaped his image by working the media, Trump flashed an impish smile, shrugged his shoulders and repeated his mantra that \u201call publicity is good publicity.\u201d Trump has refined the art of working the levers of public opinion to pressure those who would block his initiatives. In 1985, after he bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump broke with the traditions of the wealthy enclave by chopping down his hedges to give gawkers a clear view of his castle, inviting a raft of celebrities with the accompanying paparazzi, and opening the facility for wedding and event rentals. The town council, annoyed by the increased traffic and attention, tried to impose restrictions on street use and party attendance. Trump responded by sending council members classic movies about discrimination \u2014 \u201cGentleman\u2019s Agreement,\u201d about anti-Semitism, and \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner,\u201d about racism \u2014 to remind them and the public about how the town had long tolerated the exclusion of Jews and blacks from private clubs in Palm Beach. The effort to embarrass the politicians into easing restrictions on his club, which was open to all who could afford it, was successful. Measuring the brand He recognized early on that his primary talent lay in marketing his brand, more than in managing day-to-day operations. In 1988, when Jeffrey Breslow, the inventor of many successful board games, visited Trump to pitch him on a Monopoly-like game that would be named after him, the game developer was prepared to get down on the floor and demonstrate how \u201cTrump: The Game\u201d was played . But Trump had no interest in the details of the game. \u201cI like it \u2014 what\u2019s next?\u201d Trump said, and after the deal was negotiated, Trump volunteered to hold a press event at the plant where the product would be manufactured. His best value, he said, was in motivating the workers and winning media attention. Throughout his career, Trump has measured success by the reach and power of his reputation and image. All of his ventures, in gambling, sports, television and politics, were designed to spotlight the message that \u201cTrump\u201d means ambition, wealth and success. He always worked with a tiny inner circle of top executives \u2014 his campaign staff was about a tenth the size of Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2014 remaining loyal to those who played by his rules: No one steps out on their own, all credit goes to the boss, and the message to the public is that Trump \u2014 the man, not the corporation or its other executives \u2014 is the rainmaker. If Trump believes an executive has done something behind his back, he pounces: \u201cYou have to realize that people \u2014 sadly, sadly \u2014 are very vicious,\u201d he told an audience at a motivational seminar in 2005. \u201cWhen a person screws you, screw them back 15 times harder.\u201d He hires for loyalty but also to build a staff that looks the part \u2014 a factor he has often mentioned through the years, including during this winter\u2019s transition , when he would comment to aides about whether job candidates presented themselves in ways that would convince a TV audience that they were right for the job. But Trump\u2019s methods for picking people can also be more subtle. Throughout his career, he has hired people who had been obstacles to his projects, both to neutralize their opposition and take advantage of their knowledge. In 1989, when a New York real estate analyst Trump had never heard of went on a TV news show and opined that Trump had taken on too much debt, overpaid for properties and now faced a severe decline in his business empire, Trump filed suit against the man, Abe Wallach, alleging slander and defamation. But Trump then invited Wallach to see him and offered him a job as executive vice president for acquisitions and finance. Wallach accepted and stayed for 12 years. (Trump did not know through most of that period that Wallach had been convicted of at least two felonies before joining Trump\u2019s business, according to a spokesman for Trump.) Rival power centers In addition to defusing the opposition, Trump hires to create rival power centers. Many Republican leaders thought Trump would have to choose between Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and former Breitbart News chairman Stephen K. Bannon to set the tone for the leadership of his White House. But Trump hired both men \u2014 the establishment choice and the rogue outsider \u2014 and gave them equal billing in his hiring announcement. Through the years, Trump has similarly hired opposing voices, both to prevent any one faction of his operations from gaining too much power, and to put competing views in play to see which might prevail. From left, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Oracle CEO Safra Catz listen to Trump during a meeting on Dec. 14. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) When a group of Silicon Valley tech executives visited with Trump in December, he told them: \u201cYou\u2019ll call my people. You\u2019ll call me. It doesn\u2019t make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here.\u201d Building such uncertainty and unpredictability into his leadership and decision-making allows Trump to float possibilities, test ideas and remain antagonistic to the powers that be \u2014 all before he puts a decision into play. Add his infamous lack of impulse control \u2014 his predawn tweets, his thin-skinned reaction to criticism, his insulting comments about people he\u2019s already defeated \u2014 and a short attention span \u2014 he said he has no patience for reading reports or briefings \u2014 and the result is something not quite like any previous occupant of the White House. But will he even make 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW his regular work address? Trump has said he plans to continue his campaign-style rallies around the country through his presidency, and he wants to spend a good chunk of time where he\u2019s most comfortable, inside Trump Tower. If he follows his life\u2019s pattern, he will leave the day-to-day administration of the government to his top aides, much as Ronald Reagan did. But unlike Reagan, Trump is unlikely to stand aside as he puts his governing philosophy into play. He is demanding and impatient with his staff, and anything but shy about making his displeasure known. But he is not the boss Americans got to know on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d; his top executives say that in real life, he rarely fired anyone and was far from the cavalier brute he portrayed on TV. He listens well and takes advice, said Res and other top Trump staffers. But there was never any master plan, just as there was no organizational chart. There was just Trump at the center of all things \u2014 the definition of Trump being Trump. He scoffs at deep study and goes, instead, with his gut. He believes in his instincts. He believes he will naturally do the right thing. He believes, as he wrote in his book, \u201cThink Like a Billionaire,\u201d that \u201ca narcissist does not hear the naysayers. At the Trump Organization, I listen to people, but my vision is my vision.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

But one room has to be in impeccable shape: the Oval Office. Wondering about the Resolute Desk? President Obama\u2019s Oval Office includes the Resolute Desk, which was fashioned out of timbers from the British Royal Navy ship HMS Resolute. (White House Historical Association) A big question for history buffs is whether President Trump will use the Resolute Desk , which has been used by most presidents in one room or another since it was given to Rutherford B. Hayes by Queen Victoria in 1880. President Kennedy was the first to put it in the Oval Office; it\u2019s the desk little John-John is peeking from in the iconic photo. Most presidents since have kept it there, including Carter, Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. \u201cThat\u2019s the first thing the president wants to see,\u201d Walters said. \u201cThat first impression sends a message to the American people about what\u2019s important to this president.\u201d That means every choice may be scrutinized for hidden meaning. A minor hubbub arose when President Obama replaced a bust of Winston Churchill in the Oval Office \u00a0with a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Donald Trump has said he plans to bring back Britain\u2019s wartime prime minister. The GSA collaborates with the residence staff on this room. Some changeovers require more work than others. During Nixon\u2019s inauguration, electricians had to remove a bank of televisions installed by media-obsessed Lyndon Johnson. When Ford took office, he had Nixon\u2019s recording equipment and wires torn from within the walls. All furniture, draperies and artwork will be changed \u2014 if the new president chooses to change them. The rug with the presidential seal probably will remain, at least for awhile, because new ones take so long to make. Sometime before noon, a National Archives and Records Administration \u00a0crew will sweep through all offices to collect any remaining documents from the old administration, including those on computer hard drives. They also pick up gifts from foreign leaders that may be displayed in the residence. Wondering about the Resolute Desk?

(AP Photo/Doug Mills) Last-minute surprises By about 2:30 p.m., the inaugural parade has begun, and the chief usher is making sure everything is perfectly in order. This is often when the unexpected occurs, and the staff has to be ready. During George H.W. Bush\u2019s parade, his twin granddaughters Barbara and Jenna \u2014 who would later be White House residents themselves \u2014 became bored and wanted to enter the residence, Walters said. So the florist took them to her shop and gave them an impromptu class in floral arranging. Stock said that during Clinton\u2019s inaugural parade, the president felt bad for performers whose floats had broken down, so he invited them back to see his new house. They came the next day, along with thousands more people whom the gregarious president invited along the way, and the guest list swelled to 4,500 \u2014 triple the number the staff was originally expecting. Storeroom clerks had to scour the city for more hot chocolate to serve. 3:30 p.m.: Deadline Any time between 3:30 and 5 p.m., the new first family will return to a transformed White House. As they enter, usually through the South Portico, Chief Usher Reid will greet them and say for the first time, \u201cWelcome to your new home, Mr. President.\u201d Graphics by Aaron Steckelberg , Denise Lu and Cristina Rivero .

Steve Mnuchin, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, in Washington on Jan. 13. (Michael Reynolds / European Pressphoto Agency) Jim Puzzanghera Contact Reporter Steven Mnuchin, the Wall Street executive tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be the next Treasury secretary, faced some of the most blistering personal attacks of any Cabinet pick so far as Democrats accused him of foreclosing on the homes of thousands of struggling Americans while head\u00a0of a Pasadena bank, even as he helped\u00a0rich hedge fund clients shelter their wealth offshore. Mnuchin was on the defensive during a more than five-hour confirmation hearing Thursday at which it was also revealed he initially had failed to\u00a0disclose $95 million in real estate holdings and his position as director of a corporation in the Cayman Islands, a well-known tax haven. Democrats questioned how Mnuchin could be expected to crack down on tax-avoidance schemes he helped clients use\u00a0in the past. They also pressed him to ensure that Trump\u2019s foreign investments didn\u2019t compromise U.S. national security. Mnuchin said\u00a0he would look into Trump\u2019s foreign debt. The 54-year-old hedge fund manager and former Hollywood movie producer had barely settled into his seat at the Senate Finance Committee when the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, launched a nearly 15-minute fusillade of criticism.\u00a0 A major target throughout the hearing was Mnuchin\u2019s tenure as head of OneWest Bank, which Wyden said\u00a0\u201cchurned out foreclosures like Chinese factories churned out Trump suits and ties.\u201d Wyden's opening statement was so aggressive that Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) told\u00a0Wyden, \"I\u2019ve got a Valium pill you might want to take before the second round.\u201d The comment, delivered humorlessly,\u00a0sparked objections from Wyden and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). The exchange\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0the deep partisan divide over one of Trump's most controversial Cabinet picks. Republicans rallied to Mnuchin\u2019s defense, and there\u2019s no indication his confirmation is in jeopardy. If confirmed, Mnuchin would become a pivotal player in the Trump administration on the economy, trade, taxes, entitlements, housing policy, financial regulation and relations with China and other global economic powers.\u00a0 Mnuchin offered few policy details but was clear that producing economic growth of about 3% to 4% annually \u2014\u00a0significantly stronger than in recent years \u2014\u00a0was his main objective, and that cutting corporate taxes was the key. \u201cOur No. 1 priority from my standpoint is economic growth,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cI believe tax reform will be the first and most important part of that.\u201d He also told lawmakers that he supports current economic sanctions against Russia and would support hiring more Internal Revenue Service workers\u00a0in order to help boost government revenues. Mnuchin opened his testimony with a strong defense against charges leveled in recent days that OneWest, which he ran from 2009 to 2015, was a \u201cforeclosure machine.\u201d \u201cSince I was first nominated \u2026 I have been maligned as taking advantage of others\u2019 hardships in order to earn a buck,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d Mnuchin said OneWest tried to help homeowners avoid foreclosure but often was limited by federal regulations. \u201dMy experience confirmed that we must identify and eliminate unwise and burdensome policies which contribute to the disastrous outcomes that came in the wake of the financial crisis,\u201d Mnuchin said.\u00a0 In addition to supporting Trump\u2019s deregulatory push, Mnuchin committed to reducing taxes and \u201creviving trade policies that put the American worker first.\u201d\u00a0 He said Trump\u2019s trade plans do not include an \u201cacross-the-board 35% border tax\u201d imposed on imports from\u00a0certain countries, and instead would target companies that move American jobs abroad. Trump, in his own statements and tweets, has suggested doing both. Liberals have criticized Mnuchin, a multimillionaire,\u00a0because of his long career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and his role in dealing with the mortgages held by failed subprime giant IndyMac Bank. He is one of the top targets of Senate Democrats among Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. In hopes of derailing his nomination, Democrats and liberal activists are focusing on OneWest\u2019s foreclosures.\u00a0 In 2009, Mnuchin and other investors put up nearly $1.6 billion to buy IndyMac and renamed\u00a0it OneWest. They sold the bank to CIT Group in 2015 for $3.4 billion. Democrats and housing advocates\u00a0have dubbed Mnuchin \u201cthe foreclosure king\u201d for what they said was the bank\u2019s aggressive practices. They accused him of profiting from the 2008 financial crisis that left many homeowners unable to make their mortgage payments. Mnuchin critics point to a 2011 regulatory order from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision that OneWest failed to follow procedures when foreclosing on homeowners. During a forum Wednesday by Senate Democrats, Christina Clifford of Carlsbad choked up as she told of her experience with OneWest. The bank foreclosed on her Whittier condominium in 2010 after twice saying it lost her paperwork for a mortgage modification request despite cashing the checks she sent with the forms.\u00a0 \u201cSteve Mnuchin profited from people like me, even when we did everything we could to keep our homes,\u201d said Clifford, who runs an acupuncture business.\u00a0 As Democrats hit Mnuchin with similar stories, he said he regretted mistakes by the bank but denied he wanted to foreclose on homeowners. \u201cAnybody who thinks that we made more money foreclosing on a loan than modifying a loan\u00a0has no understanding of this,\u201d Mnuchin said. Democrats also pounced on Mnuchin\u2019s financial disclosure forms. According to a memo released by the committee\u2019s Democratic staff, Mnuchin initially failed to disclose real estate assets, including\u00a0homes in Los Angeles and Southampton, N.Y., and $15 million in holdings in Mexico. The committee questionnaire Mnuchin submitted Dec. 19 also didn\u2019t disclose his position as director of Dune Capital International in the Cayman Islands, and about $907,000 worth of artwork held by his children. After questions from committee staff, Mnuchin included the information on revised questionnaires he submitted this month. Mnuchin said Thursday oversight was unintentional. \"I think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\" Mnuchin said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wasn\u2019t sympathetic. She is not on the committee but said via Twitter that, \u201cWhen Mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork, he asks for forgiveness. When his customers made mistakes, he took their homes.\u201d Democrats also pressed Mnuchin on Trump's potential conflicts of interest.\u00a0 The Treasury secretary chairs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency committee that determines whether transactions involving foreign control of U.S. businesses affect national security. Democrats questioned Mnuchin on how he would exercise that authority to make sure Trump's international investments don't diminish\u00a0national security or violate the Constitution's prohibition on U.S. officials receiving benefits from foreign governments. Trump has said he would turn over management of his company's assets to his sons but won't sell his interests. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) asked Mnuchin\u00a0if, as Treasury secretary, he should know what percentage of Trump's debt is held by foreign interests. \"I think you\u00a0have a valid point about foreign debt and understanding foreign things, and I will research that and get back to you,\" Mnuchin said. But Mnuchin would not commit to reporting back to the committee on that percentage.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 When president-elect Donald Trump addressed America after winning the election, he emphasized uniting the country. \u00a0A new Fox News Poll suggests that could be a challenge. In addition, President Obama leaves office on a high note. \u00a0More on that later. \u00a0 First, only one-third of voters describe the national mood as \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d \u00a0Nearly twice as many feel like it\u2019s everyone for themselves. \u00a0And half say they\u2019re tired of politics and \u201cwant it to go away.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS. Voters also split over whether opportunities in the country favor \u201cother people\u201d or people like them. \u00a0 Still, two-thirds feel optimistic about the economy (66 percent). \u00a0In a rare instance of unity, majorities of independents (61 percent), Democrats (64 percent), and Republicans (72 percent) share this sunny outlook. Expand / Contract Who do voters credit for the recent rise in the stock market? \u00a0More say Trump (23 percent) than outgoing President Obama (13 percent), but a 56-percent majority credits regular market cycles. \u00a0Republicans (47 percent) are far more likely to credit Trump than Democrats are to credit Obama (26 percent). \u00a0 When asked about the importance of several issues, voters put the economy as item number one on Trump\u2019s to-do list. \u00a0 Almost half say it is \u201cextremely\u201d important for him to focus on the economy/jobs in his first year (46 percent). \u00a0Nearly as many say terrorism (44 percent) and health care (43 percent). \u00a0Fewer give that same urgency to government spending (38 percent), foreign policy (34 percent), Supreme Court nominations (33 percent), and immigration (27 percent). \u00a0Only 13 percent feel the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is extremely important. A separate fill-in-the-blank question gave voters the chance to name whatever they thought should be Trump\u2019s top priority. \u00a0They could pick an issue, an action -- anything. \u00a0Again, the economy comes in number one (25 percent). \u00a0Health care (12 percent) and unite the country (12 percent) round out the top three. \u00a0 By a 50-40 percent margin, voters say Trump\u2019s doing a bad job of listening to people like them, and a 54-percent majority disapproves of how he\u2019s handling the presidential transition. \u00a0Thirty-seven percent approves, with the most enthusiasm coming from Republicans (73 percent), white evangelical Christians (64 percent), conservatives (63 percent), and whites without a college degree (52 percent).\u00a0 Views on Trump as a person are similar, as 42 percent of voters have a favorable opinion (21 percent strongly), and 55 percent unfavorable (44 percent strongly). \u00a0That\u2019s a net negative of 13 points. \u00a0 His two immediate predecessors had more appeal when they began their terms. \u00a0When Barack Obama took office in January 2009, his rating was a net positive of 61 points (76 percent favorable, 15 percent unfavorable). \u00a0George W. Bush had a net positive of 27 in January 2001 (58 percent favorable, 31 percent unfavorable). \u00a0 What accounts for the difference? \u00a0Some 27 percent of Democrats had a favorable view of Bush in 2001, and 55 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Obama in 2009. \u00a0Today, only seven percent of Democrats have a positive opinion of Trump. \u00a0Obama\u2019s favorable rating among Republicans has dropped to 19 percent. Expand / Contract Vice president-elect Mike Pence\u2019s rating is a net positive of eight points: \u00a045 percent favorable vs. 37 percent unfavorable. Meanwhile, by an 11-point margin, more men than women have a favorable opinion of Trump (48 vs. 37 percent), and men are also 12 points more likely than women to say the president-elect is doing a good job listening to people like them (46 vs. 34 percent). \u00a0 That closely matches the gender gap in Trump\u2019s election support, as men were 11 points more likely than women to vote for him (52-41 percent), according to the 2016 national Fox News exit poll. \u00a0Women were 13 points more likely than men to vote for Hillary Clinton (54-41 percent). \u00a0 President Obama President Obama leaves office with positive job and personal ratings. \u00a0Fifty-seven percent of voters approve of his job performance. \u00a0That\u2019s his highest since the summer of his first year in office (June 2009). \u00a0Currently, 39 percent disapprove. \u00a0 A record-high 95 percent of Democrats approve of Obama as he departs, as do 55 percent of independents, and 13 percent of Republicans. \u00a0For comparison, the week he took office in January 2009, 85 percent of Democrats approved, as did 64 percent of independents, and 37 percent of Republicans. By a 17-point margin (55-38 percent), voters think the country is better off today than before Obama became president. \u00a0That\u2019s a significant improvement from October 2014, when they said the country was worse off by 10 points (39 better off vs. 49 worse off). The average job rating for Obama\u2019s entire presidency tells the story: \u00a047-47. \u00a0 His highest approval, 65 percent, came the week after his 2009 inauguration. \u00a0His lowest, 38 percent, came in September 2014, soon before Republicans re-took the U.S. Senate in the midterm election. Obama\u2019s been well-liked for much of his presidency, and that holds true today. \u00a0The final read shows 60 percent have a favorable opinion of him (44 percent strongly). \u00a0Thirty-nine percent have an unfavorable opinion (26 percent strongly). That makes him more popular than George W. Bush (49 favorable, 46 unfavorable) and Bill Clinton (48 favorable, 46 unfavorable) were at the end of their terms.\u00a0 The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from January 15-18, 2017. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.

The preacher made a name for herself on television \u2014 much like Donald Trump \u2014 and both have used controversial, nontraditional business practices that have been the subject of government inquires. White, like Trump, is on her third marriage, this time to Journey rocker Jonathan Cain, and both are boosted by wealth and celebrity. So it's perhaps no surprise that White is Trump's spiritual adviser \u2014 and has been for more than a decade. She'll take the stage with Trump to pray at Friday's inauguration. Their fifteen-year relationship began when Trump cold-called White. \"I pick up the phone and he begins to say to me, 'I've been watching you on television,'\" White recalled in an interview with NBC News that aired on Nightly News on Thursday. White is one of six religious leaders who will pray over Trump's swearing in on January 20th. In a wide-ranging interview with NBC Nightly News ahead of her prayer, White attested to the sometimes elusive spirituality of the president-elect, while pushing back the vocal critics who say White shouldn't be involved in the inauguration. \"I know that Donald is saved,\" White told NBC News in a pre-taped interview. \"He's absolutely \u2014 received Jesus Christ as his lord and savior.\" Related: What's Behind Evangelical Support for Donald Trump? Less Than You Think White won't take credit for bringing Trump to Jesus, but she is the most vocal defendants of his faith \u2014 something that's complicated by Trump not going to Church regularly and his repeated insistence that he's never asked God for forgiveness, a fundamental part of being 'born again' for evangelical Christians. \"I know that he's asked for forgiveness. I know that he has sought and understands the truth of that,\" White told NBC News, insisting that his repeated statements that he's never asked for forgiveness had been taken out of context and that his public persona kept him away from public church services. \"I understand on a much more personal level his walk. It's not something he feels comfortable ... He doesn't know our Christian-ese or language. ... But that doesn't mean he's not a man of faith.\" White said she saw his faith on display in 2011, when he asked her to gather pastors together to pray with him in 2011, when he was debating jumping in the 2012 presidential race. \"And we prayed over him. We sat with him for about six hours. This wasn't like-- like an hour or ten minutes; it was six hours. It was an all day meeting and we prayed for hours. And we listened, we talked, we conversed and\u2014 and the next day, I called him or he called me, one ... one or the other. And he said, 'I' -- 'I don't believe it's the timing of God,'\" White recalled. Pastor Paula White poses for a portrait at Shop Studios in New York, Friday, Jan. 6, 2017. Michael Rubenstein / for NBC News When White isn't defending Trump, she's defending her own ministry, which was subject to a three year Congressional inquiry lead by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley for shady fundraising principles and criticized by other Christians for what they call the \"prosperity gospel\" \u2014 preaching that followers who donate large sums will be made wealthy by God. White is quick to note that Grassley's investigation into her fundraising was technically an inquiry (\"We fully cooperated,\" she said) and resulted in no findings of wrongdoing or penalties . She disagrees with the characterization of the \"prosperity gospel\" and of course disagrees with critics who call her a charlatan and a heretic. She says donations, even the hefty four figure ones , are to help the ministry and its televised operations pay bills, and the \"prosperity gospel\" is misunderstood to be all about money. She's also quick to say that in her younger years, she wasn't always her ministry's best messenger. \"So have I ever said that God would bless you back financially? I'm sure I have. I'm absolutely sure somewhere. But do I principally believe? Like I'm not gonna say, \"I have never said that,\" White said with a laugh. \"But do I teach fundamentally like, \"Give to give. Give to get. Get to get?\" No. That is not the principle or the basis of who Paula White is.\" Jane C. Timm First Published Jan 19 2017, 6:39 pm ET ",

A total genius must have built this place.\u201d (As an aside, it is impossible to do the math, but President Obama\u2019s starters did include a Nobel Laureate in physics at the Energy Department, a former president of Harvard heading the National Economic Council and the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank as Treasury secretary.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Trump also singled out specific supporters, including Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets football team, and his pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump noted, wasn\u2019t at the lunch because he was being \u201cgrilled\u201d at his Senate confirmation hearing several blocks away. Mr. Trump also faulted senators for not being \u201cnice\u201d to Representative Tom Price of Georgia, his pick for health and human services secretary. Could this job help the Jets? And speaking of Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner is expected to get one of the plum jobs in diplomacy, United States ambassador to Britain, or as the Brits call it, ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James\u2019s. Mr. Johnson is only the fourth ambassador to be announced by Mr. Trump, after Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations, David Friedman, his longtime attorney, as ambassador to Israel, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as ambassador to China. Given that both Mr. Trump and his British counterpart, Prime Minister Theresa May, are relatively new in their roles, Mr. Johnson\u2019s ability to get Mr. Trump on the phone quickly could be helpful.

Sure, Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for Trump, had pledged that his members would act as a \u201cwall of meat\u201d to block anti-Trump protesters, but Mr. Huppert downplayed all that. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate any skirmishes \u2014 at least I hope not,\u201d he said. But if the safety of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 or even the president-elect himself \u2014 is jeopardized, he added, \u201cI think these folks will be willing to jump in if necessary.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story A security force beholden to no one with no rules of engagement and no real marching orders is, well, not a great idea. But Bikers for Trump stand by their man. David Nichols traveled from Texarkana, Texas, with seven others to attend the Bikers for Trump rally on Inauguration Day. The group drove for 22 hours straight, towing eight bikes on a 20-foot trailer. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a fine president \u2014 he just has to calm down his words,\u201d Mr. Nichols said. \u201cJust don\u2019t bash people\u2019s name too much.\u201d Trump says he is serious about a Jerusalem embassy Mr. Trump assured Israelis in comments posted online on Thursday that he planned to follow through on his campaign promise to move the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv soon after taking office. \u201cOf course I remember what I told you about Jerusalem,\u201d Mr. Trump told Boaz Bismuth of the newspaper Israel Hayom when he encountered him at a preinaugural event on Wednesday. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t forget. And you know I\u2019m not a person who breaks promises.\u201d Israel Hayom is owned by Sheldon Adelson , the Las Vegas casino magnate and Republican donor who is a powerful supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Mr. Trump has nominated David M. Friedman , a New York bankruptcy lawyer and strong advocate of moving the embassy, as his next ambassador to Israel. Mr. Trump\u2019s spokesman, Sean Spicer, suggested at a briefing on Thursday that the incoming president would make the embassy move one of his first acts after taking office on Friday. \u201cThere will be a further announcement on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has made clear that Israel has not gotten the respect it deserves.\u201d But implementation of such an announcement could still take months, given that the United States consulate facilities currently in Jerusalem are not considered adequate for an embassy. President Obama and other veterans of Middle East politics have warned against such a move because it would prejudge final status negotiations with the Palestinians and potentially provoke a violent backlash. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A lot of Obama officials will greet Trump Without a single cabinet or subcabinet official confirmed yet by the Senate, President-elect Trump has asked 50 officials from President Obama\u2019s expiring administration to stay on temporarily after Friday\u2019s inauguration to ensure the smooth operation of government, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team announced on Thursday. Among those requested to stick around are senior figures in the battle against terrorism and other security officials. Mr. Obama similarly kept around officials in such positions when he took over from President George W. Bush eight years ago, including some of those now being asked to remain in place by Mr. Trump. \u201cMake no mistake, we\u2019re ready to go on day one,\u201d Mr. Spicer told a briefing shortly before Mr. Trump was scheduled to depart New York for Washington. But the new president, he added, wanted to make sure that the United States was ready to handle any unforeseen events. \u201cRight now our focus was on continuity of government.\u201d Among those asked to stay were Brett McGurk, the special envoy overseeing the war against the Islamic State; Nick Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center; Adam J. Szubin, the acting under secretary of Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence; Robert O. Work, the deputy defense secretary; and Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the under secretary of state for political affairs. With his selection of an agriculture secretary, Mr. Trump has now named nominees for all 21 cabinet and cabinet-rank jobs, but it remained unclear how many would be confirmed by the Senate by Monday, the first full work day of the new administration. A few sub-cabinet jobs have been filled. The incoming administration also has tapped 536 members of what it calls a \u201cbeachhead team\u201d to show up at agencies across the government on Monday morning to serve as a first wave of appointees to begin operations while confirmations proceed. An ethicist rises in stature The federal government\u2019s top ethics monitor has played a surprisingly prominent role in the transition, and that is likely to continue into the new administration. Next week, Walter M. Shaub Jr., the director of the Office of Government Ethics, is scheduled to make an appearance on Capitol Hill to meet with Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who accused Mr. Shaub of dabbling in politics by publicly criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s ethics plan. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Chaffetz has backed down from demanding a transcribed interview and lobbing a subpoena threat at Mr. Shaub, agreeing instead to a private meeting on Jan. 23 that includes Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee. Mr. Cummings, in a letter to Mr. Chaffetz on Thursday , called his ratcheting down \u201ca positive step in the right direction,\u201d but said that if Mr. Chaffetz will not open the meeting to the public, he should at least include other members of the committee \u201cto hear firsthand what Mr. Shaub has to say.\u201d A spokeswoman for Mr. Chaffetz did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The president-elect\u2019s choice to vouch for his unifying message: Franklin Graham A day before Mr. Trump is to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, he took to Twitter to assert that he is not responsible for the nation\u2019s divisions. His champion? The Rev. Franklin Graham. \"It wasn't Donald Trump that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!\" Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham. ",

Tim Scott has a word of warning for fellow Republicans on the eve on Donald Trump's Inauguration: Get ready for the \"unpredictable.\" \"He did not run, in my opinion, as a conservative,\" Scott told ABC News' Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein on the \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast . \"He ran as an agent of change. So, we should expect to be equally unhappy with some of his policies -- from the right to the left. That's the one thing we\u2019ll have in common,\" said the South Carolina Republican. \"When there are areas of disagreement, I know that I'm going to take on the likelihood of strong criticism from the White House, but the reality of it is I\u2019m gonna stand up for what I believe in,\" he added.

He hits back,\" Scott said. \"Whether it's Meryl Streep , whether it's John Lewis, whether it's John McCain -- we've seen this play out very often in the same fashion.\" \"There's an old Scripture in the Book of Matthew that says love your neighbor,\" he said. \"Now, I would hope we as leaders would look for ways to bring this country together -- from the president of the United States down to every member of Congress, to leaders of households and at the state level as well.\" Conservative columnist George Will agreed with Scott on Trump's conservative credentials. \"I'm not convinced that he's a conservative,\" he told the \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast. \"The strongest evidence we have since the election is his behavior with regards to Carrier -- using the political power of an office he did not yet hold to compel a private sector entity to abandon its original estimate of what made economic sense ... and to reverse itself and make non-economic decisions under political pressure. ... It's not an encouraging sign.\" Will went on to say that he could see a potential clash between the White House and Republicans in Congress over major issues like entitlement reform. \"The president-elect early on in his campaign said he wanted no changes,\" Will said. \" Paul Ryan , who is the intellectual leader of the congressional wing of the party, has made entitlement reform the goal of his political life. That is, to put it mildly, a very stark conflict.\" Will also named Trump's infrastructure plan but called the repeal and replacement of Obamacare as \"the big initial test.\" \"We're going to see at that point whether Congress still thinks of itself as independent and a co-equal branch of government,\" Will said. Will held a dinner party with Obama before his inauguration, but he said he doesn't have any dinners slated with President-elect Trump. He also said he wouldn't hazard a guess on whether the Chicago Cubs or Donald Trump are more likely to repeat their underdog 2016 victories. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Another location change for Chicago Women's March as larger crowd expected Route for Saturday's Women's March on Chicago The location for the Women's March on Chicago on Saturday has changed again after the number of expected attendees more than doubled in two days. Organizers now anticipate more than 50,000 people will attend. On Tuesday, that number was 22,000. The new site is still adjacent to Grant Park but is on Columbus Drive just north of Jackson Drive, where participants will gather for a rally at 10 a.m. Attendees will march about 11:30 a.m. west on Jackson to Federal Plaza. The original route also was shortened to accommodate the growing crowd. Organizers rejected plans to circle back to the rally site, opting instead to end the march at Federal Plaza. The march route now runs straight west along Jackson. \"Due to the number of totally passionate women and their allies participating, the city has agreed to close Columbus,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhamer said. \"We're really excited about this. It really guarantees enough room for our marchers.\" Last week, organizers announced they were slightly relocating the rally from Grant Park's music shell to avoid damaging the grass after the forecast called for unseasonably high temperatures and rain. The rally was to be held on Jackson at Lake Shore Drive. When a woman apprehensive about Donald Trump 's presidency broke down in tears at Lynn Coe's North Side shop, Coe offered her an unusual remedy: Come knit with us.

Dozens of women have packed the store in recent weeks armed with bright pink yarn and knitting needles to create hats for the Jan. 21... (Duaa Eldeib) Organizers are confident they will be able to handle the increased numbers and have added enhanced safety measures, said Carrie Kiley, who is coordinating logistics for the march. \"We're not expecting any issues, but we definitely want to be safe and make sure we are taking every precaution, especially since it has grown to this magnitude,\" Kiley said. While the changes in location may have caused some confusion, they are the result of weather and increasing interest, not inexperience, Kiley said. Early in the planning process, organizers brought on people with ample know-how planning such large-scale events, she said. When the number of expected attendees surpassed 50,000, city officials agreed to the Columbus and Jackson location, much to organizers' delight, Kiley said. The amended permit for the rally and march has not yet been completed, but city officials anticipate the route will remain the same and that street closures will not change significantly. Other measures to accommodate the expected larger crowd include the doubling of portable bathrooms to 150, she said. The march is one of more than 250 scheduled to take place globally in solidarity with the Women's March on Washington one day after the President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. More than 200,000 people are expected to participate in the nation's capital. The marches aim to draw attention to women's rights, racial justice and equality. ",

    "text": "AP Jan 19, 2017 2:03 PM EST CHICAGO -- The first national estimate suggests that nearly half of U.S. men have genital infections caused by a sexually transmitted virus and that 1 in 4 has strains linked with several cancers. Most human papillomavirus infections cause no symptoms and most disappear without treatment. And most adults will get an HPV infection at some point in their lives. But high-risk HPV can cause cancer in the mouth and upper throat, cervical cancer in women and other cancers. Less harmful strains can cause genital warts. Vaccines can prevent infections but experts say vaccination rates in pre-teens and young adults are too low. High-risk HPV poses cancer risks to people who are infected and to their sexual partners, who can catch HPV even when the infections are silent. The study \u201cjust underscores that you need to vaccinate boys as well as girls, \u201c said Debbie Saslow, an HPV specialist at the American Cancer Society. Is it skin cancer? The new estimate comes from an analysis of a 2013-14 national health survey; nearly 2,000 men aged 18 to 59 were tested for HPV. Results were published Thursday in the journal\u00a0 JAMA Oncology . The researchers say it\u2019s the first published estimate for genital HPV infections in men. The 45 percent rate is higher than previously reported rates for women, said Dr. Jasmine Han, the lead author and a cancer specialist at Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. HPV virus can also be found in the mouth at much lower rates in men and women. The new study involved only genital HPV. The new estimate provides a good baseline for measuring the effectiveness of HPV vaccinations in boys and young men, said Saslow. Routine vaccination was recommended for pre-teen boys and young men in 2011, five years after approval for girls. Few men in the new study had been vaccinated. Before the government eased recommendations last October, fewer than one-third of 13-year-old girls and boys were fully vaccinated. Now they need only two doses instead of three. HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer, can be detected in women during routine Pap tests, which have led to a decline in cervical cancers and deaths. HPV-related mouth and throat cancers are becoming more common, especially among men, who are not routinely screened for the virus. Dr. Tanguy Seiwert, a head and neck cancer specialist at the University of Chicago, said the results show that doctors and parents need to step up efforts to vaccinate boys and young men and get over concerns that the HPV vaccine will lead to risky sexual behavior. \u201cOur society keeps talking about finding \u2018the cure for cancer.\u2019 Frankly, this is as close as it gets -- it prevents cancer,\u201d Seiwert said. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

    "text": "Jan 19 2017, 5:52 pm ET President Obama Grants 330 Commutations in Historic Final Act by Jon Schuppe advertisement President Obama capped an extraordinary week in clemency activity Thursday when he shortened the prison sentences of 330 drug offenders, the largest single batch of White House commutations in history. The announcement, less than 24 hours before he leaves office, came two days after Obama handed out 209 commutations and 64 pardons , part of his unprecedented effort to show mercy to drug offenders serving epic prison terms. Obama has now commuted the sentences of 1,715 people, more than any of his predecessors. Related: Some Big Names Got a Measure of Mercy From President Obama \"The President set out to reinvigorate clemency, and he has done just that,\" White House Chief Counsel Neil Eggleston said in a statement . President Barack Obama speaks to the media after having lunch with formerly incarcerated individuals who have received commutations, at Bus Boys and Poets restaurant on March 30, 2016 in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch / Pool via Getty Images But, for advocates, there is a more somber side to Obama's initiative: the thousands of inmates whose petitions were denied, the thousands who are still waiting for a decision, and the relatively small number of pardon applications he approved. The future of his project remains in doubt under Donald Trump. Related: The Flip Side to Obama's Historic Clemency Push: A Stinginess with Pardons The clemency push came late in Obama's presidency, as he granted just a few dozen in the first six years. Then, in 2014, after becoming more actively supportive of criminal justice reform, he put out a call for applications from nonviolent offenders who were sentenced to prison before the easing of notoriously harsh mandatory minimum laws in 2010. That triggered a deluge of petitions. Obama solicited help from the nation's bar and from advocacy organizations, but the program struggled through a backlog. Lawyers in the Justice Department reportedly worked around the clock in recent months to get through the stack. Related: Inmates Hope for Last-Ditch Shot at Obama's Clemency Program Obama's clemency grants came in large batches, hundreds at a time, accompanied by statements that framed his effort as a bid to become the most merciful president of all time. But his denials were even more voluminous. The effect on applicants and their lawyers was like emotional whiplash. On Wednesday, sandwiched between Obama's two ballyhooed clemency announcements, the Justice Department quietly released the names of more than 2,000 applicants who'd been denied. Play ",

By Dan Balz By Dan Balz Chief correspondent January 19 at 4:25 PM Follow @danbalz \u201cWe meet on democracy\u2019s front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends,\u201d George H.W. Bush said from the expansive West Front of the Capitol moments after taking the presidential oath in 1989. \u201cFor this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.\u201d That is the imagined ideal of Inauguration Day, a time of coming together in the spirit of national unity. It is a theme that President-elect Donald Trump sounded shortly after accepting a concessionary phone call from Hillary Clinton on the night he won the presidency \u2014 \u201cNow it is the time for America to bind the wounds of divisions,\u201d he said. \u2014 and likely a sentiment he will express again when he takes the oath Friday. It is customary for incoming chief executives to do so as they speak to the country for the first time as its leader. But after a rancorous campaign that exposed the raw nerves of partisans on both sides, that was fought over elemental questions of character, honesty, temperament and national identity, and that saw the Russians interfere in the process, Trump\u2019s America is as deeply divided as it has been in years and has no signs of a reconciliation on the horizon. The condition is hardly new. Lest anyone forget, Trump reminded everyone of that in a Thursday morning tweet . \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Donald Trump that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!\u201d Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham. Embedded in the political system today are partisan and ideological differences so deep and abiding that it likely would take a supreme effort on Trump\u2019s part \u2014 and a willingness of his opponents to respond in kind \u2014 to see it changed. The divisions have been widening. As important is the fact that passions have intensified. A sense of goodwill toward political opponents has largely faded. Now it is common not just to disagree but to ascribe the worst in the other side. This has left a mark on President Obama. He will leave office with higher approval ratings than at any time since the early months of his presidency, but he has the distinction of being the president with the most divided approval ratings of any recent president, according to data from the Pew Research Center. It is a reflection not just on the president but also of the deepening partisanship of the public over the past two decades. Data published by Pew shows the degree to which former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were also highly polarizing leaders. The Gallup organization has asked people whether they believe the country is united or divided. Two months after the 9/11 attacks, 74 percent said the country was united. By the beginning of the 2004 election cycle, 45 percent described the country as united. Last fall, in the wake of the 2016 election, just 21 percent thought so. The United States are not united politically. Based on election results, some red states have become redder and some blue states bluer. But the voting patterns are but one measure of the state-by-state divisions that exist. Pollster V. Lance Tarrance examined data from Gallup surveys and found a series of issues on which attitudes in states that went for Trump differ significantly from states that went for Clinton. Those issues include abortion, the promotion of \u201ctraditional values,\u201d climate change, government regulation and whether refugees going into Europe and North America represent a threat to U.S. interests. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Partisanship is perhaps the single most important indicator. Last summer, there was speculation that Trump\u2019s candidacy, which was splitting the Republican Party, might result in an increase in ticket-splitting, after a series of elections in which split-tickets were at historic lows. In the end, that did not happen. As Jacobson noted in a recent paper, \u201cFor the first time, every Senate contest was won by the party that won the state\u2019s electoral votes.\u201d Partisanship and election results color attitudes about the state of the country. Over most of the past two presidencies, majorities have described the direction of the country as seriously off track. But changing presidents can change who says this. In the Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week, 63 percent described the state of the country that way, only slightly better than the 68 percent who said so last July. Beneath those numbers was a dramatic shift in the perceptions of Democrats and Republicans. In July, 49 percent of Democrats said the country was on the wrong track and 45 percent said things were going in the right direction. Today, only 19 percent are positive while 74 percent are negative. Republicans have gone from 8 percent positive to 45 percent positive, from 90 percent negative to 50 percent negative. [ Trump will bring a new leadership style to the White House ] Trump is the inheritor of conditions he did not create. Still, the campaign just concluded made things worse in at least one important way: Trump starts his presidency with a deficit unlike his most recent predecessors. As the Post-ABC poll and other surveys have found this week, he will be sworn in with the lowest approval ratings of any incoming president in at least four decades. Trump\u2019s post-election statement for unity and any calls for healing on Friday represent bookends of a transition in which a series of other comments, tweets and actions have done the opposite. Democrats say they can point to little as evidence that Trump truly wants to make the country whole. Former Obama White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said in an email that, with the exception of being conciliatory toward Obama, Trump has done nothing of consequence to bring the country together. \u201cHe extended exponentially more olive branches to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin than the Democrats in Congress, Hillary Clinton, or the majority of the country that voted for someone else,\u201d he wrote. Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former adviser to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, offered a more charitable assessment, pointing not only to Trump\u2019s visit to the Oval Office but also his consideration of Romney as secretary of state. Madden said the Romney meeting sent a signal to a divided Republican Party that Trump was \u201cserious about surrounding himself with the best people.\u201d He argued that any skepticism that Trump was cynically playing Romney was outweighed by the \u201ccalming effect\u201d this had on many Republicans. The tone of his language when he met with Obama \u201chelped him as he transitioned from presumed long-shot candidate to president-elect.\u201d Anita Dunn, who also served Obama as White House communications director, said the nature of Trump\u2019s campaign offers the best hints to how he will govern. She wrote in an email: \u201cWhen you win, and you win against the odds, and you win in the face of implacable opposition, you often feel like taking advice and being told how to do things by the people you just vanquished is about Number 101 on your list of 100 most important things to remember.\u201d The question is: How important binding a divided nation will be to Trump once he becomes president? Will he seek to unify the country, and if so how? Or will he decide there is little he can do and then govern a divided nation the way he sought and won the presidency \u2014 by accentuating those differences? The ultimate answer will not come on Friday, but clues will emerge soon after, as the 45th president and his adversaries begin to engage over his and the Republicans\u2019 agendas. Actions, not words, will tell the tale. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

By Michael Kranish By Michael Kranish January 19 at 6:00 AM Follow @PostKranish Michael Kranish is the co-author, with Marc Fisher, of the Washington Post biography \u201cTrump Revealed.\u201d He is an investigative political reporter on the national staff. (Christopher Buzelli for the Washington Post) The two-story, 23-room house sits grandly on Midland Parkway in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood in Queens, its portico upheld by six white columns, as if a plantation manse from the South had been transplanted to suburbia. It was here, in a mansion built by his father, with a chauffeur-driven limousine in the driveway, that Donald Trump spent most of his childhood. And it was here, in this house that symbolized how the Trumps were bigger and brasher than all around them, that Donald first revealed his rebellious nature. He punched his music teacher, disobeyed his parents by sneaking into Manhattan and, according to his close friend at the time, bought a switchblade knife. Eventually, his parents sent him away, enrolling him for five teenage years in New York Military Academy, which tried, and often failed, to calm the most hyperkinetic of all the Trumps. Donald, the family learned, could not be easily contained. Now, as Trump prepares to move into a far grander, many-columned home, he is once again unlikely to be contained. That, it seems, is what the voters wanted. Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington has excited a cross-section of the country who see in him not an elitist, but a populist who can explode the way business is done in the nation\u2019s capital. The fact that Trump comes from such a privileged background, and that he became fabulously wealthy by catering to some of the world\u2019s richest people, did not put off the millions of working-class people who supported him. To the contrary, they see him as their champion, even as he stacks his Cabinet with fellow billionaires. Trump comes to this moment as a more complex man than is widely realized. He is in some ways still the boy from Queens, who grew up in a bubble amid a melting pot, wanting to be, as he wrote in 2016, \u201cthe toughest kid in the neighborhood . . . mouthing off to everybody while backing down to no one.\u201d He moved across the river to cater to the Manhattan glitterati but never quite felt accepted; they were put off by his crude language and boastful manner. He is also a survivor who filed six corporate bankruptcies even as he lived in his three-story gilded aerie at the top of a tower he named after himself. For much of his 70 years, Trump has been on a roller-coaster ride of rebellion and revolution and upending it all, of risking everything, leaving wreckage in his path when necessary, and, above all, finding a way to survive. To win. It\u2019s all about winning, he said often, and he did win the presidency, much to the surprise of myriad pundits and pollsters, as well as his vanquished rival, Hillary Clinton. For all the unpredictable nature of his actions, he has remained stubbornly consistent about how he believes the world views America. He fumed in 1987 about the United States being laughed at by the rest of the world. He said the same thing in 2016. Yet his politics changed endlessly: Democrat, Republican, Independent, Reform Party, Republican again. So did his positions; first he favored abortion rights, citing his \u201cpro-choice instincts,\u201d then he opposed them. He favored universal health-care coverage before he called for repealing Obamacare. He called for higher taxes on the superwealthy before suggesting tax cuts. He had no core, his opponents said. What is now clear is that lack of ideology is his ideology: It\u2019s the ideology of winning. If he is to be successful, that pragmatic side, which has served him so well when he needed it, could be his guiding principle \u2014 unless he finds it cannot coexist with his love of rebellion. Trump\u2019s life, beginning with the street in Queens where grew up, provides a road map to his outlook and vision and failings, showing how he dealt with one crisis after another, touchstones that may foreshadow how he will handle the presidency. *** Trump, second from left, with classmates from his Queens school. (Paul Ornish) Descending the 17 steps of the mansion in Jamaica Estates, walking down a tree-lined street and then turning onto Hillside Avenue, Donald Trump arrived at the Jamaica-179th Street subway station, where he often boarded the F train to Manhattan. His parents were unaware that their preteen son was wandering around the city, which the family considered too dangerous. Trump was enthralled with the teeming borough on the opposite side of the East River, and so began his dreams of always doing something bigger. These early journeys eventually led him to envision building skyscrapers in midtown Manhattan. His father, Fred Trump, said the idea was \u201ccrazy,\u201d Donald later wrote, and initially tried to keep him within the outer boroughs. He named Donald the president of Trump Management, which oversaw a real estate empire in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island from a modest office on Avenue Z near Coney Island. The family\u2019s grand achievement was Trump Village, which would have looked at home in the former Soviet Union, a dreary collection of seven 23-story buildings, 2,300 units built as cheaply as possible. The working-class residents were grateful to Fred Trump for the affordable housing, but Donald later wrote that it \u201cwas not a world I found very attractive.\u201d He continued to dream of building in Manhattan and catering to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. His father eventually assented to the idea. Fred once gave a speech that Donald attended in which he laid out the Trump philosophy. \u201cNine out of 10 people don\u2019t like what they do,\u201d Fred said. \u201cAnd in not liking what they do, they lose enthusiasm, they go from job to job, and ultimately become a nothing.\u201d Donald aimed to become something. Trump\u2019s will was soon tested when the Justice Department sued Donald and his father, alleging that Trump Management officials steered blacks away from buildings that were mostly occupied by whites. It was left to Donald to decide whether to settle the case, and he sought the advice of Roy Cohn, the tenacious former counsel to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who urged him to fight the government, hitting back 100 times harder. Trump eventually settled the case two years later \u2014 the first of many times he would say he would never settle and then did \u2014 but these events proved to be among the most formative of his life. They define him to this day. Trump learned to fight, to threaten, to countersue. He harbored an animus to the federal government that never subsided, feeling he was treated unfairly, which could affect his view of lawsuits that his administration might be asked to bring. He remains angry that the first real attention that he received in the media \u2014 a front-page story about the case in the New York Times headlined \u201cMajor Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias in City\u201d \u2014 in effect suggested that he was racist. Trump, anxious to move on from the outer boroughs and the racial-bias case, determined he would become a major builder in Manhattan, and he succeeded. Taking advantage of a variety of tax incentives, he built a Hyatt Hotel and Trump Tower, playing a major role in revitalizing parts of Manhattan. The projects\u2019 success boosted Trump\u2019s ego and power. He had gone against his father\u2019s initial advice to avoid Manhattan, and it had paid off. Now he set his sights on even bigger projects. *** Donald Trump, left, and his father at Trump Village, a cluster of affordable housing in Brooklyn. Although his father urged him to stick to New York\u2019s outer boroughs, Donald Trump set his sights on Manhattan at an early age. (Barton Silverman/The New York Times/Redux/Barton Silverman/The New York Times/Redux) Trump soon traveled by seaplane to Atlantic City and decided that he wanted to be the biggest casino operator in the eastern United States. At first, he said he would follow his father\u2019s second piece of advice: never go deeply into debt. He testified at a New Jersey Casino Control Commission hearing that he would never use \u201cjunk bonds\u201d that paid 14 percent interest because they were too risky. But his ambition to be the biggest operator was so intense that he soon relied on the junk bonds he had disdained, and he went deeply into personal debt. He told the story of walking down Fifth Avenue and seeing an impoverished blind man. Trump told his companion that the man hawking pencils was $900 million richer than he was \u2014 because Trump\u2019s negative worth was precisely that much. (In one of his books, Trump wrote that the blind man was worth $9.2 billion more than he was, but he later said that was a mistake.) He pleaded with Japanese bankers, hid his fleet of helicopters from those who wanted to repossess them, and persuaded a bank to insure a yacht that he couldn\u2019t afford. He had believed that he could succeed by attracting big-spending gamblers, but his associates gave him a piece of advice that would later resonate in his presidential campaign: It\u2019s fine to have the support of the wealthy big spenders, but the path to profitability would rely on attracting people of more modest means who boarded buses to his casinos to inject a little excitement into their lives; they just wanted to taste the Trump experience and feel wealthy. On Oct. 10, 1989, just as Trump\u2019s financial problems were coming to a head, he met at Trump Tower with three executives who ran his casinos. The trio then boarded a helicopter to return to Atlantic City. As the chopper headed over the Garden State Parkway, a rotor broke, and the aircraft crashed, killing all aboard. A devastated Trump informed the families. As his financial problems mounted, he realized that he had, as he put it, taken his \u201ceye off the ball,\u201d in part because he was having an affair with Marla Maples while he was married to Ivana Trump, the first of his three wives. \u201cFor the first time since I had known him, I heard fear and uncertainty in his voice,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Donnell, who ran the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino at the time and later wrote a book about the experience. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Shefte,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post) As Trump tried to regain control, he lashed out at other executives, blamed those who died in the helicopter crash for his problems, and fired employees. It was, to this point, his greatest test. He managed to open his third and grandest casino, the Taj Mahal, but it cannibalized business from his other two at the very time Atlantic City was experiencing an economic slowdown. Everything Trump built was at risk. Yet Trump had piled one risk on top of another. He bought New York\u2019s storied Plaza Hotel for $407 million, admitting that \u201cI can never justify the price I paid\u201d but explaining that he had to have the trophy property, which symbolized wealth, class and elegance. He paid $365 million for an airline that became the Trump Shuttle, even though he knew nothing about the business, which eventually floundered. He put all three casinos into corporate bankruptcy, as well as the Plaza Hotel and two other businesses. He created a public company, paid himself millions of dollars, and saw the stock price fall from $35 a share to 17 cents. Through it all, investors howled, bondholders cried foul, and contractors \u2014 many of them small-business men \u2014 said they were stiffed. Yet Trump survived. Donald Trump celebrates his third Atlantic City casino in 1990. Casino bankruptcies brought Trump to the brink of financial ruin, but reality TV revived his fortunes and honed his showman\u2019s skills. (CHARLES REX ARBOGAST/ASSOCIATED PRESS) He renegotiated countless contracts, persuaded the banks to let him keep a majority stake in the properties, and avoided personal bankruptcy. He explained it this way in an interview with The Washington Post: \u201cI wasn\u2019t representing the country. I wasn\u2019t representing the banks. . . . I was representing Donald Trump. So for myself, they were all good deals.\u201d This, said the author of \u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal,\u201d was an even more magnificent chapter, and so he wrote \u201cThe Art of the Comeback.\u201d He had learned a lesson. His father had been right; it was a mistake to go so deeply into debt. In the future, he decided, he would mostly let others take the risk. He would sell his name to developers who would put it on their buildings; he would get a licensing fee with no downside. Even if the property failed, he won. Gradually, as Trump\u2019s name started appearing on more properties around the world, a television producer named Mark Burnett, who had created a show called \u201cSurvivor,\u201d came calling. Trump was dismissive; reality television \u201cwas for the bottom-feeders of society.\u201d But Burnett was persuasive. Trump would play himself in a show called \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which would relentlessly promote Trump as the epitome of success. For millions of Americans, this became their image of Trump: in the boardroom, in control, firing people who didn\u2019t measure up to his standard. Trump lived in grand style, flew in a Trump-emblazoned jet or helicopter, and traveled from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. Most viewers didn\u2019t realize it, but the show helped transform a man who had nearly suffered catastrophic financial failure into a success. Trump has said he earned $214\u00a0million during 14 seasons of the NBC broadcast, and he made more from related licensing deals for products including ties and cologne. His name became a valuable brand. When Trump showed up at a minor event to promote his clothing line, he was asked why he was there. His answer defined his philosophy: \u201cBecause I want to win, and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to win.\u201d Having agreed to host \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d he set out to appeal to the \u201cbottom-feeders\u201d he had derided, and he found that he excelled at his new craft. Showmanship came naturally. His father had promoted housing on Coney Island with an array of stunts, and his mother, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Scotland, had often told Donald of her love of royal pageantry. Trump had combined these two parental traits and created a political persona unlike any other. Without \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d there almost certainly would have been no presidential candidacy and no President Trump. The self-described multibillionaire took pride in being able to appeal to the average working person. One of his most famous comments \u2014 that \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters\u201d \u2014 underscored his belief that he could say or do anything without harming his brand. His family called him a \u201cworking-class billionaire\u201d; he liked nothing more than a Big Mac and fries and a binge on television shows. He said he had never read a book about a president, and he didn\u2019t like long briefings or lengthy papers. Summaries would suffice. Trump\u2019s incuriosity about much of the world inevitably led to derision that he did not have the intellectual capacity or temperament to be president. But Trump had a different kind of genius. He was a showman who understood the power of television, where most people got their information. (When social media started to play an outsize role, he seized on that, as well.) He threw himself into the world of professional wrestling, appearing in the ring before 80,000 people in Detroit in 2007, and celebrated the crassness of it all. Just like a pro, he pretended to body-slam an opponent, soaking in the crowd\u2019s roar. In retrospect, the WrestleMania appearances were a warm-up for the rambunctious rallies that Trump would hold during the 2016 campaign; he developed an uncanny sense about how to read the mood in an arena and play to a pumped-up crowd. Indeed, anyone who was paying attention to Trump\u2019s speeches or read his books (which were typically written by ghostwriters or co-authors) could have seen the antecedents of his presidential campaign strategy. He said he agreed with the idea that paranoia was the key to success. \u201cNow that sounds terrible,\u201d Trump said in a speech earlier in his career. \u201cBut you have to realize that people \u2014 sadly, sadly \u2014 are very vicious. You think we\u2019re so different from the lions in the jungle?\u201d The Trump style \u2014 boasts and bombast, attacks and taunts \u2014 were hardly new devices. He has been using them for decades. To read Trump\u2019s books is to find a man of contradiction. In \u201cSurviving at the Top\u201d (1990), Trump wrote that one of his rules is \u201cdon\u2019t think you\u2019re so smart that you can go it alone.\u201d But in \u201cThink Like a Billionaire\u201d (2004), Trump wrote that one his of rules was to \u201cthink of yourself as a one-man army. You\u2019re not only the commander in chief, you\u2019re the soldier as well. You must plan and execute your plan alone.\u201d Trump\u2019s other rules in this latter book included not taking a vacation, having a short attention span, and not relying on technology. \u201cFriends are good, but family is better,\u201d Trump wrote, foreshadowing his heavy reliance during the campaign on his children, particularly his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Some of the most revealing words written by Trump came in \u201cThe Art of the Comeback\u201d (1997), which during the presidential campaign received notice because he had included a picture of himself with Hillary Clinton, writing that \u201cthe First Lady is a wonderful woman who has handled pressure incredibly well.\u201d Much of the book is about how Trump rebounded from his financial nadir. It is a story that he rarely told on the trail, where he depicted himself mostly as an unerring success. But as he told it in his book, \u201cthe worst of times can turn to your advantage \u2014 my life is a study of that. I learned so much during the tough years. . . . I learned about handling pressure. I was able to home in, buckle down, get back to basics, and make things work. I worked much harder, I focused and I got myself out of a box.\u201d *** Trump and wrestler Bobby Lashley, right, shave WWE chief Vince McMahon\u2019s head. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) Trump teased his candidacy for decades. He first raised the possibility in 1987, traveling to the first-primary state of New Hampshire, but it turned out to be a promotional ploy for his first book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d In 1988, Trump attended the Republican National Convention to watch George H.W. Bush receive the nomination. Appearing on a CNN show at the convention, Trump was asked by host Larry King about his wealth. He responded by saying he was a man beloved by average people. \u201cYou know, wealthy people don\u2019t like me because I\u2019m competing against them all the time and I like to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe fact is, I go down the streets of New York and the people that really like me are the taxi drivers and the workers.\u201d \u201cThen why are you a Republican?\u201d King asked. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Trump responded. All he could say was that he believed in \u201ccertain principles of the Republican Party.\u201d *** After Trump descended the elevator in his eponymous tower on Fifth Avenue to declare his presidential candidacy in June 2015, his off-the-cuff comment that many illegal Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists led many pundits to dismiss his chances. He stood in the low single digits in the polls. Yet the polls provided the wrong numbers to study. Trump himself had correctly said in 2000 \u2014 when he briefly considered running for the presidency \u2014 that it was inevitable that an outsider would be elected president. Economic stagnation had only worsened since he made that prediction. The numbers that mattered most were these: The 117 million Americans in the bottom 50 percent of the nation\u2019s economy had seen practically no real increase in their income since 1980, while the top 1 percent had seen their net worth skyrocket. The status quo, which Hillary Clinton represented, was not acceptable to many. The approval ratings of Congress, and of Washington in general, were at historic lows. Trump, who had spent much of his career selling high-end real estate to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people, may have hardly seemed like the ideal carrier for the message of economic populism. There was little in Trump\u2019s career that indicated he was devoted to the concerns of the working class. But here is where the boy from Queens had an advantage that few seemed to realize at the time. The essence of Trump\u2019s character could first be seen on the baseball field of his youth. Trump idolized Yogi Berra, the scrappy Yankees catcher, and played the same position, constantly chattering behind the plate, chiding the batter, seeking to rattle the opponent, not unlike his technique on Twitter today. Trump took out his aggression on the field, running hellbent around the bases, crashing into players who stood in his way, leaving the field with the dirtiest uniform. He had the power to hit home runs, but when he struck out, he sometimes slammed the bat against a concrete walk so hard that it splintered. He was often injured. But he loved playing catcher, he told his friends, because it was the roughest position the field. \u201cHe learned how to be very competitive,\u201d said Trump\u2019s childhood friend, Peter Brant, who played baseball with him in a Queens Little League. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious how he conducted himself in this election is very similar to the way he was on the field; he basically wanted to win.\u201d Brant, who also traveled by subway with Trump on sojourns into Manhattan, said Trump\u2019s upbringing in Queens, in a neighborhood that was racially and economically mixed, goes far in explaining the president-elect. Brant recalled going to ballgames at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, where Trump picked seats with a clear view of the catcher, and sitting with blue-collar fans. They went to Fred Trump\u2019s construction sites and marveled at the artistry of bricklayers. Given Trump\u2019s background, Brant said, it is not surprising that he found a way to relate to average folks. \u201cDonald can be a regular Joe,\u201d Brant said. \u201cHe grew up in Queens. You have to understand it\u2019s not like growing up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. This was Queens.\u201d Although his Queens accent is mostly gone, Trump retains the demeanor that Brant saw long ago. It is a straight line from Trump\u2019s days taunting opponents from the catcher\u2019s position to the outrageous appearances on WrestleMania and then the belittling of adversaries on the campaign trail. Trump learned through his experience with professional wrestling and \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as well as his many appearances on late-night television shows and shock-jock radio programs, that he had a way \u2014 sometimes a crude way \u2014 of connecting with average people. He sounded equally at ease talking on Howard Stern\u2019s radio show about a woman\u2019s breasts as he was on CNBC discussing the future of interest rates. Before running for president, his most recent involvement in politics was to suggest, falsely, that President Obama was not a U.S. citizen, a claim it took years for him to abandon. During his campaign, Trump boasted that he was uniquely prepared for the presidency. He said he knew more than the generals about the Islamic State, that he \u201calone\u201d could fix the nation\u2019s problems. After winning the election, he said that he didn\u2019t need daily intelligence briefings because he was \u201csmart\u201d and they were often repetitive. His choices for a variety of Cabinet positions often were provocative: He picked Andrew Puzder, an opponent of the minimum wage, to be labor secretary; Betsy DeVos, an advocate of private school vouchers, to be education secretary; and Scott Pruitt, who has said the science on climate change is \u201cfar from settled,\u201d to be the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. For all his business experience, nothing in Trump\u2019s career is comparable to the demands of the presidency. Upon assuming the office, he will control a massive military and be responsible for deciding whether to launch nuclear weapons, a choice that he might have to make in minutes. Trump will hold a unique place in the pantheon of presidents. He is the only businessman to become president who has not previously worked in some kind of public service, such as the military or the Cabinet, according to presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anybody who is just a business person making money for himself and has zero public office\u201d experience, he said. Will he be \u201cpresidential,\u201d as he has promised, or will he revert to campaign mode, relying on insult and bombast and Twitter? He made many promises that will be hard to keep: rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure; replace Obamacare with something \u201cgreat\u201d at a fraction of the cost; return coal and steel jobs; rebuild manufacturing; unite a deeply divided country. Part of Trump\u2019s challenge will be coming to terms with his contradictions. He ran against the establishment, of which he is a member as a billionaire. He ran against the media, which he played expertly to promote himself. (\u201cIf you say outrageous things and fight back, they love you,\u201d Trump wrote in his 2016 book, \u201cCrippled America,\u201d about his media strategy.) Trump ran against Washington, which he must now lead. He railed against the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs, which he said had \u201ctotal control\u201d over Hillary Clinton. Then he appointed current or former Goldman Sachs officials to be treasury secretary, director of the White House National Economic Council, and chief strategist. Trump ran against not just the Democratic Party but also his fellow Republicans. He blasted Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan, who had said Trump\u2019s words about the heritage of the judge in a case regarding Trump University were \u201cthe textbook definition of a racist comment\u201d; now the two must work together. If Trump carries grudges into the White House, as he often did in business, he will have unprecedented power to launch vendettas. Already, he has used Twitter to warn critics that he won\u2019t hesitate to hit them back harder, just as Cohn taught him decades ago. Trump once explained his strategy by quoting what he called the \u201cphilosophy\u201d of his longtime friend, boxer Mike Tyson: \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Trump arrives in Washington with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, which should give him a clear path to pass many of his initiatives. But many Republicans remain skeptical about him, and Democrats in the Senate can try to stop him with filibusters. The public divisions aren\u2019t likely to go away. Trump won the electoral vote, but he would have lost it with a switch of just 107,000 votes in three states, and he lost the popular vote by 2.8 million. So, how will Trump govern, this man who says one thing, then changes his mind, then attacks, then strives to please? Who tweets and preens and gloats. Who has no record of governance, who has had as much failure as success. He was elected on a wave of angst and anger, embodying an idea expressed by countless supporters: blow up the way Washington works (or doesn\u2019t work). Not just disruption but explosion. Trump is well on his way to engineering that explosion, and the impact could reshape the country. Much will depend on how he sells his plans, and whether the economy continues to improve. An unforeseen crisis could emerge. George W. Bush, for example, had to deal with the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Great Recession. Such crises seize a president\u2019s attention, undermine his plans, reroute his vision. Trump\u2019s leadership skills doubtless will be tested in ways he has not yet imagined. The prologue of the campaign is past. The tales of Trump\u2019s Queens childhood, as well as his bankruptcies, divorces, vulgar comments, casinos and reality show, are now the backstory of his life, early chapters that shaped his road to the White House. In the great sweep of history, it is only now, as Trump ascends to the presidency, that his story truly begins. michael.kranish@washpost.com ",

Trump could easily boost deportations by more than 75% in his first year in office by giving more authority to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Aides are clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to take the first steps toward transforming the immigration system as soon as he takes office Friday, fulfilling a major campaign pledge while deepening the fears of immigration advocates about what\u2019s to come. Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally. In their place, say immigration advocates and\u00a0people familiar with his plans,\u00a0expect to see images on the evening news of workplace raids as Trump sends a message that he is wasting no time on his promised crackdown. In addition to the high-profile raids, those people said in interviews, Trump will also widen the range of people singled out for deportation, focusing on those with criminal convictions, and he could move immediately to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. He may also limit who can come into the country as a security measure, making good on a sweeping vow to stop immigrants \u201cfrom any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.\u201d The Inauguration of Donald Trump The Inauguration of Donald Trump The Inauguration of Donald Trump See more videos \u201cWe need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system, and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community,\u201d Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday. Other changes will unfold more slowly but are designed to have wide-ranging effects. People who have committed even minor crimes are expected to be deported, along with about 800,000 people who were ordered removed but may still be in the U.S. More immigration agents will be sent to local jails to look for violators, prosecutions of immigration violations will increase, and fewer people will be eligible to request protection in the U.S. as the definition of what constitutes a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of returning home probably will be narrowed. Taken together, the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced, which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U.S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other big-ticket plans, such as replacing Obamacare, Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president\u2019s wide legal authority to control borders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to move very quickly on the border,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday, saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge \u2014 building a wall along the border with Mexico. Next year\u2019s Homeland Security budget includes about $175 million set aside for upgrading Border Patrol buildings and adding new equipment, which along with other funds could be diverted quickly to start construction on a wall while Congress considers proposals to increase funding. Trump\u2019s transition team has planned a \u201cvery robust few weeks\u201d of executive actions on immigration, energy policy, crime and combating terrorism, Spicer told reporters Wednesday. He said Trump will sign \u201cfour or five\u201d executive orders within hours of taking the oath of office Friday and plans additional actions Monday. With a stroke of his pen, Trump could also end Obama\u2019s move to protect from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. (Lisa Mascaro) More than 740,000 people subjected themselves to a background check and received two-year work permits under that program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. If the program is canceled, those permits could be allowed to expire during Trump\u2019s first two years in office. Obama vowed to fight any effort by the incoming administration to track down and deport those who applied for protection under the program. The president said Wednesday during his final news conference that he plans to keep a low profile right after he leaves the White House, but that he will speak out if he sees evidence of \u201cefforts to round up kids who have grown up here and who are, for all intents and purposes, American kids.\u201d Trump has already hinted he will work with the Republican-led Congress to revamp the work visa system, reduce the flow of legal immigration and revive a proposal, formerly called the Dream Act , that would give some form of legal status to those immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children. In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, Trump said he would be \u201cworking on a plan\u201d over the next few months that could help some people stay in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan that\u2019s going to be very firm, but it\u2019s going to be a lot of heart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have great people coming into our country, people that love our country.\u201d Nevertheless, advocates for immigrants expect to see Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raid workplaces to detain people in the U.S. illegally, and are preparing to counsel children who have seen their fathers or mothers handcuffed and driven away to an immigration detention center. \u201cTrump and his team have demagogued immigrants from Day One on his campaign, and we are bracing for the worst,\u201d said Frank Sharry, head of America\u2019s Voice, an immigration advocacy group. In a Gallup survey this month, 41% of Americans were satisfied with the current level of immigration, a higher percentage than at any time since Gallup began tracking the issue in 2001. Donald Trump \u2019s more controversial promises. In the process,... With the Senate having held confirmation hearings for seven of the incoming administration\u2019s \u00a0choices for\u00a0top positions, a clear pattern has begun to emerge \u2014\u00a0prospective Cabinet members have carefully walked away from some of President-elect Donald Trump \u2019s more controversial promises. In the process,... (David Lauter) Amid the contentious debate over the issue in the last year, the percentage of people wanting less immigration fell to just 36%. They\u2019re part of a majority, 53%, that are dissatisfied on the issue, though some in that group want to see more immigration or for levels to remain the same. The Obama administration limited deportations to recent arrivals, repeat immigration violators and people with multiple criminal convictions. If Trump sweeps away those restrictions, many of them enshrined in a November 2014 memo from outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson , immigration agents will be free to begin deporting more people. They could quickly boost removals by 75%, to levels last seen in 2012 at the end of Obama\u2019s first term, when more than 400,000 people were deported. Last year, the Obama administration deported 235,000 people. Much of the task of unraveling Obama\u2019s immigration protections and ratcheting up deportations will fall to Trump\u2019s choice to run the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly , who oversaw the military\u2019s counter-narcotics operations in Central America until early last year. Kelly is expected to be confirmed Friday. \u201cOne of the effective things would be for Gen. Kelly to give his Border Patrol agents and ICE officers the clear go-ahead to start enforcing the law,\u201dsaid Rosemary Jenks, vice president and director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for reduced immigration levels. \u201cI think that\u2019s an important message that has to go out as soon as Gen. Kelly is confirmed, because they have been waiting eight long years to get that order.\u201d Building a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d across the entire U.S. border with Mexico, as Trump has called for, would also fall under Kelly. Trump would often bring his campaign rallies to a crescendo with a call-and-response about forcing Mexico to pay for such a wall. One proposal his advisors have floated would be to tax some of the estimated $25 billion in remittances sent home by Mexican workers in the U.S. each year \u2014 an idea that would probably be opposed by the financial services companies that facilitate the money transfers. Trump surprised some Republican lawmakers this month when he said he would ask Congress to front the cost \u2014 estimates range from $12 billion to $38 billion \u2014 before demanding reimbursement from Mexico. He later said he was not altering his campaign plans but merely trying to move more quickly than the appropriations process would allow. \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d Trump tweeted. Mexican officials have said they will refuse to cooperate.

The clemency grants announced on Obama's last full day in office set a one-day record. Proud to make this one of my final actions as President. America is a nation of second chances, and 1,715 people deserved that shot,\"\u00a0 Obama tweeted Thursday . The clemency initiative, which began in 2014, was targeted at drug dealers who received mandatory-minimum sentences during the War on Drugs from the 1980s to the 2000s. But the effort ultimately fell far short of the 10,000 clemency grants former attorney general Eric Holder predicted when the initiative began. And while Obama set a record for granting commutations, he also set a record for denials. As of the end of 2016, he had denied 14,485 petitions and closed another 4,242 without action\u00a0\u2014 an overall grant rate of 5.9%, a couple of percentage points higher than many of his predecessors. \"The president set out to reinvigorate clemency, and he has done just that,\" White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in a statement. It's unclear how big of a backlog in clemency cases President-elect Donald Trump will inherit. But Justice Department officials had promised to give an up-or-down determination on every clemency initiative case it received by August. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say we kept that promise,\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates said in a statement. \"This undertaking was as enormous as it was unprecedented, and I am incredibly grateful to the teams of people who devoted their time and energy to the project since its inception.\" Read more: Obama commutes sentence of Chelsea Manning in last-minute clemency push Obama's final list of clemency grants included no more full pardons, meaning his final pardon tally will stand at 212\u00a0\u2014 fewer than any modern president except Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. (It was the younger Bush who gave Obama this advice in the limo ride to the Capitol on his Inauguration Day eight years ago. \"Announce a pardon policy early on, and stick to it.\") The grants on Thursday also did not include any of the more high-profile political cases, like former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and former congressman Chaka\u00a0Fattah, all serving time on corruption charges. With Thursday's action, the Clemency Project 2014 also closes its doors. The coalition of defense attorneys who had agreed to help inmates with their cases says it completed work on all the applications it received. \"Of course we'd be delighted to continue, but we have to wait to see whether the next president says whether he will or will not pursue this,\" he said. President-elect Trump hasn't talked about his pardon policy, and his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, defended the mandatory minimum sentences that Obama commuted with his actions.

Secret Service agent Doug Barnett is also on the lookout for cyberattacks.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Gambians cheers in the city of Bakau on Thursday after watching a broadcast of Adama Barrow being sworn in as Gambian president at the Gambian Embassy in Dakar, Senegal. AP Updated 4:30 p.m. ET West African troops have crossed the border with Gambia in an effort to uphold the result of the country's presidential election by force. The winner of the Dec. 1 vote, Adama Barrow, was officially sworn in as president at the country's embassy in neighboring Senegal earlier this afternoon. But Gambia's longtime leader, Yahya Jammeh, has refused to quit power despite mounting regional and international pressure. The battle for power between two men who both claim to be president of Gambia has plunged Africa's smallest country into uncertainty. \u2014 Adama Barrow (@adama_barrow) January 19, 2017 \"A newly sworn in President Barrow appealed to neighboring countries for help,\" NPR's Eyder Peralta reported. \"And now troops from Nigeria, Senegal and other countries have entered Gambia.\" U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the United States supports the military intervention by ECOWAS, the West African regional bloc. \"We support it because we understand that the purpose is to help stabilize a tense situation and to try to observe the will of the people of the Gambia,\" he said. Article continues after sponsorship U.S. forces are not involved, Kirby added, and U.S. citizens in Gambia are advised to shelter in place. In Barrow's inaugural speech, he emphasized the historic nature of his win: \"This is the first time since The Gambia became independent in 1965 that Gambians have changed their government through the ballot box.\" Jammeh initially accepted the result of the Dec. 1 election. But a week later, he dramatically reversed course and claimed that the election results are illegitimate. He later announced a state of emergency, and on Wednesday, the parliament extended his term for three months. \"Exceptional circumstances have compelled me to be sworn here today,\" Barrow said at the televised ceremony in Dakar. \"My right as a winner to be sworn in and assume the office of president is constitutionally guaranteed and irreversible. ... I therefore call on all civilians and military personnel of the state to support my presidency, since it is built on a constitutional foundation.\" Barrow, a businessman, vowed to pursue \"comprehensive reforms.\" He fled to Senegal for his own protection \u2014 like thousands of other Gambians in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council has backed a resolution in support of the new leader. The council voted unanimously to adopt the resolution, which \"expresses its full support to the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) in its commitment to ensure, by political means first, the respect of the will of the people of The Gambia as expressed in the results of 1st December elections.\" The resolution also stressed that Gambian defense and security forces have a \"duty and obligation to place themselves at the disposal of the democratically elected authorities.\" The African Union has stated that its recognition of Jammeh's authority would end with the end of his term on Wednesday, at the stroke of midnight. Jammeh has an abysmal human rights record and has vowed to rule the country for \"a billion years.\" ",

(Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) 1998 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE When the Trump extended family gathered at Arlington National Cemetery on Thursday, it was incoming first daughter Ivanka Trump\u00a0\u2014 in striking kelly green\u00a0\u2014 who stood out, even more than her stepmother, incoming first lady Melania Trump. During a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns, Ivanka popped with color in a green dress with a matching coat featuring super-sized ruffled lapels and a tulip-shaped hem. Ivanka was wearing the outfit when she arrived from New York aboard a military jet with the rest of her family Thursday morning at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. in suburban Maryland. As the children, spouses and grandchildren of the president-elect and Vice President-elect Mike Pence gathered, Melania blended in with the family's mostly black attire, in a black coat over a fitted black dress.

The color green, according to color psychology , is the color associated with such things as new life, nature, growth, energy and renewal. It's also the color of money, finances, banking, ambition, jealousy and Wall Street. President-elect Trump and wife Melania Trump at Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, Jan. 19, 2017. \u00a0(Photo: Chris Kleponis / POOL, EPA) It was an early sign, if not intended, that Ivanka is going to be more in the spotlight than Melania as Donald Trump's administration gets underway on Friday. Will Ivanka Trump be the most influential first daughter in decades? After the inaugural celebrations are over early Saturday morning, Melania is expected to head back to New York and Trump Tower, where she and her 10-year-old son, Trump's youngest child Barron, will remain for at least the first six months until Barron finishes up the school year. Ivanka and her husband,  New York real-estate tycoon Jared Kushner, who is taking a job as a senior counselor to his father-in-law, will settle in to their pricey new home in Washington's pricey Kalorama neighborhood with their three children, Arabella, 4, Joseph, 2, and Theodore, who turns 1 in March.

Earlier, Trump and his wife, appeared at a\u00a0luncheon in a ballroom at his own hotel in Washington, where he met with GOP congressional leaders.\u00a0At the luncheon, Trump invited Melania to speak; she told the crowd, \"Tomorrow we're starting the work,\" adding that \"there's a lot of possibility and a lot to take care of.\" Posted!

While hundreds of enemy combatants and terror suspects have been through the facility since the war on terror began - with many returning to the fight - the most hardcore Al Qaeda operatives ever captured remain there. They are too dangerous to set free, and no one else wants them. During its peak, Gitmo held some 778 suspected Al Qaeda operatives. Obama acclerated the policy of his predecessor, President Bush, to free those deemed to no longer be a risk. Within the last week, another 14 were released from the facility, and turned over to other countries willing to hold them. But the federal government admits that once they leave Gitmo, there's no guarantee their new countries will keep them locked up. And the Pentagon has estimated that at least 30 percent returned to the battlefield, killing Americans and their allies. Expand / Contract Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is shown in this file photograph during his arrest on March 1, 2003. (Reuters Photo) \u201cThe policy of closing Guantanamo Bay has made America less safe,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \u201cThe best way to gather intelligence long term to help prevent Islamic terror attacks is by capturing those engaged in Islamic terror groups and questioning them over a long period of time.\u201d The Trump administration will reverse Obama\u2019s policy and keep Gitmo open, Johnson predicted. \u201cAs long as the war on terror continues, as long as Islamic terrorists want to attack the civilized world including the U.S. and U.S. interests, we ought to try to find them, and where we can, capture them and question them,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we would handcuff ourselves and not have a detention facility.\u201d During the terms of President Bush, who opened Gitmo after 9/11, the prisoner count swelled to 779. It had dropped to 242 when Obama took office, and now stands at 41. Still at Gitmo for more than a decade are some of the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d Johnson said. The most famous - and most dangerous - occupant is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani senior Al Qaeda \u201crecruiter, financer and operational planner\u201d who the Pentagon calls the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the 9-11 attacks. The 52-year-old terrorist also was indicted for his role in the Feb. 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Retired Army Maj. Gen. Jay Hood, who oversaw the detention facility, and who has personally interviewed many of the terrorists there, said clearly Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other top Al Qaeda operatives \u201cshould never leave.\u201d \u00a0 In this undated photo provided by Flashpoint Partners, a man who Flashpoint has identified as confessed 9/11 architect Ramzi Binalshibh is shown. (AP Photo) Also remaining at Gitmo: Abd al Aziz Ali, 40, a citizen of Pakistan and an Al Qaeda senior member and planner. His military records show that under the direction of his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, he helped plan 9/11 and was involved in numerous other plots against the US. Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, 52, a citizen of Saudi Arabia , is considered \u201cone of Al Qaeda\u2019s most skilled, capable and prolific operational coordinators.\u201d With a long jihadist history, he and has been linked to as many as a dozen plots to attack U.S. and western interests including the successful bombing of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen on Oct. 12, 2000. He reported directed to Usama bin Laden, according to the U.S. military. Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, 56, a citizen of Iraq, is a senior member of Al Qaeda, according to the U.S. military, which determined that in addition to serving as an accountant and commander for the terror network, al Iraqi also initiated attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan. Mustafa Ahmed al Hawsawi, 48, a citizen of Saudi Arabia , is a senior Al Qaeda member who served as a \u201cfacilitator, financial manager and media committee member\u201d his records show. He is accused of planning the movement of 9-11 hijackers and helping to obtain financing for the terror plot. Ramzi Bin al Shibh, a citizen of Yemen , is a senior Al Qaeda operative who, according to his military file, was the \u201ccoordinator\u201d of the 9-11 attacks. Walid Bin Attash, a citizen of Yemen , is a senior Al Qaeda operative who served as a trusted bodyguard for Bin Laden. His military file said the 38-year-old helped coordinate and acquire materials for the USS Cole bombing. After reviewing the background of many of those still at Gitmo, Hood said it is \u201cobvious why other countries around the world do not want to take them off our hands.\u201d Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

Amy Zantzinger, a social secretary for Ms. Bush, recalls walking out the White House gate just before noon on that day in 2009 as Michael Smith, the Obamas\u2019 decorator, was coming in. \u201cMrs. Obama\u2019s priority that day was getting the girls\u2019 rooms settled in time for bedtime that night,\u201d Ms. Zantzinger said about the first daughters, then 7 and 10. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A transition official close to Mrs. Trump, speaking on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to talk about the move-in process, said she was working closely with an interior designer to redo parts of the White House residence. (The official also would not address reports that Mrs. Trump, a former model, would install a well-lit \u201cglam room\u2019\u2019 for makeup and hair preparations.) She has enlisted Jessica Boulanger, a senior vice president of communications at the Business Roundtable who has an interest in fashion design, on a volunteer basis to help her establish an East Wing team. Mr. Trump is planning to swap the curtains in the Oval Office \u2014 currently a deep shade of red \u2014 for those used by a previous president, according to a person familiar with the exchange. At the White House, aides have been plotting the move for weeks. They compiled briefing books for the incoming first family with color photographs and architectural drawings of all the rooms in the residence, including what furniture and artwork are available. Curators, who keep computerized inventories of artifacts that are in the permanent collection of the White House and those that have been brought in as gifts or personal items, police the process to ensure that exiting presidents do not leave with anything that does not belong to them. It does not always go seamlessly. Bill and Hillary Clinton had to return nearly $50,000 worth of gifts they took with them when they left the White House in 2001. These were eventually determined to be the property of the National Park Service, which oversees the White House. \u201cThe Clintons were partying up until 3 a.m. the night before, so it was much more of a frantic turnaround for the residence staff to move in the Bushes\u2019 stuff,\u201d Ms. McBride said. When it came time for Mrs. Bush, a librarian, to transition out of the White House, she added, she made sure the process was orderly, starting in the summer of 2008 when she began gradually moving belongings to the family\u2019s ranch in Crawford, Tex. The newly sworn-in president and first lady typically return to the White House after a lunch at the Capitol and are greeted by the chief usher, who makes sure they are comfortable for a few moments before they head out again to a viewing stand on Pennsylvania Avenue to watch the inaugural parade. \u201cThey\u2019ll come and go quickly, which is just as well,\u201d Ms. Monkman said, \u201cbecause there is still so much to do.\u201d Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

Hero Images/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Hero Images/Getty Images An overhaul of Obamacare could still change health coverage for people who get insurance on the job at large companies. Hero Images/Getty Images If you think that you wouldn't be touched by a Republican overhaul of Obamacare because you get health insurance through your job at a big company, think again. Several of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in March 2010). It's not yet clear how President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. They have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the Senate to fully repeal the current statute. So they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. But they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented. Nonetheless, as tensions grow in Washington over the future of the health law, it is important to understand some of its effects on large-group plans. Article continues after sponsorship No copays for preventive services The health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. But Obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. Under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. The services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. The change that affects the most people on an ongoing basis is likely the requirement that plans cover without cost sharing all methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (There are limited exceptions for religious employers.) \"In terms of sustained costs, birth control is probably the biggest,\" said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. No annual or lifetime limits on coverage Even the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. The health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits . Annual cap on out-of-pocket payments for covered services The health law set limits on how much people can be required to pay in deductibles, copayments or coinsurance every year for covered care they receive from providers in their network. In 2017, the limit is $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families. \"Many employers often had an out-of-pocket limit anyway, but this guarantees protection for people with high needs,\" said JoAnn Volk, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, who has written on this issue . Adult kids' coverage expanded The law allowed workers to keep their children on their plans until they reach age 26, even if they're married, financially independent and live in another state. Republicans have said they may keep this popular provision in place if they dismantle the law. Guaranteed external appeal rights Consumers who disagree with a health plan's decision to deny benefits or payment for services can appeal the decision to an independent review panel. The provision applies to all new health plans including those offered by self-funded companies that pay their workers' claims directly and who were previously exempt from appeals requirements. No waiting periods to join a plan Employers used to be able to make new employees wait indefinitely before they were eligible for coverage under the company plan. No more. Now the waiting time for coverage can be no more than 90 days. No waiting periods for coverage of pre-existing conditions Prior to the ACA, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. Under the ACA, that's no longer allowed. As a practical matter, though, coverage of pre-existing conditions was rarely an issue in large-group plans, say some health insurance analysts. Repeal could reopen the door to that prohibited practice, however. Standardized plan descriptions The law requires all plans to provide a \" summary of benefits and coverage \" in a standard format that allows consumers to understand their coverage and make apples-to-apples plan comparisons. Basic coverage standards for large-group plans The health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. They aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. But the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a \" minimum-value \" standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. Those that don't could face a fine. Initially, the online calculator that the federal Department of Health and Human Services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year. Now plans must provide at least that coverage to meet federal standards. The result: Large employers generally no longer offer so-called \"mini-med\" policies with very skimpy benefits. If the health law is repealed, that could change. In some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, \"they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it\" to help make the premiums more affordable, said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health, a membership organization representing large employers. Although the law strengthened coverage for people in large-group plans in several ways, consumer advocates have complained about shortcomings. It aimed to ensure that coverage is affordable by requiring that individuals be responsible for paying no more than 9.69 percent of their household income for individual employer coverage, for example. If their insurance costs more than that, workers can shop for coverage on the marketplaces set up by the health law and be eligible for premium tax credits \u2014 if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). But the standard does not take into consideration any additional costs for family coverage . Consumer advocates also point to the wellness regulations as a problematic area of the law. The health law increased the financial incentives that employers can offer workers for participating in workplace wellness programs to 30 percent of the cost of individual coverage, up from 20 percent. Such incentives can effectively coerce people into participating and sharing private medical information, critics charge, and unfairly penalize sick people. \"It potentially allows [plans] to discriminate against people with medical conditions, which the ACA is supposed to eliminate,\" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center.

    "text": "Moscow Nightclub Hosts Early Trump Inauguration Party By nataliya vasilyeva, associated press MOSCOW \u0097 Jan 19, 2017, 5:48 PM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press Entertainer Willi Tokarev, center, an 82-year-old Russian emigre to the U.S. appears during a nightclub party entitled \"Trumplissimo America!\" in Moscow, Russia, on Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017. Twenty-four hours before Donald Trump is to be sworn in as president of the United States, people gathered at a Moscow nightclub to celebrate his inauguration. (AP Photo/Ivan Sekretarev) 0 Shares Email Twenty-four hours before Donald Trump was to be sworn in as president of the United States, several dozen people packed a Moscow nightclub to get a head start on celebrating. \"Trump, Trump \u2014 it is unbelievable. Trump, Trump, he's a superman, Trump, Trump \u2014 symbol of America. Trump, Trump, he's really president,\" the Thursday evening crowd at Arbat 13 heard an 82-year-old, Soviet-born crooner sing in English. The small jazz club located a stone's throw from the Stalin-era tower housing Russia's foreign ministry might have been early, but it isn't the only place in the capital that Ronald Reagan associated with an \"evil empire\" to be toasting Trump. Across from the U.S. embassy compound in central Moscow, the Russian Army store put up a poster with the incoming president's picture to advertise inauguration day discounts of 10 percent for embassy employees and American citizens. \"Russians celebrate a lot. We celebrate Russian holidays, foreign holidays. I welcome it because it's not a secret that Russians were glad that Trump won,\" Arbat 13 club owner Igor Khaletsky said when asked why Russians would want to party in honor of a U.S. president. Months before the November election, Russian lawmakers openly rooted for Trump. Kremlin officials also made remarks which clearly indicated Moscow preferred to see the wealthy businessman in the White House rather than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. President Vladimir Putin took a parting shot at the Obama administration this week, accusing it of trying to undermine Trump's legitimacy with fake allegations and \"binding the president-elect hand and foot to prevent him from fulfilling his election promises.\" Both Putin and other top Russian officials have dismissed an unsubstantiated dossier outlining unverified claims that Trump engaged in sexual activities with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel, calling it a \"rude provocation.\" The inauguration party on Thursday at the underground jazz club just off Moscow's main tourist drag attracted a curious crowd: Canadian tourists, an American personal trainer, Russian friends of the night's performers, and the owner of a provincial restaurant called Trump. \"I thought this was like a comedy event, more of a spoof of the fact,\" said Joe MacInnes, a Canadian who came with two friends and was slightly bewildered. \"Are they making fun of the fact that the world thinks that Russia is supporting Trump?\" The guests were entertained by obscure Russian jazz acts, stand-up comedians, a Russian band called The Trump Band, and a teenager who grew up in the United States and sang a karaoke version of \"Strangers In the Night.\" The Trump Band plays every weekend at a steakhouse in Tula, a city 170 kilometers (106 miles) south of Moscow near the birthplace of novelist Leo Tolstoy. Owner Natalya Palladicheva, who opened the restaurant two years ago, named it Trump after the English word that means a high-ranking hand of cards. She didn't like the sound of the Russian equivalent. Burdened with the association, Palladicheva after the November election introduced a \"Donald Trump menu,\" which features an 18-centimeter (7-inch) -high hamburger. \"It's a joke of course,\" Palladicheva explained while attending the pre-inauguration party at the jazz club. \"We all want relations between Russia and American to improve, particularly for Russia.\" At the table across from her, two middle-aged men, dressed in black and wearing cargo pants, were eating burgers with Bologna sausage. One of them, a personal trainer from California, called it a Trump burger. \"There's nothing to be afraid of\" in Russia, said Jim Barcena, who has been coming to Russia to train professional boxers since 2009. \"It's the governments that pit us against each other. The positive thing is, apparently Putin and Trump have a nice relationship. I hope it's for real.\" Trump's open admiration of Putin has created expectations of improved relations between Washington and Moscow. Trump has not yet articulated a clear policy on Russia, and some of his Cabinet nominees have voiced decidedly hawkish stances. In turn, Putin has expressed hope that \"common sense will prevail\" and Russia and the United States will be able to normalize relations once Trump takes office Friday. The Thursday night event at Arbat 13 club was the first of at least two private parties scheduled in Moscow to celebrate Trump's passage from president-elect to commander in chief. Willi Tokarev, 82, a singer who emigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1970s and soon became a music legend, topped the entertainment bill with his song \"Trumplissimo America!\" \"Trump, Trump - symbol of America. Trump, Trump, he's really president,\" the mustachioed Tokarev sang on a tiny stage with the Russian and American flags hanging behind him. Tokarev, whose real first name \u2014 Vilen \u2014 is a portmanteau word for Vladimir Lenin , told The Associated Press he wrote the song after friends who also know Trump asked him to compose something. He was glad to help. \"I saw that this person is able to make the country the way he wants it to be because he does not need anything for himself. He's got everything,\" Tokarev said. \"If these two leaders... can find common language, they can bring order to the world.\" 0 Shares ",

    "text": "'What if women...?' Thousands prepare to answer with a march on Washington Sue Fernandez Barbara Demick / Los Angeles Times Sue Fernandez is joining a protest for the first time in her life. Sue Fernandez is joining a protest for the first time in her life. (Barbara Demick / Los Angeles Times) Barbara Demick and Laura King At the age of 74, Sue Fernandez has lived through the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and the invasion of Iraq without joining a single protest. She was busy raising three sons and working full time as a pharmaceutical researcher. She took some pride in staying out of politics. That was before the 2016 presidential election, a campaign that might have ushered in America\u2019s first woman president, but did not. This week, Fernandez boarded a plane for the East Coast, making her way to Washington, D.C. There, she will join an estimated 200,0000 others Saturday for the Women\u2019s March on Washington \u2014 a massive display of female political will scheduled to unfold on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital the day after Donald Trump is inaugurated as the nation\u2019s 45th\u00a0president. \u201cThis is the first time I felt compelled,\u201d said Fernandez, sitting at her kitchen table in a golf course retirement community on the outskirts of\u00a0Phoenix, methodically reviewing a handwritten list of supplies\u00a0(granola bars, clear plastic tote, subway card). \u201cThis thing has become so much bigger than any of us alone.\u201d At first, Fernandez hadn\u2019t been too fussed about the presidential election. But then she thought of all her ailing older friends and how dependent for their care they all are on immigrants from Latin America\u00a0\u2014 some possibly targeted for deportation under Trump\u2019s administration. She thought about her daughter-in-law, an African American attorney, and her biracial grandchildren, all of whom worry about Trump\u2019s commitment to civil rights. The Washington march and simultaneous demonstrations across in the country are taking shape as one of the largest mass demonstrations in recent U.S. history, rivaling the civil unrest that swirled around the Vietnam War. While it\u2019s not expected to be as large as the Million Man March against racism in 1995 or the Million Woman March two years later in in Philadelphia, the event could wind up being a bigger draw than Trump:\u00a01,200 bus parking spaces have been reserved, three times as many as for the inauguration Friday. The march embraces a grab bag of progressive causes, its website listing more than 300 partners promoting causes including anti-bullying,\u00a0gun control, climate change and transgender rights. And it\u2019s not only women. Men from across the country will be part of the demonstrations. Two of Fernandez\u2019s three sons are participating in marches, while the third is staying home so his wife can march. The fact that so many diverse groups have joined has already sparked some tension. Organizers have wrestled with conflicting agendas of race and sexual orientation.\u00a0African American women initially questioned whether they would be adequately represented, leading some more conservative white women to question whether they would be welcomed. A group of antiabortion feminists was disinvited as a full-fledged partner. Fernandez, who describes herself as an \u201costrich\u201d politically, has seen the polarization of American society show up even in her retirement community. One woman in her social circle dropped her as a tennis partner after learning that she voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI sit with these women in church. I just want to say, I still like you. I still want to play tennis with you,\u201d\u00a0said Fernandez, who will march with family members including her 7-year-old granddaughter. \u201cI\u2019m not an angry person. I don\u2019t like confrontation. I don\u2019t see the march as anti-Trump. But it is important for us to get out there and support the freedoms that we have worked so hard for. If not for my generation, than the next.\u201d Linda Whittlesey, 60, a massage therapist and jewelry designer, is undertaking an eight-hour drive, then a flight and a bus to get to Washington from the outskirts of Missoula, Mont. Linda Whittlesey is traveling to Washington from Montana. Linda Whittlesey is traveling to Washington from Montana. Linda Whittlesey is traveling to Washington from Montana. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a march in my life, but I figured, if not now then when?\u201d\u00a0she said.\u00a0\u201cWe often have these ideas of we should have, we wish we had, we ought to have.\u2026\u00a0 We all now just better do whatever we can.\u201d Living in Montana, which she calls \u201ca little slice of paradise where I\u2019m secure in my bubble,\u201d\u00a0Whittlesey has been increasingly looking outside herself at the threats she believes are facing her country. In her litany of worries, she lists climate change and the threatened demise of the Affordable Care Act. She worries that someone could start a new war. \u201cThese are not, strictly speaking, women\u2019s issues, but I can\u2019t separate women\u2019s issues from human issues,\u201d\u00a0Whittlesey said. Exactly what is drawing all these women \u2014 and many men \u2014 to make the often long and costly pilgrimage to Washington is often very individual. For some women, the gathering is an elegy to the dream of electing a female president. Others see it as an affirmation of the progressive causes championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination. \u201cWomen are marching for each other,\u201d said co-organizer Winnie Wong, a 40-year-old digital strategist credited with creating the hashtag #feelthebern for Sanders. Wong said she is concerned not for herself or her colleagues, but for lower-income women. \u201cWe never talk about the women who work at Wal-Mart, who work in every service center, the ones who are raising their children,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to help lift them up.\u201d For some, the voyage to Washington is deeply personal. Driving cross-country from Long Beach to Washington in a rented red Ford Focus, Nicolassa Galvez said she was motivated by her experience of being sexually molested as a child\u00a0by a family friend. \u201cHaving basically the president of the United States not held accountable [for his behavior with women] was kind of a personal slap in the face, and just made me worry for my own safety and the safety of other women, because I think people will look up to him,\u201d\u00a0Galvez said. \u201cIt gives permission.\u201d Some marchers are striving to keep the spotlight on opportunity and potential, rather than on grievances. Lauren Hagler, a 24-year-old African American who is pursuing her doctorate In chemistry at the University of Illinois, says\u00a0she hopes\u00a0to be an inspiration for younger women who aspire to a career in science. \u201cWhen I was deciding to pursue my doctorate, I wanted to be someone who the next generation of African American girls can look to,\u201d she said. Among the delegations is a Dallas-based group of antiabortion feminists.

    "text": "Mexico extradites drug lord 'El Chapo' Guzman to US Published               January 19, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 The U.S. Justice Department issued a statement confirming that Guzman was en route to the United States and expressed gratitude to Mexico for its cooperation. A senior U.S. official said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration took custody of Guzman in Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and a plane carrying him departed for New York at 5:31 p.m. EST. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and agreed to give the information only if not quoted by name. The convicted Sinaloa cartel boss had been held most recently at a prison near Ciudad Juarez. He was recaptured a year ago after escaping from a second maximum-security prison through a tunnel dug to his cell. The 2015 escape was highly embarrassing for the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, and Mexican officials were seen as eager to hand the headache off to the United States afterward. Guzman's lawyers have fought extradition since his recapture. Guzman, who is in his late 50s, faces the possibility of life in a U.S. prison under multiple indictments in six jurisdictions around the United States, including New York, San Diego, Chicago and Miami. A federal indictment in the Eastern District of New York, where Guzman is expected to be prosecuted, accuses him of overseeing a trafficking cartel with thousands of members and billions of dollars in profits laundered back to Mexico. It says Guzman and other members of the Sinaloa cartel employed hit men who carried out murders, kidnappings and acts of torture. He was first indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury in July 2009. A superseding indictment was issued in May charging him and Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada with a variety of drug, gun and money laundering charges as part of an ongoing criminal enterprise. The Mexican Foreign Relations Department's statement said a court had ruled against Guzman's appeal and found that his extradition would be constitutional. \"The criminal Joaquin Guzman Loera was extradited this afternoon to face his pending legal cases,\" Mexican Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong tweeted. Guzman's first prison break was in 2001. He spent more than a decade at large before being captured in 2014. The following year he broke out through the mile-long tunnel dug directly to the shower in his cell. It was while on the lam a second time, in fall 2015, that he held a secret meeting with actors Sean Penn and Kate del Castillo. The encounter was the subject of a lengthy article Penn published in Rolling Stone last January, right after Mexican marines re-arrested Guzman in the western state of Sinaloa. Guzman was initially returned to the Altiplano prison outside Mexico City where he escaped through the tunnel. Last May, officials abruptly moved him to the prison in the desert near Juarez. The White House, which was down to a skeleton staff hours before Trump takes office, said it had no immediate comment. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Advertisement ",

    "text": "Rick Perry Regrets Call to Close Energy Department By CORAL DAVENPORT Photo Rick Perry at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Rick Perry , the former Texas governor and President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee as energy secretary, said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that he regretted having recommended the abolition of the Energy Department in the past. He addressed his awkward history on the issue up front, telling the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that after \u201cbeing briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy,\u201d he no longer believed, as he said while running for president in 2011, that it should be eliminated. Mr. Perry also offered a full-throated reversal of his views on the science of human-caused climate change , which he called a \u201ccontrived, phony mess\u201d in a 2010 book. \u201cI believe the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-made activity. The question is: How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn\u2019t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy or American jobs?\u201d Mr. Trump, by contrast, has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and has continued to express doubts about established climate science. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Perry also appeared to signal a somewhat different position from Mr. Trump on nuclear weapons policy, the Energy Department\u2019s chief portfolio. Mr. Trump has said the United States must \u201cgreatly strengthen and expand\u201d its nuclear capability, \u201c Let it be an arms race ,\u201d he said. But Mr. Perry, asked by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, whether he believed expanded testing of nuclear weapons was a \u201cdangerous idea,\u201d replied, \u201cI think anyone would be of the opinion that if we never have to test another nuclear weapon that would be a good thing for the world.\u201d He added, \u201cI think nonproliferation is a good thing.\u201d Asked if he would support the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 which Mr. Trump has derided and which was largely negotiated by the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz \u2014 Mr. Perry said he had not received classified briefings on it. \u201cIf D.O.E. has a role to make sure that Iranians are living up to the deal, message delivered, sir,\u201d Mr. Perry said to Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Video Perry on Energy: \u2018I Regret Recommending Its Elimination\u2019 Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee for the Department of Energy, Rick Perry, answered questions on his past statements about the department and on climate change. By REUTERS. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Last month, when Mr. Trump offered Mr. Perry the job of energy secretary, he accepted with the understanding that the role would be largely focused on promoting American energy development, according to people who have briefed him. Only later did he learn that the agency\u2019s central portfolio is the oversight and management of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex, as well as 17 national scientific laboratories. \u201cThis confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,\u201d Mr. Perry said, citing his conversations with Mr. Moniz, a nuclear physicist. He highlighted his experience as an Air Force pilot from 1972 to 1977 as among his qualifications to oversee the nuclear weapons complex. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Democrats pressed him sharply on his views on climate science, noting that the Energy Department is a major science agency, with thousands of research scientists across the country. Democrats expressed concern that his past views, so at odds with established mainstream science, could be a serious impediment. Advertisement They also pressed him on reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s team is considering making cuts to the Energy Department\u2019s offices of energy efficiency, renewable energy and fossil energy. The last is focused on research to lower planet-warming carbon emissions. Mr. Perry said he was unaware of such reports. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll have the same experience I had and forget that they said that,\u201d he said to laughter, referring to the moment in a 2011 presidential debate when, asked which agencies he wanted to eliminate, he could not recall the name of the Energy Department. What Mr. Perry later called his \u201coops\u201d moment was widely seen as sinking his campaign. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said, \u201cLike many of my colleagues, I am deeply concerned by some of the things that Governor Perry has said in the past about climate science.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Department of Energy\u2019s scientific horsepower is key to understanding these trends. I hope you can understand there is widespread anxiety about President-elect Trump\u2019s intention to dismantle these scientific capabilities or simply just starve them for resources.\u201d Ms. Cantwell pushed Mr. Perry on whether he would protect the agency\u2019s budget for climate science. \u201cI\u2019m going to protect all the science, whether it\u2019s related to climate and all other aspects of what we are doing,\u201d he replied. Ms. Cantwell also asked Mr. Perry about a questionnaire sent to Energy Department employees by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team that appeared to target the agency\u2019s climate science research. Mr. Perry disavowed the questionnaire, saying it was sent out before he was selected as the nominee. \u201cI didn\u2019t approve it, I don\u2019t approve it, I didn\u2019t need the information, I don\u2019t want that information,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I manage.\u201d The hearing was leavened with some humor. Asked by Mr. Franken, who had earlier pushed him sharply on nuclear weapons and climate change in his Senate office, \u201cDid you enjoy meeting me?\u201d Mr. Perry responded, \u201cI hope you are as much fun on the dais as you were on your couch,\u201d before adding, \u201cMay I rephrase that, sir?\u201d \u201cPlease. Please,\u201d Mr. Franken replied. \u201cOh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord.\u201d \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve found our \u2018 Saturday Night Live \u2019 sound bite,\u201d Mr. Perry said. ",

But Assange retreated from his pledge , arguing via his lawyers that what he was really asking for was an immediate pardon for the ex-Army analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that what President Obama did is not what Assange was seeking,\u201d said Barry Pollack, who represents the WikiLeaks chief in the United States. \u201cMr. Assange was saying that Chelsea should never have been prosecuted, never have been sentenced to decades in prison, and should have been released immediately.\u201d Then on Thursday, Assange said he\u2019s \u201calways been willing to go to the United States provided that my rights are respected because this is a case that should never have occurred.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to having a conversation with the DoJ about what the correct way forward is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say of course that they should immediately drop their case or they should unseal their extradition request, if they have one, unseal their charges, if they have one.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m confident about winning any U.S. case that is respecting the law in the United States, because Wikileaks is a publisher and as a publisher our activities are protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Assange has spent more than four years in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, refusing to meet prosecutors in Sweden, where he\u2019s wanted on a rape allegation. He has feared he would be extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges if he leaves the embassy. Regarding Manning, Assange said on Thursday, \u201cWe are very, very happy\u201d that she received clemency.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a major strategic victory to have achieved that, both for Chelsea Manning and everything that she has had to suffer over the last seven years,\u201d he said. Manning, whose name was Bradley at the time of her arrest in 2010, worked as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. She was convicted in 2013 in military court of six violations of the Espionage Act and 14 other offenses for providing to WikiLeaks more than 700,000 secret military and State Department documents, as well as battlefield videos.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

I'm the messenger,\" Trump said at the Lincoln Memorial. \"We all got tired of seeing what was happening and we wanted change but we wanted real change,\" he said. \"On the campaign I called it the forgotten man and the forgotten woman,\" he said. \"Well, you're not forgotten anymore. That I can tell you. Not forgotten anymore.\" Trump said that he didn't care if the weather was nice or not for the inauguration because \"I'm going to be cheering you on -- you're going to be cheering me on but I'm going to cheer you on. \"We are going to make America great again, and I'll add greater than ever before,\" Trump said. This wasn't the first time Trump made public comments today. When he arrived in the nation's capital earlier today, he used a leadership luncheon as an opportunity to boast about his Cabinet picks. Evan Vucci/AP Photos President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President-elect Mike Pence places a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns, Jan. 19, 2017, at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va. \"We have by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever assembled,\" he said. Trump highlighted Rep. Tom Price, his pick for secretary of health and human services, who was at the Trump International Hotel luncheon.

Bush and his wife, Barbara, are both doing relatively well after being hospitalized with respiratory ailments, a family spokesman said Thursday. \"President Bush had a good night's rest and remains in stable condition in the ICU at Houston Methodist Hospital,\" spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. Doctors are evaluating him for \"extubation\" \u2014 removing him from a ventilator \u2014 \"and we are hopeful he will be discharged from the ICU in a few days,\" he said. George Bush, 92, was hospitalized Saturday for shortness of breath, and underwent a procedure to treat an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia, according to McGrath.

Richard Wolf , USA TODAY Published 12:41 p.m. ET Jan. 19, 2017 | Updated 2 hours ago CLOSE x Share With Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration almost here, one group is making a last-ditch social media effort to keep the President-elect from taking office. Nathan Rousseau Smith reports. Buzz60 Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts arrives for President Obama's second swearing-in at the West Front of the Capitol in January 2013. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) 4006 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 164 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON \u2014 Before the first votes were cast for president in last year's primaries and caucuses, Donald Trump picked a fight with John Roberts. \"Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster ,\" Trump said a year ago, dropping the title of chief justice that makes Roberts first among equals on the Supreme Court. \"He turned out to be an absolute disaster, because he gave us Obamacare.\" Shortly after noon Friday, \u00a0the 17th chief justice of the United States will deliver the oath of office to the 45th president of the United States. It could be the start of a match made in heaven \u2014 or the high point of a rocky\u00a0relationship. If Trump gets to replace more than one justice during his presidency, it would cement the court's conservative majority and Roberts' place at its helm, an Election Day gift that could have been coal if Hillary Clinton had won the White House. If, on the other hand, potential policy forays such as a ban on Muslim immigration or\u00a0 ethics entanglements involving Trump's real estate empire prompt\u00a0constitutional challenges, Roberts' court could become the final arbiter of Trump's fate. \"He is unlikely to look favorably upon actions of the Trump administration that might really run afoul of well-established principles of our Constitution and the way our government normally operates,\" says Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, who led a 10-year review of Roberts' record last year. Read more: Chief Justice John Roberts' Supreme Court at 10, defying labels While Trump has vowed to nominate a doctrinaire conservative in the next few weeks to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia , Roberts' brand of conservatism over 11\u00a0years has been harder to define. He sided with the court's majority in the landmark Citizens United case that allowed for unlimited independent corporate spending on elections, and he wrote the decision striking\u00a0down the key section\u00a0of the Voting Rights Act . But he twice rescued President Obama's signature Affordable Care Act from annihilation, a task that Trump and the Republican Congress have vowed to take on. Now a chief justice who endured a testy relationship with Obama faces a potentially stormy one with Trump, who prefers bold strokes to Roberts' minimalist brand of jurisprudence. TWO VERY DIFFERENT STYLES The two conservative leaders could not be more different. Where Trump is bellicose, Roberts is circumspect. Given various opportunities to comment on Trump's rhetoric or congressional Republicans' refusal to fill Scalia's seat throughout 2016, the chief justice demurred. Chief Justice John Roberts attends President Obama's 2016 State of the Union address with fellow justices. \u00a0(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) Ironically, Trump's victory saved Roberts' role as a powerful chief justice. With a conservative rather than a liberal replacing Scalia, Roberts will remain in the majority on most rulings, allowing him to decide who writes the opinions. Had Hillary Clinton won the White House, her nominee likely would have thrust Roberts into a conservative minority and empowered Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal wing. Now Trump and Senate Republicans will deliver Roberts a fifth conservative justice. If the new president\u00a0chooses a hard-line conservative such as Alabama's William Pryor, who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, it could push Roberts further toward the middle. And if Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's swing vote, retires while Trump is president, Roberts could become the court's least reliable conservative. \"It does put him in a position where he can have a lot of influence, not only because he's chief justice,\u00a0but because of where he sits on the court,\" Gorod says. Supreme Court justices serve lifetime appointments, so their tenure usually traverses several presidencies. For Roberts, the billionaire real estate magnate will be his third \u2014 following George W. Bush, who named him chief justice, and Obama, who voted against him in the Senate. Roberts cut a modest figure before the Senate Judiciary Committee when making his case in September 2005. \"It's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat,\" he assured lawmakers. The Senate rewarded him with a 78-22 confirmation vote, a better percentage than the justices who have followed. His eight-year relationship with Obama began on a low note, when Roberts botched the oath of office before more than 1.8 million people who crowded the National Mall. To prevent a far-fetched challenge to Obama's presidency, the two repeated the oath inside the White House on Jan. 21. But Obama and Vice President Biden went out of their way to establish a relationship with the conservative-leaning court by visiting the justices a few days before the inauguration, something Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have not done because of conflicting schedules. On Thursday afternoon, Roberts met briefly with Trump at Blair House, across from the White House, to go over Friday's arrangements. BRICKBATS AND BAILOUTS There were troubles to come: In his 2010 State of the Union address, with Roberts in the front row of the House of Representatives, Obama criticized the court's Citizens United decision\u00a0to whoops of applause from Democrats. Roberts later described the experience as \"very troubling\" and questioned whether justices should continue to attend an annual ritual that has \"degenerated into a political pep rally.\" President Obama takes a botched oath of office from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2009. The two repeated the ceremony the following day inside the White House. \u00a0(Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USAT) In 2013, during the first round of Supreme Court debates over same-sex marriage , Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli why the president would continue to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act\u00a0while asking the justices to strike it down.\u00a0\"I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions,\" Roberts said. But in 2012 and again in 2015 , the chief justice bailed out Obama's signature health care law, ensuring the president would leave office with his biggest achievement largely intact.\u00a0\"Congress passed the\u00a0Affordable Care Act\u00a0to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\" Roberts said in 2015. While the first ruling saved the law and the second only its tax credits, both bore Roberts' distinctive brand of jurisprudence.\u00a0The court should not stick its neck too far out, he believes, deferring to the other branches of government wherever possible. It caused Scalia to quip that the law should be called \"SCOTUScare.\" The chief justice's\u00a0pragmatic view often aligned Roberts with the moderate judge Obama sought as Scalia's replacement, Merrick Garland . The two served together on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit 2003-05\u00a0and agreed on 85% of the cases they shared.\u00a0When they differed, however, it was usually over federal power \u2014 and there, Roberts' skepticism of executive branch authority could jibe with Trump's, who has vowed to scale back on Obama's use of executive actions.

    "text": "CBS/AP Jan 19, 2017 10:51 AM EST Former President George H.W. Bush, who has been placed in intensive care at a Houston hospital, is suffering from pneumonia and has vascular parkinsonism, a rare syndrome that mimics Parkinson\u2019s disease. The 92-year-old Bush also broke a vertebra in 2015 and has used a motorized scooter or a wheelchair in recent years.\u00a0 Family spokesman Jim McGrath says Bush is stable and resting comfortably at Houston Methodist Hospital after being admitted for an \u201cacute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia,\u201d reported CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca. Doctors intubated the 41st president on Wednesday for a procedure to protect and clear his airway. His wife, 91-year-old Barbara Bush , is also in the hospital as a precaution. She is not in the ICU. This is the former president\u2019s fourth hospital stay in five years, but McGrath says he is a fighter. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious situation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s 92. He has pneumonia. He\u2019s in the ICU. But again, you don\u2019t bet against George Bush.\u201d Here are some answers to common questions about the former president\u2019s health: What are the risks of pneumonia?\u00a0 Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be mild or severe. Elderly patients are at risk of deadly complications. The former president wrote to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 10, saying that he would be unable to attend Friday\u2019s inauguration because of doctor\u2019s orders : \u201cMy doctor says if I sit outside in January, it will likely put me six feet under. Same for Barbara. So I guess we\u2019re stuck in Texas.\u201d What is vascular parkinsonism? People diagnosed with the condition walk with shuffling steps, and brain scans suggest they have suffered small strokes. However, they do not have the characteristic tremors of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and they do not respond to drugs for Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cThey look like Parkinson\u2019s from the waist down. From the waist up, they look very expressive,\u201d said Dr. Alberto Espay of the University of Cincinnati\u2019s Gardner Neuroscience Institute. Is it different from Parkinson\u2019s disease? Yes. It does not get steadily worse in the same way Parkinson\u2019s does. Classic Parkinson\u2019s disease develops when cells that produce one of the brain\u2019s chemical messengers, called dopamine, begin to deteriorate and die. Dopamine transports signals to parts of the brain that control movement. Parkinson\u2019s symptoms appear after enough dopamine-producing cells die that there\u2019s too little of this neurotransmitter in the brain. Vascular parkinsonism can closely mimic a number of other disorders, including classic Parkinson\u2019s, progressive supranuclear palsy and excessive fluid on the brain. What has President Bush said about the condition? In a 2012 interview with Parade magazine, Bush said: \u201cIt just affects the legs. It\u2019s not painful. You tell your legs to move and they don\u2019t move. It\u2019s strange, but if you have to have some bad-sounding disease, this is a good one to get.\u201d Bush said the symptoms have been difficult for him, \u201cbecause I love being active, (playing) sports, being in the game. But you just face the reality and make the best of it.\u201d Who gets it? People in their 70s and older are most likely be diagnosed, said Dr. Tanya Simuni who conducts research on Parkinson\u2019s and other movement disorders at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. She calls it a \u201cdifficult diagnosis\u201d because of the lack of accurate diagnostic tests. The risk factors are the same as for stroke and heart disease: history of smoking , lack of exercise and poor diet. It\u2019s rarer than Parkinson\u2019s disease, which affects about 1 million Americans. In contrast, roughly 20,000 people have been told they have vascular parkinsonism. How is it treated? Since the condition does not respond well to drugs used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, treatment relies on lowering the risk factors for stroke . That means quitting smoking, exercising, eating a healthy diet and perhaps taking a daily aspirin. Preventing falls is important, so a patient may receive physical therapy to improve balance. What causes the disease? This is where answers get tricky. Conventional thinking says the disease is caused by strokes. But without a perfect test, lots of problems get lumped under the umbrella. Espay has written a paper questioning whether most parkinsonism is related to vascular disease. He\u2019s also debated the topic at a recent neurology conference. Is there a cure? Physical therapy can help with balance and walking, but the damage cannot be reversed, said Dr. Corneliu Luca, assistant professor of neurology at University of Miami. \u201cIf you do not control risk factors for stroke, they can have another stroke, and the walking can get even worse,\u201d Luca said. What complications are most worrisome? Falls are the biggest concern because they can lead to fractures, Simuni said. Bush took a spill in 2015 and fractured his C2 vertebra, the second one below the skull. It\u2019s not known whether that fall was directly related to parkinsonism. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "advertisement Aloha \u2014 Now sell me your land! Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly is suing hundreds of Hawaiians to compel them to sell the billionaire small plots of land they own that lie within a 700-acre property that Zuckerberg purchased on the island of Kauai two years ago for $100 million. Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the China Development Forum in Beijing in 2016. REUTERS/Shu Zhang Zuckberberg-controlled companies filed eight so-called \"quiet\" title lawsuits in a Kauai court on Dec. 30 requesting the forced sales at public auction to the highest bidder, which would allow him to make his secluded beach-front land on the island's north shore even more private, according the Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper. Currently, owners of the lands \u2014 which have been in their families for generations \u2014 have the rights to travel across Zuckerberg's property to get to their own lands. Their lands comprise slightly more than eight acres. Many of the defendants in the suits by the social media mogul are living, but some are dead. The defendants may hold just a tiny fraction of ownership in the parcels because they are several generations removed from the original owners, according to the paper's story on the cases. \u201cIn some cases, co-owners may not even be aware of their interests.\u201d The defendants had 20 days to respond to the suits, or forfeited their rights to a say in the proceedings. Zuckerberg's lawyer, Keoni Shultz of the firm Cades Schutte, in a statement to CNBC said, \"It is common in Hawaii to have small parcels of land within the boundaries of a larger tract, and for the title to these smaller parcels to have become broken or clouded over time.\" \"In some cases, co-owners may not even be aware of their interests,\" Shultz said. \"Quiet title actions are the standard and prescribed process to identify all potential co-owners, determine ownership, and ensure that, if there are other co-owners, each receives appropriate value for their ownership share.\" The cases target a dozen small plots of so-called \"kuleana\" lands that are inside the much larger property that Zuckerberg bought on Kauai. Kuleana lands are properties that were granted to native Hawaiians in the mid-1800s. Some of the people who own, or who are believed to own, lands targeted by Zuckerberg's suits are descendants of the original owners of the kuleana land. One suit, according to the Star-Advertiser, was filed against about 300 people who are descendants of an immigrant Portuguese sugar cane plantation worker who bought four parcels totaling two acres of land in 1894. One of that worker's great-grandchildren, Carlos Andrade, 72, lived on the property until recently, the paper said. But the retired university professor told the Star-Advertiser that he is helping Zuckerberg's case as a co-plaintiff in an effort to make sure the land is not surrendered to the county if no one in his extended clan steps up to take responsibility for paying property taxes on the plots. Andrade, in a letter to his known relatives, said he believed selling to Zuckerberg would ensure that the relatives get \"their fair share\" of their ancestor's investment in the property \u2014 while avoiding further dilution of the value of individual property shares due to the clan increasing in size, the paper reported. In the same letter, Andrade estimated that a large majority of his relatives are unaware that they have an ownership stake in the land.

By Philip Rucker By Philip Rucker January 18 at 7:59 PM Follow @PhilipRucker When President-elect Donald Trump successfully demanded that Carrier keep some manufacturing jobs from going to Mexico, he was criticized at first for bullying the heating and cooling giant and for violating the Republican Party\u2019s free-market capitalist ethos. In the eight weeks since, however, the atmosphere has changed dramatically. Almost daily, in Twitter missives as well as private meetings, Trump continues to hector businesses to make investments in the United States. And he is receiving credit for announcements from some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations \u2014 Bayer AG, General Motors and Walmart just this week \u2014 that they are keeping or adding U.S. jobs, even if their plans were developed long before his agitations. Trump is trying to put the bully back into the bully pulpit, modeling his governing style after Theodore Roosevelt, the president whose attacks on industry barons inspired the term. The Trump strategy is to change the behavior of corporations \u2014 not to mention the intelligence community and other creatures of Washington \u2014 through force of intimidation. His advisers talk about the president-elect\u2019s provocations, such as threatening a 35\u00a0percent tax on imports, not as policy destinations necessarily, but as boundaries designed to frame the discussion and instill fear in corporate boardrooms. \u201cTrump understands that if you change the culture, the behavior follows,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally and informal adviser. \u201cHe wants to create a Trumpian environment so that boards go into a meeting saying, \u2018No, we\u2019re not leaving the U.S.\u2019 \u201d (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s demands on the business community are among the most notable actions of the pre-inaugural period. The list of major companies announcing U.S. jobs in recent weeks has ranged from Hyundai Motor to Amazon, and in each case Trump and his aides have trumpeted their announcements and claimed credit. [ The real reason Ford abandoned its plant in Mexico has little to do with Trump ] It is unclear, however, how much the president-elect\u2019s threats influenced their actual business plans, which are months or years in the making and determined by an array of factors. The unemployment rate has remained at 5\u00a0percent or lower for more than a year, and many companies have been expanding their operations. \u201cThe word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason \u2014 not going to happen that way anymore,\u201d Trump said at his first post-election news conference last week. Corporate America has quickly adapted to Trump\u2019s new posture. Fear permeates \u201cC-suites,\u201d where executives are trying to come up with ways to please the incoming president and avoid his wrath, according to people whose work places them in the nexus of business and politics. William M. Daley, a financier and business executive who has served as White House chief of staff under President Obama and as secretary of commerce under former president Bill Clinton, said, \u201cCEOs want to play nice because they\u2019re afraid of getting caught in a Twitter storm.\u201d \u201cThey would never call his bluff,\u201d Daley said. \u201cThey\u2019re scared to death. They\u2019ll run to the Congress and say, \u2018Oh, save us from this.\u2019 It\u2019s a good M.O., because he knows these guys will roll over the minute he puts his sights on them.\u201d Left, President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 11. Right, with characteristic fervor, Theodore Roosevelt is shown speaking when he stumped the country for William McKinley during the presidential campaign of 1900. Roosevelt was McKinley\u2019s running mate on the Republican ticket. (Jabin Botsford/Brown Brothers/The Washington Post; Associated Press) Scott Reed, chief strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said companies are motivated in part by what they see as a \u201cpositive business environment\u201d under the Trump administration, which has vowed to overhaul the tax code as well as loosen environmental, financial and other regulations. \u201cThe business community is practical and pragmatic, and looking forward to engaging with the new administration in a constructive manner,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThis was a change election, and we like that the country is now upbeat and optimistic about real economic growth in the 3\u00a0percent to 4\u00a0percent range.\u201d [ How a week of Trump tweets stoked anxiety, moved markets and altered plans ] Trump is a modern-day Roosevelt, who from the White House in the 1900s demonized banks, railroads and other businesses he viewed as insufficiently nationalist. \u201cRoosevelt\u2019s bully pulpit was very ardently about going after companies and wealthy people that weren\u2019t putting America first, that were putting their profits ahead of public goodwill,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and Roosevelt biographer. \u201cHe did it with his fingers pointed in the face of his enemies. He would call bankers out by name.\u201d In the century since Roosevelt served, Brinkley said, no president has used the bully pulpit to strong-arm companies in such a relentless and aggressive manner \u2014 until Trump. \u201cOther presidents would show up at the Harley factory and say, \u2018This is made in America. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u2019 \u201d Brinkley said. \u201cBut they would never go into a mano-a-mano war about bringing jobs back to America, not since Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d Trump said in an interview last week with The Washington Post that his early moves to badger Boeing and Lockheed Martin to bring down the costs of their aircraft \u2014 Air Force One and the F-35 fighter jet, respectively \u2014 were examples of the power of his voice. \u201cLook at what\u2019s going on with the airplanes, the F-35. We\u2019re saving such amounts of money. Look at what\u2019s going on with Air Force One. Look at what\u2019s going on with the auto plants,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd by the way, I\u2019m not micromanaging.\u201d Whether Trump considers it micromanaging, he is undeniably meddling in the affairs of private companies to a greater degree than many previous presidents. \u201cTrump is in many ways closer to a governor than to our traditional model of president,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cGovernors around the country all behave like Trump: They worry about specific jobs, specific factories, specific companies. The Washington model is always abstract policy. But he\u2019s gone straight for the jugular to say, \u2018I want jobs!\u2019 \u201d Gingrich described the president-elect as a tireless entrepreneur determined to see results, and recalled Trump\u2019s management of the Wollmann Rink in New York\u2019s Central Park. The outdoor skating rink was in disrepair in the 1980s when Trump persuaded then-Mayor Ed Koch to take over the renovations himself. The rink reopened with great fanfare, under budget and ahead of schedule, becoming one of Trump\u2019s biggest success stories, which he later chronicled in his 1987 bestseller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d Trump\u2019s focus on pressuring companies to create U.S. jobs could be politically advantageous. He owes his electoral victory to the Rust Belt \u2014 Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, whose manufacturing-based economies have been decimated over the past four decades by outsourcing and broader trends of globalization. \u201cHe understands better than anybody on his team that there are two criteria for his reelection: Is America safe, and did we create jobs?\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cIf he can run with genuine prosperity \u2014 not this phony statistical prosperity that\u2019s all baloney \u2014 then he\u2019s golden.\u201d Brinkley agreed: \u201cHe\u2019s going to live or die by jobs. He can get away with a lot of eccentric activity if he stays out of war and if the economy does well.\u201d Karen Tumulty contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "Obama Commutes 330 Drug Sentences on Last Day as President By josh lederman, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 19, 2017, 4:42 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Barack Obama Holds His Last Press Conference 0 Shares Email In a last major act as president, Barack Obama cut short the sentences of 330 federal inmates convicted of drug crimes on Thursday, bringing his bid to correct what he's called a systematic injustice to a climactic close. With his final offer of clemency, Obama brought his total number of commutations granted to 1,715, more than any other president in U.S. history, the White House said. During his presidency Obama ordered free 568 inmates who had been sentenced to life in prison. \"He wanted to do it. He wanted the opportunity to look at as many as he could to provide relief,\" Neil Eggleston, Obama's White House counsel, said in an interview in his West Wing office. \"He saw the injustice of the sentences that were imposed in many situations, and he has a strong view that people deserve a second chance.\" For Obama, it was the last time he planned to exercise his presidential powers in any significant way. At noon on Friday, Obama will stand with President-elect Donald Trump as his successor is sworn in and Obama's chapter in history comes to an end. Even as Obama issued the commutations, the White House had been mostly cleared out to make way for Trump. In between carrying out their last duties, the few remaining staffers were packing up belongings as photos of Obama were taken down from the walls of the West Wing corridors. The final batch of commutations \u2014 more in a single day than on any other day in U.S. history \u2014 was the culmination of Obama's second-term effort to try to remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing requirements that he said had imprisoned thousands of drug offenders for too long. Obama repeatedly called on Congress to pass a broader criminal justice fix, but lawmakers never acted. For Bernard Smith, it's a long-awaited chance to start over after 13 years away from his wife and children. Smith was working at a restaurant in Maryland in 2002 when his brother asked him to obtain marijuana for a drug deal. Though it was his brother who obtained the crack cocaine that the brothers then sold along with the marijuana to undercover officers, Smith was charged with the cocaine offense, too. His 22-year sentence was far longer than his brother's, owing to what the court called Smith's \"extensive criminal history\" prior to the drug bust. Smith still had 10 years on his sentence when he was notified Thursday that the president, on his last day in office, was giving him another chance. \"He's looking to turn his life around,\" said Michelle Curth, his attorney. \"He's a good person who, like so many people, got involved in something he's been punished for already.\" Curth said that Smith had learned his lesson and owned up to his crime \u2014 he asked for a commutation, she noted, not a pardon, which would have erased the original conviction. She said Smith hopes to get licensed in heating and air conditioning maintenance and has lined up family members to help with his adjustment. But freedom for Smith is still two years away. Rather than release him immediately, Obama directed that he be set free in January 2019 \u2014 two years after Obama has left office \u2014 and only if Smith enrolls in a residential drug treatment program. To be eligible for a commutation under Obama's initiative, inmates had to have behaved well in prison and already served 10 years, although some exceptions to the 10-year rule were granted. They also had to be considered nonviolent offenders, although many were charged with firearms violations in relation to their drug crimes. Obama personally reviewed the case of every inmate who received a commutation, often poring over case files in the evenings or calling his attorneys into his office to discuss specifics. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said the administration reviewed all applications that came in by an end-of-August deadline \u2014 more than 16,000 in total. Eggleston said Obama had been particularly motivated to grant clemency to inmates who had turned themselves around in prison. He said one inmate had trained and obtained a commercial driver's license through a prison program, despite having a life sentence that all but assured he'd never get to use it. \"The ones who really stuck home for the president and me are the ones who got their GED, they worked, they took courses in anger management, they took courses in getting over drug abuse issues, they remained in contract with their families,\" Eggleston said. Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With Obama's support, the Justice Department in recent years directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Earlier in the week, Obama commuted most of the rest of convicted leaker Chelsea Manning's sentence, arguing the Army intelligence analyst had shown remorse and already served a long sentence. Yet Obama will leave office without granting commutations or pardons to other prominent offenders who had sought clemency, including accused Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. He also declined to pardon former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP 0 Shares ",

W. and Barbara Bush Hospitalized 0 Shares Email Former first lady Barbara Bush is being treated for bronchitis, family spokesman Jim McGrath told ABC News today. Barbara Bush, 91, entered Houston Methodist Hospital Wednesday morning as a precaution after suffering fatigue and coughing. She had not been feeling well for a couple of weeks but is resting comfortably, McGrath said Wednesday. McGrath said the former first lady reported feeling \"1,000 percent better\" this morning. \"Antibiotics and some good rest seem to have restored her to better health,\" McGrath said in a statement today. It's unclear when she will be released from the hospital. Former President George HW Bush Admitted to ICU, Barbara Bush Hospitalized Her husband, former President George H.W. Bush, has been hospitalized at the same medical center since Saturday. He was transferred to the intensive care unit Wednesday for \"an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia ,\" McGrath said in an initial statement. The 92-year-old former president underwent a procedure \u201cto protect and clear his airway that required sedation,\u201d the statement said. George H.W. Bush remained in the ICU in stable condition today, according to the family spokesman. \"His medical team is actively evaluating him for extubation, and we are hopeful he will be discharged from the ICU in a few days,\" McGrath said in a statement today. Doctors initially believed the 41st president would be allowed to return home later this week after several days of treatment, but his stay was extended. An earlier statement from the family spokesman had said there was no timetable for his release. During his final presidential news conference Wednesday afternoon, President Obama said he had been in touch with the family about the Bushes' conditions. \"They have not only dedicated their lives to this country. They have been a constant source of friendship and support and good counsel for Michelle and me over the years,\" Obama told reporters. \"They are as fine a couple as we know, and so we want to send our prayers and our love to them.

Details about where and when Guzman will first appear in a court in the U.S. were not immediately released. U.S. authorities sought extradition after Guzman was arrested in 2014 but Mexico resisted, declaring it a matter of national sovereignty. Guzman, believed to be 61, has long been a popular anti-hero in Sinaloa and across Mexico for dodging death and evading bullets while turning the multibillion-dollar Sinaloa cartel into one of the world's most powerful \u2014 and ruthless \u2014 drug trafficking organization. Related: Who is 'El Chapo?' A Look at the Master of the Underground Tunnel The Sinaloa cartel has been blamed for thousands of deaths, including the murder of police officers and innocent civilians. A turf war between the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez claimed 10,000 lives between 2008 and 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. Guzman oversaw the explosion of subterranean networks used to smuggle massive amounts of narcotics across the U.S. border. U.S. officials have said at the height of the Sinaloa cartel, it was believed to be responsible for up to half the illegal drugs coming into the U.S. from Mexico. The Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2015 report said that of all the Mexican drug trafficking organizations, the Sinaloa cartel has the largest presence in the U.S. After his 2001 escape, Guzman outfitted many his safe houses with secret doors that opened to tunnels leading to municipal sewer systems. He used one of them, accessed through the bottom of a bathtub, to shake authorities in February 2014. He was arrested a few days later and ended up in Altiplano, the prison that he escaped from in July of 2015. Play ",

In a brief statement, the Justice Department offered its \u201cgratitude\u2019\u2019 to the Mexican government for expediting the transfer. Guzman, who has escaped Mexican prisons twice\u00a0and led authorities on a months-long search in 2015, was flown out of the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso. Among the U.S., charges lodged against him are conspiracy, organized crime, weapons possession, murder and money laundering. Despite his ruthless reign, the U.S.,\u00a0has assured the Mexican government that Guzman will not face the prospect of the death penalty, which is not applied in Mexico. Guzman made world headlines in 2015\u00a0when he slipped out of his cell in the\u00a0maximum security Altiplano federal\u00a0prison and through a mile-long tunnel to freedom.\u00a0The dramatic escape prompted a worldwide\u00a0manhunt which concluded last January with his arrest following a deadly shootout in\u00a0Los Mochis, a Mexican coastal city of 250,000 in Guzman's home state of\u00a0Sinaloa. Attorney General\u00a0Arely G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez had said the search had drawn few valuable clues until\u00a0Guzman reached out to actors and producers and began planning a biopic. That tipped off investigators to his location, and G\u00f3mez said a journey to the rugged\u00a0Sierra Madre by American actor\u00a0Sean Penn\u00a0drew authorities to Guzman. El Chapo \u2014 meaning \"Shorty\" for his 5-foot-6 stature \u2014\u00a0has been an iconic figure in the drug trade for decades. He was first captured in\u00a0Guatemala\u00a0in 1993\u00a0and was extradited to Mexico. He was serving a 20-year sentence on drug-trafficking charges in a different prison\u00a0when he pulled off an equally intricate escape in 2001.\u00a0He was recaptured in Mexico in February 2014. His grip on the multibillion-dollar cartel remained strong.\u00a0The\u00a0U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0says he was able to remain a force by communicating with his son and other cartel leaders through lawyers and others who visited him at the Altiplano prison outside\u00a0Mexico City. Guzman's transfer came in the waning hours of the Obama administration and amid concern about how the election of Donald Trump, whose promise to build a wall along the southern border could strain relations between the U.S. and Mexico. . 739 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k5Vui7 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

    "text": "<p>The \u201chairstyle\u201d of new moth species&nbsp;<em>Neopalpa donaldtrumpi</em>&nbsp;inspired its scientific name.</p> Close Vazrick Nazari A miniscule moth with a wingspan of just 0.4 inches is the first species to be named for the soon-to-be president of the United States, Donald Trump . Yellow and white scales topping the moth\u2019s head resemble\u00a0 Trump\u2019s signature hairstyle , inspiring the name\u00a0Neopalpa donaldtrumpi, wrote evolutionary biologist Vazrick Nazari, a researcher from Ottawa, Canada, in a new study.\u00a0 The moth\u2019s habitat extends from Southern California in the U.S. through Baja California in Mexico. The wall that the president-elect has proposed building along the border between the two countries could divide that stretch. [ Starstruck: Photos of Species Named After Celebrities ] Nazari discovered the new species while examining moth specimens from the Bohart Museum of Entomology in California during an investigation of the North American moth family Gelechiidae, also known as twirler moths. \u201cIts distinctive wing pattern and its unique\u00a0 DNA bar code \u00a0immediately flagged it as a new and undescribed species,\u201d Nazari told Live Science in an email. The shapes of certain folds and pouch-like structures on\u00a0N. donaldtrumpi\u2019s\u00a0genitalia were also unique to the species, Nazari wrote in the study. Twirler moths earned their common name from a habit of twirling in circles when disturbed. This is the second twirler moth species to be described in the\u00a0Neopalpa\u00a0genus, though the family includes more than 4,830 described species, and there may be as many as 10,000 species in that family worldwide, according to the \u201c Encyclopedia of Entomology \u201d (Springer Netherlands, 2008). Hair today, gone tomorrow Nazari examined seven\u00a0N. donaldtrumpi\u00a0specimens: six males and one female. Average body length was approximately the same as their wingspans, about 0.4 inches, he told Live Science. The moth\u2019s head scales are yellowish-white and \u201coften rough,\u201d with additional orange-yellow coloration that Nazari described as \u201cdistinctive.\u201d Their miniscule bodies are off-white, and their wings are brown or grayish-brown, Nazari wrote in the study. Distinctive wing patterns, genetic evidence and genital shape identified&nbsp;Neopalpa donaldtrumpi&nbsp;as a new species. Close Vazrick Nazari While this is the first species to bear the president-elect\u2019s name, Trump\u2019s hairstyle also inspired the informal moniker \u201c Trumpapillar \u201d in September 2016, for the extremely hairy orange-yellow caterpillars of the flannel moth, native to the Peruvian Amazon. Lending a recognizable name to a new species can help inspire public interest \u2014 not only for the newly discovered animal, but also for the ecosystem it inhabits and the threats it might face, Nazari said. Scientists have named new species after \u201c Star Wars\u201d characters , musical icons like\u00a0 Johnny Cash \u00a0and\u00a0 Beyonc\u00e9 , and actor\u00a0 Johnny Depp , to name just a few. President Barack Obama has inspired more species names than any other president \u2014 nine in total, including a\u00a0 coral reef fish \u00a0native to Hawaii, a\u00a0 trapdoor spider \u00a0and a type\u00a0 of lichen . Though small, the yellow-headed moth\u00a0N. donaldtrumpi\u00a0could have a big impact on biodiversity awareness \u2014 for the general public and perhaps for the president-elect himself, Nazari said. \u201cI hope that the president will make conservation of such fragile ecosystems in the U.S. his top priority,\u201d he told Live Science. \u201cThese ecosystems still contain many undiscovered and undescribed species, and deserve to be protected for future generations.\u201d The findings were published online Jan. 17 in the journal\u00a0 ZooKeys .

Got it President-elect Donald Trump and wife Melania walk out at the Lincoln Memorial during an inaugural concert in Washington on Jan. 19. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Philip Rucker and John Wagner By Philip Rucker and John Wagner January 19 at 7:09 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @WPJohnWagner Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington Thursday on the eve of his inauguration as the 45th president snapped the capital city into its new reality, as the buoyant business mogul celebrated his unlikely political ascent with signature bravado and spontaneity. Kicking off three days of carefully orchestrated inaugural proceedings infused with pomp and guided by precision and protocol, the president-elect reveled in the moment and delivered a tribute to the populist movement that propelled him into office. \u201cWe all got tired of seeing what was happening and we wanted change, but we wanted real change,\u201d Trump said on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. \u201cIt\u2019s a movement like we\u2019ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say.\u201d Exhorting thousands of supporters at the conclusion of an evening concert that was punctuated by a glimmering fireworks display, Trump vowed, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work together, and we are going to make America great again \u2014 and, I\u2019ll add, greater than ever before.\u201d Trump and his extended family signaled a new era in the country\u2019s governance as they stepped off a military plane at Joint Base Andrews. They headed directly to his Pennsylvania Avenue property, the Trump International Hotel, where the president-elect irreverently toasted his Cabinet nominees. (The Washington Post) \u201cWe have by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever assembled,\u201d Trump said in a characteristically grandiose \u2014 and unprovable \u2014 declaration before several hundred supporters, lawmakers and allies at an official luncheon. He scanned the room for familiar faces and riffed on each individually, as if he were delivering a toast. Trump narrated his journey and the day\u2019s festivities on Twitter. \u201cOn my way!\u201d Trump tweeted as he headed in the afternoon to Arlington National Cemetery, where he and Vice President-elect Mike Pence laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. They both stood in silence with their hands over their hearts as a bugler played taps. As Trump put the finishing touches on the inaugural address he will deliver from the steps of the Capitol after taking the oath of office at noon Friday, Pence and their incoming administration were preparing to assume control of the federal government. Addressing reporters Thursday from the transition team\u2019s Washington headquarters, Pence said, \u201cIt is a momentous day before a historic day.\u201d The vice president-elect noted that all 21 Cabinet nominations have been made and that 536 \u201cbeachhead\u201d officials are ready to report for duty at federal departments and agencies. President Obama\u2019s appointees packed up their belongings and vacated their offices Thursday, although the Trump team is retaining 50 of them in critical positions throughout the government to ensure continuity until Trump can more fully staff his administration. The temporary holdovers include Brett McGurk, a special envoy coordinating the war against the Islamic State; Nick Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. [ Trump keeps Obama appointee tasked with helping run the war against ISIS ] A Donald Trump supporter lingers at the fence of the White House on Jan. 19. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) \u201cOur job is to be ready on Day One,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe American people can be confident that we will be. . . . It\u2019s going to be a very humbling and moving day for the president-elect his family and for mine. But let me tell you, we are all ready to go to work.\u201d Trump and his team on Thursday sent signals suggesting an attempt to begin repairing relations with groups he demonized throughout his transition, including the intelligence community and the media. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, calmly answered questions for an hour in his first formal briefing with journalists and confirmed that Trump would soon visit the CIA\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Va., to express his gratitude to career intelligence officers. While the bureaucrats-to-be were working, Trump supporters from throughout the country who had descended on Washington were partying at the concert at the Lincoln Memorial, which was bathed in patriotic lighting. Throngs of people extended toward the Washington Monument as an assortment of military bands and recording artists performed. As Trump and his wife, Melania, descended the monument\u2019s steps at sunset, the president-elect saluted the marble statue of President Abraham Lincoln, flashed a tight smile and pumped his fist in the air to the roar of the crowd and the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cHeart of Stone\u201d playing from the speakers. [ A fierce will to win pushed Donald Trump to the top ] But the concert served as a reminder of Trump\u2019s limited popularity. Despite his electoral-college victory, a majority of voters cast their ballot for someone else in November\u2019s election. Trump is the least-popular incoming president in at least four decades, with 40\u00a0percent of Americans holding a favorable impression of him and 54\u00a0percent holding an unfavorable one, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week. Entertainers such as Elton John, Celine Dion and the rock band Kiss said publicly that they turned down invitations to perform at inaugural festivities. One artist scheduled to perform at the Lincoln Memorial concert \u2014 Broadway\u2019s Jennifer Holliday \u2014 dropped out last week, the day after the announcement, saying she had heard concerns from the gay community about the message her participation would send. The concert headliners were country singers Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood and the rock band 3 Doors Down, which performed one of its hits, \u201cBroken,\u201d the lyrics of which echoed Trump\u2019s appeal to disenchanted Americans: \u201cThis is the call to the broken/To all the ones who\u2019ve been thrown away/This is the call to the broken/Stand up and take back your world today.\u201d Trump used his various social-media platforms to promote the concert, and at 3:21 p.m., less than an hour before it began, he tweeted to his more than 20\u00a0million followers to join him on the Mall, \u201cno tickets required.\u201d Thousands of people heeded his call, yet there were large pockets of empty space along the reflecting pool. Adhering to its usual policy, the National Park Service did not provide crowd size estimates. Even if it was not a historic turnout, the reality-television-producer-turned-politician appeared to relish the spotlight. As Greenwood sang his signature song, \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d Trump swayed, smiled and flashed a thumbs-up \u2014 though he appeared bored at other times as he fidgeted from his seat behind bulletproof glass. Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the day\u2019s events signaled that \u201cthis man is going to do it his way.\u201d \u201cEverything points to this incredible sense of grandiosity,\u201d Mann said. \u201cHe\u2019s telling the country, \u2018Get used to it.\u2019 \u201d Past presidents began to descend on Washington to witness Trump\u2019s swearing-in, including Jimmy Carter, who was spotted aboard a commercial Delta flight from Atlanta. Hillary Clinton, who was Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, and Bill Clinton were planning to attend. George H.W. Bush will not be making the trip. He and his wife, Barbara, were hospitalized in Houston this week. The former president was in stable condition Thursday and hoping to be discharged from the intensive-care unit in coming days, while the former first lady was recovering from bronchitis, spokesman Jim McGrath said. [ Will Trump follow through on all of his Day One promises? ] Trump spent part of Thursday making final preparations for the ceremony. He visited Blair House, the government property where he is scheduled to stay the night before moving into the White House, and met there Thursday afternoon with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to discuss arrangements for Friday\u2019s ceremony. Roberts will administer the oath of office. Trump is expected to use two Bibles \u2014 a family one and one that Lincoln used at his first inauguration in 1861. Trump\u2019s aides said he has taken personal ownership of his speech, writing and rewriting drafts himself with the help of a few advisers, and practiced delivering it before teleprompters this week at Trump Tower in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very personal and sincere statement,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be less of an agenda and more of a philosophical document \u2014 a vision of where he sees the country, the proper role of government, the role of citizens.\u201d Trump and Pence are planning to begin the day Friday at a church service at the historic St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, which sits on Lafayette Square across from the White House and has been frequented by presidents. From there, they will have tea with the Obamas on the South Portico of the White House before making their way down Pennsylvania Avenue for the Capitol, where Trump will be sworn in. Following his inaugural address, Trump will attend a congressional luncheon in the Capitol and see off the Obamas, who are heading to Palm Springs, Calif., for a vacation. The Trumps will then watch the inaugural parade \u2014 which aides say is expected to last about 90 minutes, among the shortest on record \u2014 from a reviewing stand outside the White House. Trump will attend three official inaugural balls in the evening. On Saturday morning, the new president will to attend a traditional national prayer service at Washington National Cathedral before spending the rest of the weekend settling into his new home and meeting with his advisers. Pence marveled to reporters: \u201cSometimes people stop me on the street they say, \u2018How you holding up? I can\u2019t imagine how busy you are.\u2019 And I just tell them, \u2018Well, you just have to understand, the energy and the enthusiasm of Donald Trump is contagious.\u2019\u201d Leonard Bernstein and Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed to this report. politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

    "text": "CBS News Jan 19, 2017 11:18 AM EST Fifty officials who hold critical positions in the Obama administration have been asked by President-elect Donald Trump to continue in their roles until their successors are chosen, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Thursday. Pence announced Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, which he said is intended to \u201censure the continuity of government,\u201d during a press conference at the Presidential Transition Office in Washington, D.C., a day before the inauguration . Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration: Schedule of the day Some of the officials who have been asked to stick around are Robert Work, the deputy secretary of defense; Chuck Rosenberg, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration; Nick Rasmussen, the National Counterterrorism Center Director; Thomas Shannon, under secretary of state for political affairs; Susan Coppedge; ambassador-at-large to monitor and combat trafficking in persons; Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Fight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); and Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department. Pence, the chairman of the transition team, said that all 21 Cabinet nominees have been named, with the latest being\u00a0 Sonny Perdue for agriculture secretary . He said that the transition team had received more than 86,000 resumes and interviewed 170 people before the November election and 200 people since then. He said that the team is wrapping up its work \u201cunder budget\u201d and will return 20 percent of taxpayer funding to the treasury. \u00a0 President-elect Trump's picks grilled in confirmation hearings Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, then took over the press conference -- he did not confirm that Mr. Trump will be visiting the CIA on Saturday, which has been reported by CBS News. On reports that the Trump administration is considering moving the White House press corps to a bigger space outside of the White House for briefings, Spicer said that there has been \u201cunprecedented interest in covering this president.\u201d He said the first couple of briefings will be hold in the White House\u2019s Brady Briefing Room, but they are looking at larger spaces that are more accommodating. Spicer slammed Senate Democrats for what he called \u201cdelay tactics\u201d in the process to confirm Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, arguing that they\u2019re \u201cslowing down the continuity of government.\u201d Spicer suggested that Mr. Trump will soon issue executive orders on NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and did not answer a question about whether there would be an immigration executive order coming soon. \u00a0 Asked if Mr. Trump has decided to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Spicer said, \u201cStay tuned.

Pablo Aneli/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Aneli/AP Mexican environmentalist and indigenous leader Isidro Baldenegro Lopez was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2005. He was shot dead this week, less than a year after another winner of the award was slain in Honduras. Pablo Aneli/AP Isidro Baldenegro Lopez, a Mexican indigenous activist and subsistence farmer who led the fight to protect ancient forests from illegal logging in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, was slain on Sunday. Baldenegro Lopez, a leader among the Tarahumara people, for years had led non-violent sit-ins and blockades in protest of logging in the Sierra Madre mountain region. 4 Arrested In Murder Of Honduran Activist Berta C\u00e1ceres His efforts against deforestation earned him the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize in 2005 . Baldenegro Lopez is the second recipient of that international award to be murdered in less than a year. Honduran indigenous leader and environmental activist Berta C\u00e1ceres was killed in March 2016. In a statement , Susan R. Gelman, President of the Goldman Environmental Foundation, said Baldenegro Lopez \"was a fearless leader and a source of inspiration to so many people fighting to protect our environment and indigenous peoples' rights. Our hearts go out to Isidro's family, friends, and colleagues around the world during this difficult time.\" Article continues after sponsorship #EarthDay: The High Cost Of Eco-Activism According to the New York Times, Baldenegro Lopez had lived with death threats and was forced to leave his community. But he had recently returned to visit an uncle when he was shot several times by a gunman. Reuters reports that a suspect has been identified but not yet detained. The Times also reported: \"The death of Mr. Baldenegro, coming so soon after Ms. C\u00e1ceres' murder, highlights the danger faced by environmental defenders in Latin America, where mining, energy, agribusiness and logging interests have generated violent conflict with local communities.\" The organization Global Witness issued reports in 2015 and 2016 documenting the death toll among hundreds of environmental activists around the globe. The vast majority of those slain in conflicts over the environment were in Latin America. ",

    "text": "<p>Markeith Loyd appearing in court Jan. 19, 2017</p> Close WKMG ORLANDO, Fla. --\u00a0A suspect in a police officer\u2019s slaying directed expletive-laced outbursts at a judge during his initial hearing Thursday on charges that he also killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. Markeith Loyd declared that many of the accusations against him are \u201cmade up\u201d and complained that he was roughed up even though he didn\u2019t resist arrest following an intense manhunt. Orlando police officers salute as the body of Master Sgt. Debra Clayton (pictured in the inset image) is taken from a hospital after she was shot and killed on Monday, Jan. 9, 2016. Close Orlando Police Department Loyd, 41, appeared with his eye bandaged and flanked by two police officers in an Orlando courtroom on charges including first-degree murder and unlawful killing of an unborn child in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon. Loyd is also accused of fatally shooting Orlando Master Sgt. Debra Clayton outside a Wal Mart while he was a fugitive from justice. He was arrested Tuesday night following a nine-day manhunt, and police said he resisted arrest and that force was used to bring him in. He was hospitalized until Wednesday night, then jailed. \u00a0 \u201cThey done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw,\u201d Loyd said, swearing as he described crawling out to the road to be arrested. \u201cI didn\u2019t resist s---. They just did that s--- and they\u2019re trying to hide it from the news people. But I\u2019m here right now.\u201d Most suspects appear with a lawyer and remain silent while the judge reads the charges in these initial hearings. But Loyd said he planned to represent himself, and stridently disputed the charges. Orange County Judge Jeanette Bigney ordered Loyd held without bond. WARNING: Video contains profane language \u00a0 Loyd dismissed any notion of guilt in Dixon\u2019s death. The judge cautioned him several times that the hearing wasn\u2019t the forum for such an outburst, but he continued anyway. The judge confirmed that Loyd was speaking under oath, and said \u201ceverything you say is being recorded, sir.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not finished talking because y\u2019all been making up s--- the whole time,\u201d Loyd responded. Clayton was fatally shot while attempting to capture Loyd in a Wal Mart parking lot. After the officer\u2019s shooting, police arrested three people -- Loyd\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Jameis Slaughter; his former boss, Zarghee Mayan; and his niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, according to CBS affiliate WKMG -- for allegedly aiding Loyd in escaping capture after Dixon\u2019s killing on Dec. 13. In court, Loyd defended those who were arrested as accomplices for allegedly helping him evade arrest - and placed himself at the Wal-Mart store where the officer was shot. \u201cI have not received nothing from nobody. I was out there by myself. Nobody helped me do anything. I was in Wal-Mart by myself. Wasn\u2019t nobody doing nothing for me.\u201d At that point, the judge interrupted him. \u201cSir, we are here addressing only one case.\u201d The judge said another hearing will be scheduled to determine who will represent Loyd. When she told officers to remove him from the courtroom, Loyd turned to the judge and said \u201cf--- you!\u201d \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "Twitter When he takes the oath of office on Friday, President Trump will inherit a far different country than President Obama did eight years ago. It's a nation that is far more solid in some ways (economics) and shakier in others (terrorist attacks). We have gathered together dozens of statistics to show how the nation that Trump inherits (and the rest of the world) has changed over time. Economy Over the course of Obama's presidency, one basic trend was clear across a variety of economic indicators: After he took office, things got worse before they got better. That's not his fault, of course; President Obama took office in the middle of a devastating recession, and he introduced a stimulus bill that helped pull the country out of its plunge. Since then, many areas of the economy have (slowly but surely) recovered nicely. However, many Americans remain permanently scarred by the recession. In addition, many structural problems (inequality, better incomes for men, whites and Asians than for other Americans) remain. Politics One big way that politics has changed under President Obama: His party has lost major ground. A majority in both houses of Congress helped him pass major legislation early in his first term, like the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation reform law. But after that, Republicans gained ground, taking away Democrats' hold on power. Democrats are now at their lowest point of power than at any time in nearly a century. Crime/Justice Following an existing trend, violence in the U.S. continued to fall off during Obama's presidency. However, there are some hints of trouble. There was a slight uptick in violent crime in 2016, especially in some cities, which may or may not simply be a statistical blip. There has also been a recent uptick in the shooting deaths of police officers, though levels are still lower than they were in the 1990s. Immigration Trump's immigration proposals created some of his biggest headlines during the campaign: building a wall along the southern border and a proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. made waves as being particularly restrictive policies. In addition, he railed against bringing in more refugees. That means these numbers could change considerably, depending on how much he gets his way on immigration policy. Foreign Policy As President Trump takes office, several dynamics from Obama's presidency remain: Several thousand troops remain in Afghanistan and Iraq , although far fewer than when Obama came into office. But there are some new dynamics in the world that didn't exist when Obama took office: The Syrian civil war rages on and North Korea has conducted more nuclear tests and China has acquired or built additional islands in the South China Sea. One more big change, of course, is that the U.S. now has diplomatic relations with Cuba. It's unclear just yet how Trump will manage that transition. Environment Perhaps the most-watched statistic on the environment \u2014 the measure of global temperatures \u2014 remains troubling. Just this week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the warmest global temperatures on record, the third record-breaking temperature in three years. Health Policy The big health policy story of Obama's years was (duh) Obamacare, which helped drive the uninsured rate down to historic lows. Not only that, but the rate of cost growth has slowed down. Still, costs of premiums continue to grow, and to keep costs controlled for customers, companies put a lot more emphasis on high-deductible plans. Health Outcomes America continues to have some dismal stats in a few health areas. Adult obesity continues to climb, and the opioid epidemic is raging \u2014 deaths from overdoses grew by an astounding 69 percent between 2008 and 2015. Also potentially troubling, data show life expectancy declined slightly in 2015 (though that may be an aberration from the upward trend). Article continues after sponsorship However, there are a few bright spots, particularly among America's youth: There has been a dramatic drop in smoking among high school seniors; drug and alcohol abuse among teens is likewise at relatively low rates; and childhood obesity appears to have leveled off. With data contributions from Joe Neel, Jennifer Ludden, Didrik Schanche, Larry Kaplow, Denice Rios, and Richard Rodriguez. ",

    "text": "Steve Mnuchin Failed to Reveal $100 Million in Assets, Links to Tax Haven Company By Lauren Pearle Jan 19, 2017, 1:31 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Treasury Pick Exchanges Barbs With Senator at Hearing 0 Shares Email Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for treasury secretary, found himself on the defensive for failing to disclose $100 million in real estate assets on his financial disclosure forms before today\u2019s confirmation hearing. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., pointedly asked Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, if he would support closing tax loopholes in the U.S. that \u201cextremely wealthy people use, such as yourself, to avoid paying taxes?\u201d She said Mnuchin, 53, also failed to include his position as a director of a Cayman Islands holding corporation. Mnuchin said his offshore bank accounts in the Cayman Islands were used only to benefit nonprofits and pension funds and were allowable by law. Regarding the omission about his position in a shell company, Mnuchin claimed the mistake was an oversight. \u201cAs you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\u201d he testified before the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cI did not use a Cayman Island entity to avoid paying taxes for myself ... We shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people to set up Cayman Island funds,\u201d he said, arguing that we need to \u201cclose these tax issues that make no sense.\u201d Mnuchin said he supported changing the nation\u2019s tax laws so they\u2019re \u201csimpler and more effective.\u201d \u201cMy No. 1 priority is growth in the economy,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cTax reform will be our first and most important part of that.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is excess regulation that is hurting growth.\u201d Mnuchin faced tough questioning throughout the hearing about his stances on sanctions and other issues and was forced to defend his role in IndyMac, a failed mortgage lender that was seized by the U.S. government. \u201cIn the press, it has been said that I ran a foreclosure machine,\u201d Mnuchin said. He insisted that he made efforts to keep people in their homes by providing 100,000 loan modifications. \u201cI felt great empathy for the thousands of Americans who lost their home because of a system that failed them,\u201d he said. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, pressed Mnuchin about the 10,000 homeowners who were foreclosed on at the behest of OneWest Bank , the former IndyMac, which Mnuchin and a group of investors purchased and renamed in 2009. Brown said OneWest forced from their homes at least 23 borrowers who were current on their mortgages. \u201cWhat I would say is we follow the same procedures that the FDIC followed. We inherited the procedures,\u201d Mnuchin answered. He did admit that OneWest foreclosed on 54 active duty military members. \u201cWe unfortunately did disclose on certain people in the military, and it was unfortunate and inappropriate, and we responded and made them whole,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single person had the opportunity to have their mortgage reviewed, and we corrected errors.\u201d When Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., asked Mnuchin about his stance on sanctions, particularly the sanctions imposed on Russia, Mnuchin said he was \u201c100 percent\u201d committed to enforcing sanctions against Moscow. \u201cI will use [sanctions] to the maximum amount of the law,\u201d he vowed. After Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., brought up the topic of sanctions again, Mnuchin testified that he opposes lifting current sanctions on Russia. But he refused to answer if he would recommend additional sanctions on the country, saying that he needed access to classified reports before deciding. McCaskill expressed concern about Trump\u2019s businesses in a heated exchange with Mnuchin. \u201cHe is not divesting any business interests, correct?\u201d McCaskill inquired. \u201cCorrect. I believe he sold his public stocks,\u201d Mnuchin replied. \u201cIs it fair to categorize him as an international businessman?\u201d she continued. \u201cI believe so,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cHe will enjoy the benefits of his business success while he is president, correct?\u201d she asked. \u201cAgain, I believe he will do everything legally \u2014\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThis is not my question. My question is, he has said very loudly he will go back to his business after he is president, even said he would fire his sons if they had not done a good job. So whatever success his business enjoys during his presidency, he will get the benefit of, correct?\u201d McCaskill retorted. \u201cYes, he is the economic owner, so by definition, I would assume that he would have that,\u201d Mnuchin said. She followed up by asking Mnuchin what percentage of Trump\u2019s debt is held by foreign interests. \u201cIf I\u2019m confirmed, I will research that and get back to you,\u201d Mnuchin said. But then he appeared to backtrack, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not willing to make a commitment, but I will speak to the chairman of this committee and to the president.\u201d Earlier, Mnuchin asserted that Trump was not in violation of the Constitution by refusing to put his business assets into a blind trust, as recommended by various ethics experts. \u201cI know the president-elect is absolutely following the law and is committed to following the law and has set out a series of \u2014 although not a blind trust \u2014 he has removed himself from his business, he put his sons in charge of his business,\u201d he said. \u201cI can assure you that in my job of treasury secretary, whatever responsibilities I have to monitor these issues, which are very important, I can assure you that I will do.\u201d Mnuchin indicated that he would support raising the debt ceiling if necessary to avoid a U.S. default. \u201cI firmly believe that the U.S. has to honor its debt,\u201d Mnuchin told the committee, despite previous statements made by Trump that the U.S. could renegotiate its debts or print more money. Mnuchin promised he would \u201ccommit to work with Congress so we don\u2019t get to the last minute and run out of money,\u201d adding that the debt ceiling might need to be raised \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d He dodged questions, however, about what specific level of debt he finds \u201cunacceptable.\u201d One senator claimed that Trump\u2019s economic plan would increase the nation\u2019s debt by an estimated $7.2 trillion over 10 years, a statement Mnuchin disputed based on \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring. \u201cTrump has a pro-economic-growth tax plan, and we are sensitive to the cost of that plan,\u201d Mnuchin said. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., grilled Mnuchin over Trump\u2019s pledges to impose a high tariff on goods imported from Mexico. Mnuchin replied that the North American Free Trade Agreement should be reopened but that he was \u201coptimistic that we can renegotiate a deal that\u2019s advantageous to us and to Mexico.\u201d In closing, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., hit Mnuchin again for failing to disclose almost $100 million in Cayman Islands real estate funds. \u201cThis was not self-corrected,\u201d said Wyden. \u201cMy staff had to tell you.\u201d Wyden said those funds weren\u2019t just \u201chelping churches and pensions ... I have an SEC document showing that you were also helping a lot of private investors as well.\u201d But Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, had nothing but praise for Mnuchin. \u201cYou\u2019ve certainly impressed a lot of people, including me,\u201d he said. He recalled a private conversation he recently had with Mnuchin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose a lot of money taking this job,\u201d Hatch said he told Mnuchin. His response, according to Hatch: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I want to serve my country.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Tasnim News Agency/Handout via Reuters WATCH Stunning Video Shows Fatal Collapse of High-Rise Building in Iran 0 Shares Email A historic high-rise building in the heart of Iran's capital caught fire and later collapsed Thursday, killing at least 30 firefighters and leaving their stunned colleagues and bystanders weeping in the streets. The disaster at the 17-story Plasco building, inadvertently shown live on state television, came after authorities said they repeatedly warned tenants about blocking stairwells with fabric from cramped garment workshops on its upper floors. Firefighters, soldiers and other emergency responders dug through the debris into the night, looking for survivors. While it was not clear how many people were in the steel-and-concrete building, witnesses said many had slipped through a police cordon while the fire burned to go back inside for their belongings. \"They asked us ... using loudspeakers to evacuate the building, but some people went inside again, saying their precious documents, their bank checks, their entire life was in their shops,\" said witness Masoud Hosseini. \"They went inside to fetch those documents. I felt like they cared about their belongings, checks and money more than their lives. Tasnim News Agency/Handout via Reuters Firefighters react at the site of a collapsed high-rise building in Tehran, Iran Jan. 19, 2017. \"Firefighters went inside to bring them out, and then suddenly the building collapsed,\" Hosseini said. Iranian authorities did not immediately release definitive casualty figures, which is common in unfolding disasters. Iran's state-run Press TV announced the firefighters' deaths, without giving a source for the information. Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said more than 20 bodies of firefighters had been recovered by Thursday night. Local state television said 30 civilians were injured, while the state-run IRNA news agency said 45 firefighters had been injured. Firefighters began battling the blaze around 8 a.m., some 3 1/2 hours before the collapse. The fire appeared to be the most intense on the upper floors, the site of workshops where tailors cooked for themselves and used old kerosene heaters for warmth. Vahid Salemi/AP Photo Iranian firefighters work to extinguish fire of the Plasco building in central Tehran, Iran, Jan. 19, 2017. The building came down in seconds, shown live on state television , which had begun an interview with a journalist at the scene. One side collapsed first, tumbling perilously close to a firefighter perched on a ladder and spraying water on the blaze. A thick plume of brown smoke rose over the site afterward, and onlookers wailed in grief. \"God willing, nothing happened to firefighters who were there,\" the journalist said, then began crying. Watching the disaster unfold was Masoumeh Kazemi, who said she rushed to the building because her two sons and a brother worked in the garment workshops on the upper floors. Xinhua/Ahmad Halabisaz via Newscom Iranian firefighters mourn beside a commercial building in downtown Tehran, Iran, Jan. 19, 2017. \"I do not know where they are now,\" Kazemi said, crying. In a nearby intersection, Abbas Nikkhoo stood with tears in his eyes. \"My nephew was working in a workshop there,\" he said. \"He has been living with me since moving to Tehran last year from the north of the country in hopes of finding a job.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed sorrow over the fire in a statement and praised the courage and sacrifice of the firefighters. President Hassan Rouhani ordered Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli to investigate the disaster, IRNA reported. Rouhani also ordered the ministry to ensure the injured were cared for and immediately compensate those affected by the disaster. Rouhani, whose administration struck the nuclear deal with world powers, will probably be standing for re-election in May. The cause of the blaze wasn't immediately known. However, fire department spokesman Jalal Maleki said authorities had visited the building often to warn tenants about conditions there. \"Everyone stacked up goods outside their shops and in the staircases and corridors,\" Maleki said. \"We warned them many times, but they wouldn't listen.\" In the hours after the collapse, authorities also described the building as having a \"weak structure,\" without elaborating. Another fire broke out later Thursday at a building next to the collapsed tower, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Firefighters worked into the night to extinguish it. The Plasco building was an iconic presence on Tehran's skyline, one of the first to rise against the backdrop of the snowcapped Mount Damavand. Opened in 1962, it was the first privately owned tower to be built during the era of the U.S.-backed shah, when oil money fueled the capital's rapid development. The tower, the tallest in Tehran at the time and just north of the sprawling Grand Bazaar, got its name from the plastics manufacturing company owned by its builder, Iranian Jewish businessman Habib Elghanian. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the shah, Iran's new clerical rulers had Elghanian tried on charges that included spying for Israel. He was executed by firing squad \u2014 an outcome that prompted many of the remaining members of the country's longstanding Jewish community to flee. The state-controlled Islamic Revolution Mostazafan Foundation took ownership of the building. The foundation, which has ties to the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, made no immediate statement about the collapse. The fire was the worst in Tehran since a 2005 blaze at a historic mosque killed 59 worshippers and injured nearly 200 others. Thursday's disaster stunned the city. Firefighters openly wept on the streets, holding each other for support. Dozens of people lined up to donate blood. \"It is a humanitarian duty,\" said Gholamreza Heidari, a university student. \"It is nothing compared to the dedication that our firefighters showed in rescuing people.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates .

    "text": "Osama Bin Laden Worried That Iran Put Tracking Chip in Sons By eileen sullivan and deb riechmann, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 19, 2017, 2:39 PM ET 0 Shares Email Secluded in his hideaway in Pakistan, Osama bin Laden suspected Iranian officials might implant tracking devices in his sons, according to a document released Thursday in a batch of materials seized in a 2011 raid that killed the al-Qaida leader. \"If they inject you with a shot, this shot might be loaded with a tiny chip,\" bin Laden wrote in an undated letter to his sons, Uthman and Mohammed, who were being allowed to leave Iran. \"The syringe size may be normal, but the needle is expected to be larger than normal size. The chip size may be as long as a seed of grain but very thin and smooth.\" In its final hours, the Obama administration released the last of three installments of documents belonging bin Laden that were collected during the raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In the second batch of documents, released last March, bin Laden also expressed the same paranoia in a letter to one of his wives, who also lived in Iran. \"I was told that you went to a dentist in Iran and you were concerned about a filling she put in for you,\" bin Laden wrote. He said he wanted to be told of any concerns she or any of his followers had about \"chips planted in any way.\" Tracking down and killing the man behind the 2001 terrorist attacks on America is one of President Barack Obama's greatest accomplishments. Intelligence officials have worked for more than two years to declassify the hundreds of documents captured in the raid. The last batch, consisting of 49 documents, includes a running disagreement between bin Laden and al-Qaida's affiliate in Iraq, which morphed into the Islamic State group. Those militants are currently the top target of U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The Pentagon announced Thursday that the U.S. Air Force attacked a pair of IS military camps in Libya , seeking to eliminate extremists who had escaped from their former stronghold of Sirte. Bin Laden is responsible for orchestrating the Sept. 11 strikes against the United States that killed nearly 3,000 people. The attacks drastically changed America's footprint abroad and challenged some of the most basic tenets of the Constitution in an effort to detect terrorists before they strike. In a letter to a fellow militant, written after 9/11, bin Laden called on his followers to invent new ways to battle the West. \"If we cannot manufacture weapons like the weapons of the Crusader West, we can destroy its complicated industrial and economic system and exhaust its forces that fight without faith until they escape,\" he wrote. \"Therefore, the mujahidin had to create new methods that no one from the West can think about, and one of the examples of this creative thinking is using the airplane as a powerful weapon, like what had happened in the blessed attacks in Washington, New York and Pennsylvania.\" 0 Shares ",

President-elect Donald Trump, left, and his wife Melania Trump arrive to the \"Make America Great Again Welcome Concert\" at the Lincoln Memorial, Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017, in Washington. (Evan Vucci / AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter Ready for his big moment, Donald Trump swept into Washington on a military jet Thursday for three days of inaugural festivities and quickly set about building better ties to the Republican Congress. Washington braced for an onslaught of crowds and demonstrators \u2014 with all the attendant hoopla and hand-wringing. Trump began taking on more trappings of the presidency, giving a salute to the Air Force officer who welcomed him as he stepped off a U.S. jet with wife Melania at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington. Later, he placed a ceremonial wreath at Arlington National Cemetery. His first stop was a luncheon in a ballroom at his own hotel, where he gave a shout-out to GOP congressional leaders, declaring: \"I just want to let the world know we're doing very well together.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, he said, will finally have someone to sign legislation into law. Then Trump veered into the territory of the unknowable to boast his Cabinet selections had \"by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever.\" Just blocks away, the White House was quickly emptying out. President Barack Obama had his final weekly lunch with Vice President Joe Biden and got in a few final official acts, cutting the sentences of 330 inmates and placing a call to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, in a tweet, called Inauguration Eve \"a momentous day before a historic day,\" as security barricades and blockades went up around Washington in preparation for Friday's swearing-in at the Capitol. \"We are all ready to go to work,\" Pence said. \"In fact, we can't wait to get to work for the American people to make it great again.\" Outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said he'd be putting on his \"favorite DHS jacket\" and taking to the streets to inspect security preparations for the inaugural festivities. Donald Trump,Melania Trump Evan Vucci / AP President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife Melania Trump, waves as they arrive at Andrews Air Force Base on Jan. 19, 2017. President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife Melania Trump, waves as they arrive at Andrews Air Force Base on Jan. 19, 2017. (Evan Vucci / AP) He told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that areas where inaugural crowds will congregate will be \"extra fortified this year with dump trucks, heavily armored vehicles to prevent anybody who's not authorized from being in the area from driving something in there.\" He said there was \"no specific credible threat\" related to the inauguration. Trump's public schedule for the inaugural celebration began at Arlington, where he and Pence stood at attention as a bugler played taps at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Trump's wife, children and grandchildren silently looked on. With that solemn moment, \"the rhetoric of a campaign moves aside,\" Tom Barrack, the head of Trump's inaugural committee, told CNN. \"I think you're going to see a shift from candidate to world leader. I think he's feeling the weight of it.\" From there, Trump shuttled to a celebratory welcome concert on the steps of Lincoln Memorial that was to end with fireworks. The two-hour concert, open to the public, promised headliners including country star Toby Keith, soul's Sam Moore and The Piano Guys. But not singer Jennifer Holliday: She backed out after an outcry from Trump critics. ",

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 Students at Independence High School in Williamson County, Tennessee, will not be allowed to watch President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration during class on Friday. Click here for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s newsletter: a must-read for conservatives! Senior Olivia Roberts was so surprised by the ban she decided to write a Facebook post that has since gone viral: \u201cTo preface this, I am not one to post or debate anything political on Facebook but wanted to hear thoughts on this: I go to public school and we are not allowed to watch the inauguration tomorrow... Teachers are banned to show it. Teachers are also not allowed to discuss anything about politics or religions which is understandable but this is a nationwide event in history that I think an a US citizen (whether you are happy about it or not) should be watched to honor and support the president of The United States of America (no matter who it is) And pay respect to the country we are privileged to live in. We watched the last 2 presidential inaugurations in school.\u201d Suzanne Roberts is Olivia\u2019s mother. She thought it was really strange that teachers would not be allowed to show such a historic event in the classroom. So she picked up the phone and called the principal. Instead of getting answers, she said she received a lecture from the principal. \u201cI asked her if there was a policy regarding inaugurations but instead of answering she asked me, \u2018Why is it important for you personally that your child see the inauguration live?\u2019\u201d \u201cI was a little thrown off,\u201d she told me. \u201cShe told me that Independence High School is going to focus on learning and moving forward and staying on curriculum and they would not be stopping class for the inauguration,\u201d Mrs. Roberts said. \u201cShe told me that news happens every day in this country and they won\u2019t be stopping class to watch the news.\u201d That principal sounds like the life of the party, folks. I reached out to the school district on Wednesday and Thursday but so far they have not returned my calls. Meanwhile, fourth graders at a Michigan grade school will not be allowed to watch President Trump's inauguration address because their teacher fears he might use \u201cinflammatory and degrading\u201d language. Conservative radio host Steve Gruber obtained a letter purportedly written by teacher Brett Meteyer and sent to parents at Explorer Elementary School in the small town of Williamston. Meteyer said he was concerned about children being exposed to inappropriate language and behavior. \u201cI am anxious about showing Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address, given his past inflammatory and degrading comments about minorities, women, and the disabled,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am also uneasy about Mr. Trump\u2019s casual use of profanity, so I sought an assurance that as their teacher, I would not be exposing children to language that would not appear in G or PG-rated movies.\u201d Does the teacher really think that the president-elect is going to deliver his inaugural address while dropping f-bombs from sea to shining sea? \"Ask not what your country can do for you...\" I\u2019ve covered a lot of educators acting moronically over the past few years, but this guy takes the cake. \u201cI put in a request to the Trump team to preview the speech, but I have not heard back from them,\u201d he reportedly wrote to parents. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and suggest the president-elect\u2019s transition team has more pressing matters to attend to than being lectured by a fourth grade school teacher. The school district sent me a statement acknowledging they are \u201caware of discourse within the community regarding a teacher parent communication surrounding the Presidential inauguration.\u201d \u201cThe district administration expects teachers to present a balanced perspective consistent with the curriculum and demonstrate good judgement in their communications with families,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAdministrators do not preview nor censor communications sent by teachers.\u201d What a load of pretentious pomposity. President Trump is going to have a difficult time making America great again with educators like this stinking up our nation\u2019s classrooms.

    "text": "Jan 19 2017, 3:02 pm ET Trump Says Private Firms Can Fix Obamacare But They Underpin the ACA by Maggie Fox advertisement President-elect Trump just promised that private insurance companies can help lower costs and get health insurance to more Americans. But private health insurance already forms the basis of the Obamacare exchanges that Republicans have vowed to raze. And a conversation with just about any American covered by private health insurance makes it's immediately clear that the private health insurance industry is a source of many, if not most, of the frustrations of managing health insurance. President-elect Trump just promised that private insurance companies can help lower costs and get health insurance to more Americans. But private health insurance already forms the basis of the Obamacare exchanges that Republicans have vowed to raze Joe Raedle / Getty Images \"We're going to get private insurance companies to take care of a lot of the people that can afford it. That's going to take a tremendous burden off and they're going to be able to have plans that are great plans,\" Trump said in an interview aired Wednesday on the Fox news channel. That's pretty close to the goals of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare or the ACA. \"The ACA is a fairly free-market oriented health care proposal, more than I think many people on the left would have liked,\" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. \"For the most part, companies can decide more or less what they want to do.\" Obamacare set up health insurance exchanges where people who couldn't get good coverage any other way could go to buy policies regulated by the new rules, often with a generous federal subsidy. It sought to stop the worst insurance company abuses, such as cutting off coverage when people got too sick, and sought to get rid of some of the most bare-bones plans that had low premiums but that also often left people in the lurch when they actually needed coverage. Related: Five Things You May Not Know About Obamacare Yet people still have struggled with denied claims, red tape and surprise medical bills, even on the Obamacare policies. Abigail Leigh has been fighting with her provider, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Virginia, to pay for an emergency visit she made last August to an urgent care clinic while visiting her home state of South Carolina. \"It became very painful to breathe,\" Leigh, a pharmacy student in Richlands, Virginia, told NBC News. \"I had to take very short breaths to even breathe at all. I was starting to get a little dizzy. So we decided to go to urgent care.\" \u201cNow I\u2019m having to call the hospital facility and keep them from sending the bill to collection.\u201d The symptoms pointed to a potentially deadly blood clot in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism, so doctors ordered a battery of tests. Luckily for her it wasn't. \"He decided I must have pleuritis, which is an inflammation of the lining of my lungs,\" said Leigh. The total bill: more than $1,700. \"I later on got a statement from my insurance company saying they won't cover it.\" Leigh's been going back and forth with the insurance company. Her $184-a-month policy, which she bought through the exchange that the federal government runs on Virginia's behalf, doesn't cover out-of-state care, unless it's emergency care. Leigh argues that her case is clearly emergency care, but as of this week her appeal is still unanswered. \"Now I'm having to call the hospital facility and keep them from sending the bill to collection,\" Leigh said. \"I don't feel like I should be having to keep up on this.\" Related: Obamacare Repeal Would Leave 18 Million Uninsured It's a problem that easily could have existed pre-ACA, but Leigh said these kinds of negotiations should have been addressed by the law. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) lays the blame at the feet of the health insurance companies. \"No one chooses when they will need emergency care and should not be punished financially for having emergencies or discouraged from seeking medical attention when they are sick or injured,\" said ACEP president Dr. Rebecca Parker. \"There have been significant reductions in insurance payments for emergency care, as much as 70 percent. They have taken gross advantage of patients and emergency medical providers since the ACA, arbitrarily slashing payments to physicians,\" Parker added. \u201cThey left me high and dry.\u201d In some states, such as California, the exchanges have attracted many insurance companies and offer a variety of policies. In others, problems caused some insurance companies to abandon the exchanges, saying they can't make enough money. That's what happened to Beverly Deeds, who lost her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in Santa Fe, New Mexico when the insurer dropped off her state's exchange. \"They left me high and dry,\" said Deeds, a 62-year-old retiree. Related: Is the Obamacare Name to Blame for its Enemies? The only insurer left for Deeds was Christus. Deeds had been paying $250 a month, with a $6,000 deductible, she said. After making several phone calls, Deeds got a bronze-level Christus plan for $449 a month. The bare-bones bronze plans are meant to provide catastrophic coverage for people who are generally healthy. \"The deductible is just under $7,000,\" she said. Her husband, who has Medicare coverage, earns too much for her to qualify for a federal subsidy or for Medicaid, even though New Mexico did opt in to the federal expansion of the program. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death. If I got diagnosed with something, how would I pay with that $7000 deductible?\u201d \"I hate it,\" said Deeds, who says she voted against Obama but she says there's plenty of blame to go around for what she sees as the ACA's failures. \"The insurance companies slanted things so they made a lot of money. Obamacare really padded their pockets,\" she said. Now, even though she qualifies for free annual mammograms and well-woman checkups, Deeds doesn't go. \"I'm scared to death. If I got diagnosed with something, how would I pay with that $7,000 deductible?\" she asked. \"I think there's a lot of frustration out there where this law was passed and was supposed to fix problems with the health care system, and people feel they are still paying a lot and don't understand why the law hasn't done more to help them,\" said Liz Hamel, who leads polling for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. A report out this week from consultancy firm Avalere Health shows that the 11.5 million people getting health insurance on the exchanges in 2017 will pay more and often get less for their money than in previous years, although federal subsidies will close the gap for 81 percent of customers. \"Following several years of single-digit premium growth, premiums increased 12 percent on average for silver plans in 2017\u2014from $496 per month in 2016 to $554 per month in 2017,\" Avalere says. Fewer than a third of policies are the preferred provider organizations (PPO) or point of service (POS) plans that offer customers a wide choice of doctors, hospitals and other providers. Deductibles for the silver plans - the plans that qualify for federal subsidies - grew by 20 percent for 2017. America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents insurance companies, says prices depend on competition in each state, and says some of the ACA's rules have driven up costs. \"Health insurance premiums are set based on a complex set of factors that reflect the cost of providing coverage in a state and in a market,\" it says.

Schooner, a professor specializing in government procurement law at George Washington University. \u201cWe are about to have a legitimate scandal on our hands.\u201d Representative Cummings, the Maryland Democrat, said he expected the G.S.A. to declare the Trump Organization in breach of the contract. Renee Kelly, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not confirm that it intends to take such a move, saying only in a written statement that the \u201cG.S.A. won\u2019t have an update until Friday after the inauguration.\u201d That a company Mr. Trump controls is a prominent tenant of the federal government is just the beginning of it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story His administration will assume oversight of Wall Street regulation, which includes policing Deutsche Bank\u2019s activities. The Trump administration will also direct American foreign policy and will probably be in regular contact with the diplomats sent by other countries to the United States. For Washington hotels, those diplomats\u2019 visits are big business, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington hotel has been actively courting them in recent months. Photo The lobby of the Trump International Hotel has been the social center for the president-elect\u2019s supporters this week in the days before his inauguration. Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Mickael Damelincourt, the hotel\u2019s managing director, has held meetings and attended social events with ambassadors and other foreign dignitaries, all potential sources of business for the new hotel, given that visiting delegations frequently come to Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said he would donate any profit derived from foreign government hotel guests to the United States Treasury. But Mr. Trump\u2019s critics say that would not eliminate the risk he would be violating the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution, which some legal experts say prohibits federal employees from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of University of California, Irvine, School of Law, said, \u201cThere is no doubt he will be benefiting financially from foreign government officials who are patronizing the Trump Hotel in Washington and other facilities around the world.\u201d Employees at the hotel \u2014 the bellhops, bartenders, restaurant servers and housekeeping aides \u2014 are deciding if they will join the local hotel workers union, a process Mr. Trump recently agreed to allow without protest. Signature cards are being distributed to new employees at the hotel who will decide if they want to be organized. Labor disputes have ended up before the National Labor Relations Board, including one at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Members of the board will be picked by Mr. Trump. Photo Gentry Beach, left, a prominent fund-raiser and old friend of the Trump family, in the hotel lobby on Tuesday. Credit Eric Lipton/The New York Times \u201cWe want to get workers at the hotel organized, into a union and then negotiate a contract,\u201d said John Boardman, the president of the local, which represents about 7,000 hotel and casino workers in the Washington area. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Employees at the hotel who might have discrimination claims or claims related to overtime pay, worker safety or health could end up having them investigated by federal agencies overseen by people Mr. Trump appoints. And if the Trump hotel seeks to fill job vacancies with foreign guest workers \u2014 as Mr. Trump did at Mar-a-Lago, the resort he owns in Florida \u2014 the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security would need to approve different aspects of the issuance of visas. \u201cHim being an employer can only lead to complications,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization that studies labor issues. \u201cIt is inherent in owning a business.\u201d Already, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract after they backed out of the hotel development. The chefs had a change of heart about doing business with the hotel in 2015, after Mr. Trump made incendiary comments about Mexican immigrants. Both lawsuits are continuing and in one case Mr. Trump has given a video deposition . Even the marketing of the hotel is sure to draw scrutiny. Earlier this year Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel offered a $500,000 \u201cinauguration package\u201d to its wealthy clients, which included the opportunity to stay in a 6,300-square-foot suite, according to Travel Market Report, a news report that caters to travel professionals. Doug Gollan, a contributing editor and the author of the article, said hotel management told him that it had been sold. The hotel has certainly had a rush of business this week from the inauguration festivities. The lobby has turned into the social center for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, who lounged at the dozens of tables set up in the lobby, washing down bottles of wine and offerings from the bar menu, including the $120 Trump tower seafood platter. The crowd in the giant room \u2014 the courtyard of the Old Post Office building \u2014 included Tony Romo , the Dallas Cowboys quarterback, and Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister. Gentry Beach, 41, a prominent fund-raiser and friend of the Trump family, roamed the floor, greeting friends, drink in hand, as they arrived for the big celebration on Friday. \u201cHow are you?\u201d Mr. Beach, a hedge fund manager from Dallas, said again and again, as he worked the room. \u201cHow are you?\u201d The hotel was sold out and the restaurant was booked. \u201cWe are very busy,\u201d said Patricia Tang, the director of sales and marketing for the property. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d Steven Eder contributed reporting.

Got it Police stand guard outside the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington as security tightens ahead of Friday's presidential inauguration. (John Minchillo/AP) By Matea Gold and Jonathan O'Connell By Matea Gold and Jonathan O'Connell January 19 at 6:31 PM Follow @mateagold Follow @OConnellPostBiz As he held court Thursday afternoon inside the ivory-and-gold ballroom of the Trump International Hotel, President-elect Donald Trump could not resist plugging the luxurious locale playing host to his Cabinet appointees, top Republican congressional leaders and hundreds of the GOP\u2019s wealthiest donors. \u201cThis is a gorgeous room,\u201d the soon-to-be president said of his new hotel\u2019s presidential ballroom. \u201cA total genius must have built this place.\u201d Out in the airy lobby, where 4,000 red, white and blue balloons were cosseted in nets far above the crystal chandeliers, Trump supporters snapped selfies with incoming White House aides Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and other boldface surrogates who waltzed through the room. Major party fundraisers from Texas and New York huddled at the marble bar. Waiters rang bells before sabering the corks off champagne magnums. The U.S. Capitol is the backdrop for the official swearing-in ceremony on Friday, but the hub of inaugural action is Trump\u2019s hotel, the site of a slew of official events and some of the week\u2019s most sought-after private gatherings. The main draw: \u201cDonald Trump owns it,\u201d said Doug Deason, a Dallas investor. \u201cSo many of the parties will be here. It\u2019s electric \u2014 nobody wants to go to bed.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump gestures toward his wife, Melania, during a luncheon Thursday at Trump International Hotel. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) Nevertheless, after they awake Friday, the hotel will become the site of the first clash between Trump\u2019s business interests and his presidency. At 12:01 p.m., when Trump becomes president, he may be in violation of his lease for the building, which is owned by the federal government. The agreement includes a clause barring any \u201celected official of the Government of the United States\u201d from deriving \u201cany benefit\u201d from the agreement. Ethics experts warn of other potential conflicts. For instance, if the hotel continues to rent ballroom and meeting space to foreign officials, it could run afoul of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting benefits from foreign leaders. For his part, Trump appears unconcerned about using his weighty platform to promote his business. On Wednesday night, with members of the news media in tow, he made an unscheduled stop at the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, drawing applause as he worked the lobby, greeting friends and supporters. Spicer, Trump\u2019s incoming press secretary, dismissed questions about whether it was appropriate for the incoming president to be putting a spotlight on his hotel \u2014 even offering an endorsement of the facility. \u201cHe is going to his own hotel?\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI think that is pretty smart. I think the idea that he is going to his own hotel shouldn\u2019t be a shocker. It\u2019s a beautiful place. It is somewhere he is proud of and symbolic of the kind of government he is going to run, ahead of time and under budget. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely stunning hotel,\u201d Spicer continued. \u201cI encourage you to go there if you haven\u2019t been by. \u201d [ The Constitution may have something to say about how Trump runs his D.C. hotel ] Trump\u2019s election in November kicked off a surge of interest in the luxury property, located in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion, which opened its doors in the fall. Rates this week were five times higher than normal \u2013 meaning many of the rooms are running at least $2,000 a night \u2014 and required a five-night minimum beginning Tuesday. \u201cBusiness is fantastic,\u201d said the hotel\u2019s managing director, Mickael Damelincourt. \u201cThe bar is packed every night. There is such a good energy to the place. I think it is really becoming a gathering place for Washington, D.C.\u201d On Thursday afternoon, well-heeled friends of the next president were ushered into a private room off the lobby marked \u201cTrump Townhouse,\u201d emerging with stuffed gift bags. An Ecuadoran official in town for the inauguration dined on tuna tartare at the bar. Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone made a cameo in the lobby. For Trump fans such as Vaughn Lower, who came from San Diego for the inauguration, it was the perfect place to be. \u201cI mean, where else would you want to be if you\u2019re a Trump supporter?\u201d said Lower, 28, his red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat firmly in place as he worked the room, gathering signatures and snapping selfies. Lower had scored autographs from Conway, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and \u201cPawn Stars\u201d star Rick Harrison in a black notebook he titled \u201cThe Inauguration Guest Book.\u201d Tara Memmen, 46, of Fairfax Station, Va., and Lisa McCollough, 46, of Coronado, Calif., arrived early with their families Thursday to have breakfast at the in-house restaurant, BLT Prime, then stayed for several hours to soak in the scene. \u201cIt just feels like this is the very heartbeat of what Trump stands for, of what he has built from the ground up,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cEveryone wants to come and be part of it.\u201d Her 18-year-old son, Evan, excitedly rattled off everyone he had spotted: Spicer, Conway, Falwell Jr. \u201cI\u2019m kind of star struck, because I\u2019ve been following the campaign for 18 months,\u201d he said. Being in Trump\u2019s hotel, he added, was \u201clike the icing on the cake.\u201d Trump has turned over management of his business to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, but he does not plan to sell his assets. He said this month that he would donate \u201cprofits\u201d from foreign business clients to the U.S. Treasury. However, neither Trump nor representatives of the Trump Organization have provided details on how such payments would be tracked, collected and disbursed. Given such issues, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and other congressional Democrats have pushed the General Services Administration to cancel the Old Post Office Pavilion lease. GSA officials have said that no violations have yet occurred. \u201cNo determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the \u00adPresident-elect\u2019s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office,\u201d the agency said in a statement. [ Update: Feds say it\u2019s \u2018premature\u2019 to judge lease for Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel ] By then, of course, GSA will be part of the new administration \u2014 raising the prospect of a Trump appointee renegotiating the lease with one of his sons. Steven L. Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University, said he feared that the GSA would \u201cjust bury its head in the sand and hope the storm blows over\u201d even though \u201cthis problem isn\u2019t going to get better with time.\u201d \u201cAnything they do will be heavily scrutinized and, as we\u2019ve seen, the Trump Organization pulls no punches in attacking its enemies, all too often without regard for objectivity, facts, or principles,\u201d he said. \u201cJust think about it: Who wants to go to war with the president, who selects your bosses and replaces them at will?\u201d Rosalind S.

By CNBC on Publish Date January 19, 2017. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 Steven T. Mnuchin, President-elect Donald J. Trump \u2019s pick to be Treasury secretary , failed to disclose nearly $100 million of his assets on Senate Finance Committee disclosure documents and forgot to mention his role as a director of an investment fund located in a tax haven, an omission that Democrats said made him unfit to serve in one of the government\u2019s most important positions. The revelation came hours before Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, began testifying on Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, which has historically been bipartisan in its demands for transparency from nominees. Mr. Mnuchin was ready to outline his vision for the economy and defend himself against claims that he headed a bank that ran a \u201cforeclosure machine\u201d during the financial crisis. \u201cThe Treasury secretary ought to be somebody who works on behalf of all Americans, including those who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cWhen I look at Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s background, it\u2019s a stretch to find evidence he\u2019d be that kind of Treasury secretary.\u201d In a hearing marked by sharp exchanges, Mr. Mnuchin struggled to answer questions about his use of tax havens as a hedge fund manager and whether he thought such loopholes should be closed. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, pointedly asked Mr. Mnuchin if he was using Cayman Islands corporations to avoid taxation. He responded that he was working on behalf of his clients, in accordance with the law. Video At Mnuchin Hearing, an Offer of Valium Things got heated on Thursday when Steven T. Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury secretary, testified before the Senate Finance Committee. By THE NEW YORK TIMES. Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed \u201cLet me just be clear again: I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes for myself,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cI would love to work with the I.R.S. to close these tax issues that make no sense.\u201d He added: \u201cI would support changing the tax laws to make sure they are simpler and more effective.\u201d Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans came to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s defense, suggesting that none of his omissions were willful, and they gave strong indications that they would vote for him. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s business record and described him as extremely qualified for the job. \u201cObjectively speaking, I don\u2019t believe anyone can reasonably argue that Mr. Mnuchin is unqualified for the position,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cIf the confirmation process focused mainly on the question of a nominee\u2019s qualifications, there would be little, if any, opposition to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s nomination.\u201d OPEN Graphic But the process was also focused on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s financial disclosure form, and that prompted intense scrutiny. \u201cIn his revised questionnaire, Mr. Mnuchin disclosed several additional financial assets, including $95 million worth of real estate \u2014 a co-op in New York City, a residence in Southampton, New York, a residence in Los Angeles, California, and $15 million in real estate holdings in Mexico,\u201d Democratic staff members of the Senate Finance Committee wrote in a memo on Thursday. \u201cMr. Mnuchin has claimed these omissions were due to a misunderstanding of the questionnaire.\u201d According to the memo, Mr. Mnuchin also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in seven other investment funds. And he belatedly disclosed that his children own nearly $1 million in artwork. Asked about the omissions at the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin described them as a simple mistake made amid a mountain of bureaucracy. \u201cI think as you all can appreciate, filling out these government forms is quite complicated,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that he had handed over 5,000 pages of disclosures. \u201cLet me first say, any oversight, it was unintentional.\u201d Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

    "text": "Trump Asks Some 50 Senior Obama Appointees to Stay On By matthew lee, ap diplomatic writer WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 19, 2017, 5:19 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Inauguration Ceremonies Begin for Donald Trump 0 Shares Email President-elect Donald Trump has asked roughly 50 senior Obama administration appointees to remain in their posts after his inauguration to ensure continuity in government, his incoming White House press secretary said Thursday. The officials include the highest-ranking career officials at key national security agencies like the Pentagon and State Department . Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work and America's third-ranking diplomat, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon, will serve as acting chiefs of their agencies until successors for the top jobs are confirmed by the Senate, Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer said. Thursday's announcement comes after weeks of questions about how Trump's team is managing the presidential transition, although it may not address broader concerns about what officials at many federal agencies have said is a lack of communication with the incoming team. Such concerns are natural in presidential transitions. But the confusion among officials at national security agencies could have consequences, given their international engagements. The rest of the world doesn't pause while Washington determines its chains of command. Work will likely helm the Defense Department for only a matter of hours. Trump's selection for the Pentagon, retired Gen. James Mattis, is expected to be confirmed on Friday shortly after the inauguration ceremony, along with retired Gen. John Kelly for Secretary of Homeland Security . Senate debate on Trump's choice for CIA boss, former Rep. Mike Pompeo, is expected to start Friday. It is unclear if Pompeo will receive an immediate confirmation vote. At the State Department, Shannon will be in charge until at least until next week as a Senate vote on Trump's choice for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, isn't expected until Monday or Tuesday. Also staying will be Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's point-man for fighting the Islamic State group, Nicholas Rasmussen, the National Counterterrorism Center director, and Adam Szubin, the Treasury Department's top official for terrorism and financial intelligence. Spicer said Chuck Rosenberg, the Drug Enforcement Agency administrator, and Susan Coppedge, the State Department's ambassador-at-large to combat human trafficking, would be left in place for the transition. The National Institutes of Health said its director, Dr. Francis Collins, was asked to stay on at least temporarily. A full list of Obama appointees asked to remain was not immediately available. It also wasn't clear if the Trump administration would accept an invitation to attend Russian-supported Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Monday. Trump has made a great point about seeking closer cooperation with Moscow on counterterrorism and security matters. Obama's special envoy for Syria, Michael Ratney, has indicated he is willing to attend, but the transition team hadn't instructed him to make the trip. Spicer said an announcement was expected soon. As in previous transitions, U.S. embassies and consulates abroad headed by noncareer, presidential appointee ambassadors will transfer to the most senior career diplomat present until the new administration fills the top posts. The transition team has largely yielded on matters of national security to retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president-elect's son-in-law. But the circle will have to be expanded once the new administration assumes the full responsibility of government. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Senate confirmed seven Cabinet members on Inauguration Day. Republicans and Democrats are still negotiating over Trump's picks, and Mattis and Kelly may be the only ones to make it through Friday. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Jan 19 2017, 6:54 pm ET Donald Trump Is Getting the Nuclear Football by Robert Windrem and William M. Arkin Share advertisement Sometime before he's sworn in Friday, President-elect Trump will sit down with the top military officers who control America's massive military arsenal and get \"THE Briefing,\" the one that provides him with an understanding \u2014 and the tools \u2014 of how he would wage nuclear war. According to those who have witnessed it previously, the briefing is both daunting and sobering. When Donald J. Trump raises his right hand and asks, \"So help me God\" during the inauguration, he really does become the most powerful man in the world \u2014 with control of America's nuclear \"triad\" and more than 4,000 nuclear warheads. Play Trump's nuke tweets cause international jitters 15:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170120014005if_/http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/840021059684\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Little is known about the briefing, which traditionally takes place early on Inauguration Day and is conducted by the Strategic Command, the Omaha-based joint military command responsible for the strategic nuclear arsenal, and the White House Military Office . None of the parties involved will discuss its particulars or its timing. But some details are known, as detailed in William Arkin's 1999 book \"American Coup.\" The \"football\" \u2014 an oddly shaped 45-pound briefcase \u2014 is at the center of the President's command and control of the arsenal, in nuclear submarines patrolling the Arctic; in missile silos on the Great Plains and in bombers on runways and aloft in the skies. The military aide carrying the \"football\" remains physically close to the president, ready to carry out a well-rehearsed choreography of command and control. Inside are what Arkin, now a senior investigator with NBC News, called the \"modern accoutrements\" of communication. Related: What Does Donald Trump Really Think About Using Nuclear Weapons? There are computers, modems, radios, cell and satellite phones, even an instruction booklet, but no \"button\" per se. American nuclear weapons are launched by the highly secure communication of specified nuclear codes, nicknamed the \"biscuit,\" which are changed daily. They authenticate the President's identity. The options for nuclear war, called courses of action, vis a vis Russia, China, North Korea, etc., are contained in both the \"Presidential Decision Handbook\" which is handed off, as well as in other more detailed briefings that President Trump will receive after inauguration. The purpose of the nuclear briefing just prior to inauguration, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Project at the Federation of American Scientists, is primarily to tell the incoming president: \"This is your role.\" In past transitions, the president-elect has not received the actual nuclear code card until after the briefing, he meets with the outgoing president at the White House just before the actual inauguration ceremony. The code card is activated electronically right after the president-elect takes the oath at noon. The president is not alone in assuming nuclear responsibilities. Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis will get their own \"footballs.\" Play ",
