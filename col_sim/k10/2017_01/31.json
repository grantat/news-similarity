    "text": "Courts and Law Who will Trump add to the Supreme Court? President Trump will fill at least one vacant seat on the Supreme Court during his term. Here are his possible picks to replace Justice Antonin Scalia and how they could fit in with the justices on the bench. Trump is scheduled to announce his nominee at 8 p.m. Tuesday . The eight current Supreme Court justices were appointed when they were between 43 and 60 years old, and they all attended Ivy League law schools . Half were nominated by a Democrat, and half by a Republican. Antonin Yale Law Source: Supreme Court biographies Antonin Scalia was the longest-serving sitting justice before he died on Feb. 13, 2016. He was nominated to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan and confirmed by the Senate unanimously in 1986. Nominated by: Source: Supreme Court Historical Society, U.S. Senate Three front-runners Trump has said he will choose from a list of 21 possibilities released during the campaign, and sources involved in the process say a handful of federal appeals court judges have emerged at the top. William Pryor, 54 Judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Alabama Pryor is a protege of Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). His past comments on gay rights and stalwart support of the death penalty have made him the nominee that liberal groups say they would most fiercely oppose. Several conservative groups have also objected to a decision he joined that upheld the right of a transgender woman to sue over being fired. Profile: Perhaps the most polarizing Supreme Court justice possibility Law school alma mater: Tulane University Career: Pryor served as a private attorney after clerking on the U.S. Court of Appeals. He also served as attorney general of Alabama. Neal Gorsuch, 49 Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Colorado Gorsuch, 49, would not bring the outsider credentials represented by others on Trump\u2019s list \u2014 graduated high school from Georgetown Prep and his mother was head of the Environmental Protection Agency. He is seen as a reliable conservative with a reputation for clear and lucid writing. Law school alma mater: Harvard Career: Clerk for Justices Byron White and Kennedy; deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department Thomas Hardiman, 51 Judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Pennsylvania Hardiman was the first person in his family to go to college, and he financed his law degree by driving a taxi. Conservatives praise his record on gun rights. Law school alma mater: Georgetown University Career: Hardiman serves on the 3rd Circuit with Trump\u2019s sister Maryanne Trump Barry. Key opinions The rest of Trump\u2019s choices During his campaign, Trump released a list of 21 possible nominees \u00a0with help from two conservative groups \u2014 The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation. The remaining 18 people on the list includes one U.S. senator, eight federal judges and nine state Supreme Court justices, though a nominee without experience enforcing federal laws is rarely confirmed. Eight of the potential nominees worked as clerks for justices at the Supreme Court. The list also includes two brothers \u2014\u00a0Thomas Lee and Sen. Mike Lee, from Utah. How they compare to Scalia A group of researchers attempted to measure the likelihood that each potential Trump nominee would be the most Scalia-like \u00a0of the group. Because the measure is based on their judicial decisions, the researchers only included nominees with experience as judges. They based their conclusions on three things: how the judge interprets the constitution; how often they cite Scalia\u2019s writings about how to think about interpreting the law; and how often the judge writes a separate dissenting opinion, something Scalia did quite often. The researchers also considered the pre-Supreme Court judicial careers of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito for comparison. Range of similarity ",

By Petula Dvorak By Petula Dvorak Columnist January 30 at 3:36 PM Follow @petulad When they came through the arrivals gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1968, my parents could have been seen as a threat. It was the middle of the Cold War, and my parents \u2014 my mom was 21 and my dad was 23 \u2014 had spent their entire lives behind the Iron Curtain in a communist country. And 1968 was the bloodiest year yet for American troops in a war being fought to contain communism. Nearly 17,000 Americans died that year in Vietnam. And here came my parents through the airport gates in the middle of all of that, in the fanciest clothes they owned, two people with paperwork \u2013 Czechoslovakian passports \u2013 that linked them to communism. They were not detained, they were not questioned. They were allowed into a country symbolized by the Statue of Libery. That was the America of 1968. It is not the America of today. My parents watched this weekend, in horror, by the scenes unfolding across this 2017 America, as people like them \u2013 refugees with nothing more than suitcases and dreams \u2013 were treated so differently when they walked through those airport gates. It was the second weekend of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, and, once again, he\u2019d generated a wave of protests in Washington and around the country. This time the outrage was aimed at his decision to sign an executive order banning immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. [ Washington\u2019s new normal: A Trump protest spectacle a day ] Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, basically. At the White House, up Massachusetts Avenue to the Islamic Center of Washington, outside the Trump International Hotel and at airport arrival gates across the region and the nation, thousands of people gathered to show support for refugees, green card holders and even American citizens who were suddenly being denied entry to the United States. My mom imagined what would have happened if, back then, President Lyndon B. Johnson had signed an executive order banning all citizens of communist countries from the U.S. A chunk of American would have bought that, for sure. Fear sells, and the country has a long, ugly history of hostility toward immigrants from many countries and many faiths. Fifty years ago, no one was worried about the Islamic State or al-Qaeda; the Communists were our enemy. But reason, empathy and humanity won. Because when my parents left everything in Czechoslavakia behind, when they got green cards, and when they raised their hands to pledge allegiance to America, the immigrants of my parents' era were seen as dissidents, heroes, even. Of course, it helped that my mother and father are white and from a Christian country. And it helped that our confrontations with communism didn\u2019t take place on American soil. So they were celebrated for rejecting the enemy and embracing the U.S. America 2, Communism 0. USA! [ Tell us: What do you think of President Trump\u2019s travel ban? ] This weekend, we became a country that detained a 5-year-old Bethesda boy at Dulles International Airport, kept him from mother for hours to make sure he wasn\u2019t terrorist threat. Artiman Jalali was born in the United States and has dual citizenship with Iran. He was traveling back from visiting relatives with his 25-year-old cousin. Both were detained. His mother, Shohreh Rahnama, said she waited for him hours, until he and his cousin were finally released around midnight. \u201cHe was hungry and he was thirsty, and I could not see him,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can a 5-year-old be banned? Just because his parents are Iranian? We are American, too,\u201d she told my colleague, Michael Alison Chandler, at a protest outside the White House . \u201cI almost died in that airport. I can say it was the worst day of my life.\u201d We became the kind of place that treated Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had a valid U.S. visa and worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq, like a criminal when he flew into JFK airport. He was eventually released. Overnight, America reneged on promises of citizenship and sanctuary to hundreds of people \u2014 translators, engineers, IT specialists, fixers. Some of them risked their lives for our military. [ \u2018We call it Muslims \u2018R\u2019 Us\u2019: In Trump\u2019s America, they want to explain who they are ] A friend of mine who has worked in Afghanistan and Indonesia was stunned by this development. Over time, he\u2019s helped five people come to the U.S. from Afghanistan, all of them risked their lives helping fight terrorism in their home nation and in turn, he helped them find new lives here. He marched on Sunday, and as the crowd went past the Islamic Center of Washington, a woman handed out water bottles to the marchers and thanked them for her support. One of the marchers hugged her. \u201cAnd she buried her head in (the marcher\u2019s) shoulder and began crying about how scared she is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is tragic to see the human toll on people who are already part of the fabric of America.\u201d This executive order is a shameful stain on our country, yanking the American dream out from under families who have been here for decades and from families in dangerous parts of the world who sold everything and endured years of vetting to join us. Why a sudden executive order? To stop terrorism , Trump said. \u201cThere is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign.\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning. It was wrong when it was part of his campaign, and it\u2019s wrong now. Twitter: @petulad Read more Petula Dvorak: ",

(Reuters) White House press secretary Sean Spicer had a stern message for State Department employees\u00a0opposed to President Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries: \u201cEither get with the program or they can go.\u201d Dozens of career diplomats have signed on to\u00a0a \u201cdissent channel\u201d document, which is a mechanism by which State Department employees can express\u00a0policy disagreements privately without fear of retribution. The memo has been circulating in the agency and it expresses the view that the immigration ban \u201cwill not achieve its aim of making our country safer.\u201d [ Dissent memo circulating in the State Department over Trump\u2019s policy on refugees and immigrants ] Asked to respond to the document, Spicer suggested that the \u201ccareer bureaucrats\u201d who disagreed with the executive order should not continue to serve in the government. \u201cThis is about the safety of America, and there\u2019s a reason that a majority of Americans agree with the president,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThey should understand it\u2019s his number one priority.\u201d Asked to clarify whether he was suggesting that public servants who disagree with the president should leave their posts, Spicer doubled down. \u201cIf somebody has a problem with that agenda, then that does call into question whether ... they should continue in that post or not,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI\u00a0know the president appreciates the people who serve this nation and the public servants. \u201cThat\u2019s up to them to question whether or not they want to stay,\u201d he added. politics ",

By Mark Berman and Matt Zapotosky By Mark Berman and Matt Zapotosky January 30 at 5:15 PM Follow @markberman Follow @mattzap Hundreds of protesters gathered at the arrivals gate of Washington Dulles International Airport to push back against President Trump's executive order that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Acting Attorney General Sally Yates has ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend challenges to President Trump\u2019s immigration order temporarily banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world, declaring in a memo Monday she is not convinced the order is lawful. Yates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure the department\u2019s position is both \u201clegally defensible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\u201d Yates wrote. She wrote that \u201cfor as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\u201d Yates\u2019s view is perhaps unsurprising; she was second-in-command at the Justice Department under President Obama, held over until a new attorney general can be confirmed. Still, her announcement is remarkable for its defiance. It was not immediately clear who would defend the president\u2019s order in the Justice Department\u2019s place. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on President Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), whose views align much more closely with the president\u2019s. Meanwhile, President Trump continued on Monday to adamantly defend his order, despite mounting criticism, legal challenges and questions that stretched from Capitol Hill to the United Nations. Trump\u2019s order has sparked protests from coast to coast, court cases challenging its constitutionality , unease in cities worldwide and a host of questions about the limits of its scope. Even as the White House remained defiant, former president Barack Obama became the latest high-profile voice to weigh in on the issue, offering his first public criticism of his successor while backing protesters. The ban\u2019s impact continued to reverberate around the world. The United Nations said that some 20,000 refugees could be affected by the 120-day suspension of refugee admission.\u00a0Lawyers sought to confirm how many people remain detained in the United States, while a lawsuit argued that dozens of people may have been forced to give up their green cards by Customs and Border Protection agents. [ Trump and his aides keep justifying the entry ban by citing attacks it couldn\u2019t have prevented ] Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said the situation at airports remains \u201cchaotic and fluid.\u201d Lawyers are \u201chaving trouble independently verifying anything because the government will not provide full access to all the detainees,\u201d he said. Gelernt said that by Monday afternoon, no list of detainees had been turned over, adding that the ACLU could be back in court within a day to get the list so it could obtain more definitive information. On Monday, in what could be the first volley in an intense legal battle,\u00a0Bob Ferguson, Washington state\u2019s attorney general, said he plans to file a federal lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the order\u2019s implementation. Ferguson is the first state official to declare plans to file such a suit, but he may not be the last. A day earlier, Ferguson joined 15 other state attorneys general in calling the measure unconstitutional. Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who joined in that message, is reviewing possible options, \u201cand that could certainly include litigation,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman, said Monday. White House officials have played down the anger and chaos over the order, holding a briefing with reporters Sunday evening to argue that the rollout was \u201ca massive success story.\u201d On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the ban and its implementation. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when the next attack\u2019s coming,\u201d he said during the briefing. \u201cAnd so the best you can do is to get ahead of it because if you wait, you\u2019re going to be reacting. And what I think I want to be clear on is the president\u2019s not going wait. He\u2019s going to make sure he does everything in his power when he can to protect the homeland and its people.\u201d Trump\u2019s order was followed by two days of intense protests at airport terminals across the country, meaning both weekends of his presidency so far have been marked by heavy public demonstrations against him. In his now-customary morning tweets, Trump blamed others for the disorganized implementation and sought to\u00a0 minimize its impact on travelers . Trump claimed that \u201cbig problems at airports\u201d were caused by the demonstrators themselves, an airline\u2019s technical problems and\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who teared up while discussing the ban. (Delta Airlines\u00a0 suffered technical issues Sunday evening \u2014\u00a048 hours after Trump signed the immigration order \u2014\u00a0that canceled about 150 flights.) \u201cOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBig problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage\u2026..protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.\u201d 1 of 36 How people reacted to Trump\u2019s immigration ban View Photos Thousands protested the president\u2019s executive order outside the White House, at Trump International Hotel and at Dulles International Airport.

Hours later, Obama \u2014\u00a0who had not weighed in on Trump since leaving office 10 days ago \u2014\u00a0 endorsed the protests that have emerged nationwide and rejected his successor\u2019s attempt to link the travel ban to the Obama administration. Obama feels \u201cheartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d\u00a0Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president, said in a statement. \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d Alluding to Trump\u2019s questionable claim that his ban was based on Obama administration decisions, Lewis said the former president \u201cfundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d [ Scholars: Many more legal challenges likely for Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration ] A group of former U.S. officials who served under presidents of both parties wrote a letter released to Politico asking the Trump administration to rescind the order, calling it \u201cinhumane, unnecessary and counterproductive from a security standpoint.\u201d On Capitol Hill, Democrats sought to capitalize on the growing public outcry and said they were hoping to pass legislation rescinding the ban and planning to delay confirmation votes for Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. Some Republicans have also spoken out against the ban, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.), top defense hawks who issued a joint statement bluntly worrying that the order could \u201cbecome a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\u201d Criticism also emerged in other quarters. State Department diplomats have been circulating a document objecting to Trump\u2019s order since he announced it Friday. According to a draft version of the memo,\u00a0first reported by the Lawfare blog, the dissenters say the ban will not deter attacks on American soil, but will generate ill will toward U.S. citizens. [ Jihadist groups hail Trump\u2019s travel ban as a victory ] Iraqi parliament leaders called for retaliatory visa restrictions on American citizens, while a petition called on Britain to cancel a planned state visit by Trump amid the furor. In a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed concern about \u201cthe uncertainty facing thousands of refugees around the world who are in the process of being resettled to the United States.\u201d According to the agency, more than 800 refugees were set to go to America this week but are barred, and the 120-day halt on refugee resettlement could impact as many as 20,000 refugees. \u201cRefugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process,\u201d the agency said. [ Officials worry that U.S counterterrorism defenses will be weakened by Trump actions ] In airports around the world, sorrow and relief mixed together as travelers entered an unknown future.\u00a0Trump\u2019s virtually unprecedented executive action applies to travelers and U.S. legal residents from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Libya and Yemen, and to refugees from around the world. People subject to the ban include dual nationals born in one of the seven countries who also hold passports from U.S. allies. At Dulles International Airport, lawyers and Democratic members of Congress were unable to get information from Customs\u00a0officials. Late Sunday, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said he was told there were no people in Customs custody at Dulles. Dozens of demonstrators gathered at Dulles to welcome international visitors, joining volunteer lawyers who gathered to monitor any potential problems. [ Share your thoughts on the travel ban ] Customs agents at Dulles\u00a0forced lawful permanent U.S. residents to give up their green cards this weekend, according to a complaint filed Monday in federal court in Alexandria. Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz were flying from Yemen to the United States. Both had been granted immigrant visas because their father, who lives in Flint, Mich., is a U.S. citizen. When they arrived at Dulles Saturday morning, the Aziz brothers were handcuffed and their immigration paperwork was seized, according to the complaint. They were given documents to sign and allegedly told that if they did not, they would be removed from the United States and barred from coming back for five years. They were not allowed to see attorneys. Under pressure, their attorneys said, they signed documents they did not understand, giving up their American visas, and agents stamped \u201ccancelled\u201d on those visas. Attorneys are asking for their visas to be returned, the forms they signed to be invalidated and for them to be returned to the United States. Attorneys said they believe it is possible that many of 50 to 60 other legal permanent residents at Dulles were likewise tricked into giving up their status there. The lawyers said they hope to learn the identities of those individuals through the discovery process. The Aziz brothers were compelled to buy tickets, at their own expense, for a flight back to Ethiopia, and when they arrived, their passports were confiscated, leaving them in limbo. Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said anyone with a valid visa should be able to enter the United States, even if they are abroad, and the ACLU is working to investigate reports that this is not happening. In the long run, Romero said, ACLU lawyers will work to get the executive order thrown out permanently, and they will seek to have its implementation delayed while they press their case. This court battle could take years, he said. Romero said they believe the executive order violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, some ratified treaties and \u2014\u00a0perhaps most acutely \u2014\u00a0the First Amendment, because it seems to target Muslims. The order\u2019s exception for those from minority religions in majority-Muslim countries \u201cis clearly the smoking gun that this has targeted individuals of the Muslim faith.\u201d \u201cThat dooms it from a First Amendment perspective, in our view,\u201d Romero said. The Council on American\u2010Islamic Relations on Monday filed a sweeping challenge to the executive order, alleging its \u201cpurpose is to initiate the mass expulsion of immigrant and non-immigrant Muslims lawfully residing in the United States.\u201d The lawsuit lists 27 plaintiffs, some of them activists and council officials and others students with visas, lawful permanent residents, refugees and others who allege Trump\u2019s order will deny them citizenship or prevent them from traveling abroad and returning home. [ Here\u2019s where Republicans stand on the travel ban ] Among them is a doctor who the suit alleges is working in an underserved area in the United States. \u201cIn the event he is prevented from returning to the United States, the area he serves will be lacking an essential physician to provide critical care to a substantial population in the United States,\u201d the lawsuit says. Gadeir Abbas, who joined with others to file the suit, said the lawyers are \u201cconfident that we can win, and fortunately, President Trump and those around him make it very easy to reveal that bigotry. They can\u2019t keep their mouths shut.\u201d Department of Homeland Security officials said the\u00a0executive order does apply to green-card holders, who may be let into the country with a waiver. The directors of each large port of entry, such as airports, have the authority to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a green-card holder may be admitted. Since Friday, dozens of green-card holders at large airports in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been admitted, officials said. The officials also said Friday\u2019s confusion has abated in these large airports because people subject to the ban are not being permitted to board flights overseas and so are not arriving at American airports. In Seattle, two men whose visas were revoked and who were put on plane to be deported were allowed to enter the United States after a federal judge issued an emergency ruling in their favor, said Matt Adams, the men\u2019s lawyer. Adams said the men \u2014\u00a0one an engineer from Sudan who was coming to the United States for a conference, the other a visitor from Yemen who was coming to see family \u2014\u00a0\u201cliterally had to get pulled off the plane as they were deporting them.\u201d The men dropped their lawsuit after they were allowed to enter the United States, Adams said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is now with the national stay in effect, if anyone were to arrive, then the government\u2019s precluded from trying to immediately deport them like they were doing on Saturday,\u201d Adams said. However, Adams said more lawsuits were likely, noting the number of people getting stopped as they tried to board planes abroad. The Department of Homeland Security said that \u201cless than one percent\u201d of international air travelers arriving Saturday in the United States were \u201cinconvenienced\u201d by the executive order \u2014 though the situation described by lawyers and immigrant advocates across the country was one of widespread uncertainty and disorder at airports where travelers from the targeted countries were suddenly detained. Trump wrote on Twitter that Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly \u201csaid that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\u201d\u00a0In other messages, Trump again cast his order as necessary to protect the country: There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 The seven countries under Trump\u2019s ban do not include several that have been tied to terrorists involved in major attacks or attempted plots in the United States. White House officials through the weekend and Monday continued to justify the ban by citing the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Boston Marathon bombing and San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage.\u00a0 None of these attacks involved people born in countries listed on the ban . President Trump signed an executive order to halt U.S. entry for refugees, migrants and foreign nationals for 120 days starting Jan. 27. Fiery protests and lawsuits made for a tumultuous weekend.

    "text": "Acting AG tells Justice Department staff not to defend Trump's refugee order Published               January 30, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, directed Justice Department attorneys Monday not to defend President Donald Trump's controversial executive refugee and immigration ban. Yates said in a memo that she was \"not convinced\" that Trump's order was lawful, nor that its defense was consistent with the department's obligation to \"always seek justice and stand for what is right.\" Yates' directive was likely to be temporary, given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, will likely move to uphold the president's policy. Sessions is currently awaiting Senate confirmation. Still, Yates' abrupt decision deepened the chaos surrounding Trump's order. The Associated Press reported that at least three top national security officials -- Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department -- have told associates they were not aware of details of directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order in the media. The fallout was immediate: Friction between Trump and his top advisers and a rush by the Pentagon to seek exemptions to the policy. The White House approach also sparked an unusually public clash between a president and the civil servants tasked with carrying out his policy. A large group of American diplomats circulated a memo voicing their opposition to the order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. In a startling combative response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer challenged those opposed to the measure to resign. \"They should either get with the program or they can go,\" Spicer said. The blowback underscored Trump's tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, many of whom he met for the first time during the transition, as well as with the government bureaucracy he now leads. While Trump outlined his plan for temporarily halting entry to the U.S. from countries with terror ties during the campaign, the confusing way in which it finally was crafted stunned some who have joined his team. Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday's signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed. A senior U.S. official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump's order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president's political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order. U.S. officials and others with knowledge of the Cabinet's thinking insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the officials' private views. Trump's order pauses America's entire refugee program for four months and indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria. Critics dispute the president's assertion that the policy is needed to keep Americans safe, noting that recent acts of extremist violence have been carried out either by U.S. citizens or by individuals whose families weren't from the nations singled out in the order. The president has privately acknowledged flaws in the rollout, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. But he's also blamed the media -- his frequent target -- for what he believes are reports exaggerating the dissent and the number of people actually affected. Trump has also said he believes the voters who carried him to victory support the plan as a necessary step to safeguard the nation. And he's dismissed objectors as attention-seeking rabble-rousers and grandstanding politicians. After a chaotic weekend during which some U.S. legal permanent residents were detained at airports, some agencies were moving swiftly to try to clean up after the White House. Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing much of the refugee ban, clarified that customs and border agents should allow legal residents to enter the country. The Pentagon was trying to exempt Iraqis who worked alongside the U.S. and coalition forces from the 90-day ban on entry from the predominantly Muslim countries. \"There are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves,\" said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. Policies with such broad reach are typically vetted by affected agencies and subject to review by multiple agencies. It's a process that can be frustratingly slow but is aimed at avoiding unintended consequences. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in Trump's party sought to distance themselves from the wide-ranging order. While Spicer said \"appropriate committees and leadership offices\" on Capitol Hill were consulted, GOP lawmakers said their offices had no hand in drafting the order and no briefings from the White House on how it would work. \"I think they know that it could have been done in a better way,\" Corker said of the White House. The executive order was largely crafted by Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, and Stephen Miller, a young policy adviser and former congressional aide to Trump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Spicer insisted the advisers had kept departments \"in the loop at the level necessary,\" but he sidestepped questions about whether Cabinet secretaries were directly involved in the process. Some Trump supporters defended the president, saying his actions should not have come as a surprise given his positions during the campaign. \"Nothing he did over the weekend was new,\" said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an informal adviser. He conceded that coordination could have been better, but he said Trump's vow to quickly bring change to Washington will sometimes mean he needs to prioritize fast action over broad consultation. \"If you're the reformer, you need the momentum,\" Gingrich said.

As havoc unfolded over the weekend following President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on refugees coming into the country, some longtime Washington hands were alarmed by something else: the revamping of the National Security Council, the group of Cabinet-level officials and others who\u00a0deliberate\u00a0on the... (Brian Bennett) In the name of party unity, many Republicans so far have refrained from publicly attacking the new president. But for\u00a0some, the new refugee\u00a0policy\u00a0crossed the line,\u00a0signaling the first major rift in their\u00a0already fraught partnership. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, one of the few GOP lawmakers critical of Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cWe need to be careful as we do this,\u201d warned Senate Majority Leader Mitch\u00a0McConnell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have religious tests in this country.\u201d Trump responded testily\u00a0with two Sunday afternoon\u00a0tweets aimed at Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey\u00a0Graham (R-S.C.), who had issued a statement that day criticizing the \u201chasty\u201d implementation of the policy. \u201cThe joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong \u2014\u00a0they are sadly weak on immigration. The two\u2026 Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.\u201d For a party that lambasted Obama\u2019s reliance on his \u201cpen and phone\u201d to bypass congressional roadblocks, Trump\u2019s\u00a0willingness to go it alone is testing the legislative branch\u2019s resolve to protect its power and maintain\u00a0influence in the Trump era. Lawmakers appear\u00a0to have little forewarning of what Trump is doing from one day to the next \u2014\u00a0or even hour to hour \u2014\u00a0learning about their party leader\u2019s latest moves the way everyone else does \u2014\u00a0when his tweets light up their smartphones. \u201cThis is obviously a transition that's underway here,\u201d said\u00a0Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate. \u201cThere are issues where there are going to\u00a0be differences of opinion between the White House and the Congress\u2026. What we have to try and do is focus on the things that unite us.\u201d Perhaps nowhere was the political adjustment more on public display than at the congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia last week as Trump\u2019s controversial\u00a0pronouncements ricocheted up the Acela corridor from the White House. Republicans\u00a0who had hoped to huddle privately to craft a policy agenda were forced to\u00a0veer\u00a0repeatedly off message as they fumbled to respond to Trump\u2019s string of actions and statements. Many were dismissive about\u00a0some of Trump\u2019s moves, particularly\u00a0his push for an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the 2016 election. \u201cHave at it,\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the House Oversight Committee chairman who said his committee had no plans to look into the matter.\u00a0 Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) admitted to reporters he was barely able\u00a0to keep up with the string of policy initiatives coming from the White House, and cautioned that Trump\u2019s approach might alienate Congress and others. \u201cYou\u2019re taking your eye off the message and harming your ability to unify Republicans in the country,\u201d Kinzinger said. Asked about Trump being a different kind of president, Sen.\u00a0Jim Risch (R-\u00a0Idaho), a former governor, quipped: \u201cYou think?\u201d \u201cBoth the president and Congress are adjusting,\u201d he added. Republicans have spent the last decade trying to climb back to power since President George W. Bush was in the White House and they lost control of Congress.\u00a0 Usually an election that puts the same party in control of both Congress and the White House\u00a0would open the door to coordination and cooperation between the\u00a0executive and legislative branches, which could seize the\u00a0rare opportunity to muscle their priorities into law. \u00a0 For example, Obama used such a\u00a0period to pass the Affordable Care Act, an economic stimulus package and financial reform. But few Republicans expected Trump would win the White House, so they didn\u2019t prepare\u00a0a cohesive\u00a0legislative agenda.\u00a0They have been playing catch up ever since with a president who has no government experience,\u00a0is unfamiliar with the lexicon of legislating and so far has had no qualms about leaving Congress in the dust. Much time has been spent behind the scenes trying to bring the president up to speed on how to transform his popular campaign slogans \u2014\u00a0build the wall; bring back American jobs; destroy Islamic State \u2014 into actionable policy. But it remains a work in progress. Some signs of morphing \u2014 and splintering \u2014 have emerged as each side steps up for a dance with the other. When Trump suggested Congress should pony up money for his promised border wall to deter illegal immigration \u2014\u00a0on his word that Mexico would ultimately repay the cost \u2014 Republicans signaled support, even if it means they initially add to the deficit. It was a stunning reversal for a party generally loath to pile on debt, having refused funds in the past for hurricane victims. At the same time, Trump appeared to inch closer to Republicans by suggesting funding for the wall could come through a so-called border-adjustment tax, something GOP leaders have been pushing as part of corporate tax reform. But the administration\u2019s position is unclear. Trump initially criticized the idea as too complicated, then the administration\u00a0seemed to endorse it and then backed away, saying it was only one idea under consideration. At the same time, as lawmakers struggle to figure out a replacement plan for Obamacare, they have received little help from the White House in shaping the details of such a plan. ",

    "text": "Scientists Describe Ancient Bag-Like Sea Creatures From China Scientists Describe Ancient Bag-Like Sea Creatures From China Embed Embed An artist's impression of Saccorhytus coronarius, a sea creature that lived 540 million years ago. Jian Han, Northwest University, China hide caption toggle caption Jian Han, Northwest University, China An artist's impression of Saccorhytus coronarius, a sea creature that lived 540 million years ago. Jian Han, Northwest University, China Scientists have described a new kind of sea creature in what's now central China. It lived 540 million years ago, and the tiny, baggy organism could occupy a peripheral spot on our own evolutionary tree. When scientists like Simon Conway Morris discover a new animal, they get to name it. He and his colleagues in China don't seem to give compliments where they aren't deserved. \"We arrived at the word Saccorhytus, which basically means a wrinkled bag,\" says Conway Morris, a paleobiologist at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. Actually, this thing is a lot uglier than a wrinkled bag. It's basically a giant gaping mouth with spikes and some extra holes \u2014 probably for oozing waste. \"Doesn't sound too appetizing, does it?\" says Conway Morris. Fortunately, it was no bigger than a grain of rice. How Boy Bits First Came To Be Morris and his colleagues in China and Germany announced the these ancient sand-dwellers (they found 45 of them) Monday in the journal Nature. He says the animals likely lived about 540 million years ago, \"slithering or clambering\" in sediment in shallow seas. \"It has a very small body. It doesn't have a tail. It does not appear to have eyes,\" says Conway Morris. And it doesn't appear to have an anus, either, though its pleated, expandable mouth sure did look like one. It sounds primitive, but compared to other life in that era , this little blob of an animal was on the cutting edge. This was a time in Earth's history when sea pens and mats of algae were about the most exciting things around. Article continues after sponsorship Conway Morris and his colleagues think it's a really important find, that the animals could be a distant side-shoot of our own evolutionary tree \u2014 a humbling part of it that doesn't come up much. \"What we have here is an animal which we would suggest is in fact the earliest known deuterostome,\" he says. Deuterostomes are a huge group of organisms that, over the next millions of years would come to include starfish, sea squirts and anything with a spine, including humans. (Interestingly, \"deuterostome\" is Greek for \"second mouth.\" That's either a polite euphemism, or a reference to the fact that now, everything in this group \u2014 us included \u2014 develops an anus first and then a mouth after that.) Instead of that key orifice, Saccorhytus coronarius had eight holes down the sides of its round body, where waste might have just passed through willy nilly. \"And why's that important? Because basically one of the very few hallmarks of all deuterostomes is what we call gill slits,\" says Conway Morris. Structures like those may have been precursors to gills, which were in turn an important stepping stone on the way to animals that were capable of walking and breathing on land. This critter is a glimpse of what the common ancestor of many of today's animals might have looked like, says Peter Van Roy , a paleobiologist with Yale University and Ghent University in Belgium who wasn't involved in the paper. \"Things that are really that early \u2014 540 million years old \u2014 are really important because they give major insights into the origins of all these major groups,\" says Van Roy. No one is arguing that this is our common great great great grandparent, but it's an ancestor of a major animal group that includes humans. So humans probably came from something that looked like it. \"We come from these tiny, small blobs. That, I think, is an important thing for people to realize,\" says Van Roy. Saccorhytus lived during a dramatic point in evolutionary history, the Cambrian explosion, when there was a big boom in diversity of creatures that resulted in all the major animal groups present today. \"Things start becoming big and start developing hard parts and structures to capture other animals and tear them apart \u2014 basically, a much more violent world,\" says Van Roy. Food chains were just starting to assemble. \"It was the beginning for the world as we know it now, a world that's dominated by active animals \u2014 things walking around, swimming around, not just sitting there,\" he says. There's another reason these fossils are interesting, says Imran Rahman , a paleontologist at Oxford University Museum of Natural History in the U.K. who wrote an accompanying article in Nature. There's a mystery about when, exactly, the explosion in animal diversity occurred. Molecular data, which allows researchers to estimate the age of the ancestor of two living species based on genetic differences between them, suggest it occurred as far back as 800 million years ago. But paleontologists don't see hard evidence of that spike in diversity until millions of years later, around 520 million years ago. \"So, there's this big gap in the record based on what would be predicted by molecular clocks and what we know from the fossil record,\" says Rahman. This rare fossil find, he says, suggests that diversity could have gotten started earlier than fossils suggest. \"Perhaps one of the reasons we didn't see so many animals in the fossil record is because the animals were really small,\" he says. Small enough to fit between grains of sand. ",

Lawyers from throughout Chicago showed up to assist travelers. Dawn Rhodes and Vikki Ortiz Healy Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune President Donald Trump 's immigration ban had repercussions Monday at colleges and universities throughout the Midwest, with officials urging some students and scholars not to leave the country. The University of Illinois joined several other major research institutions \u2014 Northwestern University , Purdue University , DePaul University and the University of Notre Dame among them \u2014 in urging students and staff from the seven Muslim-majority countries most affected by the new policy to defer travel abroad \"until there is fuller assessment.\" Trump's executive order, signed Friday, freezes entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halts Syrian refugees indefinitely and places a 90-day moratorium on the arrival of citizens of the predominantly Muslim countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In response, students and faculty began canceling personal and academic trips overseas. School leaders scrambled throughout the weekend to assess which students, faculty and academic programming would be affected by the restrictions and to ascertain whether anyone was stuck abroad. They also warned of the policy's long-term effects on higher education. Link: Statement on executive order on immigration from Chancellor Jones and President Killeen Open link \"We are greatly concerned about the negative consequences for members of our community and their families arising from President Trump's recent executive order instituting changes in immigration policy,\" said U. of I. President Timothy Killeen , who originally is from Wales and was a green card holder before becoming a U.S. citizen. There are more than 150 people from the affected countries at U. of I.'s Urbana-Champaign campus and 184 students, research scholars, faculty and staff at UIC , school officials said. U. of I. is not aware of any students, faculty or staff who are currently overseas and unable to return to the United States, Killeen said. There were more than 17,000 students from the seven countries studying in the United States during the 2015-16 academic year, according to the nonprofit Institute of International Education. The American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which has a membership of 420 four-year state colleges and universities, said the ban could have a negative effect on students and scholars across the country. But the organization has been struggling to issue definitive counsel to its members because of confusion in the way the executive order has been implemented and who is affected. Protesters rally at O'Hare after travelers held following Trump's order Protesters rallied\u00a0at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 28, 2017, after travelers were held, including those with green cards and visas, following President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration.

(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \"There's no question we are obliged to play by the rules,\" said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal policy for the association. \"But the implementation of the executive order, I dare say, has been very chaotic.\" The Trump administration has issued conflicting statements on how green card holders should be treated with respect to the executive order, a reflection of the chaotic rollout of the president's first major national security initiative. The Department of Homeland Security first said the ban extended to legal U.S. residents, then reversed course Sunday night when Secretary John Kelly issued a statement deeming \"the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\" In addition to the confusion in academia, the ban led to mass protests at major international airports throughout the weekend as arriving travelers were held by immigration authorities, and in some cases, sent back to their home countries. U.S. citizens and those holding green cards were among those stopped and questioned by immigration authorities. Dozens of Chicago-area lawyers camped out at O'Hare International Airport throughout the weekend to assist travelers who were being detained. Of the 17 people held at O'Hare on Saturday, three had student visas to allow them to legally enter the country, according to a database maintained by lawyers at the airport. All three are listed as being from Pakistan, which is not one of the countries listed in the ban. It was not immediately clear which schools those students attend or the reason they were held.

University of Illinois President Timothy Killeen meets with the Chicago Tribune Editorial\u00a0Board on \u00a0July 12, 2016. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Mercedes Badia-Tavas, president of the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said she thinks universities are making the right decision in issuing travel advisories. Until the situation becomes more certain, there's too much risk involved for some travelers, she said. \"That's the problem when you don't have clear instructions on how you implement the order,\" Badia-Tavas said. \"Everyone shoots in the dark and they start detaining everyone.\" University leaders across the country criticized the executive order, including the president of Purdue University, which has about 100 students and 10 faculty from the affected countries. None have been stranded outside the United States, according to the school. \"The President's order related to immigration is a bad idea, poorly implemented, and I hope that he will promptly revoke and rethink it,\" Purdue President Mitch Daniels , former Republican governor of Indiana, said in a statement. \"If the idea is to strengthen the protection of Americans against terrorism, there are many far better ways to achieve it.\" Northwestern University also cautioned that students from the affected countries should not travel abroad. Northwestern has 71 students, scholars and faculty from Iran, including graduate students with student visas and faculty and scholars visiting the university as postdoctoral candidates and researchers, according to statistics from Northwestern's international office. \"We believe strongly that there is no legitimate basis for depriving students and scholars from those countries who have already obtained visas from entering the United States to study and conduct research at Northwestern or elsewhere,\" Northwestern President Morton Schapiro said. He also pledged \"all the necessary actions to protect our students, faculty and staff,\" including not providing federal authorities information on someone's immigration status. Notre Dame President the Rev. John Jenkins also called on Trump to rescind the executive order, saying it will \"demean our nation.\" While some universities strongly urged against traveling abroad, others issued softer warnings. At the Illinois Institute of Technology, which has the second-highest number of international students among Illinois schools, the provost warned citizens of the affected countries that they \"likely will not be allowed to return\" to the United States. University of Chicago leaders reaffirmed their commitment to foreign-born students but also advised citizens of those countries to \"carefully consider\" before traveling outside the United States. U. of C. President Robert Zimmer also penned a letter to the White House asking the administration to commit to welcoming students and scholars from other countries. Hearing these messages of inclusion from management, whether it's a university president, a CEO or a school principal, is critical for those affected by Trump's order, said Maryam Kouchaki, an assistant professor of management and organization at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. \"They feel really alone, not respected, not valued,\" said Kouchaki, who is Iranian and holds a green card. \"Research has shown exclusion hurts.\" At Oakton Community College in Des Plaines, as word got out that one of its math tutors, Hessan Noorian, was detained for several hours at O'Hare after coming back from Iran, officials made counselors and other resources available for students worried about how the executive order could impact them. At Monmouth College, a private, liberal arts school in western Illinois, administrators planned to meet Monday night with about a dozen students from Syria who have visas to study in the United States. They hoped to offer encouragement, answer questions and quell fears. \"I think everyone is equally confused and unclear right now,\" college spokesman Duane Bonifer said. \"We're telling our students just to go to class, continue to work on their degree ... they've got the college's support.\" Meanwhile, the ban also is creating dilemmas for some university staff who are U.S. citizens working closely with the listed countries. Northwestern professor Elizabeth Shakman Hurd was scheduled to leave next month for Iran for a two-week seminar and tour to study politics, religion and other international issues. But after Iran issued a ban reciprocating the one imposed by Trump's order, Hurd said her plane tickets and spot on the enrichment tour may go to waste. She said she will have to teach upcoming courses about Iran, including \"International Politics and the Middle East,\" without the firsthand knowledge she planned to bring home from her trip. \"This will have a chilling effect on academics in the United States that I think we cannot even begin to estimate at this point,\" said Shakman Hurd, a political science professor. \"It's going to really hamper our ability to do our jobs.\" Chicago Tribune's Ally Marotti and Stacy St. Clair contributed. drhodes@chicagotribune.com ",

The \"one in, two out\" plan requires federal agencies requesting new regulations to cut two existing regulations. Trump said the order will reduce the regulatory burdens on the private sector, particularly small businesses. \"If you have a regulation you want, number one, we're not going to approve it because it's already been approved probably in 17 different forms,\" Trump said while signing the order surrounded by small business leaders. \"But if we do, the only way you have a chance is we have to knock out two regulations for every new regulation. So if there's a new regulation, they have to knock out two.\" Related: With Executive Order on Deregulation, Small Businesses Mainly Optimistic Government agencies must self-identify the regulations to cut, though the White House will ultimately decide what to nix. There is currently a temporary regulatory freeze that was issued by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. But Monday's directive sets a budget for new regulations, though the order does not apply to military or national security. There is also an exception to allow flexibility during emergencies. President Trump, accompanied by small business leaders, signs an executive order in the Oval Office cutting regulations. Carlos Barria / Reuters Before signing the order, Trump held a listening session with the business leaders at the White House where he pledged to create a climate that will allow businesses to thrive. \"We're going to create an environment for small business like we haven't had in many, many decades,\" Trump said. \"This isn't a knock on President Obama, this is a knock on many presidents preceding me. It's a knock on everybody.\" The businessman turned politician campaigned heavily against overbearing government rules that he said stifle entrepreneurship. Trump has pledged to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act aimed at regulating Wall Street, which he claims made the big banks bigger, and replace it with \"new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.\" Wall Street has embraced Trump's presidency so far, with the Dow hitting 20,000 points for the first time ever last week. Stocks dipped, however, on Monday as uncertainty swirled around Trump's order to close the U.S. to people from certain predominantly Muslim countries. Trump has relied heavily on executive orders since his Jan. 20 inauguration to begin addressing his biggest campaign promises. He has declared the U.S. will build a wall on the southern border with Mexico, advanced the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, and weakened the Affordable Care Act. Andrew Rafferty ",

Cincinnati Enquirer Mayor John Cranley announced endorsements from two local unions Tuesday, an attempt to rain on Rob Richardson Jr.\u2019s candidacy announcement and send a message to him. (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) 11010 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 52 COMMENTEMAILMORE CINCINNATI \u2014 Cincinnati is defying President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, joining a group of major U.S. cities in welcoming people who are in the country without permission. Standing amid several of the region's\u00a0Muslim, Catholic, Jewish and political leaders, Mayor John Cranley on Monday proudly announced Cincinnati as a so-called \"sanctuary city.\" It means Cincinnati will not enforce federal immigration laws against people who are here illegally, something the city already has been doing. \u201cWe have put the whole world on notice that we intend to live up to the Statue of Liberty ideals,\u201d Cranley said. He added that being a sanctuary city \"is a badge of honor.\" Police divided over Trump's 'sanctuary city' order The sanctuary debate is separate from the ongoing national and international debate over Trump's temporary suspension of the U.S. refugee program, which has blocked immigrant refugees with visas and green cards from legally entering the country. Cranley and others spoke Monday about the refugee ban and the chaos it has caused worldwide, but the focus was on illegal immigrants and their place in Cincinnati. The decision to declare Cincinnati a sanctuary city does not put the city\u00a0in danger of losing federal money, Cranley said, though Trump has threatened to withhold\u00a0money from\u00a0any local jurisdictions that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials. \"I don't believe it,\" Cranley said. \"I just don't believe it.\" Others aren't so sure. Republican Councilman Charlie Winburn said he had \"concerns\" about the sanctuary city status. \"I'm not interested in putting\u00a0federal\u00a0funding for Cincinnati in jeopardy. I also don't want to make the jobs of our police officers any harder.\" Defining the possible consequences of calling Cincinnati a \u201csanctuary city\u201d is a challenge, mostly because Trump has not yet defined his plan and because the term sanctuary city means different things to different people. Big city mayors vow to defy Trump on sanctuary cities order In some communities, local law enforcement may be discouraged from cooperating with federal immigration officials, while in others local authorities may simply avoid actively involving themselves in immigration enforcement. Based on written policies and past statements, Cincinnati appears to fall into the latter category. \u201cWe value our immigrant population,\" Chief Eliot Isaac said. \"The Cincinnati police department is in the business of making\u00a0everyone\u00a0safe. We will not be enforcing immigration laws.\u201d Nothing local authorities are doing, however, would stop or interfere with the work of federal immigration officials. Cincinnati Police Department policy is to cooperate in most cases with federal authorities if they seek assistance, but that doesn\u2019t mean officers will begin checking the immigration status of everyone they encounter if federal authorities ask. Although local enforcement agencies can sign agreements with federal authorities to enforce immigration laws, federal law does not require them to do so. \u201cWe don\u2019t proactively seek out people who are undocumented or are over-staying their visas,\u201d Cincinnati police spokesman Steve Saunders said. \u201cThat\u2019s not our role.\u201d Trump has said the costs of defying the federal government in any way could be high, saying federal aid to sanctuary cities could be at risk. Cincinnati does not receive any federal money specifically for immigration, city officials said. As part of its $1 billion annual operating budget, the city receives federal money for housing, roads\u00a0and non-immigration related law enforcement projects, according to city budget documents. \"It is against the law to deny federal funding to communities for taking positions like this,\" said Todd Portune, president of the Hamilton County board of commissioners. \"Immigration issues like deportation are civil issues, they\u2019re not criminal law.\" Cincinnati joins several other cities that have Democratic mayors in being a sanctuary city, including New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco.\u00a0\"Sanctuary city\" is a popular term among pro-immigration activists, but it does not have a set definition and is not an\u00a0official government designation. Cincinnati already has taken steps to be a \"sanctuary city\" the past two years, and Democratic council members Yvette Simpson and Chris Seelbach had\u00a0been working on a plan to designate the city as such in recent months. Simpson is running against Cranley in this year's mayoral race, but she stood alongside other leaders during the mayor's press conference and did not want to politicize the matter. \"I wish we could've gotten here sooner,\" Simpson said, \"but I'm just glad we're doing it now.\" Follow Jason Williams and Dan Horn\u00a0on Twitter: @jwilliamscincy and @danhornnews 11010 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 52 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jMTrlm NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Her directive was likely to be temporary, given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, will likely move to uphold the president's policy. Sessions is awaiting Senate confirmation. Still,\u00a0Yates' abrupt decision deepened the chaos surrounding Trump's order. At least three top national security officials \u2014 Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order in the media. The fallout was immediate: Friction between Trump and his top advisers and a rush by the Pentagon to seek exemptions to the policy. The White House approach also sparked an unusually public clash between a president and the civil servants tasked with carrying out his policy. A large group of American diplomats circulated a memo voicing their opposition to the order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. In a startling combative response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer challenged those opposed to the measure to resign. Washington state's attorney general declared Monday that he was suing President Donald Trump over his temporary ban on immigration from seven countries with majority-Muslim populations, making it the first state to announce a legal action against the Trump administration over one of its policies. ... ... (Tribune news services) \"They should either get with the program or they can go,\" Spicer said. The blowback underscored Trump's tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, many of whom he met for the first time during the transition, as well as with the government bureaucracy he now leads. While Trump outlined his plan for temporarily halting entry to the U.S. from countries with terror ties during the campaign, the confusing way in which it finally was crafted stunned some who have joined his team. Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday's signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed. A senior U.S. official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump's order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president's political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order. U.S. officials and others with knowledge of the Cabinet's thinking insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the officials' private views. Ed O'Keefe, David Weigel Democrats are doubling down on plans to drag out the confirmation of President Trump's top Cabinet picks, seizing on a growing public outcry against the president's ban on certain migrants and refugees to further stall the formation of his new government and Republican legislative plans. Using... Democrats are doubling down on plans to drag out the confirmation of President Trump's top Cabinet picks, seizing on a growing public outcry against the president's ban on certain migrants and refugees to further stall the formation of his new government and Republican legislative plans. Using... (Ed O'Keefe, David Weigel) Trump's order pauses America's entire refugee program for four months and indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria. Critics dispute the president's assertion that the policy is needed to keep Americans safe, noting that recent acts of extremist violence have been carried out either by U.S. citizens or by individuals whose families weren't from the nations singled out in the order. The president has privately acknowledged flaws in the rollout, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. But he's also blamed the media \u2014 his frequent target \u2014 for what he believes are reports exaggerating the dissent and the number of people actually affected. Trump has also said he believes the voters who carried him to victory support the plan as a necessary step to safeguard the nation. And he's dismissed objectors as attention-seeking rabble-rousers and grandstanding politicians. After a chaotic weekend during which some U.S. legal permanent residents were detained at airports, some agencies were moving swiftly to try to clean up after the White House. Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing much of the refugee ban, clarified that customs and border agents should allow legal residents to enter the country. The Pentagon was trying to exempt Iraqis who worked alongside the U.S. and coalition forces from the 90-day ban on entry from the predominantly Muslim countries. \"There are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves,\" said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. Policies with such broad reach are typically vetted by affected agencies and subject to review by multiple agencies. It's a process that can be frustratingly slow but is aimed at avoiding unintended consequences. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in Trump's party sought to distance themselves from the wide-ranging order. While Spicer said \"appropriate committees and leadership offices\" on Capitol Hill were consulted, GOP lawmakers said their offices had no hand in drafting the order and no briefings from the White House on how it would work. \"I think they know that it could have been done in a better way,\" Corker said of the White House. The executive order was largely crafted by Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, and Stephen Miller, a young policy adviser and former congressional aide to Trump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Spicer insisted the advisers had kept departments \"in the loop at the level necessary,\" but he sidestepped questions about whether Cabinet secretaries were directly involved in the process. Some Trump supporters defended the president, saying his actions should not have come as a surprise given his positions during the campaign. \"Nothing he did over the weekend was new,\" said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an informal adviser. He conceded that coordination could have been better, but he said Trump's vow to quickly bring change to Washington will sometimes mean he needs to prioritize fast action over broad consultation. \"If you're the reformer, you need the momentum,\" Gingrich said.

A second man who was detained after the attack on the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Center, where six people were killed and 17 others were injured, is considered a witness and not a suspect. Police said they are confident there was only one shooter. Alexandre Bissonette poses in a photo posted on his Facebook page. via Facebook Police have said one of the two men was arrested after he called 911 to say he was in his car on a bridge near \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans, an island in the Saint Lawrence River, and was armed and ready to surrender, officials said. More than 50 people were in the mosque at the time of the attack. Laval University, where Bissonnette was a student, identified one of the victims as an agriculture professor, Khaled Belkacemi, 60. The others were Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42; Abdelkrim Hassane, 41; Aboubaker Thabti, 44; Azzeddine Soufiane, 57; and Ibrahima Barry, 39. \"This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons on Monday afternoon. \"Make no mistake: This was a terrorist attack.\" Professor Khaled Belkacemi was killed in the mosque shooting. via INAF No more information has been released about the motive. In June, a pig's head was left on the doorstep of the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Center, but it was not known whether the incident was related in any way. A former classmate of Bissonnette's told NBC News that he was shocked by the arrest but said that the suspect was known to troll Facebook pages dealing with immigration issues and that he had seen him comment on pages linked to a far-right, nationalist, anti-immigration movement. A local refugee group said in a Facebook post that Bissonnette was known to it for anti-immigrant and anti-feminist stances. \"His online life was full of hate, but in real life he was calm and his chess game was on point,\" said Antoine Cabanac, a former classmate. Bissonnette's Facebook page said he had studied political science and anthropology at Laval University. There were photos of him at a party, with family, in a Halloween costume and posing in front of a chessboard. He had liked pages for heavy metal bands, video games and public figures ranging from far-right French politician Marine Le Pen and U.S. President Donald Trump to chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov and Pope John Paul II.

    "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch January 30, 2017, 4:35 PM A who's who of CEOs decry Trump's travel ban Email Last Updated Jan 30, 2017 5:15 PM EST Some of America\u2019s most prominent companies have condemned President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial executive order that temporarily restricts immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. That directive has also spurred nationwide protests and lawsuits in several states, in addition to condemnations in many foreign capitals. The reaction has been especially strong from the U.S. technology industry , which counts on foreign workers to fill positions that don\u2019t have enough American applicants with the necessary skills. In a memo to employees , Apple ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Tim Cook said he shared their concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions and promised the company would do all it can to help employees affected by the action. \u201cIt is not a policy we support,\u201d wrote Cook, who\u2019s a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum. \u201cApple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship.\u201d President Trump took to Twitter to defend his controversial executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the... Cook didn\u2019t specify how many employees are affected. A spokesperson for the Cupertino, California, company couldn\u2019t immediately be reached.\u00a0 About 200 employees \u00a0of Alphabet\u2019s Google ( GOOG ) business are affected by the move, according to the search engine giant. Co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, reportedly joined protestors denouncing the move at the San Francisco International Airport. Google also formed an immigration crisis fund that could raise as much as $4 million for groups that are helping immigrants, such as the American Civil Liberties Union. About 76 Microsoft ( MSFT ) workers were affected as were three IBM ( IBM ) employees according to the companies, which both raised concerns about the new policies. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, himself an immigrant from India, told the software giant\u2019s employees that he has experienced the benefits of immigration, a point he has made in private meetings\u00a0 with government leaders . My note to all @Yelp employees this morning... pic.twitter.com/3Bu70cjW6K \u2014 Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) January 30, 2017 Other companies were still assessing the order\u2019s impact on their staff. The Trump administration has argued that the media was hyping the impact of the order, which resulted in the detention of 109 people. \u201cI have not seen such widespread CEO outrage since the 2002 corporate backlash against Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley regarding the vague open-ended nature of the mandate that all publicly traded companies must establish internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and must document, test and maintain those controls and procedures to ensure their effectiveness -- providing no guidelines on what is required,\u201d said Jeffery Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for Leadership Studies at Yale School of Management, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook (Photo: Getty Images) The 'Trump Trade' might not be invincible after all. On Monday, Wall Street started to account for political and policy risk for the first time in the Trump era, with the Dow suffering its biggest point drop since the election amid fallout stemming from President Trump's\u00a0order to clamp down on immigration from seven Middle East countries with Muslim-majority populations. \"This is not a positive story for the markets,\" says Gregory Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. Since Trump's Nov. 8 election, Wall Street has been driving stocks higher on Trump's business-focused agenda, which include\u00a0cutting corporate taxes, slashing regulations and ramping up fiscal spending. But Monday's trading action signals that\u00a0investors are concerned about some of\u00a0Trump's other policies, which include his views on immigration and a protectionist stance on global trade. 'Hamilton' Ponzi scheme suspect linked to ticket reseller The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down nearly 224 points at its session low Monday, closed down\u00a0122.65 points, or 0.6%, to 19,971.13. It was the blue-chip stock gauge's worst point loss of 2017 and its biggest since a 200.38-point fall on Oct. 11. Other major U.S. stock indexes also fell, but finished the day\u00a0off their lows. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell\u00a00.6% to 2280.90 and the Nasdaq lost 0.8%. The lousy start to the week comes after the Dow topped 20,000 for the first time last Wednesday. The selloff also occurred\u00a0ahead of a busy week of earnings results from Corporate America, the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of 2017 and the final look at the employment market in 2016 when the December jobs report is released Friday. Much of the angst on Wall Street comes from Trump's executive order signed Friday that placed a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also imposed a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program and blocked Syrians from entry indefinitely. The move triggered protests and confusion at U.S. airports over the weekend. Trump's\u00a0travel ban\u00a0also caused a sharp spike in market uncertainty, as investors tried to handicap the fallout of a less-open U.S. border on key sectors of the economy, such as technology, Wall Street also wondered whether sealing off the U.S. border to certain people would ultimately trigger\u00a0wider concerns over global trade and the free movement of educated workers. \"We are not saying all this divisiveness will cause problems for the market; we are just saying it is something to watch,\" says Gary Kaltbaum, president of\u00a0Kaltbaum Capital Management. Wall Street fears the border flap and others like it will steer Trump's focus away from more market-friendly policies. Immigrant tech workers fear 'reactionary' travel ban The immigration flap is taking the market's focus off of the \"one issue that matters to Wall Street most -- tax reform,\" says Valliere.\u00a0It's\u00a0also\u00a0creating worry\u00a0that changes to the tax code might not be \"on the front burner\" and could \"get delayed amid the furor over immigration,\" he\u00a0adds. Border wars could also hurt U.S. competitiveness, some money managers fear. Longer-term, Trump's immigration ban could send the message that \"highly skilled workers from abroad ... aren't welcomed,\" says Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments. \"The U.S. is at risk of losing the fight for the best and brightest.\" The controversy over Trump's immigration policy has at least one market pro urging caution. \"The maelstrom our president has unleashed over immigration ... is yet another reason to honor our ... cautionary\u00a0stance in the near-term,\" Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James wrote in a report.

    "text": "Obama Says He 'Fundamentally Disagrees' With Discrimination Based on Religion By Meridith McGraw Jan 30, 2017, 3:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH What President Trump's Executive Order Does 0 Shares Email Former President Obama \u201cis heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\u201d but he \u201cfundamentally disagrees\u201d with discrimination based on faith or religion, Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said today. President Trump signed an executive order on Friday calling for a suspension of immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries with ties to terror, including the suspension of the United States\u2019 acceptance of Syrian refugees. That move was met by protests in airports and city streets nationwide. \u201cIn his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy -- not just during an election but every day,\u201d Lewis said in a statement. \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,\" he added. The statement pushed back on assertions by the Trump administration that Trump\u2019s policy is comparable to restrictions put in place during the Obama administration. \u201cWith regard to comparisons to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy decisions, as we\u2019ve heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\u201d Lewis said. In November 2015, President Obama spoke out against impulses to discriminate based on religion and commended President George W. Bush for being adamant after the 9/11 terror attacks that America is not at war with Islam. \u201cIt was the right impulse. It\u2019s our better impulse,\u201d Obama said during a news conference in Antalya, Turkey, on Nov. 16, 2015 -- a few days after the attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. \u201cAnd whether you are European or American, the values that we are defending -- the values that we\u2019re fighting against ISIL for are precisely that we don\u2019t discriminate against people because of their faith,\" Obama added during the news conference. \"We don\u2019t kill people because they\u2019re different than us. That\u2019s what separates us from them. And we don\u2019t feed that kind of notion that somehow Christians and Muslims are at war.\u201d 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Trump Says His Order Didn't Cause Weekend Airport Chaos By vivian salama and catherine lucey, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 30, 2017, 2:04 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Protests Grow in Wake of Trump's Immigration Ban 0 Shares Email Holding firm to his immigration order, President Donald Trump on Monday denied it was to blame for chaos at the nation's airports over the weekend, instead pointing to computer glitches, protesters and even the \"tears of Senator Schumer.\" Later he shifted the focus away from the weekend's immigration turmoil, signing an executive action aimed at cutting regulations for small businesses. White House officials called the directive a \"one in, two out\" plan, requiring government agencies requesting a new regulation to identify two others they will cut. Trump signed the order in the Oval Office surrounded by small business leaders, saying it would \"massively\" cut regulations and calling it the \"biggest such act that our country has ever seen.\" Trump's business announcement came as protests continued around the country over his immigration order. Early Monday, he took to Twitter to defend the move, saying that only 109 out of 325,000 people \"were detained and held for questioning.\" Trump also said swift action was important, noting that there are a \"lot of bad 'dudes' out there.\" Trump's order temporarily suspends all immigration for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days. Democratic New York Sen. Schumer choked up over the weekend while talking about the repercussions from the ban, but that brought scorn from Trump. \"I noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with fake tears - I'm going to ask him who was his acting coach, because I know him very well. I don't see him as a crier,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. Top Trump aides compared the order to a 2011 policy on Iraqi refugees, when President Barack Obama imposed additional checks on Iraqi refugees after two Iraqis were charged with terrorism offenses in Kentucky. Unlike Trump's order, the Obama policy applied only to Iraqi refugees and never specifically prohibited entry. Meanwhile, Trump announced he will reveal his pick for the Supreme Court at 8 p.m. Tuesday. The court has had eight justices since the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Obama nominated Merrick Garland for the post, but Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refused to take up the nomination. Trump enters his second week in office amid a global backlash to his policies. European Union officials denounced his immigration order as a dangerous embrace of isolationism and inequality, while the international aid group Doctors Without Borders accused Trump of keeping people \"trapped in war zones, directly endangering their lives.\" In Iraq, two lawmakers said the Iraqi parliament has approved a \"reciprocity measure\" restricting the entry of Americans into Iraq. Trump's order does not address homegrown extremists already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. And the list of countries in Trump's order doesn't include Saudi Arabia , where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from. Trump's take on the weekend turmoil: \"Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.\" A Delta systems outage Sunday night led to departure delays and cancellations of at least 150 flights. However, the chaos started Saturday as protesters packed some of the country's major airports to demonstrate against the executive order. In the face of criticism, Trump says his order is not a \"Muslim ban.\" SLIDESHOW: Demonstrators Gather Across the US to Oppose Immigration Order A number of U.S. diplomats prepared a memo criticizing it. In a \"dissent cable,\" being drafted for State Department leadership, the diplomats say the ban runs counter to American values and will fuel anti-American sentiment around the world. They say it won't produce a drop in terror attacks in the U.S., but instead \"a drop in international good will toward Americans.\" U.S. officials say several hundred diplomats have signed on. The dissent cable originated in the State Department's Consular Affairs bureau, which handles visas and whose employees are most directly affected by Trump's order. There appeared to be widespread confusion among authorities tasked with carrying out the order and how it would be applied to certain groups, such as U.S. legal permanent residents. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement Sunday saying that, absent information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, citizens of the seven countries who hold permanent U.S. residency \"green cards\" will not be barred as officials had previously said. It remains unclear what kind of additional screening they will face. Republican Ohio Sen. Rob Portman urged the new president to \"slow down\" and work with lawmakers on how best to tighten screening. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday, \"I think there are some people who might not like the way it was done, but they were all consulted in the process.\" A federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from the seven nations. The order bars U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrives in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covers anyone with an approved refugee application. The Department of Homeland Security said Sunday the court ruling would not affect overall implementation of the White House order. Several Democrats in Congress said they would be introducing legislation to stop the ban. Washington state's attorney general said Monday he would sue Trump over the executive order, making Washington the first state to announce a legal action against the administration. Bob Ferguson was one of 16 state attorneys general who released a statement Sunday calling Trump's immigration action \"un-American and unlawful.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press writers Josh Lederman, Alicia Caldwell and Steve Peoples in Palm Springs, California, contributed to this report. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj \u2014\u2014\u2014 This story has been corrected to ...

    "text": "WATCH Kellyanne Conway Talks Trump's Executive Orders 0 Shares Email President Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway defended his criticism of GOP Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham today, saying the president's fellow Republicans need to back his leadership. \"We want them to be there for the president and support him,\" she said on ABC News' \" Good Morning America \" on Monday. Conway was responding to questions from ABC News' chief anchor, George Stephanopoulos , about Trump's response on Twitter on Sunday after McCain and Graham issued a joint statement criticizing Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 ...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. Trump Spars With Sens. McCain and Graham After They Criticize Travel Ban Conway asserted that Trump has accomplished an impressive amount in the short time since he took office, saying, \"I mean, Donald Trump has been on the job for \u2014 what? \u2014 eight, nine, 10 days. Barack Obama was here for eight years,\" she said. \"The extraordinary accomplishments in just the first week truly are breathtaking.\" The executive order signed Friday suspends immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa \u2014 Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Libya \u2014 for 90 days. It also blocks refugees from entering the country for 120 days; refugees from Syria are barred indefinitely. When Stephanopoulos asked Conway why the order, which repeatedly cites the 9/11 terrorist attacks, covers none of the three countries where those attackers were from \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 she said Trump's order follows the Obama administration's lead. \"These countries were identified by President Obama. President Trump is merely following President Obama's lead on state-sponsored terrorist countries, where they have a history of training and exporting, harboring terrorists,\" she said. She added that many of those protesting against the order may not understand what it really says and suggested that the media has overblown its impact. \"This is temporary. It is narrowly prescribed,\" she said. 0 Shares ",

Got it Janie Killips waves an LGBT pride flag on Jan. 21 during the Women's March in Madison, Wis. (Angela Major/Associated Press) By Juliet Eilperin and Sandhya Somashekhar By Juliet Eilperin and Sandhya Somashekhar January 30 at 6:36 PM Follow @eilperin Follow @sandhyawp The White House is embroiled in a debate over whether to reverse some key protections that the Obama administration extended to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers, according to several people briefed on the process. A draft of a potential executive order began circulating in Washington over the weekend that would overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s directive barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the federal workforce and by federal contractors. But individuals familiar with deliberations within the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no final decision has been made, said that the details of the policy remain in flux and that it is far from certain President Trump would ultimately issue such an order. That top officials are debating whether to wade into the issue of gay and transgender rights highlights the tension the new administration faces when it comes to social issues. Trump campaigned on an economic message, but he is under pressure from the social conservatives who propelled him into office to implement their top priorities. [ Supreme Court takes up school bathroom rules for transgender students ] The issue of gay rights is particularly fraught for Vice President Pence, who as governor of Indiana signed a controversial measure expanding religious liberties in a way that gay rights groups said opened the door to legalized discrimination. A national outcry over the bill led Pence and the state legislature to weaken the measure . Speaking to reporters Monday , White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment on whether an executive order affecting gay and transgender people was under consideration. \u201cI\u2019m not getting ahead of the executive orders that we may or may not issue,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThere is a lot of executive orders, a lot of things that the president has talked about and will continue to fulfill, but we have nothing on that front now.\u201d The executive order Obama signed in 2014 had two parts. It expanded protections in federal hiring, which already barred discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, to also include gender identity. And it required all companies doing business with the federal government to have explicit policies barring discrimination against gay and transgender workers. The move was significant because it applied to 24,000 companies that collectively employed about 28\u00a0million workers \u2014 representing about a fifth of the U.S. workforce. But the order drew sharp criticism from religious leaders \u2014 including many who were Obama\u2019s allies at the time \u2014 because it did not provide an exemption for religious organizations that contract with the government. Many faith-based groups, including Catholic Charities USA, receive federal grants to assist people with housing, disaster relief and hunger, and expressed concern about the precedent it could set for other forms of federal funding. Gay rights groups argued that such an exemption would amount to a loophole giving groups the right to discriminate. Any attempt by the Trump administration to rescind or weaken Obama\u2019s order would essentially be an effort to \u201cauthorize discrimination\u201d against gay and transgender people, said James Esseks, director of the LGBT program at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThe Trump administration has shown that it\u2019s willing to go against core American values of freedom and equality, and it\u2019s troubling to hear they may target LGBT people as well,\u201d he said. But he said the impact might be mitigated because federal law bans discrimination on the basis of sex. Many courts have interpreted discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity to be a form of sex discrimination.

    "text": "News Local news Breaking News About 40 held at O'Hare on Monday Protesters rallied at O'Hare this weekend, after authorities took travelers into custody in response to Trump's immigration order. Lawyers from around Chicago showed up to assist travelers having problems. Nereida Moreno and Stacy St. Clair Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune About 40 travelers were held at O'Hare International Airport for additional questioning Monday, as concerns and confusion continued over President Donald Trump 's immigration ban. The vast majority of the affected travelers were released and allowed to pass through customs, attorneys said. Three people \u2014 including two Iranian-born travelers who are legal U.S. residents \u2014 remained unaccounted for, according to logs maintained by lawyers at the airport. The Trump administration has issued conflicting statements on how green card holders should be treated under the executive order, a reflection of the chaotic rollout of the president's first major national security initiative. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the ban extended to legal U.S. residents, then reversed course Sunday night when Secretary John Kelly issued a statement deeming \"the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.\" Yet green card holders from the seven majority-Muslim countries listed in Trump's ban \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 are still being subjected to uncommon levels of scrutiny upon arrival at O'Hare. The National Immigration Justice Center, along with the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, issued an advisory Monday telling U.S. residents from those targeted countries to expect hourslong questioning at the airport and that their phones, email and social media accounts may be checked. Iranian-born Gholamreza Behforooz, 65, was held with his wife and 14-year-old son for nearly three hours upon arriving at O'Hare on Monday. The family, legal U.S. residents, immigrated to Muncie, Ind., three years ago in the hopes of a better life for their children. Behforooz's 23-year-old daughter, Mitra, a student at Ball State University , was relieved to finally see her family emerge from customs, though she expressed concerns about what life will be like for them over the next four years.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) \"They have green cards. Shouldn't they be fine? This whole weekend was tragic,\" she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen next.\" Local immigration attorneys also are grappling with uncertainty and are advising clients potentially affected by the ban not to leave the country unless absolutely necessary. The recommendation echoes a similar advisory issued by several major Midwest universities Monday, which urged some students and scholars not to travel abroad \"until there is further assessment.\" \"Out of an abundance of caution, I would advise my clients to stay here,\" Chicago-based immigration attorney Fiona McEntee said. \"This confusion is just crazy. These are details that should have been taken care before it was signed.\" McEntee is one of more than 500 Chicago-area lawyers who have volunteered in recent days to assist travelers affected by Trump's immigration crackdown. Under U.S. law, travelers are not entitled to legal representation at ports of entry, so the lawyers established a makeshift office in the international terminal and have made their services known to families anxiously waiting for detained travelers.

    "text": "Trump Acts To Roll Back Regulations On Businesses The statement was remarkable for the setting and the vitriol. Of course, presidents often have their differences with congressional leaders, especially from the opposition party. But rarely, if ever, do they call them out by name, and question the sincerity of their tears. It's also odd for a president to use photo sprays \u2014 where the media are invited in for what are typically short moments to get pictures \u2014 to level insults at political opponents. Normally, the president might utter a couple of sentences about the event taking place to push that issue \u2014 in this case, small businesses \u2014 and maybe take a question before the media is hurried out. In this case, Trump spoke for 13 minutes \u2014 without taking questions. For context, that's just three minutes shorter than his entire inaugural address. Trump had earlier Tweeted a similar annoyance with Schumer, saying, \"Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.\" Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning.

By Kristine Guerra By Kristine Guerra January 30 at 1:51 PM Follow @kristinegWP Vice President Pence waves before delivering remarks at the 44th March for Life, on the Mall in Washington on Jan. 27.\u00a0(Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency) About 4 \u00bd months ago, an attorney representing the administration of then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence stood in front of what amounted to a judicial firing squad. \u201cYou are so out of it,\u201d U.S. Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner told Indiana Solicitor General Thomas Fisher, who was tasked with defending Pence\u2019s decision to block aid to Syrian refugees coming to the state. The state government already had lost the case in Indianapolis, where a federal district judge found that targeting only Syrians, but not refugees from other countries with the potential to produce terrorists, was unconstitutional\u00a0and amounted to discrimination based on national origin.\u00a0The state\u00a0tried, unsuccessfully, to overturn the ruling. During a hearing in September on the appeal,\u00a0two judges seemed more than critical of the government\u2019s arguments. Posner and Judge Frank Easterbrook, both of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago, fired barbs, at times sarcastically, at Fisher who argued \u2014 over and over, but not to the judges\u2019 satisfaction \u2014 that the governor\u2019s decision was a response to FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s testimony before Congress that there were \u201ccertain gaps\u201d in intelligence about refugees coming from Syria. \u201cYou don\u2019t think there are dangerous people from Libya, from Egypt, from Saudi Arabia, from Yemen, from Greece and France and Germany, which have had terrorist attacks?\u201d Posner asked. Indiana\u2019s new governor has dealt another blow to his predecessor\u2019s efforts to keep Syrian refugees from coming to the state. Gov. Eric Holcomb (R), who was hand-picked by Pence to succeed him when he became vice president, said in October that he will continue to allow refugees to \u201cfind a safe haven\u201d in Indiana, the Indianapolis Star reported . [ Mike Pence wants to keep Syrian refugees out of Indiana. They\u2019re coming anyway. ] Critics say the legal battle in Indiana over Syrian refugees and President Trump\u2019s executive order barring migrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations from coming to the country appear to have a common theme \u2014 painting an entire citizenry with the same brush. That\u2019s contrary to legal principle, said David Orentlicher, a constitutional law professor at Indiana University\u2019s Robert H. McKinney School of Law. \u201cIn terms of the principles of our laws, it\u2019s the idea that you be judged as an individual,\u201d said Orentlicher, a Democrat and a former member of the Indiana House.\u00a0\u201cYou know, not because you\u2019re part of a group. \u2026 To treat Syrians and Iraqis and Iranians the same is inconsistent with our principle, that we judge your guilt or innocence based on yourself, what you\u2019ve done, not what others have done.\u201d Legal experts, however, say that the legal challenge Pence faced in Indiana was fundamentally different from what his new boss is likely to encounter as a result of\u00a0the executive action \u2014 perhaps Trump\u2019s most controversial directive so far. Pence\u2019s decision in Indiana, while also controversial, brought national attention to his conservative state. In an editorial published in the Star in November 2015 , Pence defended his decision, saying his \u201chighest duty and first responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of the people of our state.\u201d But his actions were far more limited than Trump\u2019s and did\u00a0not appear to be an outright ban on refugees. Rather, his administration withheld money to prevent local agencies from resettling Syrian refugees who have already gone through a federal screening process. The Indiana case also is unlikely to serve as a blueprint for how constitutional challenges to Trump\u2019s order will play out in court, legal experts say. For one thing, federal law governs immigration and refugee issues, and state governments can\u2019t interfere. As president, Trump has broad authority\u00a0over implementing immigration policies. The federal government has more discretion to make distinctions based on countries of origin than states do, said Richard Primus, a constitutional law professor for the University of Michigan. President Trump signed an executive order halting all refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days, among other provisions. Here's what the order says. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Trump\u2019s\u00a0unprecedented executive action applies to migrants and U.S. legal residents from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\u00a0Green-card and visa holders who happened to be en route to the United States\u00a0when the order was signed were detained at airports over the weekend as administration officials implemented Trump\u2019s\u00a0directive. Confusion remains over how expansive the order is. On Sunday, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that green-card holders are not affected, contradicting what government officials had said\u00a0earlier. Parts of Trump\u2019s executive action had already been put on hold by\u00a0federal judges in New York, California, Virginia, Seattle and Boston.\u00a0 Scholars told The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Kranish and Robert Barnes \u00a0that\u00a0the Trump administration is likely to face more legal challenges, including the argument that the president\u2019s decision discriminates based on national origin. In Indiana, U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt\u00a0found that Pence discriminated by halting aid for\u00a0Syrian refugees\u00a0who had already passed screening by the federal government.\u00a0She also wrote in her ruling last February that withholding funds meant to provide social services for refugees \u201cin no way directly, or even directly, promotes the safety of Indiana citizens,\u201d\u00a0 the Star reported . \u201cWhy all Syrian refugees? Why does Indiana have a blanket screen?\u201d Pratt asked Fisher during an earlier hearing, the Star reported . The appeals court judges in Chicago heard the case several months after Pratt\u2019s ruling. The heated exchange \u00a0between Fisher and the two judges, Posner and Easterbrook, lasted for nearly 20 minutes. While Fisher was arguing that discrimination \u201cis not at play,\u201d Easterbrook chuckled. \u201cWhen a state makes an argument that\u2019s saying we\u2019re differentiating according to whether somebody is from Syria, but that has nothing to do with national origin, all it produces is a broad smile,\u201d he said. Fisher kept repeating one main point \u2014 that Pence was relying on statements by Comey about the lack of information about\u00a0refugees coming from Syria, and that no similar statements were made about people from other war-torn countries. At one point, Posner asked if Syrians are the only Muslims whom Indiana fears. \u201cThis has nothing to do with religion,\u201d Fisher explained. \u201cThis has to do with what\u2019s going on in Syria.\u201d \u201cOh, of course it does,\u201d Posner snapped back. \u201cOh, I object to that, your honor,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cLook, if you look at the attacks, the terrorist attacks on the United States, 9/11, attacks in New York, Boston, San Bernardino, they\u2019re all by Muslims. ISIS is Muslim. Al-Qaeda\u00a0was Muslim. You understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Posner asked. Posner, a Ronald Reagan appointee known for his forthright remarks, asked repeatedly why Indiana \u201csingled out Syrians.\u201d And, repeatedly, Fisher answered by going back to what Comey said about Syrian refugees. \u201cLook, I asked you whether the FBI director has said the United States is perfectly secure against foreign terrorists unless they\u2019re from Syria,\u201d Posner said. \u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Fisher responded.

    "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the media Monday of overplaying and misreporting on a range of fresh administration controversies -- specifically describing claims of a shakeup at the National Security Council as \"utter nonsense.\"\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of misreporting,\u201d Spicer said. The press briefing on Monday saw a return to a more combative style for Spicer. While he spent much of the briefing chiding the media over their description of President Trump's executive order on immigration, he opened with a point-by-point rebuttal -- complete with visual aids -- to critical reports about a separate action signed Saturday that restructures the NSC, a key advisory body.\u00a0 Those reports claimed Trump had effectively downgraded the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence, while promoting adviser Steve Bannon to the principals committee \u2013 which is the National Security Council, only without the president. The New York Times \u00a0had labeled Bannon's role \u201ca startling elevation of a political adviser\u201d and said it put him at the same level as National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. The Times also said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and DNI chief are only to join the principals committee when directly affected. Spicer shot back, saying, \u201cThe idea that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and DNI are being downgraded or removed is utter nonsense.\u201d In making his point, he presented a related 2001 memo by President George W. Bush and a related 2009 memo by President Barack Obama, and argued the relevant passages were virtually the same.\u00a0 As for Bannon\u2019s elevation, Spicer also downplayed its significance and noted that former Obama adviser David Axelrod had attended NSC meetings as well, though had not been given a formal promotion to the role. \u201cDavid Axelrod walked in and out of NSC meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat this shows is that this administration is being rather transparent.\u201d He also suggested Bannon \u201cwon\u2019t be at every meeting.\u201d He added, \u201cHe'll come in and out as needed, but we wanted to be up front about it.\u201d Spicer also reacted to a tweet by former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who had asked where the role of the CIA was in the memo. Spicer noted there was no mention of the CIA in Obama's 2009 memo either. However, he said Trump had decided to amend his memo to add CIA Director Mike Pompeo to the top circle of national security advisers Since taking the podium for the first time last week, Spicer has made a point to call out what the administration believes to be inaccurate or biased reporting.\u00a0On Monday, he also doubled down on the administration\u2019s defense of the controversial order suspending the refugee program and entry to the U.S. for travelers from certain countries. Spicer said it was one of a number of steps \"to make sure that this country is as safe as it can be and that we're ahead of every threat.\" Spicer further was asked to comment on a report in The Washington Post that said dozens of State Department staffers are ready to sign a memo opposing Trump\u2019s travel restrictions, saying they are poorly conceived and against American values. Spicer seemed unfazed by the memo: \"I think that they should either get with the program or they can go,\" he said. \"This is about the safety of America.\"\u00a0 He also addressed the controversy surrounding a statement released by the White House on Holocaust Remembrance Day \u2013 which omitted any specific reference to Jewish people despite them being the overwhelming majority of victims in the genocide. \"By and large he's been praised for it,\" Spicer said of the statement. He said Trump was recognizing the suffering of those who endured the Holocaust, \u201cwhether they were Jews, Gypsies, gays, [people with a] disability, priests.\u201d \"The idea that you're nitpicking a statement that sought to remember this tragic event that occurred and the people who died in it is just ridiculous,\" he said.\u00a0 The Republican Jewish Coalition, among other groups, called the omission \"unfortunate.\"\u00a0 Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Obama's office released a statement Monday that, while not directly critical of President Trump, did applaud those protesting a travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim countries. The statement from Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis: \"President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy \u2014\u00a0not just during an election but every day. \"Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake. \"With regard to comparisons to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy decisions, as we\u2019ve heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\" Read more: Posted!

CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports that Iran tested a missile on Sunday that flew 550 nautical miles and then exploded.\u00a0 A defense official said that the missile test ended with a \u201cfailed\u201d re-entry into the earth\u2019s atmosphere. The official, speaking to The Associated Press, had no other details, including the type of missile. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\u00a0 Iran is the subject of a United Nations Security Council resolution prohibiting tests of ballistic missiles designed to deliver a nuclear warhead. As part of the 2015 nuclear deal , the U.N. ban was prolonged by eight years, although Iran has flaunted the restriction.\u00a0 Mr. Trump\u00a0 has strongly criticized the nuclear deal, which was made between Iran and several world powers. He has said that he doesn\u2019t\u00a0 want to simply tear up the agreement , but instead has spoken of reopening the diplomacy.\u00a0 In mid-January, Iran\u2019s president compared talk of renegotiating its nuclear accord to \u201cconverting a shirt back to cotton.\u201d \u00a0President Hassan Rouhani told reporters that renegotiation was \u201cmeaningless,\u201d Reuters reported. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said on Monday that the U.S. was looking into whether the ballistic missile test violates the U.S. Security Council resolution. \u201cWhen actions are taken that violate or are inconsistent with the resolution, we will act to hold Iran accountable and urge other countries to do so as well,\u201d Toner said.\u00a0 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Email CHICAGO\u00a0-- Activists who say too many poor people are unfairly languishing in U.S. jails because they can\u2019t afford to post cash bail are increasingly deploying a new tactic: Bailing out strangers. Community groups are collecting donations from individuals, churches, cities and other organizations in more than a dozen cities, including New York, Chicago, Seattle and Nashville, to bail out indigent prisoners. Though many bail funds are still in their infancy, they\u2019ve freed several thousand people in the last few years, and the number is growing. So far, the overwhelming majority of defendants still show up for court even when they have no money on the line, according to the groups. Once free, the defendants are better able to fight their case, often leading to charges being dropped or reduced. \u201cMany, many people are having their lives ruined pre-trial because they can\u2019t afford to get out of jail,\u201d said Max Suchan, who co-founded the Chicago Community Bond Fund, which had bailed out 50 people as of December. The bail funds are a step toward a larger goal for some legal reform activists: abolishing the cash bail system. Advocates say it creates two unequal tiers of justice: one for people who can afford bail and one for people who can\u2019t. Lavette Mayes, 46, who was arrested for the first time after she got into a fight with her mother-in-law, spent more than a year in Cook County Jail unable to come up with $25,000 needed to get out. The mother of two, who was in the midst of a divorce, said she \u201clost everything - my home, my car, my business, my credit,\u201d before the Chicago bond fund offered to get her out. \u201cI called my attorney and said \u2018Is this real?\u2019 I said, \u2018If they can do it, I promise I won\u2019t jump the bail. I will do whatever they need me to do,\u2019\u201d Mayes recalled. Mayes resolved her aggravated battery case a few months later and was sentenced to one day in prison, with credit for the 571 days already served. As the broader bail reform issue has received more attention in recent years - in part due to events such as the death of Sandra Bland, a black woman who died in a Texas jail cell after a traffic stop while waiting help posting bail - opposition has come from bail bondsmen, who charge fees to post a bail bond on someone\u2019s behalf, and some law enforcement officials. Barb Chapman, president of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States and the star along with her husband of television\u2019s \u201cDog the Bounty Hunter,\u201d said the community groups mean well but don\u2019t have the resources or expertise to ensure that freed prisoners don\u2019t abscond or reoffend. \u201cThey\u2019re not licensed or trained to deal with the criminal element,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get burned.\u201d The bail agents organization also argues that eliminating the cash bail system would put the public at risk. With few exceptions, Chapman said, \u201cPeople are not in jail because they are poor. They\u2019re in jail because they broke the law.\u201d Some local authorities oppose it because bonds forfeited by people who don\u2019t show up to court provide a revenue stream for counties. But one of the biggest barriers to change is simply \u201chistory and practice,\u201d said Peter Goldberg, who leads the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for so long to one degree or another that it\u2019s just the way the system works,\u201d he said. Some groups, including the Brooklyn fund and one in the Bronx, will only post for people charged with misdemeanors and who are in jail because they cannot afford a bail of $2,000 or less. Each year more than 10,000 cases in New York city fit those criteria, Goldberg said. Since May 2015, the Brooklyn fund has secured release for more than 1,300 of them. The group now serves 100 to 110 people per month with an average bail paid of $910. Goldberg said 95 percent have returned for all court dates. In Chicago the anti-cash bail movement has a seemingly unlikely ally in Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart. He argues the cash system should be abolished and replaced with more thorough background checks; if a person is considered dangerous, they stay in jail and if they\u2019re not, they go free, with access to services such as drug-addiction counseling if needed. As of last week, there were more than 1,100 inmates at Cook County jail - or about 15 percent of the roughly 7,500 total jail population - who needed to post bail of $5,000 or less to be released. Of those, almost 300 needed $1,000 or less, county officials said. Housing each of those people costs the county a minimum of $150 per day. Jocelyn Simonson, an assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School, wrote an article on bail funds that will appear in the Michigan Law Review in March. When she started her research four years ago she said there were three or four funds operating nationwide. There will be 15 to 20 by the end of this year, and \u201cthey have not plateaued,\u201d Simonson said. She says the funds give communities - particularly minority communities - a way to push back against a system that disproportionately punishes them, and it goes beyond getting some people out of jail. \u201cThey\u2019re not just freeing individuals,\u201d Simonson said. \u201cThey\u2019re making a statement about the fairness of the criminal justice system.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

The pumi is an ancient Hungarian herding breed Westminister Dog Show The pumi, the sloughi \u00a0and the American hairless terrier will be newcomers at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show next month in New York. They can compete among as many as 202 breeds and varieties for the coveted Best in Show award. Dogs from the three newly eligible breeds were showcased at a preview news conference Monday. More than 2,800 dogs are expected at the show, set for Feb. 11, 13 and 14. Besides the traditional breed judging, it includes agility and obedience competitions - and a non-competitive \u201cmeet the breeds\u201d event that even includes cats this year. A soft-spoken beagle really raised a ruckus last year. The Sloughi is a rare breed of sighthound from the North African countries of Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria.

Gregg Phillips, whose unsubstantiated claim that the election was marred by 3 million illegal votes was tweeted by the president, was listed on the rolls in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi, according to voting records and election officials in those states. He voted only in Alabama in November, records show. In a post earlier this month, Phillips described \"an amazing effort\" by volunteers tied to True the Vote, an organization whose board he sits on, who he said found \"thousands of duplicate records and registrations of dead people.\" Trump has made an issue of people who are registered to vote in more than one state, using it as one of the bedrocks of his overall contention that voter fraud is rampant in the U.S. and that voting by 3 to 5 million immigrants illegally in the country cost him the popular vote in November. The AP found that Phillips was registered in Alabama and Texas under the name Gregg Allen Phillips, with the identical Social Security number. Mississippi records list him under the name Gregg A. Phillips, and that record includes the final four digits of Phillips' Social Security number, his correct date of birth and a prior address matching one once attached to Gregg Allen Phillips. He has lived in all three states. At the time of November's presidential election, Phillips' status was \"inactive\" in Mississippi and suspended in Texas. Officials in both states told the AP that Phillips could have voted, however, by producing identification and updating his address at the polls. Matea Gold, Alice Crites Jared Kushner , President Donald Trump 's son-in-law and one of his closest White House advisers, is registered to vote in both New Jersey and New York, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is on the rolls both in Virginia and his home state of Rhode Island, according to elections officials... Jared Kushner , President Donald Trump 's son-in-law and one of his closest White House advisers, is registered to vote in both New Jersey and New York, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is on the rolls both in Virginia and his home state of Rhode Island, according to elections officials... (Matea Gold, Alice Crites) Citing concerns about voters registered in several states, the president last week called for a major investigation into his claim of voter fraud, despite his campaign lawyer's conclusion that the 2016 election was \"not tainted.\" \"When you look at the people that are registered, dead, illegal and two states, and some cases maybe three states, we have a lot to look into,\" Trump said in an ABC interview. Reached by telephone Monday, Phillips said he was unaware of his multiple registrations but asked, \"Why would I know or care?\" \"Doesn't that just demonstrate how broken the system is?\" he asked. \"That is not fraud \u2014 that is a broken system. We need a national ID that travels with people.\" Phillips has been in the national spotlight since Nov. 11, when he tweeted without evidence that his completed analysis of voter registrations concluded the \"number of non-citizen votes exceeded 3 million.\" Thousands of people liked and retweeted the claim, which led to a viral article three days later on InfoWars.com, a site known to traffic in conspiracy theories.

Wochit A photographer looks at the sky at night to see the annual Geminid meteor shower near Provenzales' rock, in Maira Valley, northern Italy, on Dec. 6, 2016. A new study says the entire universe could be a hologram. (Photo: MARCO BERTORELLO, AFP/Getty Images) Talk about a reality check: The entire universe could be a \"vast and complex hologram,\" scientists reported Monday. Also, even more unsettling, what we think of as reality may \u00a0be just an illusion. \"Imagine that everything you see, feel and hear in three dimensions (and your perception of time) in fact emanates from a flat two-dimensional field,\" said study co-author Kostas Skenderis of the U.K.'s University of Southampton. \"The idea is similar to that of ordinary holograms where a three-dimensional image is encoded in a two-dimensional surface, such as in the hologram on a credit card,\" Skenderis said.\u00a0\"However, this time, the entire universe is encoded.\" A sketch of the timeline of the holographic universe. Time runs from left to right. The far left denotes the holographic phase and the image is blurry because space and time are not yet well defined. At the end of this phase (denoted by the black fluctuating ellipse) the universe enters a geometric phase, which can now be described by Einstein's equations. The cosmic microwave background was emitted about 375,000 years later. Patterns imprinted in it carry information about the very early universe and seed the development of structures of stars and galaxies in the late time universe (far right). \u00a0(Photo: Paul McFadden) It's similar to\u00a0watching a 3-D movie\u00a0in a cinema, according to the study. While we see the pictures as having height, width and depth, they in fact all originate from a flat two-dimensional\u00a0screen. The study authors say they found the evidence for a holographic universe by studying the\u00a0\"afterglow\" of the Big Bang with powerful new telescopes. The telescopes\u00a0detected a vast amount of data hidden in the \"white noise\"\u00a0or microwaves left over from the moment the universe was created. Theoretical physicists and astrophysicists first identified the concept of a holographic universe in the 1990s, and this discovery is the best evidence yet for that theory. The odd theory is equally likely to other, more traditional hypotheses about what makes up the\u00a0universe, the scientists say, adding that it may further explain Einstein's theory of gravity and also quantum theory. The study appeared in the journal Physical Review Letters \u00a0and was led by scientists from Canada, England and the U.S. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Aguilar, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Fullscreen A new species of dinosaur had feathers not just on its wings but also on its hind legs, making it one of only a handful of \"four-winged\" dinosaurs. It also had big, sharp teeth and sharp claws, indicating it was carnivorous. Scientists report in 'Nature Communications' that the extraordinarily long tail feathers of the Changyuraptor yang could have helped save the animal from crash landings.\u00a0 Stephanie Abramowicz, Dinosaur Institute, NHM Fullscreen Unlike the other 60-plus known species of horned dinosaurs, the newly-discovered Mercuriceratops, center, has wing-like protrusions on the side of its skull. Measuring about 20 feet long and weighing more than 2 tons, Mercuriceratops lived about 77 million years ago. The species is named after Mercury, the Roman god with the winged helmet, says Michael Ryan, the lead author of a report published in June on Mercuriceratops in the journal 'Naturwissenschaften.'\u00a0 Danielle Dufault Fullscreen Researchers have discovered evidence of water \u2014 enough to fill oceans \u2014 embedded in minerals deep beneath the surface of the United States that could alter the current understanding of Earth's composition and how it was formed. Were this water in liquid form, which it is not, the discovery could be considered the planet's largest underground water reservoir, researchers said. The team of researchers, led by geophysicist Steve Jacobsen and seismologist Brandon Schmandt, has found pockets of magma about 400 miles beneath Earth's surface \u2014 clear signs of the presence of water, though not in its familiar liquid form. Here is hydrous ringwoodite synthesized from olivine in Jacobson\u2019s laboratory.\u00a0 Steve Jacobsen Fullscreen A sea creature previously thought to be a sea anemone belongs to an order of it's own, researchers found. The Relicanthus daphneae lives near deep sea thermal vents in the Pacific and had been considered a giant sea anemone because of it's boneless, immobile carnivorous state. But while the anemone lost it skeleton over millions of years of evolution, R. daphneae never had them. \"Putting these animals in the same group would be like classifying worms and snakes together because neither have legs,\" says researcher Estefan\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez. (Picture: A diver looks at a sea anemone off  Saba island in the Caribbean in 2012.)\u00a0 Brian Witte, AP Fullscreen An exploratory dig for Los Angeles' subway extension project uncovered Ice Age fossils, including geoducks (or large clams, pictured), sand dollars and digger pine tree cones and seeds. A rock found in the dig \"appears to have a sea lion skull within it that is perhaps 2 million years or more old,\" according to the Metro Rail's blog.

A fly called Apocephalus borealis attaches itself to the bee and injects its eggs, which grow inside the bee, Hafernik said. Scientists believe it causes neurological damage resulting in erratic, jerky movement and night activity, \"like a zombie,\" Hafernik told the Associated Press. These aren't undead bees doomed to roam for eternity. They often die only a few hours after showing symptoms, Hafernik said.\u00a0 Andy Duback, AP Fullscreen The duck-billed dinosaur known as Edmontosaurus regalis was supposed to be a plain Jane of the Cretaceous. Now scientists have discovered that it actually had a spectacular adornment unique in the dinosaur world. A beautifully preserved new fossil shows Edmontosaurus boasted a party hat of jiggly flesh atop its head. Researchers theorize that like a rooster's coxcomb, the crest was brightly colored and served as a signal to others of its kind. Never before have scientists found such a non-bony crest on a dinosaur.\u00a0 Juliis Csotonyi, Current Biology Fullscreen Potentially the world's oldest-known wine cellar was discovered in what is now present-day Israel. Anthropologist Eric Cline, who helped unearth the site, says the cellar was near a hall where banquets took place in the 75-acre Tel Kabri site in Israel. The ruins date back to about 1700 B.C. Overall, 40 jars, the equivalent of 3,000 bottles of wine, were found packed in a 15-by-25 foot storage room, Cline said.\u00a0 Skyview Photography Fullscreen The Hubble Space Telescope photographed a never-before-seen asteroid with at least six comet-like tails on Sept. 10, and then again two weeks later.

The fossils were found in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in November 2009, and a team of paleontologists spent four years digging them up and traveling the world to confirm they were a new species. Paleontologists believe the dinosaur lived 80 million years ago in the late Cretaceous Period on a landmass in the flooded central region of North America.\u00a0 Audrey Atuchin,  Natural History Museum of Utah, via AP Fullscreen Tamu Massif, a monster volcano roughly the size of Arizona, ranks among the largest such structures in our solar system, 'Nature' reports by way of a Nature Geoscience study. But Tamu Massif differs from typical seamounts in that it has a nearly indiscernible slope\u2014around 1 degree near the summit (which sits 6,500 feet below the surface), and much less near the base, National Geographic reports.

(Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) The people who elected Donald Trump president say the furor over his executive order on immigration is nothing compared to the one he\u2019d cause if he did nothing to crack down on travel into the country from nations linked with terrorism. \u201cThis is exactly what he promised during the campaign,\u2019\u2019 said A. D. Amar, a college professor who immigrated to the U.S. decades ago from India. \u201cIf he did not do this, I and many other of his supporters would have been disappointed.\u2019\u2019 That, in the Trump camp, is putting it mildly. If Trump backed down, \u201cI would be furious,\u2019\u2019 said Barbara Cope, a retired hospital employee who lives in Elmwood Park, N.J. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018This is what you ran on! You lied like all the other politicians!\u2019\u2019\u2019 Both are members of Trump Nation, an array of Trump voters in all 50 states who\u2019ve spoken periodically with the USA TODAY Network \u00a0about their hopes and expectations of the new president.\u00a0Although much analysis of Trump\u2019s order has focused on how his election victory empowers him to make such changes, it\u2019s also true that if he does not make them, there will be a political price. Read more: The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Trump\u2019s order prohibits entry by all refugees for four months and by Syrian refugees indefinitely, and it calls for \u201cextreme vetting\" in the future. It also bars any visitors for three months from seven nations deemed to be sources of terrorism, all of which have Muslim majority populations.\u00a0Other nations with Muslim majorities whose citizens have committed terror attacks, such as Saudi Arabia, were not covered by the order. At least part of the backlash against Trump\u2019s order focused on the haste in which it was issued; the confusion it created, especially at airports; and the impression it gave of America turning its back on the world. But Gene Dunn, a longtime Trump supporter who lives on Long Island, decried what he called the \u2018\u2019whining about all the \u2018chaos\u201d being caused by the travel ban.\u00a0\u201cIf you want chaos,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cwatch what happens when some ISIS maniac yells, \u2018Allah Akbar!\u2019 and proceeds to mow down innocent Americans with a machine gun, bomb, big construction truck, or God forbid, one day with WMDs.\u2019\u2019 Despite the inconvenience or hardship caused by the order, \u201cwith something like this, there\u2019s gonna be some toes stepped on,\u2019\u2019 said Michael\u00a0McCoy, a saw mill owner who lives outside Weaverville, in the mountains of western North Carolina. He\u2019s one of many registered Democrats who voted for Trump. Now he's a registered Republican. \u201cTrump caught the population off guard on this,\u2019\u2019 Amar said. \u201cPeople did not expect it to happen so soon.\u2019\u2019 People chant slogans at the Indianapolis International Airport, on Jan. 29, 2017, during a protest against President Trump's executive order temporarily suspending all immigration for citizens of seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days. \u00a0(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson, AP) McCoy was among those who admitted he was confused by what seemed like a complex issue, and he expressed dismay over the case of a South Carolina college student who was stranded by the order.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t truly understand international travel, because I don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u2019 he said. But, he added, the order and the process it set in motion\u00a0\u201cseems over-complicated to me. This nation is great at over-complicating things.\u2019\u2019 Amar, however, said there was no way the order could have been worded or issued that would have placated Trump\u2019s critics.\u00a0\u201cThe reaction is very much based on the side to which one belongs,\u2019\u2019 said Amar, who teaches business at Seton Hall University and lives in rural Warren County, N.J. \u201cWhen I hear some opposition, I find that the individuals voted for Clinton. Those who support it are Trump voters.\u2019\u2019 Read more: Congressional Democrats seek to repeal Trump's refugee travel ban And they like what they\u2019re seeing. According to a Quinnipiac poll, although Trump's job approval among all Americans has slumped to 36% \u2014 the lowest on comparable record \u2014 since the inauguration his stock has risen among Republicans from 76% approval two weeks ago to 81%. After the election, it seemed Trump might get a pass on many of his campaign promises. This was because his supporters\u2019 loved him so much, because his opponents hated his proposals so much, and because of a general acknowledgement that Trump the campaigner was best taken seriously but not literally. And at first the president-elect seemed inclined to take the pass. He said he wouldn\u2019t necessarily build a wall along every inch of the Mexican border; would focus deportation efforts not on all illegal immigrants, but on those with criminal records; and try to retain some redeeming facets of Obamacare. Then he took office. \u201cOnly a person like Trump could do such bold things,\u2019\u2019 said Amar. Cope knew why: \u201cBecause he has the toughest skin \u2014 tougher than snakeskin.\u2019\u2019 Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Silliman, pictured in 2016, was left scrambling to deal with the travel ban's fallout. (Hadi Mizban / Associated Press) Laura King and Nabih Bulos Contact Reporter The news arrived in Iraq like a thunderbolt. Of the countries whose nationals President Trump has temporarily barred from entering the United States, this close U.S. ally\u00a0would have seemed the least likely to be targeted. Baghdad is a front-line partner in the fight against Islamic State . A major battle is underway right now: American forces are backing Iraqi and Kurdish fighters as they seek to drive jihadists from Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of shock,\u201d said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq\u00a0who maintains deep connections with the country. \u201cNo one saw this coming.\u201d A disruption of U.S.-Iraqi ties could have wide impact. Thousands of American contractors work in Iraq. Business deals, including arms sales and energy, run into the billions of dollars. U.S. troops and diplomats have for years depended on Iraqis working alongside them, sometimes in life-or-death situations. There is close intelligence cooperation between the two countries. Iraq\u2019s pro-American government was still struggling for its footing on Monday, three days after being blindsided by the executive order. Prime Minister Haider Abadi, already vulnerable to restive internal factions, swiftly came under strong parliamentary pressure to retaliate with measures to keep out Americans. Lawmaker Meshan Jboori, from a Sunni faction, said the Iraqi government needed to act to \u201cpreserve the dignity of the people.\u201d \u201cMy belief is that Trump saw that our government is weak and wanted to fulfill his promises to the electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government will have trouble if they don\u2019t follow through on this decision.\u201d Officials and ordinary citizens alike said they found it baffling to be on a list that also included the failing or failed states of Libya and Yemen and avowed U.S. rival Iran. Among those caught by surprise was Lukman Faily, a former ambassador to Washington, who said he would not be able to travel to the United States for upcoming conferences. He told CNN that Iraqis were \u201castonished\u201d by the travel ban, considering it a deep affront to national pride. Diplomatically, Iraq has so far been treading carefully. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement asking the new U.S. administration to \u201creconsider this wrong decision.\u201d \u201cWe affirm Iraq\u2019s desire to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries,\u201d it said, noting the essential nature of cooperation in fighting the jihadists of Islamic State. Then there are families who had hoped to escape their homeland\u2019s violence and make new lives for themselves in the United States. The wife and four children of Nizar Isaac \u2014 members of a minority Christian sect from a village outside Mosul \u2014 were approved for refugee visas and had planned to leave Tuesday for Michigan, reuniting with a son who had arrived in the U.S. two months earlier. In a shabby Beirut apartment, five suitcases wrapped in cellophane and two red UNICEF tote bags were ready to go. The travel ban dashed the family\u2019s departure hopes. Isaac, a 52-year-old plumber, had planned to stay behind because his application was rejected. He\u00a0had been distraught over the prospect of being separated from his wife and children, but that was outweighed by the desperate hope that they would find safety and refuge in the United States. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could follow them or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like I was getting a divorce, but I had accepted it.\u201d The ban, which blocks entry of all citizens for 90 days, also includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump\u2019s order also keeps out all refugees for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely. Particularly galling to some was the notion that Iraqis entering the United States posed a terrorist threat, in light of the fact that few countries have been harder hit by terrorism. Suicide bombings and other attacks have killed and maimed thousands over the last decade. Compounding the resentment,\u00a0Trump rattled Iraq with repeated assertions that the United States should have \u201ctaken the oil\u201d when it toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Experts said any move to seize oil reserves as spoils of war would have been in violation of international law, but Trump \u2014\u00a0who had floated the idea during his campaign \u2014\u00a0brought it up again\u00a0after taking office. \u00a0\u201cWe should have kept the oil, but OK, maybe we\u2019ll have another chance,\u201d the president said on a visit to CIA headquarters a day after being sworn in. In the Arab world, those comments helped fuel a belief in some quarters that U.S. Mideast policy is largely predicated on a wish to plunder the region\u2019s energy resources. In Washington, the travel ban left Trump\u2019s most senior Cabinet members struggling to contain the fallout even as they settled into new jobs. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, who began work the day the order came down, was reportedly not consulted in advance about the directive. The Pentagon, which has 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, was seeking to shield Iraqi citizens who have worked with the U.S. military from the travel ban, compiling a list of Iraqis to recommend be exempted.\u00a0 At the State Department, where regional experts were also reportedly excluded from the drafting process, Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson is not yet in his post. Diplomats, including many with Mideast expertise, were already circulating a memo for the department\u2019s official internal \u201cdissent channel\u201d to express opposition to the directive. The U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Douglas A. Silliman, was left scrambling to deal with the travel ban\u2019s fallout. Silliman, who took up his post less than five months ago, was meeting with lawmakers to try to stave off a vote for Iraq to respond in kind to the U.S. restrictions, among other urgent consultations. To many inside and outside\u00a0Iraq, the travel ban posed the potential to undercut the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, and at the very least provided a propaganda gift to jihadist supporters. Backers of Islamic State were cheering from the social-media sidelines, citing Trump\u2019s move as proof that Muslims would never be accepted by the West. Two powerful Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Sunday that the presidential directive could \u201cdo more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security\u201d by inflaming resentments against the U.S. \u201cWe fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\u201d the two said in a joint statement. Separately from the consternation in Baghdad, officials in the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan were worried as well. As Iraqi passport holders, its people fall under provisions of the travel ban. That leaves many Iraqi Kurds with U.S. ties in limbo, including students, aid workers and businesspeople. The Kurdistan regional government, which has a separate diplomatic mission in Washington, said in a statement that it was trying to get more information from the Trump administration about the order\u2019s scope and effects. \u00a0 In Lebanon, which has been a prime refuge for Iraqis hoping to travel onward to the United States or other destinations, the directive left many despondent, said Suheil Anton, a former oil engineer who has become an unofficial spokesman for displaced Iraqi families. \u00a0\u201cWe thought that things would open up for Iraqis this year, since they would barely let anyone in last year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a betrayal of Iraqis now.\u201d Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Trump\u2019s order to block travelers \u00a0from Muslim-majority nations is met with protests worldwide.

By Ed O'Keefe , Sean Sullivan and Kelsey Snell By Ed O'Keefe , Sean Sullivan and Kelsey Snell January 30 at 6:22 PM Follow @edatpost Follow @WaPoSean Follow @kelsey_snell Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) pushes for an overturn of President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country at a news conference. (Bryan R. Smith/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Democrats on Monday all but abandoned their pledge to find common ground with President Trump after he banned some foreign nationals from entering the United States, while Republicans angrily accused him of not telling them ahead of time about the controversial order. Seizing on growing public outcry over Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from across the globe, Democrats on Capitol Hill launched what they said would be a protracted fight on several fronts. It will include public protests against the ban, delaying Cabinet confirmations and an attempt to reject Trump\u2019s pick to serve on the Supreme Court, an announcement expected Tuesday. The plans represent a sharp pivot in Democratic strategy after weeks of vowing to work with Trump and Republicans in areas of agreement \u2014 and to allow noncontroversial nominees to be quickly confirmed. But \u201cthen Trump shredded the Constitution,\u201d said one senior aide familiar with ongoing strategy talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWe should be using our time on the floor to talk about the dangerous consequences to U.S. national security by this executive order. We shouldn\u2019t be rushing through any confirmation votes this week,\u201d said Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.). \u201cWe can take a pause in confirmation votes to try to get this executive order right. You know this is going to get Americans killed if we don\u2019t take our time to understand what this order is and what its consequences are,\u201d he added. Trump\u2019s ban also significantly deepened fissures in his already fragile relationship with congressional Republicans, with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill angrily complaining Monday that they were not consulted before the order was issued. At least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump\u2019s order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban does not amount to a \u201creligious test.\u201d And a steady stream of Republican lawmakers released carefully tailored statements expressing concerns about the order. But others spoke out more forcefully. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Monday that he was not briefed before the order was signed. \u201cI know that they said they talked with some staffers on the Hill \u2014 not in our office,\u201d Corker said. The disarray over Trump\u2019s fulfillment of a core campaign promise underscored the increasingly strained relationship between the new White House and the Republican congressional majority. It comes after a rocky first week and a half punctuated by confusion over health-care and tax changes, as well as frustration with the president obsessing over crowd size and his loss of the popular vote in November. Asked whether he was consulted in the drafting of the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate said simply: \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Pressed on when he first learned about the order, Corker answered that it was Friday, after it was signed. \u201cI guess one of you guys probably told me about it \u2014 thank you for that,\u201d he told reporters. On Monday evening, Senate Democrats sought to quickly pass legislation that would rescind Trump\u2019s ban, but there was insufficient GOP support. Confirmation delays began, as well, when Democrats blocked a committee from meeting to approve Trump\u2019s nominee for treasury secretary, Steve. Mnuchin, to the full Senate. The Senate Finance Committee is expected to consider the former Goldman Sachs banker on Tuesday, at the same time it will vote to approve the nomination of Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Amid the Democratic outcry, Trump and his aides strongly defended the ban and faulted Democrats for trying to \u201cobstruct\u201d his Cabinet nominees. \u201cWe actually had a very good day yesterday in terms of homeland security,\u201d Trump said at a White House event. During a meeting with small-business leaders, he blasted Democrats for delaying the confirmation of his nominees \u201cfor political reasons. Just politics.\u201d But it remained unclear just how united Democrats would remain. On Monday, the Senate voted on a key procedural step toward the nomination of former ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, with four members of the Democratic caucus supporting him \u2014 Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Angus King (I-Maine), Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she did not think there would be further delays of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general; and it was unclear whether Democrats would succeed in delaying a hearing Tuesday for Price. Committees are also scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve former Texas governor Rick Perry to lead the Energy Department; Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to serve as interior secretary; and GOP powerbroker Betsy DeVos to serve as education secretary. How far Democrats go will be closely watched by the liberal activists who joined them to protest Trump\u2019s ban Monday night on the steps of the Supreme Court. After the sun set and Democrats made their way from the Capitol, chants of \u201chands too small, can\u2019t build a wall\u201d and \u201cbuild a fence around Mike Pence\u201d alternated with \u201cwalk the walk!\u201d \u2014 a command to the Democrats themselves. And when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told the crowd, \u201cWhat the president did is not constitutional,\u201d one protester retorted: \u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything if you don\u2019t stop Sessions!\u201d Meanwhile, statements from top-ranking Republicans in the House and Senate were at odds with comments earlier in the day from White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \u201cThere were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved,\u201d Spicer told reporters at a briefing. He refused to specify which if any committees were involved in the decision-making. Senior House leaders, including Ryan, did not see the text of the order until after it was signed Friday, according to a GOP aide. Antonia Ferrier, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said \u201cit was public\u201d that executive orders \u201cwere coming,\u201d but declined to offer further clarity on the level of interaction with the White House. Spokesmen for Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said the senators were not consulted about the order. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he could not confirm whether his staff was consulted \u2014 but he personally did not weigh in on the executive order as it was being drafted. Grassley\u2019s committee is responsible for overseeing the majority of immigration-related legislation in the Senate. \u201cI\u2019m sure if they said they consulted us, they did,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cBut not me personally.\u201d A member of Grassley\u2019s committee staff worked alongside other congressional staff to assist the Trump transition team on legislative issues, including early drafting of the executive order, said one Senate GOP aide. However, that staff member did not participate in writing the final order. The White House did not share details of the order with the committee before its release Friday, the aide said. Several GOP aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about the sensitive discussions said they were frustrated and surprised by the order and were forced to scramble to respond as chaos spread at airports across the country. Many said they felt the administration was moving too swiftly and without respect for critical protocol for vetting executive actions that have been in place for decades. \u201cThis is emblematic of a new, power-hungry White House staff flexing its muscles without consulting the public servants responsible for implementing their fiats. If this type of behavior continues, then this administration is going to lose all of its friends very quickly,\u201d one Senate GOP aide said. [ Trump defends executive order, says it\u2019s not \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 ] (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The freshly combative mood of Democrats has also begun to shape the debate over previously uncontroversial nominees. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who faces a 2018 reelection bid in a swing state, sent a letter to transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao on Monday with seven questions about enforcement of the ban. Failure to answer those questions overnight might be more reason to try delaying her final confirmation vote, aides said. In the end, Democrats are unlikely to derail the confirmation of any Trump nominees. While they can use procedural tactics to lengthen the time it takes to confirm a pick, just 51\u00a0senators are needed to confirm a nominee. Republicans enjoy a 52-seat majority in the Senate. That is not likely to ease the pressure from the left. On Sunday night, more than a thousand protesters in Rhode Island, organized by the progressive Working Families Party, marched to an event held by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). At a rally outside the event, speaker after speaker denounced Whitehouse\u2019s vote last week to confirm CIA Director Mike Pompeo and demanded that he reject the rest of Trump\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cDemocrats alone can\u2019t block these appointments, but they can make sure they don\u2019t bear our stamp of approval,\u201d said David Segal, the executive director of the progressive transparency group, into a bull horn. \u201cThey must vote as any one of us would vote \u2014 against surveillance, against authoritarianism and against Trump.\u201d Karoun Demirjian and David Weigel contributed to this report.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Virginia, wants a\u00a0ruling blocking enforcement of\u00a0Trump\u2019s executive order signed Friday, saying it discriminates against Muslims and violates protections for the free exercise of faith and prohibitions on governmental establishment of religion. It also says people affected by the order are being denied due process of law. Referring to the order as a \"Muslim Exclusion Order,\" the complaint \u2014\u00a0which includes 27 plaintiffs from across the U.S. \u2014\u00a0says it \u201cimplements an impermissible religious gerrymander that divides foreign nationals, even those lawfully present inside the United States, into favored and disfavored groups based on their faith.\u201d Advocacy groups leverage anger to target Trump \u201cMake no mistake, the First Amendment of our Constitution was attacked last week,\u201d said Shereef Akeel, a Troy civil rights lawyer who is one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which comes as other lawsuits have been filed across the country seeking to block the order.

The idea for Pac-Man\u2019s design came from the image of a pizza with a slice carved out. Nakamura reportedly chose the word \u201cPac,\u201d or \u201cpakku\u201d in Japanese, to represent the sound of the Pac-Man munching its prey. \u201cPac-Man is a gamer friendly game with tons of cute characters and that\u2019s why it was loved for such a long time,\u201d Iwatani said in 2015 at a New York red carpet premiere of \u201cPixels,\u201d that featured Pac-Man creatures and featured him in a cameo role. The game started out as an arcade item and then was at first played on the Nintendo Family Computer home console. It since has been adapted for cellphones, PlayStation and Xbox formats. Other hits from Namco include driving simulation games like \u201cRidge Racer\u201d and a drumming game. Nakamura was a key player in Bandai Namco\u2019s global growth. His pet saying was that his company delivered varied and total entertainment. He took pride in having fun and games for his job. The company reported Nakamura\u2019s death but would not comment on its cause or other personal details, citing his family\u2019s wishes. A private wake and funeral were held for the family, but a separate memorial is being planned, Bandai-Namco said. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Bobcat on the loose Email WASHINGTON (WUSA9) - Officials are searching for a female bobcat they said has escaped from the National Zoo, reports CBS affiliate WUSA . Ollie, a 25-pound female bobcat, was last seen in her enclosure around 7:30 a.m. Monday. Around 10:40 a.m., zoo keepers called the bobcats for their morning feeding and Ollie did not respond. Animal Care staff searched and have not found Ollie. Officials believe that she may return to her familiar grounds for food and shelter. Zoo staff are keeping the area around the bobcat exhibit closed because the bobcat will likely stay hidden from humans. Ollie is wild born and estimated to be almost seven years old. According to the zoo, bobcats are not known to be aggressive to humans. No one should approach the bobcat if she is spotted. If spotted, call 202-633-7362. There is no imminent danger to Zoo guests or general public. Bobcats are not known to be aggressive to humans.

According to a Pentagon statement, Owens, 36, of Peoria, Illinois, died \"of wounds sustained in a raid against al-Qaeda.\" \"I extend my condolences to the family and shipmates of Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens,\" said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in a statement. \"Ryan gave his full measure for our nation, and in performing his duty, he upheld the noblest standard of military service,\" said Mattis. \"The United States would not long exist were it not for the selfless commitment of such warriors,\" he added. \"I thank our gallant troops and their families for their dedication to protecting this nation, and I pass our respects to Ryan's family in this most difficult time.\" The Pentagon statement did not specify what unit Owens served with other than saying he was \"assigned to an East Coast-based Special Warfare unit.\" His Navy records indicated that he joined the Navy in 1998 and had been serving with the Navy Special Warfare units since 2002. Officials have told ABC News that the raid on the al-Qaeda compound in southern Yemen was carried out by SEAL Team Six, the elite Naval special operations unit involved in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden . Six other U.S. servicemembers were injured in the raid. Three of them were injured in the firefight with the AQAP fighters, while three others were injured when the Marine MV-22 Osprey aircraft they were aboard was damaged in a \"hard landing.\" The raid targeting three senior leaders with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was intended to gather intelligence on the terror group that could be used to prevent future terror plots. Fourteen al-Qaida fighters were killed in the raid on the compound, including some women who had fired at the American forces. \u201cWe saw that female fighters ran to pre-established positions, as though they had trained to be ready, and trained to be combatants and engaged with us,\" said Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. Davis characterized the female fighters as legitimate combatants. The Pentagon is still assessing reports that children may have been killed in the raid, but a U.S. official said there were no internal indications that was the case. Authorized by President Donald Trump , Davis said the raid had been planned for months and that former President Barack Obama had been aware of the planning. \u201cThere were operational reasons why it happened when it did and not two weeks ago,\u201d Davis emphasized. 0 Shares ",

Buzz60 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates (Photo: Pete Marovich, Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who has been directing the Justice Department during the transition to President Trump\u2019s administration, said Monday that she will not defend in court the president\u2019s executive order that suspends immigration from seven majority-Muslim\u00a0countries. \u201cI am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,\u201d said Yates in a letter to Justice Department attorneys. \u201cAt present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful. \u201cConsequently, for as long as I am the acting attorney general, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,\" wrote Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration. Yates is serving as acting attorney general as Trump's nominee for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, awaits a Senate vote on confirmation. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a Tuesday vote on the nomination of Sessions, who has closely advised Trump on immigration matters. Senate Democrats have objected to Sessions\u2019 nomination, and Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday on CNN\u00a0that Sessions should have to disclose his opinion of Trump\u2019s immigration order before the Senate votes on his nomination. Trump responded to Yates via Twitter, characterizing the action as a \"political\" move to block his agenda. \"Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons,'' Trump tweeted. \"They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.\" Trump advisor Stephen Miller said on MSNBC Monday, \u201cI think that\u2019s a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become,\u201d so much so that \u201cyou have people refusing to enforce our laws.\u201d Miller said the president clearly has the legal authority to bar people from entry into the country for national security reasons. Trump's executive order had been reviewed by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel before it was issued Friday. The OLC, whose authority narrowly addresses the form and whether the order is properly drafted, approved the order. But the OLC \u201cdid not address whether any policy choice embodied in an executive order is wise or just,\u201d Yates wrote. \u201cMy responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts.\u201d Yates\u2019 extraordinary action comes as national law enforcement leaders are calling on the Trump administration for further guidance on his immigration-related orders, including the president\u2019s call for police to increasingly assist federal agents in enforcing immigration laws. Late Monday, the nation\u2019s largest group of police chiefs, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said it would oppose any order that forces the cooperation of local police on immigration matters. \u201cThe IACP has, and will continue to strongly oppose any initiative that would mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies play a role in the enforcement of federal immigration law,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe IACP believes that the issue of state, tribal, or local law enforcement\u2019s participation in immigration enforcement is an inherently local decision that must be made by law enforcement executives, working with their elected officials, community leaders, and citizens.\u201d Read more: ",

    "text": "President Trump Orders New Limits on Regulations By Jordyn Phelps Jan 30, 2017, 1:48 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump Signs Order to Cut Business Regulations 0 Shares Email President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday morning that he said will \u201cdramatically reduce federal regulations\u201d on businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be reducing [regulations] big league and their damaging effects on our small businesses, our economy and our entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Trump said during a meeting with small business leaders. \u201cThe American dream is back, and we\u2019re going to create an environment for small business like we haven\u2019t had in many, many decades.\u201d Trump said the order mandates that for every new regulation implemented by federal agencies, two existing regulations must be cut. He called it the \u201clargest ever cut, by far, in terms of regulations.\u201d He was flanked by small business leaders as he signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday. The president explained that two regulations would have to be cut for every new one implemented. \"If there's a new regulation, they have to knock out two but it goes far beyond that. We're cutting regulations massively for small business and for large business but hey're different. But for small business, this is what this is about today. This will be the biggest such act that our country has ever seen,\" Trump said. \"There will be regulation, there will be control, but it will be a normalized control where you can open your business and expand your business very easily and that's what our country has been all about.\" A senior administration official briefed on the order said federal agencies that want to enact a new regulation will have to identify two to cut based on their own estimate of the cost of those regulations to the economy and the private sector. Agencies will identify possible regulations to eliminate but the White House will ultimately decide which to cut. The order mandates that for every new regulation implemented by federal agencies, two existing regulations must be cut to counterbalance the cost. \u201cAny new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations,\u201d the order states. \u201cTotal incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero\u201d ",

ALICE CHICHE/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption ALICE CHICHE/AFP/Getty Images Police officers respond to a shooting in a mosque at the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre in Quebec City on Sunday. ALICE CHICHE/AFP/Getty Images Police in Quebec City have arrested two suspects following a shooting at a mosque there, which killed six and wounded eight. According to police, two gunmen opened fire in Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre around 8 p.m., where about 40 people were gathered for evening prayers. In an early-morning press conference a Quebec City police spokeswoman gave no further details about the suspects, saying the investigation had just begun. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Province premier Philippe Couillard both described the attack as an act of terrorism. The Associated Press reported Trudeau's remarks: \"We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge,\" Trudeau said in a statement. \"It is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. \"Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country,\" he added. \"Canadian law enforcement agencies will protect the rights of all Canadians, and will make every effort to apprehend the perpetrators of this act and all acts of intolerance.\" Article continues after sponsorship \"Why is this happening here? This is barbaric,\" the mosque's president, Mohamed Yangui said to reporters, according to the AP. Yangui was not inside the mosque when the shooting occurred but said he received frantic calls from many who were inside at the time of the gunfire. Says Reuters: Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. The face-covering, or niqab, became a big issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the vast majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies. In 2013, police investigated after a mosque in the Saguenay region of the province was splattered with what was believed to be pig blood. In the neighboring province of Ontario, a mosque was set on fire in 2015, a day after an attack by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris. Tonight, Canadians grieve for those killed in a cowardly attack on a mosque in Quebec City. My thoughts are with victims & their families. \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 30, 2017 Last June, during the holy month of Ramadan, as the CBC reported , someone also left a pig's head at Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre, where Sunday night's attack took place. \"Tonight, Canadians grieve for those killed in a cowardly attack on a mosque in Quebec City,\" Trudeau said. \"My thoughts are with victims & their families.\" ",

    "text": "Boy Scouts Will Allow Transgender Children Into Programs By claudia lauer, associated press DALLAS \u0097 Jan 30, 2017, 7:43 PM ET 0 Shares Email The Boy Scouts of America announced Monday that it will allow transgender children who identify as boys to enroll in its boys only programs. The organization announced it had made the decision to begin basing enrollment in its boys-only programs on the gender a child or parent lists on the application to become a scout. The organization had previously held a policy that relied on the gender listed on a child's birth certificate for those programs. Rebecca Rausch, a spokeswoman for the organization, emailed a statement Monday. She said the organization's leadership had considered a recent case in Secaucus, New Jersey , where an 8-year-old transgender child had been asked to leave his Scout troop after parents and leaders found out he is transgender, but the change was made because of the larger conversation about gender identity going on around the country. \"For more than 100 years, the Boy Scouts of America, along with schools, youth sports and other youth organizations, have ultimately deferred to the information on an individual's birth certificate to determine eligibility for our single-gender programs,\" the statement said. \"However, that approach is no longer sufficient as communities and state laws are interpreting gender identity differently, and these laws vary widely from state to state.\" Rausch said the enrollment decision goes into effect immediately. \"Our organization's local councils will help find units that can provide for the best interest of the child,\" the statement said. Boy Scouts of America leaders lifted a blanket ban on gay troop leaders and employees in July 2015. 0 Shares ",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House surrounded by small business leaders Monday. (Photo: Pool, Getty Images) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 President Trump has begun his presidency with an unprecedented blizzard of executive action, signing more presidential directives than any president in modern history. As a candidate, Trump criticized  President Obama's \"illegal and overreaching\u00a0executive orders.\" Now, he's using those same orders in ways previous presidents have not. He has\u00a0used them to order the approval of permits to specific private companies (the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines). He has not only reinstated Reagan-era policies\u00a0but expanded them \u2014 as with the ban on federal funding to global health groups that promote abortion. On Monday, he tightened the White House's grip on the regulatory process, insisting that agencies stick to a quota of regulations approved by the president as part of the annual budgeting process. And he has\u00a0even created a new form of executive order called a National Security Presidential Memorandum\u00a0and used it\u00a0to give orders to the Pentagon and give his political strategist a seat at the table in National Security Council meetings. While Trump has signed fewer executive orders than Obama at this point in his presidency, he has\u00a0signed more presidential memoranda \u2014 a kind of first cousin to executive orders that became Obama's tool of choice as he tried to get around a Republican Congress. Trump's party has control of Congress. He's just impatient. Trump appears to be trying to make good on every campaign promise at once, which in itself was one of his campaign promises. In speeches last fall, he promised to \"cancel every\u00a0unconstitutional\u00a0executive action,\u00a0memorandum\u00a0and order issued by President Obama\" on his very first day in office. (He didn't.) \"It\u2019s not unusual for a president to hit\u00a0the ground running and issue a lot of unilateral directives early in his term,\" says William Howell, a political science professor at the University of Chicago.\u00a0\"But to see him swinging for the fences \u2014 he's just letting it rip on all manner of policy issues \u2014 is striking.\" Escalating pattern Presidential scholars say Trump's executive orders have followed an escalating pattern after a change of party: Republican presidents rescind Democratic policies and reinstate those of the last Republican president. Democratic presidents do the same with Republican policies. The Day One executive order on the Affordable Care Act, for example, was a one-page directive telling federal agencies to allow more flexibility in enforcing the provisions of Obamacare until Congress can repeal it. But the order contained the phrase \"to the maximum extent permitted by law,\" three times, suggesting that its effects are yet to be determined. One of the most noticeable differences is in style: While Obama signed most of his executive orders in private, Trump has signed all of his in public, with a headline-generating photo opportunities intended to convey constant presidential action. \"Executive orders are generally used to enact public policies, but some of Trump\u2019s orders seem to have been for more symbolic or rhetorical purposes,\" says Graham Dodds, a political scientist at Concordia University in Montreal. And that seems to be part of the strategy.\u00a0\"We've hit the ground running at a record pace,\" he boasted in his weekly radio address Saturday . Read more: Trump adopts Nixon security model, except worse: Column The White House is scheduling executive order signing ceremonies even before it knows\u00a0 which order Trump is going to sign \u2014 or whether he'll sign them at all. Aboard Air Force One last Thursday, press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump would order an investigation into his spurious claims of widespread voter fraud. That order never came. Executive orders are also a way to keep control of the narrative. \"Bill Clinton did something similar during his impeachment where he issued a bunch of executive orders to do things Congress likely would have done anyway,\" says Chad Murphy, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. \"But he wanted to show he was busy doing the people's work while Congress was wasting four\u00a0years and $40 million investigating his sex life.\" The pace of action has prompted questions about how much agency lawyers have been involved in the drafting of executive orders, which has been standard practice under previous presidents. The order on refugee admissions, for example, appeared to include permanent legal residents \u2014  \"green card\" holders \u2014 despite later clarifications from the White House that it wasn't the president's intent. Trump's orders also show that presidential directives have become political weapons as much as they are policy and management tools, with partisan outrage depending on which president was wielding the pen. During Obama's presidency, Trump often criticized what he called \"overreaching\" executive orders. \"Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing\u00a0executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?\" he tweeted as early as 2012. \"The conservatives who criticized Bill Clinton's orders were largely silent for George W. Bush's orders, then loudly complained\u00a0about Barack Obama's orders, and now are mostly silent about Donald Trump's orders,\" Dodds says. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    "text": "Most Religious Groups Come Out Against Trump Refugee Order By rachel zoll, ap religion writer Jan 30, 2017, 6:37 AM ET 0 Shares WATCH President Trump to Announce Supreme Court Nominee 0 Shares Email Rabbi Joel Mosbacher had just finished the morning's Shabbat service when he got an urgent message: Rabbis were needed at New York's Kennedy Airport. People were being detained under President Donald Trump's sharp travel restrictions on refugees. Would he come pray? By sundown, Mosbacher was part a group of rabbis at the airport, playing guitar and conducting a Havdalah service marking the end of the Sabbath. About 2,000 people gathered to rally against the new policy. \"We know what it's like to be the stranger,\" said Mosbacher, a Reform rabbi at Temple Shaaray Tefila, noting that Jewish refugees were at times turned away from the U.S. \"As a person of faith, it was so important to be there.\" From pulpits to sidewalk vigils, clergy have been part of a religious outpouring against Trump's plan to suspend refugee entry from seven majority Muslim countries. Faith leaders who support the president's executive order as a way to fight terrorism have been far less vocal, ceding the religious discussion to those overwhelmingly opposed to the president's sweeping immigration order, which suspends refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely bars refugees from Syria. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which runs the largest refugee resettlement network in the country, said it \"strongly disagreed\" with the prohibitions and pledged to work \"vigorously to ensure refugees are humanely welcomed.\" The Orthodox Union, the largest association for American Orthodox synagogues, acknowledged the complexities of fighting terror, but said \"discrimination against any group based solely upon religion is wrong and anathema to the great traditions of religious and personal freedoms upon which this country was founded.\" Trump's executive order gives preference to refugees fleeing their countries over religious persecution. The president told the Christian Broadcasting Network he aims to prioritize Christian refugees. Still, relatively few evangelicals have voiced support for the idea. Among those who did offer support was the Rev. Franklin Graham, whose aid agency, Samaritan's Purse, works with refugees in Iraq, Greece and other nations. Graham said in a statement that he backed a closer examination of refugees' views on \"freedom and liberty\" and that Islamic law was incompatible with the Constitution. The Rev. Robert Jeffress, the leader of First Baptist Dallas and a vocal supporter of Trump, told \"Fox & Friends\" television show that Trump was \"fulfilling his God-given responsibility to protect this country.\" A few protesters gathered outside his church during services, with one carrying a sign that read, \"Love Thy Neighbor.\" \"We believe in security. We believe in careful vetting. We just don't think a full shutdown is the right reaction,\" said Scott Arbeiter, head of World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, which resettles large numbers of refugees. \"These are people who are running from the very terror as a nation we're trying to stop.\" Beth Hood, who attended Mass at St. Camillus Church in Silver Springs, Maryland, said her priest did not directly discuss the refugee restrictions, \"but the whole tenor of the Mass was somber\" and the reason why was obvious. The Roman Catholic parish serves a large immigrant population from El Salvador , Guatemala, West Africa and Bangladesh. The Scripture reading for the day was from the Beatitudes, the blessings from the Sermon on the Mount, including blessings for peacemakers. \"There was just a real synchronicity between what we were feeling and readings for the day and again the somber tone of the homily,\" said Hood, a social worker who works with Central American immigrants. She called Trump's action \"mean-spirited, abrupt and callous.\" A Mass near the White House organized in protest of Trump's policy drew hundreds of participants, who knelt as they received Holy Communion on Sunday evening. Many clergy had to take special care with how they addressed the issue during Sunday services, given a mix of political views in their congregations. At Johnson Ferry Baptist Church, a Marietta, Georgia, evangelical church that resettles refugees, a pastor at an early morning service prayed that the congregation would \"lift up the Syrian refugee families that we are sponsoring,\" noting they may never see some members of their family again. The pastor also asked God to grant \"wisdom\" to Trump so he would make appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court \"that can protect the right to life, protect the unborn.\" The Rev. Gary Manning, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church, in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, said he started revising his sermon at 2:45 a.m. Sunday, anxious to strike the right tone for his politically mixed suburban Milwaukee parish. Worried his preaching would be \"not fiery enough for some and not practical enough for others,\" he ended up speaking about mercy and reflecting on what can be done to help others. \"One of my Trump supporters walked by and said, 'Thank you for keeping it subtle. I don't think I could have handled being screamed at today,'\" Manning said. \"It's incumbent upon me to remember that the people in my congregation are doing their best to live out their Christian values.\" Episcopal Bishop Sean Rowe, who leads the Dioceses of Bethlehem and Northwestern Pennsylvania, said he has never seen such a strong, across-the-spectrum religious response to a social issue. His dioceses include programs to settle refugees, including a Syrian family that had been expecting a relative to come soon \u2014 a plan now on hold indefinitely. Rowe said he planned meetings this week with his own clergy and leaders of other faiths on what they should do next to oppose Trump's policy. \"I find it outrageous at every level,\" Rowe said. \"There's a real sense that the church cannot be silent about this.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Associated Press Writer David Warren in Dallas contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",

Gen. Sally Yates. (J. David Ake / Associated Press) The Justice Department will not defend President Trump's controversial immigration executive order in court, the department's acting chief announced Monday, an extraordinary move reflecting the deep divisions the order has caused within the government. \"My responsibility is to ensure that the position\u00a0of the\u00a0Department\u00a0of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after\u00a0consideration of all the facts,\" acting Atty. Gen. Sally Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers . \"At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,\" she wrote. \"Consequently, for as long as I am the acting attorney general, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\" Yates, the deputy attorney general, is a holdover from the Obama administration. President Trump could fire her. But because his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has not been confirmed and no other senior Justice Department officials have been appointed, doing so would cause significant problems within the department. Among other issues, Yates is the only person in the department currently authorized to sign warrants for wiretapping in foreign espionage cases involving the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

The order sparked protests at airports as well as legal action. A federal judge stayed part of the order regarding deportations. Yates, who was nominated by former President Obama and confirmed in May 2015, wrote that the \"order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions.\" She also wrote that the Office of Legal Counsel's review of the order \"does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just.\" \"My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts,\" she wrote. \"In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.\" This is a developing story.

    "text": "Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department WATCH DNA Evidence May Solve 40-Year-Old Murder Mystery 0 Shares Email Forty-one years after the brutal murder of Karen Klaas, a mother of two and ex-wife of Righteous Brothers' singer Bill Medley, authorities in California announced today that they've identified her alleged killer. Klaas, 32, had returned home from dropping her son off at school Jan. 30, 1976, when she was attacked at her Hermosa Beach home. Police said she was found by friends, who went to her house after she failed to meet them for coffee. Klaas has been sexually assaulted, strangled and left unconscious. She was hospitalized in a coma but died five days later on Feb. 4, 1976. During a news conference today, authorities with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department identified her alleged killer as Kenneth Eugene Troyer. They said Troyer was 29 at the time of crime . Earl Leaf/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Bill Medley of the band \"The Righteous Brothers\" attends an event with his wife Karen Klaas in 1969 in Los Angeles. Police said that in 2016, they were able to link Troyer to biological evidence found at the crime scene using \"familial DNA.\" With familial searching, a crime scene DNA profile is run through a state data bank to see if links can be found to similar profiles belonging to a relative. \"Familial DNA search is the only reason Troyer was identified in this horrific crime,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said today. Familial DNA search is legal in 10 states but the method is controversial. Civil liberties supporters have argued that the tactic has led to false leads and an invasion of privacy. \u201cFamily members of the potential suspect are now subject to questioning that certainly is not fair,\u201d Robin Sax, a criminal law expert, told ABC News. DA Urges NY State to Authorize Familial DNA Testing After NYC Jogger Murder Goes Unsolved In January 1982, Troyer was serving a prison sentence for burglary in San Luis Obispo, according to a police news release, when he escaped. \"While on the run, he was identified as a suspect in other robberies, assaults and rapes in Orange County,\" a police news release said. A task force was formed to find him, and he was fatally shot in March 1982 by police as they sought to arrest him. Because DNA collection of what McDonnell called \"qualifying criminal offenders\" was not allowed at the time, Troyer's DNA was not present in a state database run by the Department of Justice . Police said that in 1999, a DNA profile from the biological evidence was obtained due to technology advances. In 2011, a familial search was conducted but no match was found. Five years later, in 2016, another familial search was requested and a match was located. \u201cIt took a long time for this type of technology and science to catch up with the sample that had been collected a long time ago,\u201d Elissa Mayo, a DNA specialist with the Department of Justice, said at today\u2019s news conference. Authorities said today that in March 2011, a \"first-degree relative\" was the source of the confirming sample that led investigators to Troyer. That relative, whom they described as a \"close male relative,\" had committed a crime that resulted in the collection of DNA evidence. Authorities would not reveal the relative's name. After the relative's sample was evaluated and uploaded into a state database, investigators found a link to the DNA profile from the crime scene. Investigators described the link between the relative and Troyer as \"a father, son, immediate relative\" connection. Police were able to obtain a sample from Troyer from the Orange County coroner's office and make a match. They said investigators also found that a relative of Troyer's lived close to the Klaas home and that a man fitting his description had been reported by witnesses at the time of the crime. Medley, who was present at the news conference today with Klaas' two sons, thanked authorities for their hard work. \"It's been a long road. ... I speak for the family and all of us, it's just nice to close the book on this,\" he said. \"DNA, what a wonderful thing!\" 0 Shares ",

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images At the State Department, employees are expressing concern via an official dissent channel about the Trump administration's temporary visa and refugee ban. Win McNamee/Getty Images At the State Department, there is an easy \u2014 and usually private \u2014 way for employees to register their concerns about U.S. policy. It's called the \"Dissent Channel.\" And today, an unusually large number of foreign service officers are using it. A dissent cable says Donald Trump's temporary visa and refugee ban \"runs counter to American values\" and could be \"counterproductive.\" Trump's Immigration Freeze Omits Those Linked To Deadly Attacks In U.S. The White House claims it consulted for \"many weeks\" with the State Department before issuing its executive order on Friday, temporarily banning visas for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the U.S. refugee resettlement program. State Department officials who were involved in the refugee program deny this. One retired ambassador, Laura Kennedy, says the executive order did not read as if it had been reviewed by State Department lawyers or by consular or refugee officials. \"It is just, as the dissent message makes clear, inconsistent with values, with security aims of the administration, with process, with any number of things,\" Kennedy says. The Dissent Channel was set up in the Vietnam War era as a way for foreign service officers and civil servants to raise concerns with upper management about the direction of U.S. foreign policy, without the fear of retribution. The cables are sent to the State Department's policy planning director, who distributes them to the secretary of state and other top officials, who must respond within 30 to 60 days. There are typically about four or five each year. \"Freedom from reprisal for Dissent Channel users is strictly enforced,\" according to the State Department. Article continues after sponsorship During her 40-year State Department career, Kennedy never signed a dissent cable herself. She remembers one time in the 1990s when more than a dozen diplomats raised concerns about U.S. policy in the Balkans. Last year, about 50 foreign service officers criticized the Obama administration for failing to do enough to protect civilians in Syria. But this executive order, titled \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,\" is generating much more attention. Career Diplomats Leave State Department As Trump Presidency Begins \"I know that many serving officers were horrified by this message,\" Kennedy says, referring to the order. The draft dissent cable \u2013 which has been published by the Lawfare blog \u2014 points out that the overwhelming majority of attacks on U.S. soil are committed by native-born or naturalized U.S. citizens, individuals who have been living in the U.S for decades or since birth. And it points out that terrorist attacks carried out by foreign nationals entering the U.S. on visas have come from countries that are not included in the ban, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer was dismissive of the dissent cable. \"I think they should get with the program or they can go,\" he said. All this comes at a time when the Trump administration has cleared out top management positions at the State Department without naming anyone new to replace them. Rex Tillerson, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, is still awaiting confirmation. ",

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., to protest his nomination as U.S. attorney general. (Photo: NAACP) 32 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE NAACP president and CEO Cornell Williams Brooks and 10 other activists were arrested Monday after staging a repeat sit-in outside of the Mobile, Ala., office of U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Republican who is President Trump's pick for attorney general. Brooks and five other NAACP officials were in Mobile to appear in court on misdemeanor criminal trespass charges for a Jan. 3\u00a0sit-in outside of Sessions' office, during which they demanded that Sessions remove himself from the confirmation process. The civil rights organization opposes the conservative Republican for his opposition to the Voting Rights Act and for other stances that the NAACP believes work\u00a0against its human rights mission. But upon arrival to court, the judge dismissed the case, NAACP spokesman Quincy Bates said. According to Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, the charges were dropped on Sunday. After learning on Monday of the development, Brooks and other NAACP leaders spread the word that they would stage another sit-in outside of Sessions' office. About one hour in, Mobile police arrested Brooks and 10 others, packed the NAACP officials and local protesters into a police van and took them to the police station for booking, Bates said. Sessions' Mobile office was closed Monday, Isgur Flores said. At about 4:30 p.m. ET, the group had just been booked and was being taken to the Mobile city jail, police department spokeswoman Charlette Solis said. Isgur Flores responded via e-mail, saying, \"We look forward to Senator Sessions nomination being voted out of committee tomorrow and receiving bipartisan support on the floor later this week.\" In the past, Isgur Flores has\u00a0pointed out that Sessions has endorsements and support from black state officials in Alabama. Sessions has made statements that hint he might rollback advances the Obama administration has made against alleged police misconduct, that he believes the\u00a0Ku Klux Klan\u00a0is \"OK,\" and that he supports broad immigration reform, according to civil rights advocates.

Got it Demonstrators gather at Dulles International Airport on Jan. 29 to protest President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. (Thomas Watkins/AFP/Getty Images) By Michael Laris and Jenna Portnoy By Michael Laris and Jenna Portnoy January 30 at 2:30 PM Follow @mikelaris Follow @jennaportnoy Problems entering the United States eased Monday for some international travelers after a weekend of confusion about a travel ban President Trump imposed, but members of Congress said border protection and administration officials still had not answered critical questions. After Rep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott (D-Va.) made a late-night visit to Dulles International Airport on Sunday \u2014 and was denied an audience with Customs and Border Protection officials \u2014 he received a short written response, his staff said Monday. \u201cThere are no people in CPB custody at Dulles per the executive order,\u201d read an email he received after 11 p.m. Sunday from a congressional affairs official at the agency. The email did not address other specific questions from Scott, including how many people have been detained and whether any detainees have been removed from the airport \u2014 or from the jurisdiction of the federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, which had ruled Saturday on a case stemming from Trump\u2019s order. U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema issued a temporary restraining order Saturday blocking green-card holders arriving at Dulles from being removed from the country. The order also said they any green card holder detained at Dulles should have access to a lawyer. Lawyers complained Sunday that they weren\u2019t being given access to detainees. There also were mixed messages and confusion from the Trump administration about whether the order applied to green-card holders. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) confirmed Monday that permanent legal residents \u2014 green-card holders \u2014 are subject to the executive order. Kaine said he received the clarification during a phone call with officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He planned to go to Dulles International Airport on Monday afternoon. He was also told that, unlike other immigrants, green-card holders are allowed to board planes to the United States. Once they arrive, they will be questioned and can obtain a waiver allowing them to enter the country. Kaine said he doesn\u2019t think the order should apply to these residents. [ \u2018We can\u2019t become a dictatorship\u2019: Protests erupt across the U.S. against Trump refugee ban ] \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re still saying the order applies to them but then there\u2019s a waiver of it, it\u2019s still a little bit odd, so I\u2019m confused about that still, so more work to do,\u201d he said during a tour of a library in downtown Roanoke. He said the same procedure applies to people given special immigrant status, such as translators who worked with the U.S. military. At Dulles on Monday, dozens of demonstrators were back to welcome international visitors, and a contingent of volunteer lawyers was on hand to monitor any problems. Hayley Tamburello said an Iranian citizen whose case she was tracking arrived on a flight from Dubai. He is a permanent legal resident and made it through security in a couple of hours. Other than some missing luggage, things went smoothly, Tamburello said. But she said it was difficult to know whether other travelers were being held up by Customs and Border Protection authorities and whether others were being held elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for them to say they\u2019re not detaining anyone if they\u2019re not physically here,\u201d Tamburello said. Also Monday, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) sent a letter to Elaine Chao, Trump\u2019s nominee for transportation secretary, asking several questions about the order. Chao is scheduled for a confirmation vote Tuesday. Nelson asked Chao whether she agrees with the order and whether she was consulted before it was issued, and, if not, whether the Transportation Department should be consulted on \u201cany further travel restrictions to minimize passenger and industry disruption.\u201d Nelson also asked, given the \u201cgeneral confusion caused by the lack of clear communication from the administration in implementing\u201d the president\u2019s order, whether airports should be reimbursed by the federal government. [ Hundreds of lawyers descend on airports to offer free help after Trump\u2019s executive order ] Nelson said many passengers caught in the \u201clast-minute\u201d travel ban \u201csuffered substantial losses \u2014 including ticket cancellation penalties,\u201d and he asked Chao if DOT should develop policies on such fees for other last-minute government actions to come. Throughout the day Sunday, lawyers sought information about whether green-card holders or other international travelers were being detained at Dulles, but said they received no official information until getting a late-night comment Sunday similar to the one Scott received. Mirriam Seddiq, who has spent days working with other volunteer lawyers at Dulles, said she spoke directly with a customs official at the airport. \u201cI asked him if anyone was being detained. He said, \u2018No, my backroom\u2019s clear. Our work is done here,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she recalled. Seddiq said immigration lawyers and border authorities often have a different understanding of the word \u201cdetain,\u201d making government comments hard to parse. \u201cTheir idea of \u2018detained\u2019 is somebody put in handcuffs\u201d and potentially carted away, she said. \u201cOur idea of \u2018detained\u2019 is somebody who is back there who is being interrogated and who\u2019s not able to come out in a timely fashion.\u201d Seddiq said immigration lawyers are working to figure out whether anyone was transferred from Dulles, and whether travelers were facing difficulties Monday. Lawyers also are trying to document the cases of people barred from flying to the United States and are considering further legal action. local ",

The executive order banning new arrivals and refugees from the Muslim countries had already been challenged in court a number of times, and has sparked widespread protests in major cities. On Saturday, the Justice Department defended the order before a court in Brooklyn . Yates\u2019 decision signifies a major about-face by the department even if it is symbolic.

Trump, it turns out, meant what he said during the campaign. One by one last month, Trump's nominees to lead the Pentagon, the CIA, and the State and Homeland Security Departments sat before senators during their confirmation hearings and took mainstream conservative positions that were at odds with Trump's rhetoric over the last year on Russia, NATO, torture and other issues. How, many observers wondered, would the conventional views of Trump's cabinet be reconciled with the more extreme positions embraced by his key White House advisers, Stephen Bannon and Michael Flynn? The answer, at least in the first week of Trump's presidency, is that the White House will carry the day.

And then it reorganized the National Security Council in a way that awarded a spot on an important committee to a domestic political adviser \u2014 Bannon. All that happened after Trump aides circulated a draft executive order on CIA and military interrogations prepared without consulting Secretary of Defense James Mattis or CIA Director Mike Pompeo, according to officials, both of whom are on record opposing torture. If implemented as written, the memo would potentially open to door to using overseas CIA prisons and brutal interrogation techniques. In the latter case, Mattis and Pompeo won a partial victory. The White House disavowed the leaked document and Trump said he would follow Mattis' advice, for now, against seeking to use torture. But that came after Trump publicly endorsed the effectiveness of torture. How the Trump administration will proceed on interrogation is unclear. The refugee order \u2014 which blocked the State Department from issuing visas for 90 days from residents of seven majority-Muslim countries \u2014 was written under the supervision of White House domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller, who works closely with Bannon, officials told NBC News. Career government officials who might have outlined the implications of such an order did not have a chance to weigh in, said officials at the State, Defense, Homeland Security and Justice Departments.

The order provoked domestic and international outcry, even as the government struggled to come to terms with how to implement it. There was confusion, for example, about whether the order would apply to Green Card holders. Homeland Security Secretary James Kelly issued a statement Sunday saying it would not. Experts from across the national security spectrum denounced it as something that will harm U.S. national security by playing into the hands of Islamic extremists. More than 100 foreign service officers are reported to have signed a \"dissent channel\" memo calling the refugee order un-American. And, after legal challenges, four federal judges around the country issued temporary stays barring the government from deporting refugees subject to the new policy. On the NSC reorganization, the White House made a concession Monday. After criticism over the lack of a permanent role for the CIA director, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House spokesman Sean Spicer said an order on the NSC structure would be amended to make clear that the CIA director is a member of the so-called principals committee. But he defended the installation of Bannon, noting that President Obama's domestic adviser, David Axelrod, used to attend some NSC meetings.

Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, who views that as an unwelcome development. Not everyone agrees that the matter has been decided. Peter Feaver, a professor at Duke University and a former adviser to President George W. Bush, said the lack of consultation about the refugee order may simply reflect a government that isn't fully staffed. It's too soon to tell, he said, where the real power centers of national security lie in the Trump administration. \"The bigger picture is that they are slowly developing an interagency process and they are slowly staffing it up, and they have a separate executive action process than has been on a faster timetable and has outpaced the interagency process,\" Feaver said. \"I would expect, over time, that the interagency process will catch up.\" When that happens, Feaver said, it will be more clear which views will prevail. The next test of how these disagreements will be resolved may come over the issue of sanctions on Russia. Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said last week that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Russia, though she did not specify whether she meant those imposed in connection with election hacking, or with Russia's seizure of Crimea. Mattis, Pompeo and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are on the record as in favor of a tough stance toward Russia. So are GOP leaders in Congress. \"I'm absolutely opposed to lifting sanctions on the Russians,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday, according to the Associated Press. \"If anything, we ought to be looking at increasing them.\" Ken Dilanian ",

    "text": "advertisement If you live in the nation's capital, your next takeout order could be delivered by a small, six-wheeled robot vaguely reminiscent of WALL-E. Part of a pilot food delivery program launched by Starship Technologies and Postmates, the self-driving robots can pick up orders and travel to a customer's house up to two miles away, using cameras and GPS tracking to dodge pedestrians and other obstacles. Customers can follow the bot's journey through an app, or kick back and wait for a text notification that their meal has arrived outside, and then open the door and click a link to unlock the bot to retrieve their food. Related: Life-Saving Drones Promise Revolution in Emergency Care With its robo-deliveries, Starship aims to reduce delivery times and fuel costs. It's just one of a broad array of tools companies are using to speed up service and get customers what they want as quickly as possible. As Starship robots take to the streets: 7-Eleven just completed a one month aerial drone delivery test in Nevada. Amazon Prime Air made its first drone delivery in the U.K. TacoBell last year unveiled the Tacobot \u2014 an artificial intelligence chatbot that integrates with the Slack messaging platform to allow customers to text orders from their desks. Dominos rolled out a \"zero click\" app that automatically orders your favorite hot pie seconds after the app is opened. These time-saving systems, and the race to create even faster ones, are part of an emerging instant gratification economy designed to accommodate what consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow calls the \"I want what I want when I want it\" customer, or IWWIWWIWI. Having our desires delivered in minutes is a convenient game changer for those who have trouble making shopping trips, but the instant gratification economy faces serious challenges \u2014 and possible unintended psychological effects. The Need for Speed For Starship executive Henry Harris-Burland, the newer, speedier economy is about more than just getting goods faster. It's also about rethinking traditional business models. Starship's pilot programs will initially focus on food \u2014 the company is also testing automated delivery in partnership with DoorDash in Redwood, California \u2014 but the plan is to eventually provide retail, grocery, and parcel delivery, sans human drivers. \"The last couple of miles from a hub or a store to a customer's house is incredibly inefficient,\" Harris-Burland says. \"Think about vans stopping and starting 150 times outside of 150 houses in one neighborhood. It's an incredibly large waste of time. We're looking to totally revolutionize those traditional delivery methods.\" Pedestrians pass a Starship delivery robot. Starship Cruising at a max speed of four miles-per-hour, Starship bots generally deliver within 15 to 30 minutes, Harris-Burland says. Should Starship break into the retail market, it will be competing in a space that already relies heavily on technology to reduce shipping times. To deliver goods in one day, or one hour in select locations , Amazon uses proprietary algorithms to determine exactly where items should be stored within warehouses, the shortest path human \"pickers\" can take to retrieve the items, and the exact amount of time it should take to fulfill each order. The company is constantly pushing the boundaries of speedy delivery. It has filed patents for an \" airborne fulfillment center \" \u2014 a flying warehouse where aerial drones can refill between deliveries \u2014 and an \" anticipatory package shipping \" system designed to predict what you need, package it, and send it in your general direction (but not to your house) before you place an order. Related: This Robot Can Learn and Recreate Your Handwriting This year, UPS will implement ORION (On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation), a 1,000-page algorithm that determines the shortest driver routes by evaluating up to 200,000 alternatives for each trip. ORION shortens routes by an average of seven to eight miles, the company says. When fully deployed, it will save $300 to $400 million per year in fuel and human resource costs. Smaller businesses lack the time and resources to build their own mega-algorithms, which is where companies like Routific come in. Aimed at helping the little guys keep up, Routific offers optimization software that takes a list of drivers and destinations and finds the best routes. The system doesn't find the perfect route \u2014 it could take years for a computer to churn through every possibility. But it does find a near-optimal solution in minutes, helping clients cut drive times and fuel consumption by about 40 percent. It also provides substantially shortened delivery times, says Routific CEO Marc Kuo. As delivery times quicken, a cottage industry of startups is attacking other time-wasting aspects of retail. Shane Mac, CEO of Assist, is aiming to end telephone hold times with his automated messaging system. Assist provides customer service for about 20 brands using messaging platforms like Facebook and Slack, as well as automated voice platforms like Siri and Google Home. Instead of phoning a call center only to be put on hold, users can book a hotel, buy movie tickets, make a charitable donation, etc., all through text and voice commands. Assist also keeps identification and payment information on file to speed things up. \"We went from people waiting on hold 25 minutes to people being able to change a reservation they made to our hotel in under 30 seconds,\" Mac says. \"We're giving everyone in the world a lot of time back.\" Speed and the Psyche Delivery in one day, or even one hour, is still far from providing instant gratification. But as we move closer to that point, it's worth considering how it impacts consumers. Research shows that the speed at which we can satisfy our desires affects both what we want and how much we're willing to pay for it. That suggests ultrafast delivery could affect more than just when we get our purchases \u2014 it could affect our minds and our behavior. One possible reason is because \"people value a reward in the present twice as much as they would value the same reward in the future,\" says David Laibson, chair of Harvard University's economics department and director of its Foundations of Human Behavior Initiative. Related: Amazon Aims to Ship Packages from Flying Warehouse When faced with immediate rewards, we often decide based on what we want now regardless of what consequences it may bring later. When offered choices with rewards available in several days or months, we're more likely make decisions based on long-term needs and goals. Economists say this phenomenon of \"present bias\" influences all sorts of buyer behaviors, and studies show that when there's significant time between when we make a choice and when we can access its rewards, we often act more rationally. \"Technology that moves the consequences of our choices more and more into the present is going to empower this preference for instant gratification and undermine our ability to do what we consider to be in our long-run interests,\" Laibson says. Jonathan Cohen, co-director of the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, has concerns as well. Back in 2003 , an interdisciplinary team of researchers including Cohen and Laibson put study subjects into an fMRI brain scanner and watched in real time as subjects decided whether they preferred to receive a small gift certificate immediately or wait two to six weeks for a larger one. Related: How Computers are Learning to Predict the Future The researchers found that when the choice revolved around an immediate or near-term reward, the subject's emotional processing areas were activated. Those who chose the delayed reward showed more reliance on brain regions associated with logic. Those who opted for the immediate reward showed slightly more activity in regions associated with emotion. Cohen says this study can't be universalized to paint all decisions, but future brain imaging research may provide a better understanding of the logical and emotional processes that govern decision-making \u2014 and how they're affected by instant gratification. The Future of Fast Kit Yarrow doesn't believe that instant gratification business models will pervade our entire lives as consumers. While many companies are testing lightning-speed delivery, those services are costly, logistically complex, and thus unrealistic for most smaller retailers. Many of these services are currently free because they're in test mode, she adds, but it's unclear whether consumers will pay once they come at a price. A drone carries a package at Amazon's research and development labs. Amazon via AP \"Right now, I think [some] retailers, especially Amazon, are saying, 'Well, let's try this out. Once consumers get used to getting things in three hours, they'll eventually be willing to pay for it,'\" Yarrow says. \"A lot of what's been going on is trying to train consumers to have expectations of immediacy.\" Some have already dropped out of the same day delivery game \u2014 eBay, for instance, shuttered its service in 2015. But plenty of companies are jumping in. Last year, Staples launched its \"Staples Rush\" program, which guarantees that orders placed by 3 p.m. will make it to your door by 7 p.m., while Walmart partnered with Uber and Lyft to start same-day grocery delivery. Related: This Giant Robot is Action Movies Come to Life Despite all this innovation, immediacy might not be what consumers really want in every retail transaction. A recent survey of more than 4,000 holiday shoppers found that 92 percent of consumers consider delivery within two days to be \"fast,\" and 87 percent value free shipping over fast shipping. Consumers indicated that they were willing to pay around $5 for same-day delivery. One in four said that they wouldn't expect to pay anything at all for this service. Regardless of how fast or widespread these services become, it's worth pausing for just a moment to make sure these are truly the choices we want. \"As we make things more and more immediately available, it poses more and more of a risk that people will take advantage of that opportunity without considering whether immediate gratification is the best course,\" Cohen says, adding that immediate reward can be detrimental to consumers. \"The more it becomes available, the more we have to think about whether or not this is a good idea.\" For more of the breakthroughs changing our lives, follow NBC MACH.

The next day, a far larger illustration of popular will was on display at marches across the country. The people who gathered for the women\u2019s march hijacked the media narrative. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even for those who did not assemble on either weekend, the pictures carried special power. Amplified on social media and echoing across every TV network, they suggested something larger afoot, something democracy-defining. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening out there,\u201d Ana Navarro, the Republican never-Trumper and television pundit, declared on Twitter . Something sure is. We\u2019re witnessing the stirrings of a national popular movement aimed at defeating the policies of Mr. Trump. It is a movement without official leaders. In fact, to a noteworthy degree, the formal apparatus of the Democratic Party has been nearly absent from the uprisings. Unlike the Tea Party and the white-supremacist \u201calt-right,\u201d the new movement has no name. Call it the alt-left, or, if you want to really drive Mr. Trump up the wall, the alt-majority. Or call it nothing. Though nameless and decentralized, the movement isn\u2019t chaotic. Because it was hatched on social networks and is dispatched by mobile phones, it appears to be organizationally sophisticated and ferociously savvy about conquering the media. Over two weekends, the protests have accomplished something just about unprecedented in the nearly two years since Mr. Trump first declared his White House run: They have nudged him from the media spotlight he depends on. They are the only force we\u2019ve seen that has been capable of untangling his singular hold on the media ecosystem. Photo A rally in Manhattan on Sunday to protest President Trump\u2019s immigration ban. The flash protests in response to the ban, amplified on social media, were as organized as they were instantaneous. Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times Photo A march in Washington last week against the Trump administration\u2019s stance on immigration. Recent protests have accomplished something just about unprecedented: They have nudged Mr. Trump from the media spotlight he depends on. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times The movement is new and possibly fragile; it could dissipate, like so much else that has come up against Mr. Trump. But in such a short time, the movement has proved unusually adept. It can marshal crowds quickly, as we saw over the weekend, and it can go big, as we saw in the women\u2019s marches, which some crowd scientists believe were the largest day of protest in American history . The movement has other skills. It\u2019s capable of coming up with catchy slogans, funny signs and even branding efforts to rival Mr. Trump\u2019s own. The president has his Make America Great Again hats. Protesters at the women\u2019s march had pink woolen hats with cat ears \u2014 \u201cpussy hats,\u201d a reference to the president\u2019s confessed penchant for grabbing things. But unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s hats, the pink caps came from the crowd. Thousands of knitters created them in the weeks between the election and the inauguration, then mailed them off to strangers who shared their views. Video Immigrants Respond to Ban: #ImAlreadyHome Immigrants around the country are taking a stand against President Trump's executive order by sharing their stories on Twitter with the hashtag #ImAlreadyHome. By NEETI UPADHYE on Publish Date January 30, 2017. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed There\u2019s money, too. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s win, the inchoate online movement has sparked millions in donations to progressive groups such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Over the weekend, the A.C.L.U. raised more than $20 million . Advertisement Continue reading the main story The movement can also compel the attention of elites. In large part because of pressure from their connected work forces, the leaders of many technology companies denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration orders. Between Friday and Monday, thanks to the movement, Silicon Valley was transformed . An industry that was once merely skeptical of Mr. Trump largely became opposed to him, only because crowds forced change. Most important, though, the movement can command the media narrative. The president has promised a lot of bold change. His boldness will involve lots of real-world consequences. Millions might lose health care coverage if he repeals the Affordable Care Act. Many might be deported if he achieves his immigration proposals. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

By Juliet Eilperin By Juliet Eilperin January 30 at 2:22 PM Follow @eilperin Then-President Barack Obama holds a year-end news conference in Washington, D.C., Dec. 16, 2016. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images Former president Barack\u00a0Obama rejected the idea Monday that President Trump based his immigration executive order on a policy adopted by his own administration, and he endorsed the protests that have been taking place across the country in response to the new restrictions. Trump has said that his move to ban the entry of citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries into the United States, and to suspend temporarily the admission of refugees, was based in part on a decision in 2011 by then-President Obama to ban the admission of Iraqis to the country after evidence surfaced that two Iraqis seeking\u00a0resettlement had been linked to terrorist activity in their homeland. The Obama and Trump administrations also identified the same seven countries as harboring terrorism threats. Former Obama administration officials have denied that there was ever a halt to the awarding of visas to Iraqis, though the processing of these applications slowed after they were subject to more intense scrutiny. [ Trump\u2019s facile claim that his refugee policy is similar to Obama\u2019s in 2011 ] Obama, who has remained publicly silent about his successor since leaving office 10 days ago, pledged before leaving office to only speak about Trump's policy moves \u201cwhere I think our core values may be at stake.\u201d On Monday, his spokesman, Kevin Lewis, said in a statement, \u201cWith regard to comparisons to President Obama\u2019s foreign policy decisions, as we\u2019ve heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\u201d Alluding to the widespread protests taking place in major airports and cities in response to the new immigration policy, Lewis said that Obama \u201cis heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country.\u201d Hundreds of protesters gathered at the arrivals gate of Washington Dulles International Airport to push back against President Trump's executive order that targeted citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. A federal judge in New York blocked deportations nationwide late Saturday of those detained on entry to the United States. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) \u201cIn his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy \u2014 not just during an election but every day,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cCitizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d Read more from Politics:\u00a0 ",

    "text": "Email KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- For the second straight week, people searching for a missing Missouri woman \u00a0have found a man\u2019s body. Relatives of Jessica Runions found the man\u2019s body while searching in fields and brush along a roadway Saturday in southeast Kansas City, Missouri. Police said the discovery was being investigated as a suspicious death, but no details have been released. Police said Sunday they hope to identify the body soon. The Kansas City Star reports that Runions\u2019 relatives have been searching for the 21-year-old woman nearly every week since she went missing in early September. Last week, they found a man\u2019s decomposing body in a creek bed. He was later identified as a 21-year-old man also from Raytown, just southeast of Kansas City, who was reported missing in November. His death is being investigated as a homicide. \u201cTwo bodies two weeks in a row?\u201d said her father, John Runions. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. ... We\u2019re not going to stop looking until we find her. And if we find other people along the way, that\u2019s good. Families deserve closure.\u201d Kylr Yust KCTV Jessica Runions was last seen leaving a gathering of friends in south Kansas City. Her burned vehicle was found two days later in a nearby wooded area. Kylr Yust has been charged with burning her vehicle, and a judge entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Police have said Yust also has been questioned in the 2007 disappearance of an ex-girlfriend, Kara Kopetsky, who was 17 when she went missing. Kopetsky went went missing just days after filing for a protection order against Yust.\u00a0 Yust hasn\u2019t been charged in either disappearance. \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Wilfredo Lee/AP hide caption toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Republican candidates listen to a question during a March 2016 GOP presidential debate co-sponsored by CNN at the University of Miami. Wilfredo Lee/AP CNN is embarking on what it characterizes as a major new initiative in investigative reporting as executives pull together accomplished reporters into a single unit and promise to hire at least a dozen more. \"CNN needs to be an organization that breaks news, not just an organization that covers breaking news or talks about breaking news on television,\" Andrew Morse, the executive vice president of editorial for CNN/U.S. and general manager of CNN digital worldwide, told NPR. \"There's no better way to do that than to invest in investigative reporting.\" The legendary investigative reporters Carl Bernstein and James Steele, both Pulitzer Prize winners, will serve as contributing editors to advise the team on their work and executives on hiring. President Trump's Tweets, Annotated \"A lot of news divisions, newspapers and online projects say they want to do this,\" said Steele, who remains a contributing writer at Vanity Fair. \"The message is really clear: This reporting is important to this institution. We really want to have an impact in this area.\" \"These news organizations that have huge budgets have not devoted historically the kinds of resources to investigative reporting that they are capable of,\" said Bernstein, who has been a contributor and commentator at CNN for the past three years. \"With this, CNN is making a statement that it is capable of doing this kind of work and devoting the kind of resources to it that this deserves. Hopefully, other networks will do the same. It's good for journalism and it's good for the people of the country.\" Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump enters the debate hall at the University of Miami. Alan Diaz/AP hide caption toggle caption Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump enters the debate hall at the University of Miami. Alan Diaz/AP According to several people involved in its planning, CNN's effort was in the works before the November elections. Morse said the planning started more than a year ago. Article continues after sponsorship Yet executives at many news organizations say the dawning of the Trump era has created a distinct challenge because of the White House's aggressive and hostile stance toward the press. The New York Times, the Washington Post and Politico have expanded the size of the teams they are assigning to cover the new administration. As a fundraiser, the not-for-profit investigative outfit ProPublica is selling T-shirts with the caption \"We're not shutting up\" \u2014 a reference to White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's admonition that the press should do just that. In CNN's case, the network has found itself both covering the new administration and being the target of rhetorical attacks from it. FACT CHECK: Trump Tweets On Christians, ISIS And Vetting Miss The Bigger Picture Trump was incensed by CNN's breaking news of a dossier filled with unsubstantiated claims about past salacious activity on Trump's part in Russia and the prospect that Vladimir Putin's intelligence agencies would be able to use that against him. CNN reported that U.S. intelligence officials took the dossier so seriously that they briefed both then-President Barack Obama and then-President-elect Trump on its contents. Trump called CNN \"fake news\" and berated a CNN reporter at a press conference just days before the inauguration, refusing to take questions from him. Anchor Jake Tapper has been shut out by the administration since helping to break the dossier story along with Bernstein and two other colleagues. No White House officials have appeared on Tapper's Sunday public affairs show, State of the Union, in the two weeks since the story was first posted and broadcast by CNN. 5 Questions About The Law And Trump's Immigration Order \"This effort is not a response to the administration in Washington, but it's certainly well-timed,\" Morse said. \"It's very important for us to do good, solid independent work at a time like this.\" The network intends to add more investigative reporters to key areas such as politics, financial news, health care, justice, the environment, consumer advocacy and race. Morse promises they will be \"experienced and skilled reporters who will be held away from the fray \u2014 not in the everyday news mix.\" Among those current CNN journalists who will be drawn into the new unit are Sarah Ganim, a young reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize covering the child abuse scandal that embroiled the Penn State football program; Drew Griffin, who made headlines with stories on waitlists at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers ; and the reporting team of Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken, who cover financial matters for CNN . The unit will also include the K-File, a group of reporters and fact checkers who most recently showed rampant plagiarism by a journalist who was set to join the Trump administration. The journalist, Monica Crowley, withdrew after the team's reports and subsequent ones by Politico making similar findings about her doctoral thesis. With National Security Council Shakeup, Steve Bannon Gets A Seat At The Table CNN is creating a digital home that will unify its investigative reporting and will refashion reports for all platforms. \"You can watch CNN and go extended periods of time without seeing a full package of a story,\" said media analyst Merrill Brown, a past editor-in-chief of MSNBC.com. \"What you see is conversation rather than real packages. People need to get into the business of telling real stories again. ... It's exciting to hear that CNN is expanding what it wants to do in this regard.\" \"It's not about being digital first, which I think is already an antiquated way of thinking,\" Morse said. \"It's not about just feeding the TV beast. It's about being a truly 21st century media company that breaks news and programs it and distributes it everywhere.\" ",

President Donald Trump sits during a meeting to sign executive orders in the Hall of Heroes at the Department of Defense on Jan.\u00a027, 2017. in Arlington, Va. (Pool / Getty Images) Carol MorelloThe Washington Post State Department diplomats on Monday circulated various drafts of a memo objecting to President Donald Trump 's executive order last week to suspend the nation's refugee program and deny U.S. entry to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries. The document is destined for what's known as the department's \"Dissent Channel,\" which was set up during the Vietnam War as a way for diplomats to signal directly to senior management their disagreement with foreign policy decisions. The communications are typically confidential, and may even be done anonymously if any of the signatories fear retaliation. Several versions of the draft are floating around the State Department, as diplomats weigh in and ask for revisions. Yet even as it was still being circulated, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, \"And these career bureaucrats have a problem with it? I think they should either get with the program or they can go.\" The memo probably will be submitted to Acting Secretary of State Thomas Shannon, a holdover from the Obama administration who will be in charge of the department until a new secretary of state is confirmed. The Senate was expected to vote on Rex Tillerson's nomination later Monday. The State Department officially acknowledged the existence of the memo Monday morning, and vowed to respect it. Since Trump's announcement Friday, the document has been circulating swiftly among diplomats charged with carrying out the foreign policy changes Trump is making. \"The Dissent Channel is a long-standing official vehicle for State Department employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues,\" acting spokesman Mark Toner said. \"This is an important process that the Acting Secretary and the Department as a whole value and respect. It allows State employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.\" ",

The unhinged outrage from Trump-haters \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 puts the interests of non-Americans over the security of our citizens. And the administration\u2019s botched roll-out of the new restrictions gave opponents just the excuse they needed to bellow. Reduce the argument to a personal level. A homeowner is permitted to refuse entry to anyone he or she doesn\u2019t want in, right? Security systems are intended to keep unwanted visitors out and let the homeowner know who is outside. Lots of apartment dwellers have an intercom that rings when someone outside wants to visit. Are those precautions divisive, discriminatory or unconstitutional? One of the most horrifying placards I saw during the protests on Trump\u2019s inauguration day read: \u201cNo borders. No nations.\u201d Really? Let anyone go anywhere without asking who they are, why they want to come here and what their past actions tell us about them? The notion that America must be open to anyone who decides to visit flies in the face of 21st century reality. How do other countries vet visitors? China requires potential guests to fill out a four-page application that asks, among other things, the reason for your visit, the names of your close relatives and what they do, the person who will pay for your trip, your passport number, how long you plan to stay and if you have ever been denied a visa for China in the past? How would the protesters outside American airports react to that kind of quizzing? China doesn't bother with pretending a democracy, so protests are few and far between. Iran, another country that likes to know who\u2019s coming across its borders, asks most of the same questions as China, as well as \u201cHave you ever been infected by any contagious diseases?\u201d and who you plan to meet with in Iran. Saudi Arabia gets right to the point, telling female travelers that they cannot enter the country without a male relative accompanying them. Yet Saudi airports have no one outside screeching about their rights. And a handful of Muslim-majority countries won\u2019t admit anyone who has an Israeli visa in his or her passport. The United States allows a great deal of leeway for protest and disagreement. Those who disagree with the president\u2019s executive order have taken full advantage of those rights, and rightly so. But their argument that the United States, alone among all countries, cannot restrict who comes in from beyond its shores is, quite simply, specious. The protests against anything this president does will continue, and that\u2019s fine as long as they\u2019re peaceful. But let\u2019s at least admit that they are not about the issues, but the issuer-in-chief. John Moody is Executive Vice President, Executive Editor for Fox News.

On a March morning nearly five years ago, a 15-year-old California high school cheerleader vanished as she walked from her home in Santa Clara County to her school bus stop. Sierra LaMar's body has never been found, but authorities charged a 21-year-old man with her murder and kidnapping, allegations that could sentence him to death if he's convicted in a trial set to begin this week. LaMar's disappearance sparked a massive search by air and land for the girl who came to be known as \"Everyone\u2019s Daughter\" on T-shirts and posters. A sophomore at Sobrato High School, LaMar was last seen around 6 a.m. March 16, 2012, when she left her Morgan Hill home for the bus stop. Expand / Contract A day later, authorities found the teen's cellphone and her handbag -- with her clothes neatly folded inside -- along the side of the road near her home. The condition of the phone indicated it had likely been tossed from a vehicle. \u00a0 Antolin\u00a0Garc\u00eda-Torres, a high school dropout, was arrested in May 2012 and charged with murder and attempting to kidnap three other women in 2009. Prosecutors said they had strong physical evidence linking him to LaMar -- including traces of her DNA found in the trunk of his car. \"We believe we have probable cause that he committed the kidnapping and murder of Sierra LaMar,\"\u00a0County Sheriff Laurie Smith announced following the arrest of Garcia-Torres, who has pleaded not guilty. Expand / Contract Antolin Garc\u00eda-Torres (AP) District Attorney Jeff Rosen is seeking the death penalty -- despite no body being recovered -- and prosecutors must argue their case without an autopsy or murder weapon. Defense attorneys, meanwhile, are expected to argue that LaMar may still be alive, Fox affiliate KTVU-TV reported . \u00a0 If prosecutors fail to get a conviction, Garcia-Torres cannot be tried again even if new evidence is recovered in the case, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The murder trial is set to begin Monday with the selection of alternate jurors and opening statements. Advertisement ",

An Afghan Pashtun tribal elder makes his case with an unidentified interpreter for the Army's 101st Airborne Division during an informal meeting in 2010 west of Kandahar, Afghanistan. (Chris Hondros / Getty Images) Shashank Bengali Contact Reporter For seven years, Ekram Razeqy worked alongside U.S. forces in some of Afghanistan\u2019s most volatile provinces, surviving roadside bombings and Taliban ambushes as an interpreter for American troops. Fearing he could be targeted by Taliban sympathizers when he returned to civilian life, he applied for a special visa that allows interpreters who assisted U.S. forces in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to resettle with their families in the United States. In May 2012, he sat for an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and was told to wait up to 12 months for his application to be processed. Nearly five years later, Razeqy is still waiting for an answer \u2013 one he now fears might never come because of President Trump\u2019s executive order shutting down the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and banning all citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. While Afghanistan is not one of the seven countries on the list, Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce immigration, particularly from Muslim nations he perceives as security threats, have alarmed Razeqy and others who feel the Special Immigrant Visa program will be abolished or curtailed even further. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about this,\ufffd? Razeqy, 33, said Sunday by phone from Kabul, where he lives with his wife and two children. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really bad news for Afghans who are still waiting for the SIV.\ufffd? The executive order Trump signed Friday does not mention the SIV, intended for interpreters whose lives may be in danger\u00a0because of their service to the United States. But the order\u2019s vague, sweeping language prompted mass confusion and protests at U.S. airports this weekend as authorities detained immigrants and visitors with valid visas and lawyers fought to have them released. The Pentagon said Monday that it was working to ensure that interpreters and others who worked with the U.S. military were exempt from the ban on entry.\u00a0Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, referred specifically to Iraq, which, unlike Afghanistan, is among the seven countries whose nationals are banned. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer later pushed back against blanket exemptions. \u201cWe recognize that people have served this country, we should make sure that in those cases they're helped out,\ufffd? he said. \u201cBut that doesn't mean that we just give them a pass.\ufffd? An Afghan national traveling on an SIV was detained briefly Friday at San Francisco International Airport while his wife and children were allowed through, said Matt Zeller, an Afghanistan veteran and founder of No One Left Behind, a nonprofit group that helps Afghan and Iraqi combat interpreters resettle in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers held the Afghan man for several hours because they were unclear on which nationalities were subject to the ban, Zeller said. Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an Iraqi man who worked for U.S. forces for 10 years and obtained an SIV  this month, was detained upon arrival Friday at Kennedy Airport in New York because Iraq is one of Trump\u2019s seven \u201ccountries of particular concern.\ufffd? The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi detainee, winning a judgment late Saturday that blocked the deportation of visa holders. Trump\u2019s order would slash the number of refugees allowed into the United States in 2017 to a maximum of 50,000 \u2013 fewer than half the number allowed last year. That could significantly restrict approvals under the SIV program, which has a backlog of 13,000 applicants in Afghanistan and only 1,500 more visas available over the next four years under the latest congressional authorization. The visa program also seems in trouble because Trump\u2019s order will prohibit immigration from countries that fail to provide adequate information to the U.S. about visa applicants. Record-keeping in Afghanistan has long been scant; many SIV applicants, for example, never obtained birth certificates. \u00a0 Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, is one of the harshest critics of the visa program and has argued that it should be killed. \u201cWe\u2019re profoundly concerned about what this means for U.S. national security,\ufffd? Zeller said. \u201cWe\u2019re already starting to see previous translators express dismay at this order online and question why they ever signed up to work with us, saying they don\u2019t trust Americans. \u201cIf that\u2019s the prevailing narrative, how are we ever going to find allies in future conflicts or humanitarian situations around the world if we don\u2019t keep our word to leave no one behind?\ufffd? The visa program has resettled more than 52,000 Afghan and Iraqi interpreters and family members in the United States since 2007. The program in Afghanistan was long criticized for bureaucratic delays until the State Department significantly sped up processing of the applications in 2014. Proponents of the program say SIV recipients have put their lives on the line to assist U.S. personnel. They are among the most thoroughly vetted of visa applicants, undergoing exhaustive background checks by U.S. military and intelligence agencies that often last years \u2013 not to mention the extensive screening that took place before they were hired as interpreters in the first place. As the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan has dwindled to about 8,000, jobs for interpreters have dried up. At the same time, Taliban insurgents, who have said they will target anyone who collaborated with foreign troops, have strengthened their grip on\u00a0large parts of northern and southern Afghanistan. Many SIV applicants live in fear in Afghan cities while others have given up waiting and joined the dangerous migrant trail to Europe. Razeqy, who is jobless, said he checks the State Department website sometimes multiple times a day for updates on his status. He and his wife spent more than $1,000 collecting the required documents, letters of recommendation and medical reports for themselves and their two children. \u201cI send a lot of emails to the U.S. Embassy,\ufffd? Razeqy said. \u201cI told them: You don\u2019t know my situation. Everyone knows I was an interpreter. I can\u2019t travel easily. I can\u2019t work.\ufffd? \u201cMy message to President Trump is that I worked seven years faithfully for Americans, shoulder to shoulder,\ufffd? Razeqy said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just me but there are thousands of us. It\u2019s not fair to leave us behind.\ufffd? Other former interpreters have been stymied by the visa application process. Alireza Rezai, 26, said he couldn\u2019t contact his former U.S. military mentors for recommendation letters because he forgot his Facebook password and was locked out of his account. Emails he sent went unreturned. Six years ago, Rezai was riding at the front of a U.S. Army convoy in western Afghanistan when his truck struck a roadside bomb. The soldiers and Rezai escaped without severe injuries, and the platoon leader praised the young interpreter for remaining \u201ccool under pressure.\ufffd? \u201cHis enthusiasm for the job is unwavering, and his professionalism is without equal,\ufffd? Lt. David S. Savanuck wrote in a recommendation letter Rezai collected. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump understands that for most of the Afghan guys who worked with the U.S., their lives are in danger,\ufffd? Rezai said by phone from Herat, in western Afghanistan. \u201cEvery day the security is getting worse here. So if they end this [SIV] process, I am sure that most of the guys who worked with the U.S. Army will be at risk.\ufffd?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story The swift reassessment of trade relations \u2014 a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II \u2014 only amplifies the potential for a shake-up of the broader geopolitical framework. Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values. Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail. But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China\u2019s growing influence. Then, on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall \u2014 resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cOne would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that\u2019s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly.\u201d The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the job-creating magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had \u201ca very good call\u201d with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u201d Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen. Photo Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with President Xi Jinping of China and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in September. Ms. Merkel on Wednesday spoke with Premier Li Keqiang of China \u201cin favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,\u201d a German government spokesman said. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7,000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries. Mr. Trump\u2019s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell\u2019s work force. \u201cThey hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,\u201d he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But in the end, he said, business will carry on. \u201cIn 31 years, I\u2019ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through worse.

    "text": "Privacy Policy It was all symptomatic of a new president eager to tweet first and work out details later. \u201cThis is policy by thunderbolt,\u201d said Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who served as the head of the National Intelligence Council and has written extensively on how the United States can gain leverage from its \u201csoft power\u201d \u2014 the attractiveness of its culture and democracy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tear up 70 years of foreign policy until you think hard about what replaces it.\u201d But inside the halls of the State Department, where Rex W. Tillerson, the pick for secretary of state, has just begun to find his way around, there is definitely the sense among career diplomats that this is Year Zero. Last week, the \u201clanding team\u201d of Trump designees told several of the department\u2019s most senior diplomats \u2014 career officials, some with decades of service \u2014 to clear out of their offices. Almost all had submitted their resignations, the protocol when administrations changed, but had volunteered to stay on for a month or two until successors were appointed, to ensure that State Department facilities were safe, American citizens were evacuated from perilous places and passports were issued. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Trump team made it clear it had no interest in transitions. (Mr. Tillerson also never met one-on-one with his predecessor, John Kerry, before the inauguration.) It was not exactly a purge, but the fact remains that some of the government\u2019s most experienced diplomats have moved on \u2014 including some of the highest-ranking women in the department. Among them is Anne Patterson, 67, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and a former ambassador to Pakistan and Egypt, two of the biggest tinderboxes Mr. Trump will face. Victoria J. Nuland, 55, one of the department\u2019s top Russia experts and former ambassador to NATO, who dealt with the Ukraine crisis, decided to retire after concluding there was probably no place for her in Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. Such a housecleaning leaves open the question of whether Mr. Tillerson, who has extensive experience abroad as chief executive of Exxon Mobil but none as a diplomat, will have the kind of help he needs in a very different kind of enterprise than negotiating on behalf of the world\u2019s largest oil company. In such an atmosphere, even seemingly routine moves \u2014 like the reorganization of the National Security Council \u2014 take on a political air. On Sunday, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and chief ideologue, Stephen K. Bannon, was designated a permanent member of the \u201cprincipals committee\u201d of the National Security Council , putting a political aide on par with the secretaries of state and defense. Meanwhile, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to be downgraded, told to attend only when their issues were on the table. \u201cThis is stone cold crazy,\u201d Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser until earlier this month, wrote in a Twitter post . \u201cWho needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK?\u201d she said, using acronyms for the Islamic State and North Korea. Mr. Trump\u2019s answer is simple: When you have come to upend the establishment, the establishment must vacate the premises.

    "text": "Email BEL AIR, Md. \u2014 The police chief of a small Maryland town responded Sunday in a Facebook post to outcry over a Dec. 21 incident in which a resident was stopped as she went for a walk, and asked if she was in the country legally . Aravinda Pillalamarri, a U.S. citizen,\u00a0 told CBS Baltimore that officers in the town where she lives, Bel Air, stopped her while she was on a casual evening walk in her neighborhood. \u201cI had just come out for a walk, so I didn\u2019t have my ID. And he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have ID? Are you here illegally?\u2019\u201d Pillalamarri said. \u00a0 During a Town Hall meeting soon after the incident, Bel Air Police Chief Charles Moore indicated that the incident made him realize his officers need more training on handling similarly sensitive interactions. In a Facebook post Sunday, Moore said his department had received a high volume of calls related to the incident and the department\u2019s overall approach to immigration issues. \u201cThe Bel Air Police Department in no manner supports bias based policing/racial profiling tactics while in the performance of our duties,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOur goal is to earn everyone\u2019s respect and admiration and to keep our community safe.\u201d Moore said in the post that when officers first encountered Pillalamarri, at around 9:40 p.m., they were responding to a report of a suspicious person in a neighborhood where packages had previously been stolen from porches. Moore said Pillalamarri fit the description reported to police. \u201cUpon (the officer\u2019s) approach to Ms. Pillalamarri, the officer was immediately asked by Ms. Pillalamarri if she was being stopped for \u2018walking while brown,\u2019\u201d Moore wrote. \u00a0\u201cThe officer immediately denied this and indicated to her that he had been dispatched to a call for service and was trying to check her welfare. Ms. Pillalamarri then began to walk away from the officer, refusing to speak to him or to provide identification. The officer continued to attempt to establish dialogue.\u201d Pillalamarri could not immediately be reached for comment, but reiterated her concern about the stop during her interview with CBS Baltimore. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this to happen in Bel Air. Walking while brown? He said, \u2018No, no, no, nothing like that,\u2019\u201d Pillalamarri said. Moore said Pillalamarri at first refused to identify herself, which is why she was asked if she was in the country legally. However, he noted that the department personnel are undergoing \u201ccontinual training and education\u201d related to the incident.\u00a0 \u201cIt is also clear that questioning one\u2019s immigration status isn\u2019t the answer for relieving tension,\u201d Moore wrote. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Got it Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), President Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, testifies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 10. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) By Philip Rucker and Robert Costa By Philip Rucker and Robert Costa January 30 at 5:50 PM Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @costareports In jagged black strokes, President Trump\u2019s signature was scribbled onto a catalogue of executive orders over the past 10\u00a0days that translated the hard-line promises of his campaign into the policies of his government. The directives bore Trump\u2019s name, but another man\u2019s fingerprints were also on nearly all of them: Jeff Sessions. The early days of the Trump presidency have rushed a nationalist agenda long on the fringes of American life into action \u2014 and Sessions, the quiet Alabam\u00adian who long cultivated those ideas as a Senate backbencher, has become a singular power in this new Washington. Sessions\u2019s ideology is driven by a visceral aversion to what he calls \u201csoulless globalism,\u201d a term used on the extreme right to convey a perceived threat to the United States from free trade, international alliances and the immigration of nonwhites. And despite many reservations among Republicans about that worldview, Sessions \u2014 whose 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship was doomed by accusations of racism that he denied \u2014 is finding little resistance in Congress to his proposed role as Trump\u2019s attorney general. Sessions, left, and then-President-elect Donald Trump speak at a \u201cUSA Thank You Tour\u201d rally in Sessions\u2019s home town of Mobile, Ala., on Dec. 17. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Sessions\u2019s nomination is scheduled to be voted on Tuesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but his influence in the administration stretches far beyond the Justice Department. From immigration and health care to national security and trade, Sessions is the intellectual godfather of the president\u2019s policies. His reach extends throughout the White House, with his aides and allies accelerating the president\u2019s most dramatic moves, including the ban on refugees and citizens from seven mostly Muslim nations that has triggered fear around the globe. The author of many of Trump\u2019s executive orders is senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, a Sessions confidant who was mentored by him and who spent the weekend overseeing the government\u2019s implementation of the refu\u00adgee ban. The tactician turning Trump\u2019s agenda into law is deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn, Sessions\u2019s longtime chief of staff in the Senate. The mastermind behind Trump\u2019s incendiary brand of populism is chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who, as chairman of the Breitbart website, promoted Sessions for years. Then there is Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who considers Sessions a savant and forged a bond with the senator while orchestrating Trump\u2019s trip last summer to Mexico City and during the darkest days of the campaign. [ Trump lays groundwork to change U.S. role in the world ] In an email in response to a request from The Washington Post, Bannon described Sessions as \u201cthe clearinghouse for policy and philosophy\u201d in Trump\u2019s administration, saying he and the senator are at the center of Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-America movement\u201d and the global nationalist phenomenon. \u201cIn America and Europe, working people are reasserting their right to control their own destinies,\u201d Bannon wrote. \u201cJeff Sessions has been at the forefront of this movement for years, developing populist nation-state policies that are supported by the vast and overwhelming majority of Americans, but are poorly understood by cosmopolitan elites in the media that live in a handful of our larger cities.\u201d He continued: \u201cThroughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump\u2019s agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda. What we are witnessing now is the birth of a new political order, and the more frantic a handful of media elites become, the more powerful that new political order becomes itself.\u201d Sessions and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway speak to members of the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 17. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Trump, who is never shy about showering praise on his loyalists, speaks of Sessions with reverence. At a luncheon the day before his inauguration, Trump singled out someone in the audience: \u201cthe legendary Jeff Sessions.\u201d Trump said in an email to The Post that Sessions is \u201ca truly fine person.\u201d \u201cJeff was one of my earliest supporters and the fact that he is so highly respected by everyone in both Washington, D.C., and around the country was a tremendous asset to me throughout the campaign,\u201d Trump wrote. Sessions helped devise the president\u2019s first-week strategy, in which Trump signed a blizzard of executive orders that begin to fulfill his signature campaign promises \u2014 although Sessions had advocated going even faster. The senator lobbied for a \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d period of executive action that would rattle Congress, impress Trump\u2019s base and catch his critics unaware, according to two officials involved in the transition planning. Trump opted for a slightly slower pace, these officials said, because he wanted to maximize news coverage by spreading out his directives over several weeks. Trump makes his own decisions, but Sessions was one of the rare lawmakers who shared his impulses. \u201cSessions brings heft to the president\u2019s gut instincts,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. He compared Sessions to John Mitchell, who was attorney general under Richard M. Nixon but served a more intimate role as a counselor to the president on just about everything. \u201cNixon is not a guy given to taking advice, but Mitchell was probably Nixon\u2019s closest adviser,\u201d Stone said. [ In Trump\u2019s Washington, rival powers and whispers in the president\u2019s ear ] There are limits to Sessions\u2019s influence, however. He has not persuaded Trump \u2014 so far, at least \u2014 to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, under which children brought to the United States illegally are allowed to stay in the country. Sessions has also been leading the internal push for Trump to nominate William H. Pryor Jr., his deputy when Sessions was Alabama\u2019s attorney general and now a federal appeals court judge, for the Supreme Court. While Pryor is on Trump\u2019s list of three finalists, it is unclear whether he will get the nod. In his senior staff meetings, Trump talks about Sessions as someone who \u201cgets things done,\u201d calmly and without fanfare, said Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor. \u201cHe does it in a very courtly, deliberative manner,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s never a cloud of dust or dramatic flourish.\u201d Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House and informal Trump adviser, said, \u201cSessions is the person who is comfortable being an outsider to the establishment but able to explain the establishment to Trump. There is this New York-Los \u00adAngeles bias that if you sound like Alabama, you can\u2019t be all that bright, but that\u2019s totally wrong, and Trump recognized how genuinely smart Sessions is.\u201d Sessions was especially instrumental in the early days of the transition, which was taken over by Dearborn after a purge of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s associates. Sessions became a daily presence at Trump Tower in New York, mapping out the policy agenda and making personnel decisions. Once former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was out of consideration for secretary of state, Trump considered nominating Sessions because he was so trusted by the inner circle, including Kushner, although Sessions\u2019s preference was to be attorney general, according to people familiar with the talks. Since his nomination, Sessions has been careful to not be formally involved even as his ideas animate the White House. In a statement Sunday, he denied that he has had \u201ccommunications\u201d with his former advisers or reviewed the executive orders. Sessions has installed close allies throughout the administration. He persuaded Cliff Sims, a friend and adviser, to sell his Alabama media outlet and take a job directing message strategy at the White House. Sessions also influenced the selection of Peter Navarro, an economist and friend with whom he co-authored an op-ed last fall warning against the \u201crabbit hole of globalism,\u201d as director of the National Trade Council. Sessions\u2019s connections extend into the White House media briefing room, where press secretary Sean Spicer took the first question at his Jan. 24 briefing from a journalist at LifeZette, a conservative website run by Laura Ingraham, a Trump supporter and populist in the Sessions mold. The website\u2019s senior editor is Garrett Murch, a former communications adviser to Sessions. Another link: Julia Hahn, a Breitbart writer who favorably chronicled Sessions\u2019s immigration crusades over the past two years, was hired by Bannon to be one of his White House aides. More mainstream Republicans have been alarmed by Sessions\u2019s ascent. John Weaver, a veteran GOP strategist who was a consultant on Sessions\u2019s first Senate campaign and is now a Trump critic, said Sessions is at the pinnacle of power because he shares Trump\u2019s \u201c1940s view of fortress America.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s something you would find in an Allen Drury novel,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cUnfortunately, there are real consequences to this, which are draconian views on immigration and a view of America that is insular and not an active member of the global community.\u201d [ Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general is shadowed by race and history ] Inside the White House and within Sessions\u2019s alumni network, people have taken to calling the senator \u201cJoseph,\u201d referring to the Old Testament patriarch who was shunned by his family and sold into slavery as a boy, only to rise through unusual circumstances to become right hand to the pharaoh and oversee the lands of Egypt. In a 20-year Senate career, Sessions has been isolated in his own party, a dynamic crystallized a decade ago when he split with President George W. Bush and the business community over comprehensive immigration changes. In lonely and somewhat conspiratorial speeches on the Senate floor, Sessions would chastise the \u201cmasters of the universe.\u201d He hung on his office wall a picture of He-Man from the popular 1980s comic book series. As he weighed a presidential run, Trump liked what he saw in Sessions, who was tight with the constituencies Trump was eager to rouse on the right. So he cultivated a relationship, giving Sessions $2,000 for his 2014 reelection even though the senator had no Democratic opponent. \u201cSessions was always somebody that we had targeted,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, Trump\u2019s political adviser at the time. In May 2015, Nunberg said, he reached out to Miller, then an adviser to Sessions, to arrange a phone call between Trump and the senator. The two hit it off, with Trump telling Nunberg, \u201cThat guy is tough.\u201d The next month, Trump declared his candidacy. In August of that year, Sessions joined Trump at a mega-rally in the senator\u2019s home town of Mobile and donned a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. By January 2016, Miller had formally joined the campaign and was traveling daily with the candidate, writing speeches and crafting policies. \u201cSenator Sessions laid a bit of groundwork . . . on matters like trade and illegal immigration,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt was candidate Trump then who was able to elevate those twin pillars in a way that cast it through the lens of what\u2019s good for the American worker.\u201d As Trump kept rising, so did Sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a guerrilla in the hinterlands preparing for the next hopeless assault on the government,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative research institute. \u201cThen you get a message that the capital has fallen.\u201d politics News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 ",

Sally Yates in June 2016. J. David Ake / AP The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel signed off on Trump's order last week, but Yates \u2014 who stayed on as acting attorney general pending the confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama \u2014 said the office's reviews don't \"address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just.\" \"My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts,\" Yates wrote in a memo to the department's lawyers. \"At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\" she wrote.

Obama \"fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\" the statement said. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the directive \"a remarkable but welcome development.\" The directive \"sends a powerful message that there's something very wrong with a Muslim ban,\" Gelernt said. But Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump and a major architect of the travel ban, said, \"It's sad that our politics have been politicized, that you have people refusing to enforce our laws.\" In an interview Monday night on MSNBC's \"For the Record,\" Miller said it was \"sadder still that you have a situation where the previous administration \u2014 and I don't want to bring up the past \u2014 lifted, removed, eliminated whole sections of immigration law, and it wasn't even considered by many in the media and many in the administration to be matter of controversy.\" Yates' memo would appear to represent the most serious rebellion by the Justice Department since the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" of October 1973, when Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than carry out President Richard Nixon's order to fire Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor.

Sykes worked as a City Hall reporter, covering what he considered costly but ultimately failed government programs. (Jan. 30, 2017) Sykes worked as a City Hall reporter, covering what he considered costly but ultimately failed government programs. (Jan. 30, 2017) Mark Z. Barabak Contact Reporter For nearly 25 years, Charlie Sykes was one of the most powerful and influential voices in Wisconsin. He cheer-led\u00a0policies that turned this historically progressive state into a model of conservative governance. He made and destroyed political careers, using his perch on Milwaukee talk radio to help vault figures such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Gov. Scott Walker to national prominence. But for the moment Sykes was speechless. He sank into the brown leather banquette of a suburban steakhouse. He stammered. He sighed. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve devoted your whole life to certain beliefs and you think now they have been undermined and that you might have been deluded about things,\u201d he began. \u201cSo. So. Um...\u201d In 2016 Sykes emerged as one of Donald Trump\u2019s most prominent critics, a stance that outraged listeners, strained longstanding friendships and left him questioning much of what he once held true. What it means to be a conservative. The role of race in politics. The wisdom of voters. More troubling, Sykes believes he and others in the shoutrageous world of talk radio contributed mightily to the rise of Trump, to the contagion of fake news that abetted his presidential candidacy and to invigorating the racist, sexist and xenophobic elements drawn to his caustic campaign. \u201cReaping the whirlwind,\u201d Sykes calls it, and though\u00a0his heresy has opened new avenues, including a commentary role on left-leaning MSNBC, many erstwhile foes question both his motivations and avowedly sudden self-awareness \u2014 the leitmotif for a book due out in October. They liken him to a pyromaniac grieving over the ashes he created, or, as former Wisconsin Democratic Chairman Mike Tate put it, \u201ca guy who slowly fed poison to his dog for 10 years then, when the dog dies of poisoning, throws up his hands and says, \u2018My God, how did that happen?\u2019\u201d For Sykes, it presents something of an existential crisis. Reviled by old allies on the right \u2014 \u201cJudas goat!\u201d \u201cBenedict Arnold!\u201d \u2014 and distrusted by many on the left, he quit his radio show and finds himself a bit at sea. \u201cKind of the man without a country at the moment,\u201d Sykes said. :: For Trump supporters, Inauguration Day was a glorious pageant. Detractors called it Black Friday. Others who opposed Trump believe it signaled time to move on, swallow their qualms and, however grudging, hope for the best. In a word, surrender. \u201cI campaigned against him and I was beaten,\u201d said Katie Packer, who ran a political action committee that spent more than $18 million trying to stop Trump. \u201cI may find things that he does to be objectionable but I don't really have it in me to spend the next four years just hating on the guy every single day.\u201d Rob Stutzman, another outspoken Trump critic, has taken solace in his conservative Cabinet picks and the promise of tax cuts and a rollback of environmental regulations. \u201cI\u2019ve adopted more the notion of wait and watch at this point, but the first week was mostly appalling,\u201d said Stutzman, a Sacramento-based GOP consultant. Some, however remain firmly dug into their never-Trump trenches. John Weaver, who managed Republican John Kasich \u2019s White House bid, has never met Sykes, but expressed his admiration. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been one of those so-called conservatives who modified their belief system in order to curry access or favor,\u201d said Weaver, who offers a steady stream of anti-Trump vituperation on his Twitter feed. Sykes\u2019 own feed has become a catalog of contempt; this weekend it was filled with criticism of Trump\u2019s immigration ban and the failure to mention Jews in a White House statement observing Holocaust Remembrance Day. Sykes, who broadcast for 23 years before ending his radio show, gained national notice in March when an unwitting Trump called into his radio program a week before the Republican primary. \u201cHere in Wisconsin we value things like civility, decency and actual conservative principles,\u201d Sykes said by way of welcome, implying Trump lacked all three. For the next 16 minutes, a polite but persistent Sykes prodded the GOP front-runner about his history of supporting Democrats, his disparagement of women and \u201cplayground\u201d behavior. \u201cDo you ever apologize?\" Sykes asked, suggesting it was something \u201cmost real men\u201d do. Trump responded with rare equanimity, and no apologies. Afterward, he derided Sykes as a \u201clow life\u201d and \u201cwhack job.\u201d He lost the primary \u2014 a fact Sykes mentions with pride \u2014 but the setback barely slowed his march to the nomination. (Trump narrowly carried Wisconsin in November.) The big loser, arguably, was Sykes. He is 62, with the tidy, all-American looks of the dad in a store-bought picture frame. His own father died of a heart attack at 63, so the age has long been a kind of benchmark; Sykes says even before Trump\u2019s rise he planned to end his radio show to pursue new interests. But the antipathy of old friends and allies made the decision much easier. \u201cBasically the music score of my last six months was \u2018We\u2019re not listening to you again,\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s up with you?\u2019 \u2018Betrayal,\u2019\u201d Sykes said with a small, mirthless laugh. \u201cSome could have been trolls from Macedonia. Others were prominent Republican women from Waukesha I\u2019ve known for 20 years.\u201d His last show was Dec. 19, drawing a series of tributes, including Walker\u2019s declaration of \u201cCharlie Sykes Day\u201d in Wisconsin. Ryan was among the luminaries calling in; the House speaker pointedly ignored the host\u2019s jocular plea to prove him wrong about Trump. Ryan, who hails from the policy wing of the GOP, is one of Sykes\u2019 longtime political soulmates. Reince Priebus, a former state party chairman serving as Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff, has also been a friend, which only underscores Sykes\u2019 estrangement from his old bedfellows. He speaks of a Faustian bargain \u2014 \u201cWhat are you willing to sell out in order to get tax reform?\u201d \u2014 and likened those around Trump to the dupes who surrounded Adolf Hitler, convinced they could control him once he gained power. \u201cSo this is the Franz von Papen plan, right?\u201d Sykes said, referring to the German chancellor who preceded the Nazi dictator. \u201cI think ultimately it\u2019s the triumph of hope over experience,\u201d he said, with another cheerless laugh. :: Before he was a talk-radio titan, Charlie Sykes was a hotshot journalist and, before that, a Eugene McCarthy-loving young Democrat. He followed his father in both directions. Jay Sykes was a reporter and editorial writer at the Milwaukee Sentinel before leaving the paper to teach journalism. As the Wisconsin director for McCarthy's 1968 presidential campaign, he helped lead the anti-Vietnam War candidate to victory in the primary; 13-year-old Charlie was a volunteer. But he was no scruffy-haired radical; a 2000 Milwaukee Magazine profile describes him as \u201ca freckle-faced teenager in a button-down Oxford\u201d with hair conservatively shorn above his ears. By his 20s, Sykes had become increasingly alienated from the Democratic Party, put off by its permissive stance on abortion and the violence of the anti-war movement. His disenchantment grew as a City Hall reporter, covering what he considered costly but ultimately failed government programs. His evolution from Democrat to Reagan-era conservative is cited by skeptics who see Sykes\u2019 latest incarnation as another case of expedient rebranding. \u201cThere\u2019s a fortune to be made going out speaking to liberals and telling them how evil and awful conservatives are,\u201d said Mark Belling, Milwaukee\u2019s other major talk radio personality, who gave Sykes his start as an occasional fill-in host. (Sykes jumped to a rival station and began his own show after about a year.) However heartfelt his mea culpa, Belling said, \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that it has opened doors for him that otherwise would not have existed.\u201d Sykes doesn\u2019t disagree. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I understand why people say that.\u201d :: Regrets? Sykes has a few and as Frank Sinatra sang from the speakers overhead, he listed some. He remains devoutly conservative, so it\u2019s not as though his political philosophy changed. But he wishes he had opened his show to more divergent viewpoints, instead of feeding the preconceptions of his audience. He wishes he hadn\u2019t done so much to denigrate legitimate news sources, to the point where listeners automatically dismissed facts if they were reported by outlets such as the Washington Post or New York Times. He wishes he had done more to try to bridge the vast racial gap between Milwaukee and its suburbs, which makes this perhaps the most segregated metropolitan region in the country. He wishes he more forcefully dismissed the Trump-peddled fiction that President Obama was born in Kenya. \u201cIf I contributed to this, I got to own up to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have something this big\u2026 it\u2019s time for some serious introspection.\u201d Sykes had hoped to be somewhere far off on Inauguration Day, in the north of France, visiting family. But a book deadline disrupted those plans, and his obligation to MSNBC forced him to watch Trump\u2019s speech, painful though it was. Not in real time, however. He watched it on YouTube, peddling furiously on his exercise bike to help ease his blood pressure. Twitter: @markzbarabak ALSO ",

Legal hearings take weeks to move forward, but there likely will be test cases as dual nationals and other individuals challenge the new rules. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on Sunday on Twitter he has a bill planned for \"this week\" to put a stop to what he called a \"dangerous, hateful order,\" while New York Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to force a vote on the Senate floor to overturn the executive order Monday. Though Schumer's move failed, as he needed all 100 Senators to agree to a vote, a few cracks in party lines have emerged as a handful of Republicans broke with Trump on Sunday to speak out against the order. The most prominent Republicans to criticize the ban were longtime hawks Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said the order was \"not properly vetted.\" \"Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,\" Graham and McCain said, earning a pair of scolding tweets from the president. ...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 House Democrats on Monday also introduced the Statue of Liberty Values Act, or SOLVE, to block Trump's immigration executive order. However, this legislation will likely go nowhere as Democrats are in the minority. Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates, meanwhile, issued a letter instructing the Justice Department to \"not present arguments in defense\" of Trump's new travel ban. \"The order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions. As the Acting Attorney General, it is my ultimate responsibility to determine the position of the Department of Justice in these actions,\" Yates wrote. \"At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\" the letter continued. However, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel signed off on the policy last week \u2014 Yates in her letter notes that her role is different from that of the OLC \u2014 and DOJ lawyers did defend the policy in court over the weekend. Trump, for his part, has tried to change the conversation: He announced a new executive order on business regulations on Monday, as well as tweeting that he'd announce a Supreme Court pick on Tuesday night.

Jermaine Simmons 1828 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE TALLAHASSEE \u2014 A well-known Tallahassee pastor was forced to flee naked after a husband came home early and found him having sex with the man's\u00a0wife. The details of the Jan.17 episode outlined in a police report, combined with Pastor O. Jermaine Simmons' address to members of his Jacob Chapel congregation about the incident, have been the subject of intense social media and Internet buzz. The address, which was filmed and uploaded to YouTube by someone in the congregation, has been\u00a0seen by tens of thousands over the last week. In an\u00a0address to his members, Simmons seemed to portray the congregation and himself as the victims. Police: Woman tried to arrange daddy-daughter tryst \u201cI\u2019m hurting because I\u2019ve hurt you,\u201d Simmons said Jan. 22. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to people on the outside. I am not Tallahassee\u2019s pastor. I am not Florida\u2019s pastor. I am Jacob Chapel\u2019s pastor.\u00a0It hurts me that you have to defend my actions. You cannot defend sin,\u201d he continued to loud applause from the congregation. The scandal broke during the same week Simmons and the church were celebrating the 11th anniversary of his leadership. He was scheduled to hold a signing of his first book I Need a Man,\u00a0which, according to\u00a0his website\u2019s\u00a0description, \u201coffers a fresh perspective on the issues of godly manhood and mentoring.\u201d Simmons, who is married and has a son, is well known in Florida's capital city for addressing the physical and spiritual needs of college students and the downtrodden. He established a cold night shelter and\u00a0organizes\u00a0the annual Back to School Bash, which collects and distributes backpacks and other school supplies for hundreds of Tallahassee children. Pastor O. Jermaine Simmons of Jacob Chapel Baptist Church speaks at an event in 2015. \u00a0(Photo: Democrat files) However, his recent actions outside the pulpit have\u00a0brought him unwanted attention. According to a Tallahassee Police report, officers went to the Sienna Square apartments on Capital Circle Northeast in the middle of the afternoon of Jan. 17 after a woman called to report that her husband was angry and had a handgun after he encountered his wife and Simmons having sex in the daughter's bedroom. The man came home early after the school called him to pick up his sick son. The school had tried unsuccessfully to reach the wife. According to the woman, Simmons came over to discuss starting a business\u00a0and providing less fortunate kids with clothes and shoes,\u00a0but\u00a0they ended up in bed together. The woman told police she and Simmons began \u201cestablishing a relationship\u201d last October. After the husband interrupted the tryst, he yelled, \"I'm gonna kill him,\" and ran to the master bedroom for his handgun;\u00a0Simmons fled the apartment naked and hid behind a nearby fence. The wife then called the\u00a0police and her husband left with Simmons' clothes, wallet and car keys, which he threatened to drop off at the church. He also threatened to expose Simmons on Facebook. The wife told police her husband never threatened her and she declined to press charges. Simmons also declined to press charges.\u00a0State Attorney Jack Campbell, \"citing the interests of all involved,\" decided against prosecution. After phone negotiations with police, the husband arranged to return Simmons' belongings. The husband turned over the handgun to NAACP Tallahassee Branch President Dale Landry. \u201cMy prayers to the families involved and the church and our community,\u201c said Landry. \u201cMay God guide all our hearts and minds as we move through this period.\" Simmons, who has led the independent church since 2005,\u00a0said he won't quit. \"What I want from God, I have already received \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s his forgiveness, \" Simmons\u00a0said in his address. \"What I am asking of our members is your prayers and your forgiveness.\u201d In response, the congregation stood and applauded for several minutes.

Lynne Sladky/AP The 26-year-old man accused of opening fire at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport earlier this month pleaded not guilty to 22 counts at his arraignment in a federal court on Monday. Esteban Santiago Ruiz allegedly traveled from Alaska and started firing in the Florida airport's crowded baggage claim area. Investigators say he continued until he ran out of ammunition, then dropped his weapon and was arrested by law enforcement officers. Five people were killed and six were injured during the attack. According to the criminal complaint, Santiago told investigators that he planned the assault. \"Esteban Santiago, shackled and wearing a prison jumpsuit, stood while Magistrate Judge Barry Seltzer read all 22 counts,\" NPR's Greg Allen reports from the court in Fort Lauderdale. Here's more: \"Seltzer explained to Santiago each count, and the maximum penalty. With the combined counts, if found guilty, Santiago faces a maximum penalty of death or life in prison. Santiago told the judge he understood each of the charges against him and the penalties. His lawyer said Santiago pleaded not guilty to all charges. A date will now be set for a jury trial.\" Article continues after sponsorship Seltzer repeatedly emphasized the victims' names as he read the entire indictment aloud, according to The Associated Press. The indictment \"includes five counts of 'violence at an international airport resulting in death,' as well as numerous weapons charges for allegedly firing a Walther 9-millimeter pistol,\" The Two-Way reported .

President Trump signed an executive order Monday requiring government agencies to cut two regulations for every new one they add. (Getty Images) Joan Claybrook, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration during the Carter administration, had an immediate reaction when informed Monday of President Trump\u2019s executive order requiring that federal agencies scrap two existing regulations for every new one adopted. She burst out laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s a completely illogical way of doing things,\u201d Claybrook told me. \u201cIt\u2019s going to harm the public. People are going to die if you start eliminating safety standards.\u201d I reached out to a number of former federal regulators after Trump\u2019s order was announced. I wanted to know how such an arbitrary approach to rule-making squared with their real-world experience of keeping the public safe and monitoring businesses. Every one of them, Republican and Democrat, said Trump\u2019s approach to the highly complicated task of official oversight is reckless and irresponsible. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single regulation that has no basis in fact,\u201d said Christine Todd Whitman, head of the Environmental Protection Agency under former President George W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to find regulations that aren\u2019t important to protecting human health.\u201d She called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cmindless.\u201d In signing his order, Trump called it \u201ca big one\u201d and said his goal is \u201cthe largest-ever cut by far in terms of regulations.\u201d \u201cThere will be regulation, there will be control, but it will be a normalized control where you can open your business and expand your business very easily and that\u2019s what our country has been all about,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s order specifically requires that the cost of any new regulation be offset by eliminating existing rules with the same costs to businesses. Military regulations are excluded. Inez Tenenbaum, head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under former President Obama , said Trump doesn\u2019t seem care which regulations are abandoned, as long as there are significantly fewer rules for businesses to follow. \u201cThat\u2019s not a formula for rule-making,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a formula for just pulling things out of the air.\u201d As with many of Trump\u2019s pronouncements, details are a work in progress. But the order suggests a sweeping emphasis on deregulation affecting numerous aspects of peoples lives, from environmental protection and healthcare to banking practices and workplace safety. \u201cWhat the president is talking about is reducing public health protection,\u201d said David Michaels, who oversaw the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under Obama. Even so, he pointed out that getting rid of regulations can be just as hard as implementing new ones. It\u2019s not a matter of simply crossing out rules in some regulatory ledger book. To scrap a regulation, a federal department or agency needs to notify the public, businesses, unions and others of its intentions, explain the rationale for the move, receive comments, and undergo the horse trading that typically surrounds decisions with potentially far-reaching ramifications. This can take years. \u201cResponsible companies want regulations,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cThey want a level playing field with rules that everyone has to follow.\u201d As with his ban on travel from some predominantly Muslim countries, Trump\u2019s 2-for-1 approach to deregulation represents fulfillment of a campaign promise. His position prior to the election was that businesses are burdened by too many rules and we can easily get rid of most of them. He\u2019s said his objective is to eliminate 75% of existing regulations. That might work as a sound bite, but in reality he\u2019s tackling a highly complex, deeply nuanced process that cuts across virtually all aspects of society and commerce, with trillions of dollars in economic activity on the line. For example, Trump said Monday that he intends to \u201cdo a big number\u201d on Dodd-Frank financial regulations that have become part of the corporate DNA of financial-services companies and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . Gerald Sachs, a former senior attorney with the CFPB, said banks have spent millions figuring out how to comply with Dodd-Frank. They\u2019d have to spend just as much, he said, figuring out any significant changes to the law. \u201cHaving no regulation is just not practical,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is a race to the bottom.\u201d Trump lacks the power to demand specific changes from independent government agencies such as the CFPB and the Federal Communications Commission that operate outside the control of Cabinet secretaries. However, he can sack agency leaders under certain circumstances or use the Republican-controlled Congress to slash their budgets. \u201cThere are lots of ways presidents can take action against an agency that doesn\u2019t follow an executive order,\u201d said Lisa Heinzerling, who served as associate administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Policy under Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s very unsettling.\u201d Whitman, the former EPA administrator and New Jersey governor, told me that \u201ceveryone is scared\u201d at the agency as a result of Trump nominating Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt to take charge. Pruitt, a\u00a0strong supporter of the oil and gas industries,\u00a0has described himself as a \u201cleading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.\u201d Whitman said a likely scenario is that the EPA and other agencies will stop seeking new regulations so they can protect existing rules. \u201cI think people will go to extremes to avoid running afoul of this administration,\u201d she said. There\u2019s always room for revisiting regulations once their true impact on businesses or the public becomes known. Some might be discarded. Most simply need to be improved. Trump\u2019s 2-for-1 deal is governing by foolishness, treating the public interest like a cheesy offer on late-night TV. He might just as well offer free steak knives to the regulator who does the most cutting.

The raid in southern Yemen, conducted by the supersecret Joint Special Operations Command, was intended to capture valuable intelligence, specifically computer equipment, according to a senior U.S. military official. Three al Qaeda leaders were killed, according to U.S. officials. Contrary to earlier reporting, the senior military official said, the raid was Trump's first clandestine strike \u2014 not a holdover mission approved by President Barack Obama. The mission involved \"boots on the ground\" at an al Qaeda camp near al Bayda in south central Yemen, the official said. \"Almost everything went wrong,\" the official said. An MV-22 Osprey experienced a hard landing near the site, injuring several SEALs, one severely. The tilt-rotor aircraft had to be destroyed. A SEAL was killed during the firefight on the ground, as were some noncombatants, including females. Nawar Anwar al-Awlaki, 8, was killed in an airstrike in Yemen ordered by President Donald Trump. Yemeni media / via Twitter Defense Secretary James Mattis had to leave one of Washington's biggest annual social events, the Alfalfa Club Dinner, to deal with the repercussions, according to the official. He did not return. On Monday, he released a statement identifying the dead SEAL as Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens and said, \"Ryan gave his full measure for our nation, and in performing his duty, he upheld the noblest standard of military service.\" The senior military official said the 8-year-old girl, Nawar al-Awlaki, also known as Nora, was among the noncombatants killed in the raid, which also resulted in the death of several Yemeni women. U.S. officials said some of the women who were killed, however, were combatants and had opened fire on the SEALs as they approached the al Qaeda camp. The girl's grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, Yemen's former agriculture minister, told NBC News a different story. He identified his granddaughter as the dead girl from a photo taken at the scene of the raid but based his description on what happened at the camp on conversations with what he characterized as Yemeni sources. \"My granddaughter was staying for a while with her mother, so when the attack came, they were sitting in the house, and a bullet struck her in her neck at 2:30 past midnight. Other children in the same house were killed,\" al-Awlaki said. He said the girl died two hours after being shot. Play ",

    "text": "Email Yemeni security and tribal officials say a suspected U.S. drone strike killed two al-Qaida militants on Monday, a day after a U.S. raid killed three senior leaders of the group. They say a missile strike in the central Shabwa province hit a car used by militants coming from Bayda province, where the U.S. raid took place. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to reporters. Around 30 other Yemenis are believed to have died in the U.S. raid, including women and children. A U.S. soldier was killed and three others were wounded in the gunbattle, while another three U.S. soldiers were wounded in the \"hard landing\" of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft at a staging area in Yemen. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that U.S. officials are assessing possible civilian casualties, including women and children, but emphasized a U.S. belief that there were \"a lot of female combatants\" at what he described as preset positions, indicating that they were legitimate targets in the firefight that ensued. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said an unspecified number of the estimated 14 fighters killed in the raid were female combatants, and said reports of female civilian deaths should be taken \"with a grain of salt.\" The U.S. has been waging an air war against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula for well over a decade but has rarely engaged in ground combat in Yemen. The soldier killed in the raid was the first known U.S. combat death since President Donald Trump took office. \u2014\u2014 AP National Security Writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report. 0 Shares ",
