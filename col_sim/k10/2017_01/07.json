In a carefully worded statement that avoided more criticism of an intelligence community he has openly feuded with in recent days, Trump stopped short of saying he accepted findings shared across those agencies that Russia waged cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions to influence the election. According to a declassified version of a long-anticipated report , the intelligence community found \"Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" Trump told the New York Times on Friday, just hours ahead of the briefing, that brouhaha over the findings were part of a political \"witch hunt\" orchestrated by those hoping to undermine his victory. \"They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it's a witch hunt. They just focus on this,\" Trump he told the paper. Following the meeting, which Trump called \"constructive,\" he struck a more muted tone. \"While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee,\" he said in his statement, \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" Trump pledged to appoint a team charged with coming up with a plan within 90 days to \"to aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks\" but said that the ways in which the intelligence community works to keep the nation safe \"should not be a public discussion.\" A senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed to NBC News that the report , which was delivered to President Obama on Thursday, found Russia waged cyber intrusions against the Democratic National Committee, the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department and American corporations \u2014 though not all the attempts were successful. Senior Russians officials also celebrated Trump's victory, according to the report. Multiple media outlets reported on the contents of the report, citing senior intelligence officials, but Trump singled out NBC News on Twitter. \"I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it,\" Trump tweeted. How did NBC get \"an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?\" Who gave them this report and why? Politics! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 A spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee told NBC News on Friday they have \"not received an official request\" for an investigation from Donald Trump or his team. An aide for the Senate Intelligence Committee also says they have not received a formal request for an investigation from Trump or his team. In instances where actual top secret material is allegedly leaked by a government official, a criminal investigation is conducted by the executive branch through the FBI, not through congressional committees. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday, U.S. intelligence officials said they have no doubt Russia was behind the attacks. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the committee Thursday he stands \"more resolutely\" than ever that Russia impacted the election. \"We assess that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets,\" he told Congress. Clapper, along with CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey, briefed the president-elect at Trump Tower. Members of the president-elect's own party have sought to distance themselves from his skepticism, especially Trump's tweet citing Julian Assange's assessment that Russia did not provide his website with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton. \"Do you think there's any credibility we should attach to this individual,\" Senate Intelligence Chair John McCain asked. \"Not in my view,\" Clapper said. Senior members of Congress were briefed Friday morning and a public version of the report could be released following Trump's briefing. This is a developing story. Please refresh for details.

News-Sentinel 6:29 p.m. ET Jan. 6, 2017 x Share Allen Ho is accused of luring nuclear experts in the U.S. into providing information to allow China to develop nuclear material based on American technology. Ho is a naturalized U.S. citizen. USA TODAY NETWORK Allen Szuhsiung Ho, 66, of Wilmington, Del., was charged earlier this month with conspiracy to commit espionage and may have lured a half dozen American nuclear experts to share U.S. secrets. (Photo: Knox County (Tenn.) Sheriff's Office) KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 An engineer working as an operative for the Chinese government in a bid to use American know-how to beef up China's nuclear program pleaded guilty Friday in the first-of-its-kind prosecution in the nation. Szuhsiung \"Allen\" Ho confessed Friday in U.S. District Court in the nation's first case of nuclear espionage involving China. In a plea deal struck that Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Atchley Jr. and Ho's defense team struck, Ho is being allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge and will be sentenced under a terrorism statute dubbed the Freedom Act of 2015. The maximum sentence is 20 years. To keep that deal, Ho must tell the government everything he knows about China and its nuclear program. Chief U.S. District Judge Tom Varlan set a May 17 sentencing hearing. Ho's plea is considered key to gathering intelligence on the inner workings of China's nuclear program \u2014 both the one used to power homes and the one to make war \u2014 in a case in which the Chinese government refuses to even acknowledge the indictment of its own nuclear power company. Prosecutor: Nuclear espionage suspect owes allegiance to China Ho, his firm Energy Technology International, and Chinese nuclear power plant China General Nuclear Power were indicted in April in an alleged plot to lure nuclear experts in the United States\u00a0into providing information to allow China to develop and produce nuclear material based on American technology and below the radar of the U.S. government. It is the first such case in the nation brought under a provision of law that regulates the sharing of U.S. nuclear technology with certain countries deemed too untrustworthy to see it. Those countries include China. Although the technology is used for nuclear-power generation, the by-product of that process can be used to produce nuclear weapons. Alleged nuclear spy for China should be released, defense says The investigation began at the behest of the Tennessee Valley Authority Office of the Inspector General, which contacted the FBI with concerns about one of TVA's senior executives, engineer Ching Huey, who later admitted that Ho, and\u00a0by extension\u00a0the Chinese government, paid him to supply information about nuclear power production. He\u00a0even traveled to China on the Chinese government's dime. Huey agreed to cooperate in the probe and has since struck a plea deal. Ho is a Taiwan native who became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Atchley repeatedly insisted in court that the Chinese government had paid Ho millions for his alleged spy work. Ex-nuke manager admits Chinese paid him for secrets Ho worked for the Chinese government\u00a0and lived in China most of the time, Atchley alleged. Ho's defense team, including Knoxville lawyer Wade Davies, wrangled in plea negotiations to get Ho's position on why he was involved in the plot. They won:\u00a0The plea deal said Ho wanted to make money and was only trying to help speed up and make cheaper nuclear energy in China by using American technology and expertise.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf) 0 Shares Vice President Joe Biden told President-elect Donald Trump Thursday to \"grow up.\" Biden dismissed a Trump complaint on Twitter about how the Obama administration has handled the transition. The vice president told \"PBS NewsHour\" in an interview: \"Grow up, Donald. Grow up. It's time to be an adult.\" Biden said of Trump: \"You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have.\" The vice president also said that Trump as president will have to propose legislation that Congress and the public can then assess. He said that it'll be \"much clearer what he's for and against\" once he's in the position of governing. Biden also said it's \"dangerous\" for Trump to have publicly criticized the U.S. intelligence community over its conclusion that Russia interfered in the November election. Biden said it's \"absolutely mindless\" for a president not to have confidence in or listen to intelligence agencies. The vice president said it would be legitimate to question intelligence and ask for more detail or disagree. But he said that's different than Trump claiming he knows more than the intelligence agencies. Biden said that's like saying, \"I know more about physics than my professor.\" He says that's worrisome, but he assumes Trump's behavior will change. He said that Trump is surrounding himself with \"very smart people\" like retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, the billionaire businessman's pick for defense secretary. 0 Shares ",

(Photo: Kimihiro Hoshino, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO \u2014\u00a0WikiLeaks is taking heat for saying it wants to publish\u00a0the private information of hundreds of thousands of verified Twitter users. A Twitter account associated with the group said an online database would include such sensitive details as family relationships and finances. \"We are thinking of making an online database with all 'verified' twitter accounts & their family/job/financial/housing relationships,\" the WikiLeaks Task Force account tweeted Friday. The account then tweeted: \"We are looking for clear discrete (father/shareholding/party membership) variables that can be put into our AI software. Other suggestions?\" We are thinking of making an online database with all \"verified\" twitter accounts & their family/job/financial/housing relationships. \u2014 WikiLeaks Task Force (@WLTaskForce) January 6, 2017 Wikileaks told journalist Kevin Collier on Twitter that the organization wants to \"develop a metric to understand influence networks based on proximity graphs.\" Twitter bans the use of Twitter data for \"surveillance purposes.\" \u00a0In a statement, Twitter said: \"Posting another person's private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter rules.\" . @kevincollier No it is to develop a metric to understand influence networks based on proximity graphs. \u2014 WikiLeaks Task Force (@WLTaskForce) January 6, 2017 Twitter declined to say how many of its users have verified accounts but the Verified Twitter account \u00a0which follows verified accounts currently follows 237,000.\u00a0Verified accounts confirm the identity of the person tweeting by displaying a blue check mark. Twitter says it verifies an account when \"it is determined to be an account of public interest.\" Twitter launched the feature in 2009 after celebrities complained about people impersonating them on the social media service. Twitter users blasted the Wikileaks proposal. Wikileaks has come under fire in the past for disclosing personal information such as social security numbers in the documents it publishes. If you're verified on Twitter, Wikileaks is considering figuring out where you live and the names of your children.   Really. pic.twitter.com/xkvFcKxU1j \u2014 Scott McGrew (@ScottMcGrew) January 6, 2017 HEADS UP ",

    "text": "9 Photos An Iraqi army soldier walks across the ancient ruins of Nimrud following the recapture of the ancient town on the outskirts of Mosul from jihadists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria on Nov. 15, 2016. SAFIN HAMED/AFP/Getty Images NIMRUD, Iraq -- The giant winged bulls that once stood sentry at the nearly 3,000-year-old palace at Nimrud have been hacked to pieces . The fantastical human-headed creatures were believed to guard the king from evil, but now their stone remains are piled in the dirt, victims of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\u2019s fervor to erase history .\u00a0 New ISIS video purports to show destruction of ancient city in Iraq The militants\u2019 fanaticism devastated one of the most important archaeological sites in the Middle East. But more than a month after the militants were driven out , Nimrud is still being ravaged, its treasures disappearing, piece by piece, imperiling any chance of eventually rebuilding it, an Associated Press team found after multiple visits last month.\u00a0 With the government and military still absorbed in fighting the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) \u00a0in the nearby city of Mosul, the wreckage of the Assyrian Empire\u2019s ancient capital lies unprotected and vulnerable to looters. No one is assigned to guard the sprawling site, much less catalog the fragments of ancient reliefs, chunks of cuneiform texts, pieces of statues and other rubble after ISIS blew up nearly every structure there . Toppled stone slabs bearing a relief from the palace wall that the AP saw on one visit were gone when journalists returned. \u201cWhen I heard about Nimrud, my heart wept before my eyes did,\u201d said Hiba Hazim Hamad, an archaeology professor in Mosul who often took her students there. \u201cMy family and neighbors came to my house to pay condolences.\u201d\u00a0 Perhaps the only vigilant guardian left for the ruins is an Iraqi archaeologist, Layla Salih. She has visited it multiple times in recent weeks, photographing the destruction to document it and badgering nearby militias to take care of it. Walking with the AP across the broad dirt expanse of the ruin, she was calm, methodical and precise as she pointed out things she\u2019d seen on previous visits that were no longer in place. Still, Salih does not despair. She searches out reasons for optimism. \u201cThe good thing is the rubble is still in situ,\u201d she said. \u201cThe site is restorable.\u201d To an untrained eye, that\u2019s hard to imagine, seeing the extent of the destruction that ISIS wreaked in March 2015. Salih estimated that 60 percent of the site was irrecoverable. The site\u2019s various structures - several palaces and temples - are spread over 900 acres on a dirt plateau. A 140-foot-high ziggurat, or step pyramid, once arrested the gaze of anyone entering Nimrud. Where it stood, there is now only lumpy earth.  Just past it, in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II, walls are toppled, bricks spilled into giant piles. The palace\u2019s great courtyard is a field of cratered earth. Chunks of cuneiform writing are jammed in the dirt. Reliefs that once displayed gods and mythical creatures are reduced to random chunks showing a hand or a few feathers of a genie\u2019s wing. During a Dec. 14 assessment tour by UNESCO, a U.N. demining expert peered at a hole leading to a tomb that appeared to be intact. It might be rigged to explode, the expert said, and the UNESCO crew backed away. The militants boasted of the destruction in high-definition video propaganda, touting their campaign to purge their self-declared \u201ccaliphate\u201d of anything they deemed pagan or heretical. They dismantled the winged bulls, known as lamassu, as purposefully as any decapitation they carried out in in Mosul or the Syrian city of Raqqa . The bearded male heads of the statues are missing - likely taken to be sold on the black market as ISIS has done with other artifacts. They then wired the entire palace with explosives and blew it apart, along with the temples of Nabu and of the goddess Ishtar. It was a brutal blow to a site that gave the world a wealth of startling Mesopotamian art and deepened knowledge about the ancient Mideast.\u00a0 View Gallery A picture taken on Nov. 15, 2016, shows destruction caused by the Islamic State or Iraq and Syria at the archaeological site of Nimrud. SAFIN HAMED/AFP/Getty Images Nimrud was a capital of the Assyrians, one the ancient world\u2019s earliest and most ferocious empires. Known at the time as Kalhu, the city was the seat of power from 879-709 BC, an era when Assyrian armies expanded out across the Levant, capturing Damascus and other cities, crushing the kingdom of Israel and turning its neighbor Judah into a vassal.\u00a0 A British-Assyrian team first excavated Nimrud in 1945, then it was re-excavated in the 1950s by Max Mallowan. Though famous in his own right at the time, Mallowan is better known as the husband of Agatha Christie, who accompanied him and photographed and filmed the digs. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of the most beautiful sites in the Middle East, or at least it was,\u201d said Georgina Herrmann, a British archaeologist who worked at Nimrud with Mallowan. \u201cIt used to be covered with wildflowers. You\u2019d be there and there\u2019d be bits of ancient sculptures sticking out.\u201d Besides the reliefs and statues, archaeologists dug up hundreds of stone tablets written in cuneiform letters containing everything from treaties to temple and palace records. The tombs of queens yielded troves of gold and jewelry. Iraqi archaeologists also made a grisly find: more than 100 skeletons inside a palace well, including some with shackled hands and feet, possibly prisoners dumped in when Nimrud was sacked in 610 BC. Salih, 40, came to Nimrud a few days after ISIS fighters were driven out in early November. So far, she is the only Iraqi antiquities official to visit. Ancient Assyria is not even Salih\u2019s field; she specialized in Islamic art and architecture. But there was no one else to do it. Half of the 50-odd government archaeologists in Mosul are still trapped there under ISIS rule. She confirmed what satellite images had already shown: sometime between Sept. 1 and Nov. 4 as international forces closed in, ISIS bulldozed the ziggurat.\u00a0 ",

On his Twitter account, he said the shooter arrived in Fort Lauderdale aboard a flight with a gun in a checked bag. \"He claimed\u00a0his bag and took the gun from baggage and went into the bathroom to load it. Came out shooting people in baggage claim,\" LaMarca tweeted. A federal law enforcement official, who is not authorized to comment publicly on the case, identified the suspect as 26-year-old\u00a0Esteban Santiago.\u00a0Sen. Bill Nelson,\u00a0a Florida Democrat, said earlier that the gunman was carrying a military ID in that name. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale early Friday aboard a Delta flight that originated Thursday in Anchorage and passed through Minneapolis, the federal official said Friday. The official said the suspect apparently retrieved a handgun from his checked luggage and loaded it before launching an indiscriminate assault. In November, the suspect appeared unannounced in the FBI offices in Anchorage, complaining that the Islamic State had gained control of his mind and the terror group was urging him to fight on its behalf,the official said. The FBI conducted a background check, learning of his military record, which included service in Iraq, but found no connection to terror groups. Determining that the man apparently needed psychiatric care, the FBI alerted local law enforcement and turned him over to their custody for a medical referral.\u00a0It is not clear whether Santiago received treatment following that incident. Esteban Santiago pictured in the hospital with his newborn son in September 2016. \u00a0(Photo: (Photo: Keldy Ortiz/NorthJersey.com)) The official said Santiago worked in Anchorage in a security-related job and has a girlfriend and a child there. Santiago's aunt, Maria Ruiz, who lives in Union City, N.J., said her nephew is an Army veteran who served two years in Iraq and came back acting strangely. However, she said that he \u201cwas happy with the kid\u201d after the birth of his child last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d she said during an interview at her home Friday afternoon. Sheriff Israel\u00a0said authorities had not established a motive for the shooting and that it was too early to declare it a terrorist act. \"At this point, it looks like he acted alone,\" Israel told reporters. He called the shootings a \"horrific, horrific act.\" Florida suspect's aunt: \u2018I don't know why this happened\u2019 The melee, which erupted\u00a0around 1 p.m. EST, brought air traffic to a standstill at the heavily traveled airport. Some incoming flights were halted on the tarmac and were likely to be sent to another city without allowing\u00a0passengers to disembark, according to airport director Mark Gale. The\u00a0shooter, described\u00a0as slender, about 5-foot-7 and wearing a\u00a0blue T-shirt, did not say a word during the incident, calmly opening fire as he strolled\u00a0among passengers at a\u00a0baggage carousel in Terminal 2, which services Delta flights. Mark Lea, a witness among the passengers,\u00a0told\u00a0MSNBC the gunman was \"just randomly shooting people\" with a 9 mm pistol and only stopped after\u00a0emptying\u00a0about 3 magazines of bullets. \"He wasn't targeting anyone\u00a0particular,\" he\u00a0said. I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 Another witness,\u00a0John Schicher, told MSNBC the shooter appeared to be wearing a blue Star Wars T-shirt. A shooting victim arrives at Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., following a shooting at the Ft.

Video posted on Instagram appeared to show several people wounded in the baggage claim area of the terminal. One person appeared to be lying in a pool of blood with a head wound. Paramedics could also be seen treating a bleeding victim outside the airport. Hundreds of people stood on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called the shooting a \"senseless act of evil\" and added that he called\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump to keep him informed about the case.

    "text": "Judge denies bail for 4 suspects in Chicago torture video Published               January 06, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \u00a0 A judge denied bail Friday for the four suspects accused of beating a mentally disabled man and streaming it live on Facebook. The four appeared before Cook County Associate Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil who asked them, \"Where was your sense of decency?\" As seen in the horrifying video that appeared online this week, a young, mentally disabled white man was beaten, threatened with a knife and taunted with profanities directed at white people and President-elect Donald Trump. The suspects, who are black, face charges including hate crimes and aggravated battery. \"I find each of you a danger to yourself and society,\" Cook County Circuit Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil said, sounding baffled that the suspects who hold jobs, attend school, live with grandparents and, in one case, care for a brother in a wheelchair, could stand accused of attacking the 18-year-old victim. How, she wondered, could she agree to allow people accused of such \"terrible actions\" walk out of jail? Prosecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the victim's mother and that the beating started in a van and continued at a house. The suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt. The suspects include Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. Hill was arrested in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers. Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped. The 18-year-old victim, who is from a Chicago suburb, suffers from schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder, authorities said. The incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential election campaign that split the nation. The case heightened political tensions on social media, with some conservatives suggesting it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection. Excerpts of the video posted by Chicago media outlets show the victim with his mouth taped shut and slumped in a corner of a room. At least two assailants are seen cutting off his sweatshirt, and others taunt him off camera. The video shows a wound on the top of the man's head. One person pushes the man's head with his or her foot. A red band also appears to be around the victim's hands. He was tied up for four to five hours, authorities said. The incident began New Year's Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald's to begin what both the victim and his parents believed would be a sleepover, police said. Instead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, Detective Commander Kevin Duffin said. The victim told police what began as playful fighting escalated. A downstairs neighbor who heard noises threatened to call police. When two of the suspects left and kicked down the neighbor's door, the victim escaped. A police officer later spotted the bloodied and obviously disoriented man wandering down a street. The victim's parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The police report said the victim's mother knew the first name of her son's friend \u2014 Jordan \u2014 but wasn't clear on his last name. The report also noted that the victim \"does not like telling his parents who he's with.\" The parents later received text messages \"from persons claiming to be holding him captive,\" police said. While investigating the messages, police discovered the Facebook video. The gruesome video is just the latest sign that criminals have been \u201cemboldened\u201d to lawless acts, not just in Chicago but across the country, former Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy told Fox News. \"Unfortunately, this is becoming the new normal,\" he said on \" America's Newsroom .\" McCarthy said that despite nationwide outrage, political leaders respond to such crimes with a collective shrug, giving criminals the confidence to act again and again. \"The more outlandish the incident, we're horrified, but there's no reaction to it.\" The Windy City's former top cop stepped down in 2015 amid accusations of a cover-up over the police killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. A white police officer shot the black teenager 16 times. Police said McDonald had lunged at officers with a knife, but witnesses said that wasn't true.

    "text": "In a photo at his aunt's Union City, N.J., home, Esteban Santiago is pictured in September 2016 in a hospital with his newborn son. (Photo: Keldy Ortiz, The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record) WOODLAND PARK, N.J. \u2014 The alleged gunman who authorities say killed at least five people at the Fort Lauderdale airport Friday was an Army veteran who was born in New Jersey and a recent father who began to have problems about a month ago when a relative said he began to see things and \u201clost his mind.\u201d A federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed the suspect\u2019s name and date of birth as Esteban Santiago, born March 16, 1990. Santiago was arrested after a shooting spree that began around noon at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and left five people dead and eight people wounded, according to law enforcement officials. Santiago had served with the National Guard in Iraq and became a father in September, said his aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, who lives in Union City. She said that another member of her family had told her that he was the suspect in the Fort Lauderdale shooting. She said that her nephew had been living in Alaska, where he was able to obtain a job in security. She showed reporters a photo of Santiago at a hospital holding his newborn son in September. Staff at Providence Hospital in Anchorage confirmed that the photo was taken in their\u00a0hospital. 5 dead, 8 injured in shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport Santiago wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cDisturbed\u201d in the photo. Ruiz said that Santiago, whose mother lives in Puerto Rico, appeared happy after the birth of his son but that something happened to him about one month ago. \u201cLike a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,\u201d she said \u201cHe said he saw things.\u201d She said that he was hospitalized for two weeks, but she did not have details about his condition. Ruiz spoke to reporters at her home Friday afternoon before FBI agents showed up at her door and local authorities closed off the street near her home. \"I don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d she said during the interview. The shooting broke out around noon next to the baggage claim area at Terminal 2, which serves Delta Airlines. Witnesses said the gunman fired randomly at people gathered near a baggage carousel, reloading several times. One passenger, Mark Lea, told MSNBC the man was \"just randomly shooting people\" with a 9mm pistol without saying a word to anyone. After emptying about 3 magazines of bullets, the shooter then got down on the ground spread-eagled and waited for police to arrive. Maria Ruiz, aunt of 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, the Florida shooting suspect, talks to reporters in her apartment in Union City. \u00a0(Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com) Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., had initially identified the gunman as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago and said he was carrying a military identification card. Maria Cede\u00f1o, a Broward County resident who had just gotten off of a Delta flight from Atlanta, told The Record that she took refuge in a Terminal 2 bathroom, where she said two armed female officers from the Sheriff\u2019s\u00a0Office carrying guns and flashlights were looking around. She said FBI agents were also in the airport. \u201cThe most impactful thing is to see members of the sheriff walking around with guns and checking the bathroom right now,\u201d\u00a0Cede\u00f1o said. Hernan Rivera, uncle of 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, the Florida shooting suspect, watching news at his apartment in Union City Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com \u00a0(Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com) She said officials\u00a0were telling those in the airport to \u201cstay where you are,\u201d and to only respond to command of officers, but that some people who were in the bathroom had stepped out. She said outside the bathroom she could see people sitting along the wall on their mobile devices. Cede\u00f1o said she had heard from her daughter, who was keeping her abreast of the news, that a person from her flight may have been one of the victims of the shooting. Cede\u00f1o said she was on her way to baggage claim, but fortunately made a stop in the restroom. \u201cI could have been there in that moment,\u201d Cede\u00f1o said. ",

    "text": "Obama Says He'd Back 'Obamacare' Repeal if GOP Has Better Plan By josh lederman and catherine lucey, associated press WASHINGTON \u0097 Jan 6, 2017, 1:03 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH Donald Trump on 'Obamacare,' Election Hacking 0 Shares Email Putting pressure on Republicans, President Barack Obama pledged Friday to publicly support repealing \"Obamacare\" if Republicans come up with something better, but cast doubt on the GOP's ability to develop a viable alternative. As Republicans prepare to gut his biggest legislative achievement, Obama implored his opponents not to pursue a two-step approach where the Affordable Care Act is repealed first and replaced after \u2014 perhaps years later. He sought to lay the groundwork for Democrats to pile on Republicans for taking health care away from millions of people if the replacement never materializes. \"I am saying to every Republican right now: If you, in fact, can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what 'Obamacare' is doing, I will publicly support repealing 'Obamacare' and replacing it with your plan,\" Obama said in a live-streamed interview with online news site Vox. \"But I want to see it first.\" Obama appeared to be betting on the possibility that Republicans won't be able to unify behind an \"Obamacare\" replacement \u2014 or that if they do, it won't be one that will pass muster for Democrats. Though Republicans are in agreement that the law should be repealed and replaced, they're at odds over what the replacement should look like, and particularly over how to pay for popular elements they hope to preserve, including coverage for pre-existing conditions and the ability for parents to keep children on their plans until age 26. Most alarming to Obama and Democrats is the possibility of no replacement at all, given the fact that Republicans have been unable to settle on their own health care vision in the nearly seven years since the Affordable Care Act became law. Hoping to give themselves more time while also fulfilling campaign pledges to quickly abolish the law, Republicans are discussing a repeal that wouldn't take effect for 18 months or longer, during which they'd ostensibly agree on a replacement. \"What you don't want is a situation where they make a promise they can't keep,\" Obama said. \"I've worked on this a long time. If we had had a better way to do this, we would have done it. It would have been in my interest to do it, because I knew I was going to be judged on whether or not it worked.\" The president argued he had no \"pride of authorship\" over the law that colloquially bears his name, adding that it wasn't he who dubbed it \"Obamacare.\" He tried to dispel the notion he was trying to prevent a repeal in hopes of preserving his legacy. \"They can call it whatever they want,\" Obama said. \"They can call it Trumpcare or McConnellcare or Ryancare,\" Obama said, referring to President-elect Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan . \"If it actually works, I will be the first one to say, 'Great.'\" Signed into law in 2010, Obama's overhaul has extended insurance coverage to 20 million more people and brought the uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent, reshaping the $3 trillion-per-year health system in the process. Still, the law has failed to win broad public approval, amid persistent concerns about rising premium rates through the insurance marketplaces the law created. Republicans have set a goal to offer \"universal access,\" but their replacement may cover fewer people than Obama's overhaul. A key GOP focus is to do away with the individual mandate requirement that all Americans have insurance or pay a fine. Absent that requirement, insurers have warned it's not financially viable to force them to accept people regardless of pre-existing health issues. In his final days in office, Obama has been ramping up a public push to pressure Republicans over their repeal plans and unite Democrats behind a strategy to try to protect the law. He traveled Wednesday to Capitol Hill to strategize with Democratic lawmakers, and penned an opinion piece published Friday in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. In the article, Obama said the uncertainty of a repeal with no replacement could lead insurance companies to bail on the health care marketplaces during the phase-out years, leaving millions without insurance. He said it would set up a \"cliff\" with harmful consequences if lawmakers fail to approve a replacement in time. Yet Trump's team has said repeal is the first order of business, and leaders in Congress hope to deliver a bill voiding much of the law by late February. Although Ryan said this week that lawmakers will vote on a replacement this year as well, it's unclear how Republicans could move that quickly to replace a law that took more than a year to craft. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Lucey reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 6, 2017 4:27 AM EST CHICAGO -- A judge has denied bond for four suspects accused in the beating of a mentally disabled man broadcast live on Facebook. The four appeared before Cook County Associate Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil on Friday afternoon, when she asked them \u201cWhere was your sense of decency?\u201d Prosecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the victim\u2019s mother and that the beating started in a van and continued at a house. The suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt. The four are charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other charges. Authorities say the four black suspects assaulted the white suburban teenager, threatening him with a knife and taunting him with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. Brittany Covington, top left; Jordan Hill, bottom left; \u00a0Tesfaye Cooper, top right; Tanishia Covington, bottom right Close Chicago Police The suspects include Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington\u2019s 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. Extra security at the hearing included about a dozen sheriff\u2019s deputies. Chicago police said drug use may have played a role in the beating. Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said the video of it shows two suspects smoking cigars that authorities \u201cpresume to be blunts.\u201d Duffin says the video shows the two sisters smoking while the victim is tied up, and at the same time racial slurs and references \u201cto his mental capacity starts coming out.\u201d\u00a0 Police say the parents of the young man who was beaten received text messages while he was missing from someone claiming to be holding him captive. The victim\u2019s parents reported their 18-year-old son missing on Monday in Streamwood, a Chicago suburb.\u00a0 While investigating the messages, police discovered the Facebook video.\u00a0 The parents said they hadn\u2019t heard from their son since New Year\u2019s Eve, when they dropped him off at a McDonald\u2019s, expecting he was going to meet a friend and sleep over the friend\u2019s house. His mother told police she feared her son hadn\u2019t taken medication for a mental health disorder. Prosecutors said the victim, an 18-year-old man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder,\u00a0 according to CBS Chicago. \u00a0 The police report said the victim\u2019s mother knew the first name of her son\u2019s friend - Jordan - but wasn\u2019t clear on his last name. The report also noted that the victim \u201cdoes not like telling his parents who he\u2019s with.\u201d\u00a0 Speaking Thursday, police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said the victim was friends with suspect Hill, and the two had attended school together at one point. Duffin said Hill stole a van and picked the victim up from the McDonald\u2019s, driving him to Chicago. Duffin said Hill drove the van around Chicago for the next few days, and the the victim slept in the van. The victim thought the vehicle belonged to Hill, he said. On Tuesday, Duffin said, Hill drove to the West Side home of the Covingtons, who are sisters. The alleged assault began there and escalated from a \u201cplay fight\u201d between the victim and Hill, Duffin said.\u00a0 Excerpts of the video posted by Chicago media outlets show the victim with his mouth taped shut slumped in a corner as at least two assailants cut off his sweatshirt and others taunt him off camera. The video shows a wound on the top of the man\u2019s head, and one person pushes the man\u2019s head with his or her foot. A red band also appears to be around the victim\u2019s hands. During much of the video, the victim does not appear to make any attempt to defend himself or to escape his attackers. A second video, which surfaced on Twitter, showed the suspects grabbing the teen\u2019s head, shoving it into a toilet, and forcing him to drink, reports CBS Chicago. Duffin said the teen was bound in a corner for about four or five hours. Eventually, a downstairs neighbor called police to complain about noise. The Covington sisters became angry with the neighbor, went downstairs and kicked in her door, Duffin said. That\u2019s when the victim was able to escape. Chicago police said they found him wandering disoriented in a tank top and shorts in cold weather, bloody and beaten. Duffin said the victim was \u201ctraumatized.\u201d \u201cLet me be very clear \u2013 the acts in that video are reprehensible,\u201d Chicago Police superintendent Eddie Jones said at a Thursday press conference announcing the charges. An online fundraising effort to help the victim has pulled in more than $50,000 -- and the amount continued to climb on Friday. Two of the suspects were arrested as juveniles on armed robbery and other serious charges. Hill was arrested in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers. Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "Fort Lauderdale shooting suspect was an Iraq war veteran with delusions of being forced to fight for Islamic State Sheriff Scott Israel and other officials hold press conference The full length video of a press conference held at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport on the latest information about the shooting there early Friday afternoon. The full length video of a press conference held at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport on the latest information about the shooting there early Friday afternoon. Laura King , Nina Agrawal , Del Quentin Wilber and Alexandra Zavis Contact Reporters The young Iraq war veteran suspected of fatally shooting five people and wounding eight others at Fort Lauderdale\u2019s international airport Friday had become mentally agitated in recent weeks, family members said, despite his happiness over the birth of a son less than four months ago.\u00a0 Esteban Santiago , 26, was in custody following the attack, being questioned by local and federal law enforcement. Eyewitnesses described an eerily calm assailant who fired bursts from a semiautomatic handgun at fellow airline passengers as they clustered around a baggage carousel \u2013 and then just as calmly\u00a0tossed his weapon away and positioned himself spread-eagle on the ground, waiting for police to arrest him.\u00a0\u00a0 The country\u2019s largest mass shooting of the new year threw the busy Florida airport into chaos, with thousands of travelers and airport staff fleeing onto walkways and the tarmac as emergency responders and law enforcement officers, many\u00a0heavily armed and in tactical gear, rushed to the scene. In addition to the eight people hurt in the shooting , 37 others were injured in the chaotic aftermath, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had grounded flights around the country destined for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, but some flights that were landing when the shooting broke out shortly before 1 p.m. were stranded for hours on the tarmac with passengers aboard. Hundreds more people were trapped as security forces swept the airport. As the attack unfolded, the Transportation Safety Administration said on Twitter that there was an active shooter in the airport\u00a0and urged people inside to shelter in place. Later, television video\u00a0showed long lines of people trudging with their luggage away from the terminals or milling around outside, with most vehicles still blocked from entering the closed airport. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was following the \u201chorrific events\u201d at the airport \u2013 briefed by Republican Florida Gov.\u00a0 Rick Scott , who said he had phoned Trump rather than calling President Obama . The White House said Obama was briefed about the attack by staff. The trajectory of Santiago\u2019s life had taken him from balmy Puerto Rico to snowy Anchorage. Along the way, many troubling signs emerged. Authorities at Los Angeles International Airport said Friday they are beefing up security in the wake of a mass shooting at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cAirport Police are deploying additional resources into our terminals and an increased presence in the Central Terminal Area,\u201d LAX officials... Authorities at Los Angeles International Airport said Friday they are beefing up security in the wake of a mass shooting at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cAirport Police are deploying additional resources into our terminals and an increased presence in the Central Terminal Area,\u201d LAX officials... (Shelby Grad) A federal law enforcement official said Santiago boarded a Delta Air Lines flight in Anchorage and flew to Fort Lauderdale by way of Minneapolis. Authorities are investigating whether he got into a dispute with another passenger on the Anchorage-to-Minneapolis leg of the flight, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. After getting off the plane, the gunman retrieved his baggage and went to the bathroom, where he pulled out the gun, the official said. Unloaded firearms can be legally checked in baggage in a secure container\u00a0if declared, according to TSA regulations. Law enforcement authorities said the suspect was taken into custody without any additional shots being fired, and no other suspects have been identified. Authorities said the motive was unknown. But worrying details of the suspect\u2019s life in Alaska were beginning to emerge. George L. Piro, the special agent in charge at the FBI\u2019s Miami field office, reported that Santiago had walked into the agency\u2019s Anchorage field office in November. \u201cAt that time, he clearly stated that he did not intend to harm anyone,\u201d Piro told reporters. But the FBI agents who spoke to him were concerned about his \u201cerratic behavior\u201d and turned him over to local law enforcement, which in turn took him to a medical facility for evaluation. A federal law enforcement source said Santiago  in his visit to the FBI had complained of being forced to fight for the militant group Islamic State. He reported that his mind was being controlled by a U.S. spy agency. In January, he was arrested and charged with assault in an incident involving his girlfriend. According to the court complaint, police said he had been yelling at her through a locked bathroom door, then busted through the door, pulling it out of its frame. He then began striking her and strangling her, the woman told police, though they observed no apparent injuries. The prosecutor dismissed the case in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. Santiago was formerly a member of the Alaska Army National Guard and left the organization for \"unsatisfactory performance\" in August 2016, a National Guard spokeswoman confirmed to the Sun-Sentinel newspaper in Florida. His rank at the time was private first class. \"He is no longer a member of our organization,\" said Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, who said she could not elaborate on the reason for his discharge. \"Information on disciplinary actions [is] not releasable,'' she said. A combat engineer, Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. He was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011, according to the Alaska Army National Guard. In Union City, N.J., an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, told reporters that Santiago had been happy upon the birth of his son, but that she and family members had feared his mental state was deteriorating. She showed reporters a photo of him wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cDisturbed.\u201d \u201cLike a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,\u201d she said, according to the website NorthJersey.com. \u201cHe said he saw things.\u201d Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters the incident appeared to have been limited to the lower-level baggage claim area of Terminal 2, and there was no evidence to support earlier, unconfirmed reports of gunshots in another terminal. \u201cThere\u2019s no confirmation of any kind of gunshots anywhere at any time other than this horrific, horrific incident,\u201d Israel said. The FBI joined the investigation but said the probe was in its early stages. The suspect will face federal charges and will most likely make his first court appearance in Broward County on Monday, Piro said. He did not specify the charges, and declined to speculate about a motive, saying it was too early in the investigation. Agents have not ruled anything out, including the possibility of terrorism, he said. \"It is a long-term, very difficult, complex investigation.\" Hours after the shooting, most vehicles were still blocked from entering the closed airport, and authorities said it wasn\u2019t scheduled to open until 5 a.m. Saturday. BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

See more videos For some of those caught up in the attack, Friday was to have been the start of a voyage on one of the many cruises that depart Fort Lauderdale. Mark Lea, a 53-year-old financial adviser, had just arrived on a flight from Minnesota with his wife to catch a cruise to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. The couple collected their luggage and were about to leave the terminal when they heard three quick bursts of what they thought were firecrackers. They quickly realized, however, that a gunman had opened fire about 100 yards away. \u201cAt that point, people started frantically screaming and yelling and running for the exits,\u201d Lea said by telephone from the airport. \u201cPeople were kind of tripping over each other.\u201d He helped his wife to safety, then went back to aid others. He described the shooter as \u201cvery calm, very quiet, no emotions.\u201d The gunman, who was dressed in jeans and a blue polo shirt, was carrying what appeared to Lea to be a 9 mm handgun. He fired off a few dozen rounds near the luggage carousels, then dropped his gun to the ground and lay spread-eagle on the floor, waiting for sheriff\u2019s deputies to apprehend him, Lea said. \u201cThis whole thing took place in about 45 seconds and he was done,\u201d said Lea. Hours later, the couple was still waiting at the airport with other passengers to retrieve their luggage from the scene.\u00a0 Authorities moved passengers upstairs to the ticketing area to wait while they secured the crime scene. Travelers described huddling inside a restaurant in Terminal 2, using tables for cover, after the gunfire erupted\u00a0or ducking behind parked cars when they saw people running out the doors. Others told of surreal scenes that suddenly punctuated the tedium of a routine wait at the airport. Bruce Wagner, 55, and his husband were on their way to New York after an 11-day Caribbean cruise. They were sitting at their gate when they suddenly saw people running and screaming. The crowd stampeded for the exits, he said \u2013 but there was no way out except for the jetways for boarding planes. Alarms blared, and security officials struggled to open emergency exits leading down to the tarmac. \u201cEverybody just plowed through them, packed like sardines, shoving and pushing and screaming,\u201d Wagner said by phone, with alarms still screeching in the background. Some of those who ran outside stayed close to the terminals, but others fled as far as the runways. Authorities say a lone shooter opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale international airport, killing \"multiple\" people and wounding several others\u00a0before he was taken into custody. Finally passengers were let back inside, where people\u2019s bags and outerwear were strewn everywhere, and iPads were left still plugged in for charging in the melee. Only moments later, an apparently false alarm sent people fleeing again. \u201cIt was totally inept as far as security or any kind of safety,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt seems like nobody\u2019s had any experience or training.\u201d Josh Marsh, 24, described airline staff just one terminal over from the attack scene as being unaware of the shooting \u2013 even after he showed an agent social media reports of the shooting. \u201cNothing happened for a good 20 minutes,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cNo lockdown, no announcements, no nothing.\u201d Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was one of those caught up in the incident, tweeting that shots had been fired and \u201ceveryone was running.\u201d Shooting location at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport @latimesgraphics Shooting location at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Shooting location at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (@latimesgraphics) The Fort Lauderdale airport, about 25 miles north of Miami, is a major travel hub, with more than 70,000 people passing through daily, according to the airport. Security was stepped up at the larger Miami airport in the wake of the shooting. For some, the attack shattered a workday routine. Jayce Sisley, who lives in Fort Lauderdale and works as a flight attendant, said he was heading to the airport for work when worried friends and family began texting him about the shooting. His employer told him flights were still departing\u00a0and asked him to report for duty, but the pathway was blocked by emergency vehicles, he said, with officers waving off arriving cars. Panic spread rapidly. A traveler identified only as Ben told CBS\u2019 Miami affiliate that he was boarding a shuttle outside the terminal when he saw \u201ceveryone in a big pack just running as far as possible away from the shots.\u201d Sun-Sentinel coverage of the Florida airport shooting Open link \u201cIt was a scene of ambulances and police cars, trucks, all kinds of people with automatic weapons blocking all the exits,\u201d Sisley said. As he headed back from the airport, emergency vehicles roared past him, sirens blaring, he said. That\u2019s when the magnitude of the situation hit him. Even though he had received training for these types of incidents, Sisley said, it all\u00a0seemed unreal. \u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m worried.\u201d Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

    "text": "CBS/AP January 6, 2017, 1:19 PM Fort Lauderdale airport shooting leaves at least 5 dead Email Last Updated Jan 6, 2017 7:15 PM EST FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A gunman opened fire in the baggage claim area at the Fort Lauderdale airport Friday, killing five people and wounding eight before being taken into custody in an attack that sent panicked passengers running out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, authorities said. The gunman was identified as Esteban Santiago-Ruiz , 26, who had active-duty military identification on him and was born in New Jersey, law enforcement sources told CBS News. Esteban Santiago Law enforcement sources Federal law enforcement officials told CBS News\u2019 Jeff Pegues that Santiago-Ruiz had gotten in an argument on one leg of his flight from Alaska to Florida, and the second leg of the trip was on a Delta flight.\u00a0 The motive remains under investigation. Law enforcement officials said there is no immediate link to terrorism. FBI sources told CBS News\u2019 Pat Milton that they ran a full database check on Santiago-Ruiz, and they found no connection to terror groups. They are currently investigating the argument, sources said.\u00a0 In Nov. 2016, Santiago-Ruiz walked into an FBI office in Anchorage and claimed he was being forced to fight for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), law enforcement sources told CBS News. He also said his mind was being controlled by the CIA to watch ISIS videos, sources said. He was sent to a psychiatric hospital after police were called, sources said.\u00a0 He was also investigated as part of a child porn investigation in either 2011 or 2012, law enforcement sources told CBS News. Three weapons and a computer were seized, but no charges were filed, sources said.\u00a0 Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said it was unclear whether the military ID was the gunman\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a motive at this point,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThis could well be someone who is mentally deranged, or in fact it could be someone who had a much more sinister motive that we have to worry about every day, and that is terrorism. We can\u2019t conclude that.\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott gave a press conference at 5:15 p.m. ET and said he had reached out to President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \u201cThis is a senseless act of evil,\u201d Scott said.\u00a0 President Obama was briefed by his homeland security adviser, the White House said. In a statement from the White House, Mr. Obama \u201cextended his sincere condolence\u201d to the victims.\u00a0 A witness, Mark Lea, told CBSN the shooter appeared to be in his mid-twenties, and described it as \u201crandom shooting.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cJust shooting people that were ducked behind, underneath the chairs ... people were yelling, screaming, frantically trying to get out of any door they could, or hide under chairs, luggage to do anything they could to get out of the line of fire.\u201d Lea said the shooter was \u201ccalm as can be ... he just walked in and started shooting. He wasn\u2019t frantic, he wasn\u2019t psychotic.\u201d\u00a0 Lea said he was 50 feet away from the gunman, who was carrying a 9-mm weapon. Lea estimated that the suspect shot about 24 rounds.\u00a0 Lea said that after firing the shots, the gunman walked out of \u201cdoor 2\u201d and \u201clay spread-eagle on the floor and waited for law enforcement to arrive.\u201d\u00a0 Fort Lauderdale airport shooting witness Mark Lea recounts what he saw to CBSN, as police continue sweeping the airport terminals. He told CBS Minnesota that \u201cpeople started yelling and screaming running for any exit they could.\u201d \u201cIt sounded at first like firecrackers, and then we figured out what actually was going on. There was actually a shooter,\u201d \u00a0Lea told CBS Minnesota.\u00a0 Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport Police and Fire Department chief Jesse Davis told CBS News that Santiago-Ruiz checked in at that airport at 5:23 p.m., and said he checked a firearm into his baggage. Nothing about the check-in aroused suspicion, Davis said.\u00a0 Scores of travelers were seen milling about on the tarmac near the Delta Airlines terminal after a deadly shooting at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood I... \u201cAfter he claimed his bag, he went into the bathroom and loaded the gun and started shooting. We don\u2019t know why,\u201d LaMarca said. It is legal for airline passengers to carry guns and ammunition as long as the firearms are put in a checked bag - not in a carry-on - and are unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Guns must be declared to the airline at check-in. Air Canada said that it had no record of the suspect as a passenger or of checked guns on its flights to Fort Lauderdale. Delta did not comment if the suspect took one of their flights, but issued a statement to CBS News that the airline is cooperating with the investigation.\u00a0 \u201cSpecially trained Delta Care Team members have been activated and are traveling to Fort Lauderdale to assist families and friends of customers and employees who may have been impacted by the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport,\u201d Delta wrote in a statement.\u00a0 A man with a bleeding wound sits on a curb during a shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Jan. 6, 2017. Courtesy Maxwill Solutions The attack took place at Terminal 2, which serves Delta Air Lines and Air Canada. Israel said five people were killed and eight were wounded. Their condition was not disclosed. He said the gunman was arrested unharmed, with no law enforcement officers firing any shots, and was being questioned by the FBI. The sheriff urged people to not call 911 for information about the shooting. Facebook enabled its safety check feature so users could report their status on the social media platform. Please don't tie up 911. Call-takers have no info. If you must call, dial our non-emergency number: 954-764-4357. \u2014 Broward Sheriff (@browardsheriff) January 6, 2017 The airport suspended operations as law enforcement authorities rushed to the scene and emergency medical workers treated at least one bleeding victim on the tarmac. People spilled onto the tarmac, some carrying luggage, and some ran from both Terminals 1 and 2, hiding behind cars or anything else they could find to shield themselves. Video posted on Instagram appeared to show several people wounded in the baggage claim area of the terminal. One person appeared to be lying in a pool of blood with a head wound.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Paramedics could also be seen treating a bleeding victim outside the airport. Hundreds of people stood on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. Flights already in the air and headed for the airport were delayed or diverted, and those that had yet to take off for Fort Lauderdale were held on the ground. Nearly an hour after the sheriff\u2019s office said a suspect was in custody, people started running across the tarmac,\u00a0 CBS Miami station WFOR-TV reports . Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters there was no confirmation of any additional shooting. \u201cAt this point it looks like he acted alone,\u201d Israel said. John Schilcher told Fox News said he came up to the baggage claim and heard the first gunshot as he picked up his bag off a carousel. \u201cThe person next to me fell to the ground and then I started hearing other pops. And as this happened, other people started falling and you could hear it and smell it, and people on either side of me were going down and I just dropped to the ground,\u201d said Schilcher, who was there with his wife and mother-in-law. \u201cThe firing just went on and on,\u201d he said. He said the gunman emptied his weapon and reloaded, and \u201cit was eerily quiet.\u201d \u201cI was down on the floor, when we finally looked up there was a policeman standing over me,\u201d Schilcher said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I assumed it was safe.\u201d Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tweeted that he was at the airport when shots were fired and \u201ceveryone is running.\u201d I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017 \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Mikhail Klimentyev/AP hide caption toggle caption Mikhail Klimentyev/AP Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during his annual televised New Year's message in the Kremlin in Moscow. Mikhail Klimentyev/AP Updated 5:30 p.m. ET The intelligence report on Russia's interference in the U.S. elections concludes that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an \"influence campaign\" that aimed to help President-elect Donald Trump. \"Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,\" the public version of the report from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency states. \"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" This is the first time the U.S. government has leveled these accusations directly at Putin, as NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports . \"It's obviously a big deal to level that kind of charge at the head of state of a foreign country,\" she says. The report does not weigh in on whether this \"influence campaign\" changed the outcome of the U.S. election. Here are some of the report's key findings: Putin and the Russian Government \"aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\" The report states that Putin's motivation to discredit Clinton was at least partially personal. It says he \"publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.\" Russian intelligence \"conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election, including targets associated with both major US political parties.\" This included primary campaigns, think tanks and lobbying groups. The report asserts with \"high confidence\" that Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate \"relayed material it acquired from the [Democratic National Committee] and senior Democratic officials to Wikileaks.\" \"Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards.\" Taken together, these efforts \"represented a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations aimed at US elections.\" Article continues after sponsorship You can read the public version of the report here: On Oct. 7, the U.S. first formally accused Russia of hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee and other U.S. political organizations. \"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\" the joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Since then, intelligence officials have doubled down and expanded upon the accusations. \"We stand more resolutely on that statement,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, as NPR's Brian Naylor reported . Intelligence Chiefs 'Stand More Resolutely' Behind Finding Of Russia Election Hacking In December, the FBI threw its weight behind the CIA's assessment, as NPR's Carrie Johnson reported : \"The entire intelligence community, in fact, is now in alignment that the hacks were partly motivated to try and install Trump as president.\" President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed the assessment. Earlier Friday afternoon, he received a briefing on the intelligence report from Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey at Trump Tower in New York. In a statement, Trump called the meeting \"constructive\" and added that he has \"tremendous respect\" for the work of the intelligence community. He did not specifically blame Russia, saying it was one of a number of countries including China that are \"consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our government institutions, businesses and organizations.\" Trump also stated that the hacks had \"absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\" Remember, the report specifically states that it did not \"make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.\" It did say that the Department of Homeland Security \"assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.\" Prior to today's briefing, Trump told The New York Times he believes the continued attention on the cyberattacks is politically motivated. \"They got beaten very badly in the election. I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan,\" Trump told the Times. \"They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it's a witch hunt. They just focus on this.\" The White House announced sanctions against Russia last month in response to the cyberattacks. ",

Trump was projected to get 306 electoral votes after the popular vote, but two electors defected, giving him 304 \u2014 still more than the 270 needed to win the presidency. Two Trump electors from Texas cast their ballots instead for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Rep. Ron Paul. Hillary Clinton was supposed to receive 232 electoral votes, but five electors defected, including one from Washington state who cast a ballot for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American leader from South Dakota who has led the opposition to the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline. Four others cast their votes for former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Several House Democrats attempted to protest some of the electoral votes, though none were successful, because no U.S. senators joined the complaints. \"There is no debate. There is no debate,\" Vice President Joe Biden said repeatedly, banging his gavel over members who continued trying to speak. \"It is over,\" he said at one point, visibly frustrated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson in Tuapse in 2015. (Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AP) Team Putin-Trump vs. Team Obama-Congress-FBI-CIA? The Russia focus in Washington has made it look that way. The strange story so far: U.S. intelligence agencies have signed off on a joint report \u2014 President Obama was\u00a0briefed on it Thursday, President-elect Trump on Friday \u2014 that concludes, and details, how Russia interfered in the U.S .election by hacking. In particular, it hacked into, and Wikileaks released, embarrassing Democratic National Committee emails. The beneficiary: Trump. In retaliation, Obama expelled 35 diplomats and shuttered two Russian compounds . Senior Republican members of Congress applauded. Not Trump. He declared: \u201cIt\u2019s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things .\u201d When Russian President Putin then rejected the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s recommendation of Cold War-style tit-for-tat expulsions \u2014 even inviting American diplomats\u2019 children to a Kremlin Christmas party , saying he would wait for the Trump administration to decide what to do \u2014 Trump tweeted : \u201cI always knew he was very smart!\u201d He went on to promise he would reveal information \u201cthat\u00a0 other people don't know \u201d to cast doubt on the Russian hacking charges, but then did not.\u00a0And he\u00a0asserted Friday after his briefing\u00a0that\u00a0\"there was\u00a0 absolutely no effect \u00a0on the outcome of the election,\" though\u00a0intelligence officials have said there is\u00a0 no way to tell . All this as Sen. John McCain began\u00a0 congressional hearings into the hacking. Here\u2019s the question: Is there any way to avoid one of two very troubling outcomes? The first would be that reality and competing strong Trump and Putin personalities\u00a0morph\u00a0the bromance into vicious confrontation.\u00a0A chilling thought, given that Russian forces in Syria have thrown the war in favor of Syrian strongman Bashar Assad \u2014 whom the U.S. had insisted be removed from power \u2014 and that Putin is in Syria talks with Turkey and U.S. nemesis Iran. Just for starters. The second unhappy outcome: That the bromance flourishes, with Trump nodding, winking and lifting U.S. red lines that have\u00a0 triggered sanctions \u00a0\u2014 such as for Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea, supporting Ukraine separatists and mistreating opponents. That would send the United States\u00a0and the foundation of its foreign policy, supporting democracy, back a century. It would be, as\u00a0Foreign Policy\u00a0magazine\u00a0put it, \"making\u00a0the world\u00a0 safe for dictators .\u201d ",

The suspected gunman appeared to be shooting randomly into a crowd in a lower floor of Terminal 2 as panicked travelers took cover behind chairs \u2014 and he only stopped when his bullets ran out, according to witnesses. Multiple senior law enforcement sources identified the suspect as New Jersey born Esteban Santiago, 26, and said he had a military ID on him. The military said he had served in the Puerto Rico National Guard and was deployed to Iraq for 10 months. \"We still have people fighting for their lives in the hospital,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. Law enforcement officials told NBC News they believe Santiago flew Delta from Anchorage, Alaska and caught a connecting Delta flight from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Fort Lauderdale, where he picked up his firearm at baggage claim and began the shooting spree. Federal guidelines allow for passengers to check unloaded guns in a locked case, and also allows for ammunition to be placed in checked baggage. An injured woman is taken into Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after a shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Jan. 6, 2017. Taimy Alvarez / South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP The Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport, located about 25 miles north of Miami, tweeted the shooting occurred at a baggage claim inside Terminal 2 around 12:55 p.m. ET. \"At first we thought it was firecrackers,\" said witness Mark Lea, 53. \"Everyone started screaming and running.\" Broward Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference the shooter was apprehended without incident, no law enforcement officers fired any shots. Federal authorities declined to give details about the shooter or his weapon, and said he was being interviewed to determine a motive. Federal law enforcement officials told NBC News that Santiago was undergoing treatment for mental health problems, complaining that he was hearing voices. A few months ago, he walked into the FBI's office in Anchorage, claiming that the CIA was forcing him to join ISIS, the officials said. Officials say local police were called, and he went voluntarily to a mental health facility for treatment. Lea said the shooter made his way through baggage claim with what looked like a 9 mm firearm and emptied his entire magazine. \"People were trying to run,\" he said. \"Once he finished shooting, he walked down by Door 2, threw his gun on the ground, and laid down on the ground, spread-eagle, until the first officer came \u2014 which was probably a minute later,\" Lea told MSNBC. \"He was not shot at all, was not wounded.\" Play ",

    "text": "CBS/AP Last Updated Jan 6, 2017 11:27 AM EST ORLANDO, Fla. -- Tilikum, an orca that killed a trainer at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010 and was profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity at SeaWorld parks, has died. SeaWorld officials said Friday that Tilikum died but did not give a cause of death. In a statement to CBS News, the officials said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. A necropsy will be performed, according to the statement. Tilikum, SeaWorld's most famous orca whale, has died \u201cTilikum had, and will continue to have, a special place in the hearts of the SeaWorld family, as well as the millions of people all over the world that he inspired,\u201d SeaWorld President and CEO Joel Manby said. \u201cMy heart goes out to our team who cared for him like family.\u201d Tilikum was SeaWorld\u2019s most prolific male orca, siring 14 calves while he was at SeaWorld Orlando. He arrived at the park about 25 years ago. He was noticeable for his size at more than 22 feet and 11,800 pounds. Tilikum was born off the waters of Iceland and moved to Sealand of the Pacific in Canada after being captured. While at Sealand in 1992, Tilikum and two female orcas were responsible for the death of a part-time trainer who slipped and fell into their pool and was submerged by them. Tilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando a short time later, and Sealand later closed. In 1999, a naked man who had eluded security and sneaked into SeaWorld at night was found dead the next morning draped over Tilikum in a breeding tank in the back of Shamu Stadium. SeaWorld San Diego begins revamp of killer whale shows But it was the 2010 death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by Tilikum after a \u201cDine with Shamu\u201d show that left the biggest impact on the future of orcas at SeaWorld parks. Brancheau was interacting with Tilikum before a live audience at SeaWorld Orlando when he pulled her from a platform by her arm and held her under the water. An autopsy report said Brancheau drowned but also suffered severe trauma, including multiple fractures. SeaWorld Entertainment officials announced in March 2016 that the tourist attraction would end its orca breeding program and theatrical shows involving killer whales. The decision came six years after Brancheau\u2019s death and three years after the release of the documentary \u201cBlackfish,\u201d which chronicled Tilikum\u2019s life and Brancheau\u2019s death. Killer whale Tilikum appears during its performance in its show \u201cBelieve\u201d at SeaWorld on March 30, 2011, in Orlando, Florida. Close Gerardo Mora/Getty Images The documentary argued that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive toward humans and each other. After the documentary played at the Sundance Film Festival and aired on CNN, several entertainers pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld parks and animal rights activists increased their demonstrations outside the parks. Attendance at SeaWorld parks dipped, the company faced falling profits and Southwest Airlines ended its 25-year relationship with the theme park company. In March, SeaWorld\u2019s CEO acknowledged that the public\u2019s attitude had changed about keeping killer whales captive and that the company would end its orca breeding program. \u201cWe needed to move where society was moving,\u201d Manby said. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "U.S. intelligence report says Putin targeted presidential election to 'harm' Hillary Clinton's chances Donald Trump Evan Vucci / Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Hershey, Pa., on Dec. 15. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Hershey, Pa., on Dec. 15. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) Brian Bennett Contact Reporter Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an intelligence operation against the U.S. presidential campaign and ultimately sought to help Donald Trump win the White House , according to a new U.S. intelligence report released Friday, shortly after the president-elect appeared to dismiss its key findings. Putin both \u201caspired to help\u201d Trump in November and to \u201charm\u201d Trump\u2019s rival, Democratic nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with leaks of pilfered emails and other covert activities, the report concludes in a dramatic expansion of official U.S. accusations against the Kremlin. The report depicts the Russian operation as unprecedented, saying that an aggressive mix of digital thefts and leaks, fake news and propaganda represented \u201ca significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort\u201d against a U.S. election campaign. Moscow\u2019s goals \u201cwere to undermine public faith in the U.S.\u00a0democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,\u201d the report states. \u201cWe further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d They \u201caspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton,\u201d the report adds. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies found no evidence that hackers tampered with actual voting or with counting ballots on election day. But in a startling new assertion, it says Russian intelligence \u201cobtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards,\u201d adding that Russian spies began collecting information on equipment used in U.S. elections in early 2014. The 14 pages released offer a largely circumstantial case rather than hard evidence of Putin\u2019s direct involvement, and mostly focus on Russian propaganda efforts. But the full report remains classified, and the public portion does not include the specific intelligence. Still, the rare release of a major intelligence assessment marks a sharp escalation in what has become a bare-knuckle fight between Trump and the U.S. intelligence community, backed by President Obama, over the president-elect\u2019s repeated derision of their understanding of Russia\u2019s role. Intelligence officials had planned to declassify the key findings next week after briefing members of Congress. But the declassified summary was rushed out Friday afternoon shortly after Trump had been briefed on the full report \u2014 and had made clear he was not convinced. In a statement, Trump conflated the Russian cyberattacks with those of other countries and individuals, and said the hacking had \u201cabsolutely no effect\u201d on the election. \u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\u201d Trump said after he was briefed by four U.S. intelligence chiefs at his office in New York. Earlier Friday, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump had called the focus on election-related hacking a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d by his adversaries, who he said were embarrassed by their loss in November. The growing dispute has become a sore point for Trump\u2019s transition team and a worry for Republicans on Capitol Hill who are convinced that Moscow had a\u00a0malign role and fear Trump\u2019s presidency will get off to a shaky start. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) acknowledged the predicament Friday, noting that Russia \u201cclearly tried to meddle in our political system.\u201d But he warned that Democrats might try to use the intelligence report to undermine Trump\u2019s mandate in the White House. \u201cWe cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect\u2019s victory,\u201d Ryan said. Democrats were quick to respond. \u201cI\u2019m appalled the Russian government took the extreme step of interfering with our presidential election, particularly with the goal of tilting the playing field to increase one candidate\u2019s chance of winning,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u00a0 \u201cThe President-Elect\u2019s statement that the Russian hacking had \u2018absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election\u2019 is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,\u201d said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in a statement. The report, which Obama had requested, is a joint product of the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency . The three agencies said they had \u201chigh confidence\u201d in the findings except for the assessment that Putin had aspired to help Trump\u2019s chances. The NSA said it had \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d in that finding. In addition to stealing and dumping embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton\u2019s campaign, Russian intelligence officials also used state-funded broadcasts and\u00a0third-party intermediaries, and paid social media \u201ctrolls\u201d to spread false information and disparage Clinton, the report says. When it appeared that Clinton was likely to win, according to the report, Moscow \u201cfocused more on undercutting [her] legitimacy and crippling her presidency from the start.\u201d Putin \u201cholds a grudge\u201d against Clinton, it noted, adding, \u201cHe has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012.\u201d Officials working for the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, used an online persona known as Guccifer 2.0 and the\u00a0website DCLeaks.com to release emails, as well as to relay them to WikiLeaks. Earlier this week, Trump retweeted denials by Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of Wikileaks, that it had gotten the emails from the Russian government or its operatives. Read the U.S. intelligence report on Russian hacking Open link Trump was briefed on the evidence for more than an hour in a face-to-face meeting with Director of National Intelligence James R.\u00a0 Clapper , CIA Director\u00a0 John Brennan , FBI Director\u00a0 James B. Comey \u00a0and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command. Soon after, Trump issued a statement that called the meeting \u201cconstructive\u201d and said he had\u00a0\u201ctremendous respect\u201d for those serving in the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies.\u00a0 That marked a shift from the mocking tweets he had\u00a0issued in recent weeks, using language so demoralizing that Clapper publicly noted at a Senate hearing on Thursday that there was a difference between healthy skepticism and \u201cdisparagement.\u201d Trump said the U.S. needed\u00a0to\u00a0\u201caggressively combat and stop\u201d cyberattacks, and said he\u00a0would order a team to create a plan within the first three months of taking office. In addition, Trump said hackers tried but failed to infiltrate Republican National Committee\u00a0computers. The RNC had \u201cstrong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful,\" Trump said. He was joined at the briefing by members of his national security team: Rep. Mike\u00a0Pompeo (R-Kan.), Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director;\u00a0Reince Priebus, who will be White House chief of staff;\u00a0Michael T. Flynn, who will be national security advisor;\u00a0K.T. McFarland, his pick for deputy national security advisor;\u00a0and Tom Bossert, whom Trump has chosen for his homeland security advisor.\u00a0 Last Friday, the White House cited the intelligence when they expelled 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives, closed two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland, and expanded sanctions on Moscow.

Brancheau was killed in front of a live audience while interacting with Tilikum at SeaWorld Orlando. SeaWorld Entertainment officials announced in March 2016 that the tourist attraction would end its orca breeding program and theatrical shows involving killer whales. The decision came six years after Brancheau's death and three years after the release of the documentary, \"Blackfish,\" which chronicled Tilikum's life and Brancheau's death. Heartbreaking news. SeaWorld has announced the passing of Tilikum #RIPTilikum #Blackfish pic.twitter.com/oR8qwzsOpd \u2014 Blackfish (@blackfishmovie) January 6, 2017 Animal rights group PETA said Tilikum's death only highlights the need for ending the practice of keeping whales and other sea animals in captivity for human entertainment. \"Tilikum must be the last orca to die inside a SeaWorld amusement park,\" PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange said in a statement. \"The last generation of captive orcas will all pass eventually in light of SeaWorld's decision to discontinue breeding its orcas, and the era of keeping these great animals in captivity will actually end,\" added Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States.

    "text": "No Civil Rights Charges in Police Killing of Paralyzed Man By randall chase, associated press DOVER, Del. \u0097 Jan 6, 2017, 4:04 PM ET 0 Shares Email Four Delaware police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a black man in a wheelchair will not face criminal civil rights charges, U.S. Justice Department officials said Friday. Jeremy McDole, 28, was shot by Wilmington police in September 2015 after they responded to a 911 call about an armed man who had fired a gun. A bystander's cell phone video shows officers repeatedly telling McDole, a career criminal who was paralyzed in a 2005 shooting, to drop his weapon and raise his hands. McDole can be seen reaching for his waist area before shots erupt. Officials from the U.S. Attorney's office in Delaware, the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division and the FBI met Friday with McDole's grandmother, sisters and attorneys who have represented the family. McDole's mother, Phyllis, who is being held at the state women's prison awaiting a hearing next week on a violation of probation charge, did not participate. \"They said they left no stone unturned.... There simply wasn't enough evidence there to sustain a criminal charge,\" said attorney Thomas Neuberger. Neuberger said he's satisfied that the federal investigation was thorough, but the family is \"very disappointed.\" City of Wilmington officials agreed last month to a $1.5 million settlement with McDole's family and acknowledged that reviews of police policies will include training on de-escalation techniques. A federal judge will hold a hearing Tuesday to consider whether to approve the settlement. Authorities said that after a detailed review of police reports, law enforcement accounts, witness statements, dispatch logs, physical evidence reports, the autopsy report and an enhancement of the cell phone video, the evidence does not indicate that the four officers willfully used excessive force. Witnesses corroborated the officers' claim that McDole failed to respond to commands and continued moving his hands around his waistband when the shots were fired, authorities said in a news release. The investigation also revealed that McDole's DNA was on the grip of a handgun recovered from his waistband, and that there was gunshot residue was on his right palm and shirt sleeve, they added. \"There is insufficient evidence to disprove the corporals' claims that they shot McDole in self-defense and in defense of nearby civilians and fellow officers.... The testimonial, video and physical evidence corroborates the corporals' version of the events,\" the statement said. The Delaware attorney general's office concluded in a May report that criminal charges could not be brought against the four officers. The agency's investigation found that six officers at the scene all reported seeing a gun in McDole's pants after he was shot. Investigators determined that the same gun had been reported stolen. A detective said in a court affidavit that officers found a .38 caliber revolver with four spent casings and two live rounds in McDole's underwear. Officials also have said toxicology tests found evidence of marijuana and PCP, or \"angel dust,\" in McDole's bloodstream. The attorney general's report cited an unnamed individual who told investigators that on the morning of the shooting, he had wheeled McDole to the \"Browntown\" section of Wilmington so that McDole could get a gun and PCP-laced cigarettes. 0 Shares ",

The 18-hole golf course in Dubai bearing Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name exemplifies the questions surrounding his international business interests. Evan Vucci, AP Email Last Updated Jan 7, 2017 1:13 AM EST Top intelligence officials briefed President-elect Donald Trump Friday on Russia\u2019s hacking efforts to interfere with the U.S. election.\u00a0 Following the briefing at Trump Tower in New York, Mr. Trump released a statement on what he called a \u201cconstructive meeting and conversation\u201d saying that the cyberattacks had \u201cno effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 The president-elect said there were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but they were unsuccessful in breaching the organization. He vowed to \u201caggressively combat and stop cyberattacks\u201d as president and expressed confidence in the intelligence community.\u00a0 \u201cI had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But on Friday night, Mr. Trump tweeted that \u201cgross negligence\u201d by the DNC allowed the hacking to happen. \u00a0 Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t explicitly say whether he\u2019s convinced that Russia was behind the cyberattacks against the election. The officials who briefed him were Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey. They\u2019re preparing to point to multiple motives for Moscow\u2019s alleged meddling in their classified report, which will be presented to the public in an unclassified version. Earlier Friday, the intelligence chiefs briefed senior lawmakers Friday morning, and they briefed President Obama on Thursday. ",

Now San Diego congressman removes student painting from Capitol Hill wall after complaints it was offensive Award-winning student painting that depicted a police officer as an animal was removed from a Capitol wall by Rep. Duncan Hunter. Congressional Art Competition A painting by a student that depicted a police officer as an animal had hung on a Capitol Hill wall for months before it was removed by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) following recent complaints that it was offensive. A painting by a student that depicted a police officer as an animal had hung on a Capitol Hill wall for months before it was removed by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) following recent complaints that it was offensive. (Congressional Art Competition) Gary Warth A controversial painting that depicts police officers as animals was removed Friday from a Capitol Hill\u00a0wall by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine)\u00a0following complaints that it was offensive. Joe Kasper, chief of staff for the congressman, said Hunter personally unscrewed the painting and delivered it to the Washington office of Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who had sponsored the student competition won by the painting\u2019s creator. \u201cIt made a very strong statement today, and there\u2019s been an outpouring of support,\u201d Kasper said of his boss\u2019 action. Law enforcement agencies had called for the painting\u2019s removal, and several officers came to Hunter\u2019s office Friday to thank him, Kasper said. The Peace Officers Research Assn. of California and the Fraternal Order of Police also put out statements in support of Hunter, he said. Steven Engelhardt, a spokesman for Clay, said the congressman may make a statement next week about the issue and whether the painting would be reinstalled.

The spot where the controversial painting hung on a Capitol Hill wall. (Lisa Mascaro / Los Angeles Times) Kasper said Hunter would not take the painting down again if Clay put it back up. \u201cHe gets along really well with Lacy Clay, who\u2019s four doors down from us,\u201d Kasper\u00a0said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t anything personal. It\u2019s not about him or Hunter.\u201d The painting was part of the national Congressional Art Competition. Lawmakers sponsor the student\u00a0competition in their states, but do not select winners.\u00a0The controversial 2016 work\u00a0was created by David Pulphus, who at the time was a senior at Cardinal Ritter College Prep High School in St. Louis. Named \u201cUntitled #1,\u201d it depicts a clash between police and protesters on the street. Gun-wielding officers have\u00a0heads that resemble that of a boar, while one protester appears to be a panther or wolf, and people on the street hold signs that read \u201cHistory,\u201d \u201cJustice Now\u201d and \u201cRacism Kills.\u201d The painting was selected as the Missouri winner in\u00a0May and had hung for months in a tunnel that connects House office buildings to the U.S. Capitol. Its presence became controversial over the past two weeks when conservative bloggers wrote about it and a Fox News commentator called for its removal. Law enforcement agencies also had called for it to be taken down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it was up there in the first place,\u201d said Gary Moore, president of the Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. of San Diego County. Moore said he had no problem with Hunter taking down the painting, which he saw as not helpful following a year when many police officers had been killed in the line of duty. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not part of the solution,\u201d he said. As the controversy grew, Clay issued a statement that defended freedom of expression. \u201cI \u2026 would never attempt to approve or disapprove artistic expression,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom, not censorship.\u201d In a May news release from Clay\u2019s office, the painting was described as \u201ca colorful landscape of symbolic characters representing social injustice, the tragic events in Ferguson, Mo., and the lingering elements of inequality in modern American society.\u201d Clay\u2019s district includes Ferguson, where in 2014, riots broke out after a white officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man. Kasper said the painting was discussed Friday morning in the House Republican Conference, where several representatives said they objected to it. \u201cWhen it rises to this level of controversy, somebody should make a move to take it down,\u201d Kasper said. \u201cThe funny thing about this is, nobody was sure who had the authority to take it down, so Hunter said, \u2018I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 \u201d Hunter, who served as a Marine in Iraq, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Friday. But he previously had expressed anger over\u00a0the painting and said he wanted it removed. \u201cI\u2019m in the Marine Corps,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \u201cIf you want it done, just call us.\u201d Kasper said the painting\u2019s location was especially troubling because it was next to an entrance where police officers usually are stationed.

While the report accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering a campaign to influence the U.S. election and hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, it found that the material sent to WikiLeaks did not contain \u201cany evident forgeries.\u201d The claim that the emails may have been doctored or forged was raised by DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile in October, when she was criticized for an email that surfaced in hacked messages from Podesta\u2019s account. The report also concluded that Moscow chose WikiLeaks to distribute the information \u201cbecause of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity.\u201d While the report does not specifically mention Podesta\u2019s emails, it does say Russian intelligence agencies relayed material to WikiLeaks \u201cfrom the DNC and senior Democratic officials.\u201d Podesta was the most prominent Democratic official to be subject to a cyberattack during the campaign. The Brazile email passed on a question to campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri about the death penalty, under the subject line: \u201cFrom time to time I get questions in advance.\u201d The exchange came right before a March town hall hosted by CNN and TV One, where a similar question was asked. Yet Brazile denied receiving questions from CNN, and implies that the emails released were doctored. \"I have seen so many doctored emails. I have seen things that come from me at 2 in the morning that I don't even send,\u201d she told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, adding, \"I will not sit here and be persecuted, because your information is totally false.\u201d Brazile stood down in October as a CNN contributor over the revelation. She released a statement Friday criticizing Trump over his past statements disputing Russian involvement in the cyberattacks. \"For the first time ever, President-elect Donald Trump is not disputing the fact that Russia was behind the targeted attack on the DNC and the Clinton campaign,\u201d she said.

In 2015, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump's national security advisor, attended RT's 10th anniversary dinner in Moscow and sat at a table with Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid by RT, though he has declined to say how much. RT, the report says, collaborated with WikiLeaks as part of a Russian propaganda effort designed to discredit the United States. \"The Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\" the report says. RT's editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, he report says. \"Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become `the only Russian media company' to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to `new leaks of secret information.' RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.\" At another point, the report says, \"We assess with high confidence that the GRU (Russia's military intelligence arm) relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.\" The unclassified report does not identify who transmitted the information or how. A senior official with direct knowledge, however, told NBC News Thursday that the U.S. has identified the Russian actors who turned over stolen Democratic material to WikiLeaks. The unclassified report was released shortly after Trump was briefed behind closed doors by the heads of the major intelligence agencies. After the briefing, Trump released a statement in which he called his meeting and conversation \"constructive\" and said he had \"tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women\" of the intelligence community. Related: Trump, Intel Agencies Can't Even Agree What Day It Is He did not, however, explicitly embrace the findings of the intelligence agencies that the top levels of the Russian government interfered in the election with the hopes of hurting Hillary Clinton and, ultimately, helping him. He referred to Russia as one among several countries that might have tried to hack into the national infrastructure, but emphasized that no effect on the outcome of the election had been demonstrated. The unclassified report laid out a series of \"key judgments\" about Russian interfering and hacking that goes back as far as 2008, and goes beyond political organizations. Related: US Has Id'ed Russians Who Gave Hacked Emails to WikiLeaks Russian Celebrations A senior U.S. intelligence official with direct knowledge confirmed to NBC News that the classified version of this report, which was briefed to President-elect Trump Thursday, says that U.S. intelligence picked up senior Russian officials celebrating and congratulating one another over Donald Trump's win. The source described the intelligence about the celebration as a minor part of the overall intelligence picture. \"Highly classified intercepts illustrate Russian government planning and direction of a multifaceted campaign by Moscow to undermine the integrity of the American political system,\" the official said.

Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. \u201cThe chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee\u2019s new chairman. If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed. Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,\u201d she said in an email on Friday. At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, Mr. Trump vowed that America\u2019s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, believe me \u2014 100 percent \u2014 they don\u2019t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall.\u201d In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall. \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he wrote early Friday . Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it. In an appearance on the CNN program \u201cNew Day,\u201d Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. \u201cOf course, we have to pay the bills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the wall.\u201d But he also expressed confidence that Mr. Trump would be able to negotiate reimbursement from the Mexican government over time. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Kellyanne Conway, who will serve as a counselor to Mr. Trump in the White House, said he would keep the promises he made on the campaign trail. \u201cThe president-elect has said many times that he will build a wall and Mexico will pay for it,\u201d she said. As a candidate, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States. His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall \u2014 that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars. Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project. \u201cIf President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U.S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N.I.H. to find cures for cancer,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall. \u201cI think that\u2019s a heavy sell,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a tough sell for them.\u201d Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 American intelligence officials have concluded that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin , personally \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\u201d and turned from seeking to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Hillary Clinton to developing \u201ca clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d The conclusions were part of a declassified intelligence report, ordered by President Obama , that was released on Friday. Its main determinations were described to Mr. Trump by the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials earlier in the day, and he responded by acknowledging, for the first time, that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee \u2019s computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had no effect on the election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin, at some point last year, decided to aid his candidacy. The report, a damning and surprisingly detailed account of Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine the American electoral system and Mrs. Clinton in particular, went on to assess that Mr. Putin had \u201caspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\u201d The report described a broad campaign that included covert operations, including cyberactivities and \u201ctrolling\u201d on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia\u2019s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining \u201caccess to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,\u201d it concluded \u2014 as officials have publicly \u2014 that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8.

    "text": "Trump tells Obama's ambassadors to leave by Inauguration Day By Jennifer G. Hickey Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump is not allowing for any diplomatic dawdling. His transition team has issued a directive that all ambassadors appointed by President Obama must leave their posts by Inauguration Day, a source confirmed Friday. While it is standard for politically appointed ambassadors to step aside at the end of a presidential term, an individual with knowledge of the foreign service told\u00a0 FoxNews.com \u00a0that Trump\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to consider individual cases or exigencies\u201d appears to represent a break with protocol -- though the Obama administration appears to have done something similar.\u00a0 \u201c[The directive] in itself is not that significant. But it is more unyielding than in the past,\u201d he said. The New York Times \u00a0first reported that a State Department cable was sent to all ambassadors on Dec. 23 informing them they have to vacate their posts by Jan. 20 \u201cwithout exceptions.\u201d Ronald E. Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, told the Times that he could not \u201crecollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just, \u2018Everybody out of the pool immediately.\u2019\u201d However, Obama\u2019s transition team sent out similar guidance -- eight years ago -- telling ambassadors appointed by President George W. Bush they had to leave their posts by Inauguration Day. The Washington Post reported in December 2008 that ambassadors would not be permitted to stay on and that \u201cthe sweeping nature of the directive suggests that Obama has little interest in retaining any of Bush's ambassadorial appointees.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team has already named Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as ambassador to China and bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman to fill that role in Israel.\u00a0 Political appointees for ambassadorships under any administration are often well-connected donors or other officials who do not come from the career foreign service side. But despite the prospect of imminent vacancies at posts around the world, U.S. embassies are likely to retain leadership as deputies fill in for the short term.\u00a0 \u201cThe number twos are career foreign service officers and more than capable of stepping into the roles,\u201d said the source who spoke with FoxNews.com.\u00a0 Advertisement ",

Obama bid farewell from the White House while honoring the 2017 School Counselor of the Year, an award extended through her Reach Higher initiative to encourage post-secondary education. It was a bittersweet finale to Obama's eight years in the White House, where she stood as a champion of healthy living and opportunities for higher education.

Lauderdale shooting suspect made confused visit to FBI, said US intelligence forced him to watch ISIS videos Published               January 06, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Travelers and airport workers are evacuated out of the terminal after airport shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida, U.S., January 6, 2017.   REUTERS/Andrew Innerarity - RTX2XT74 Estaban Santiago, the 26-year-old airline passenger accused of shooting up a baggage claim area at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood airport Friday, leaving five dead and eight injured, visited the FBI Anchorage field office and told officers he was being forced to watch ISIS videos, law enforcement sources told Fox News. The visit took place last November. The sources said Santiago told agents that US intelligence had infiltrated his mind and were forcing him to watch ISIS propaganda videos. In addition, the sources told Fox that Santiago appeared agitated and incoherent during that interview, clearly indicating he was suffering from some kind of mental condition. After the contact with Santiago, the FBI called local authorities who took custody of him and brought him to a local hospital for a welfare check. Law enforcement walk outside a terminal after a shooter opened fire at a baggage carousel at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S., January 6, 2017.   REUTERS/Zachary Fagenson - RTX2XTJ5 His brother said he had been receiving psychological treatment recently, according to the Associated Press. The sources also said the November interaction with Santiago prompted the FBI to open an investigation on him that led to interviews with family members, database checks and an interagency review. The sources told Fox that the FBI found no connections to foreign terror organizations. However, he has had a series of run-ins with the law in recent years. Almost exactly a year ago, he was charged with fourth-degree assault and damage of property in Anchorage, Alaska where he lived from 2014 to 2016. One of the charges was dismissed by the local prosecutor two months later, according to records found by Foxnews.com. Details surrounding the incident were not immediately clear but authorities in Anchorage told\u00a0 the Daily Beast \u00a0it was\u00a0related to domestic violence. The case was resolved after Santiago agreed to enter an agreement of deferred prosecution. The charges were dismissed by the state prosecutor in exchange for completion of requirements. Other records show that Santiago was evicted from his apartment in February 2015 for non-payment of $435 in rent. Santiago also has a record for minor traffic infractions, including driving with a broken taillight and another incident in which he was found driving without insurance. Santiago was born in New Jersey and his family was originally from Puerto Rico--where he served in the Puerto Rico National Guard. He was in the Army Reserves prior to serving in the Alaska Army National Guard. According to reports, he was honorably discharged four months ago from his last post at Fort Greely, Arkansas, and his military rank at that time was E3 (Private First Class). He also has a concealed carry permit and had checked in his weapon prior to boarding. Santiago\u2019s aunt, who lives in Hudson County, New Jersey, spoke with a reporters from local newspaper The Record of North Jersey on Friday evening. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this happened,\u201d Maria Ruiz said to reporters at her home in Union City as FBI agents arrived. The distraught relative said that Santiago had served two years in Iraq and started acting strangely when he returned. He also became a father in the past year and she told reporters that he \u201cwas happy with the kid.\u201d It was early Friday afternoon when the mayhem first broke out at Fort Lauderdale airport. Five people were shot dead after Santiago allegedly opened fire at a baggage claim area in Terminal Two. Witness and investigators said the suspect shot some of his victims in the head without saying a word. In the ensuing panic, the TSA received two separate, unconfirmed reports of a separate active shooter, a law enforcement official close to the investigation told Fox News. However, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Friday afternoon there was no indication any additional shots were fired. Broward County Commissioner Chip La Marca posted on Facebook that Santiago was a \u201cpassenger on a Canadian flight with a checked gun. He claimed his bag and took the gun from baggage and went into the bathroom to load it. Came out shooting people in baggage claim. There were 13 total shot, 5 dead, 8 transported to hospital.\u201d Witnesses at the shooting scene told Fox News that the shooter was a slender man with dark hair, likely in his 30s and wearing a Star Wars t-shirt. It is believed that he boarded a plane in Anchorage last night and flew overnight to Fort Lauderdale. Santiago was taken into custody without incident and was unhurt. Law enforcement never fired any shots, Israel said. \"This scene is considered fluid and active.\" The sheriff said it was not clear why he chose to open fire. \"It was very surreal,\" John Schlicher, a witness, told Fox News. \"He did not say a word. \"He was shooting people that were down on the ground, too.\" Fox News' Matthew Dean contributed to this report Advertisement ",

Atmospheric rivers are key to California's rainfall. Tony Barboza , Joseph Serna and Tony Barboza Contact Reporters Public agencies across Northern California are bracing for a weekend of epic rain and snow after meeting with hydrologists from the National Weather Service who warned them that the incoming atmospheric river packs\u00a0a punch not seen in at least a decade. \u201cPeople are definitely in a state of panic right now,\u201d\u00a0said El Dorado County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Todd Hammitt.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of calls asking if we\u2019re going to be able to deal with everything. It\u2019s the general pandemonium of not knowing what\u2019s coming.\u201d Up to 12 inches of rain is expected below 8,500 feet, and massive amounts of snow \u2014\u00a0up to 6\u00a0feet \u2014 above that elevation across the Sierra Nevada. A colder storm two days behind will drop yet more heavy snow. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting heavy, heavy rain. It starts out as snow then turns to rain then turns to snow again,\u201d Hammitt said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the melt increasing waterways and all the lakes.\u201d Hammitt recalled storms in 1997 and 2005\u00a0when\u00a0\u00a0runoff overwhelmed local rivers and creeks and sent water into roads and homes,\u00a0lifting some buildings\u00a0off their foundations. \u201cWe have streams, creeks, rivers. We have lakes and ponds. Anybody near a water source could be in jeopardy depending on the severity of the storm,\u201d Hammitt said. Two sinkholes have already emerged on county roads as a result of\u00a0three stormy days earlier in the week. County residents have already filled 12,000 sandbags in preparation for the storm and another 20,000 are on the way in, Hammitt said.\u00a0 \u201cAnytime it\u2019s Mother Nature, you have to be ready,\u201d Hammitt said. Fed by a\u00a0westerly flow, the rain is forecast to continue in four counties through midmorning.\u00a0 The region is expected to be hit Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-10-year event,\u201d said Zach Tolby, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno. \u201cIt\u2019s the strongest storm we\u2019ve seen in a long time, the kind of setup we look for to get significant flooding.\u201d The atmospheric river, or \u201cPineapple Express,\u201d will be felt across much of the state this weekend, though rains will be much heavier in the north than in the south. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like buckets of water for a fairly sustained period of time,\u201d Tolby said. Wind gusts on mountain tops could top 130 mph in the Northern Sierra, which is typical, Tolby said. At lower elevations gusts could reach 30 or 40 mph, he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s an average windy day for us.\u201d Tolby said the storm is packing the same wallop as an atmospheric river that hit Northern California a decade ago that caused $300 million in damage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Angelenos may remember the 2005-06 storm because it was the first time it rained on the Rose Parade in 51 years. But Tolby, who lives in Lake Tahoe, remembers the storm differently. \u201cIt was pretty wild. I was here in 2005 and it was definitely the hardest rain I\u2019d ever seen. It didn\u2019t stop for 24 hours,\u201d he said. This weekend\u2019s storm could bring 36 straight hours of heavy rain from Mammoth Mountain to Susanville, Tolby said. Below clear blue skies Friday, people in the snow-shrouded ski town of Mammoth Lakes were gleeful about the prospect of several more feet of snow. Yet some also worried that the big, wet storm could dump so much rain and snow that it could shut down some ski runs or roads.\u00a0 In preparation, snowplows were scraping icy roadways.\u00a0 Excavators and snowblower operators stayed busy clearing and moving huge piles of snow. Some cars sat abandoned on the roadside or at gas stations, covered with thick blankets of snow from the most recent storm. Outside Kittredge Sports, store manager Terry Lucian took advantage of the clear weather to shovel away some of the mounds of snow that had built up outside the entrance. \u201cIf the storm comes in as wet as they\u2019re talking about, it\u2019ll make for a big mess,\u201d the\u00a060-year-old\u00a0said as he scooped icy snow off the entrance to the A-frame building. Lucian said recent storms definitely helped to boost business, but he worried\u00a0some skiers traveling to the area this weekend could be in for disappointment if storm conditions worsen to the point that they shut down parts of Mammoth Mountain. \u201cEverybody wants the snow, they just don\u2019t want it while they\u2019re here,\u201d the 39-year Mammoth resident said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a rough couple of days, but we need the water. So it\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d Up north, South Lake Tahoe Mayor Austin Sass urged residents to prepare for the storm. \u201cIf at all possible, get up on your roof and get off whatever snow you have on there because the moisture combined with the snow will be extremely heavy and we\u2019re worried about the integrity of your roof structure,\u201d Sass said in a Twitter message Friday. Do not go outside Sunday or Monday, he told his constituents. \u201cWhen the snow comes mixed with the rain it\u2019s going to be an absolute mess. So whatever you can do stay home and most importantly, stay safe,\u201d he said. Read the story In the mountains, the rain could pile onto the snow and trigger early snow melts, feeding extra water into watersheds already swollen from a week of rain. \u201cA combination of intense rain on saturated soils will lead to excessive runoff,\u201d the National Weather Service said in its weekend forecast. \u00a0 Paul Duginski Paul Duginski The Carson, Truckee and Susan rivers are all expected to become overwhelmed, and the nearby communities may become increasingly isolated if the deluge triggers mud flows and rock slides. Weather officials issued a flood watch from Saturday to Wednesday that covers much of\u00a0Northern California and extends\u00a0down through the Sierra to Tehachapi.\u00a0 In Mono County, authorities offered sandbags to residents in preparation for the rain. In Yosemite National Park , officials announced Friday that\u00a0the park will remain open through the wet weekend, but access to popular Yosemite Valley will be closed.\u00a0 The town of Colfax in the Sierra Nevada, known as the turnaround town, is ready. \"It's something we prepare for \u2014 it goes with the snow, hand in hand,\" said Wes Heathcock, community services director for the tiny Placer County town, which has perhaps one of the most used Interstate 80 on/off ramps in Northern California when it is a snow day. When snow conditions become too treacherous, the California Highway Patrol typically closes\u00a0Interstate 80 at Colfax, as it did Wednesday during a snowstorm that also brought a car-semi collision. Perched at an elevation of 2,400 feet, Colfax bills itself as\u00a0\"above the fog, below the snow.\" The options for stranded travelers are slim in the Old West railroad town, whose most famous mention is a passing reference in Jules Verne's \u201cAround the World in 80 Days.\u201d Even Phileas Fogg did not stop. There is a Starbucks and a single motel. \"They're welcome to spend some tax money in Colfax, but generally you'll see they'll trickle back down, try to locate hotels a little closer to the [Sacramento]\u00a0Valley,\" Heathcock said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Colfax\u00a0gears up for the die-hards, travelers who believe the solution to snow-blocked passes is to find another route to the same location. \"We all have this wonderful tool called GPS now,\" Heathcock said. From Colfax, California Highway 174 makes a long northerly loop to the narrow, hairpin turns of Highway 20, eventually depositing drivers into the thick. They hit Interstate 80 at Yuba Pass, just before Donner Summit. During Wednesday's storm, the city's public works crew joined the sheriff and California\u00a0Highway Patrol to stand along that road and ward\u00a0off drivers seeking the bypass. Wednesday's storm dropped up to 2\u00a0feet of snow in less than 24 hours in the Tahoe basin, at times coming down at more than 2\u00a0inches an hour. The Sierra Avalanche Center reported a slight improvement in backcountry conditions. The risk of avalanche was lowered to \"considerable\" even as the threat increased of historically large avalanches caused by slabs of snowpack as thick as 8\u00a0feet above a weak layer of ice laid down by a mid-December rain. Near Lake Tahoe on Thursday, two skiers were caught in an avalanche that closed a local highway. But they were not injured, officials said. Sierra residents are preparing for a third onslaught over the weekend, bringing up to 12 inches of rain below 8,500 feet, and more snow above that. A fourth storm system is forecast to roll across Northern California two days after that. After the weekend storm, another rain-making system is expected to hit Northern California on Tuesday. The storm moving through Southern California was significantly smaller than the one in the north. But it still caused problems. Rain-slicked roads were clogged with commuters after a big rig jackknifed on the eastbound 60 Freeway in East Los Angeles, forcing authorities to shut down five lanes. In Burbank, several lanes were blocked after a semi-truck jackknifed across north and southbound lanes of the 5 Freeway.\u00a0 By midmorning, firefighters\u00a0rescued a man who was stranded on\u00a0an island of branches\u00a0and brush\u00a0in the rain-swollen Los Angeles River near Fletcher Drive in Silver Lake, said\u00a0Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the\u00a0 Los Angeles Fire Department . Though the rain subsided Thursday afternoon, the problems kept coming. Crews were forced to temporarily close the northbound 710 Freeway north of the 5 Freeway to replace concrete slabs damaged by the weather, the California HIghway Patrol said.\u00a0Traffic backed up for seven miles, and the closure lasted more than four hours. For all the problems the storms may cause, it will bring more good news for California\u2019s six-year drought. Officials have said steady rain in Northern California the last few months has filled reservoirs and increased the once-anemic snowpack. They emphasize the storms won\u2019t end the drought . But if the rains keep up for spring, they could make a major dent.\u00a0 Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images A statue of a girl symbolizing Korean \"comfort women\" is unveiled last week during a ceremony in front of the Japanese Consulate in Busan, South Korea. The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images A golden statue commemorating the plight of \"comfort women\" \u2014 a euphemism for the Korean women and girls forced by the Japanese to work as sex slaves in front-line brothels during World War II \u2014 has caused a diplomatic row between Japan and South Korea. At the end of December, activists placed the golden statue of a young woman sitting in a chair in front of the Japanese Consulate in the southern city of Busan, South Korea. Local authorities initially removed the statue, citing a lack of permits, The Korea Herald reported . But after public outcry, authorities allowed the statue to be replaced and the district mayor held a press conference to apologize. Now, Japan is taking countermeasures. Speaking at a news conference Friday, Japan's chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, announced that the country is withdrawing both its ambassador to South Korea and the consul general at Busan. Suga also said Japan is pulling out of some high-profile economic talks, according to state broadcaster NHK . Article continues after sponsorship South Korea And Japan Reach Landmark Deal Over Comfort Women Calling the situation \"extremely regrettable,\" Suga said the statue is a break with the landmark deal in 2015 between the two countries over comfort women. That deal was billed \"final and irreversible,\" ostensibly smoothing over the persistent source of strain between the two countries, as we reported . It \"included an apology from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a billion yen (roughly $8.3 million) fund to support the 46 surviving Korean women.\" But some activists spoke out against the deal, as the BBC reported : \"Critics say it was reached without consultation with victims, did not contain Japan's acknowledgement of legal responsibility, and did not provide direct compensation to the victims.\" Suga also accused South Korea of violating \"the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which requires host countries to protect diplomatic missions from the impairment of their dignity,\" NHK reported. Korea's finance ministry said it \"regrets\" that Japan suspended economic talks, including those focused on a potential currency swap deal, the Korea Herald reported . \"It is desirable that the two countries continue bilateral economic and financial cooperation regardless of political and diplomatic relations,\" the ministry added. The Associated Press reported that another statue by the same artist has stood in front of Japan's embassy in Seoul since 2011, prior to the agreement. And the BBC says that \"another 37 are thought to exist in South Korea, while in Australia a similar statue has sparked a row between Korean and Japanese community groups.\" ",

    "text": "advertisement Four former employees of a Southern California nail salon last month filed a complaint against their former employers for alleged wage and hour violations. According to the complaint , Jenny Hoang, Thu Pham, Trinh Thi Tyet Truong, and Tuyet Mai Nguyen say they did not receive minimum wage and overtime compensation during their time at Tustin Nail Spa in Orange County. The complaint also alleges that the four worked long hours without meal and rest breaks. At Tustin Nail Spa, the plaintiffs were allegedly compensated based on a commission system where they received about 60 percent of what customers paid for nail services, regardless of the number of hours they worked. Their pay was further deducted for using business supplies, such as spa chairs, and absorbed discounts offered to customers, John Trang, an attorney at Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles representing the plaintiffs, told NBC News. \"Even though we smiled and seemed happy in front of customers, the truth was that we were quietly suffering,\" Hoang, a plaintiff who had worked at Tustin Nail Spa for nearly a decade, said in a statement . \"We did not fight back because we were grateful to have jobs as refugees who do not speak a lot of English, and we wanted to provide for our family and children.\" Post by NBC News . In 2013, Tustin Nail Spa was investigated by the State Labor commissioner for labor law violations, which resulted in citations of $28,000. Subsequently, the business created falsified documents to demonstrate that employees were working just 40 hours per week, Trang said. Fake paychecks were then created based off of the fake hours, though workers were actually compensated based on the number of customers they served, he added. \"Even though we smiled and seemed happy in front of customers, the truth was that we were quietly suffering.\" The plaintiffs are currently seeking damages from three sets of owners who operated the nail salon at different times from 2005 to 2015. Tustin Nail Spa is currently owned by a fourth set of owners that Trang said they are moving to include in the lawsuit. \"We believe there's some coordination among the defendants and lawyers. It makes the lawsuit more complicated because you have more people. Going after one wouldn't be helpful, you have to go after all of them,\" Trang said, arguing the business was sold multiple times to avoid liability. Federico Sayre, the attorney representing the third owners, denied the claim that his client had any association with the previous owners. \"All that ended up happening is [my client] got sued because she became the nail salon owner, so they sued her for alleged wrongdoing by the previous owners, which she clearly could've had nothing to do with because she wasn't the owner at the time,\" he told NBC News. RELATED: New York Nail Salons Ordered to Pay $2 Million in Unpaid Wages, Damages Under the ownership of Sayre's client, Michelle Ta, there was discussion of changing employees to independent contractors. However, Sayre said his client maintained them as employees after the plaintiffs expressed opposition to it. Three of the workers came to the salon demonstrating, and Sayre said his client had to call the police to have them removed. Play ",

    "text": "Email Investigators say they don't know why a couple found dead outside their still-running SUV had stopped along Interstate 4 near Daytona Beach early on New Year's Eve with their three young sons safely strapped in their car seats and watching a movie. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper found the bodies of Daniel Kelsey, 32, and his wife, Heather Kelsey, 30, about 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 31, said Sgt. Kime Montes. She said the trooper was patrolling the stretch of highway that morning and had not seen the SUV when he passed by some 30 minutes earlier. Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told The Daytona Beach News-Journal ( http://bit.ly/2iIE5OK ) on Thursday that the autopsies found no signs of trauma or foul play. He added that Daniel Kelsey tested \"presumptive positive\" for drugs and had a \"presence of weed\" in his urine. The medical examiner's office hasn't issued a cause of death because toxicology reports are pending. Chitwood said those reports may show other substances the couple may have taken. Investigators said it's unclear how the Kelsey family wound up stopping on the right paved shoulder of eastbound I-4. The hazard lights on the maroon Ford Freestyle were blinking when the trooper found it. Inside, he found the boys \u2014 Aiden, 2, Nicholas, 1, and infant Joseph \u2014 watching a movie. Chitwood said the Ormond Beach residents were traveling home from Quincy in the Florida Panhandle. Authorities said relatives of Daniel Kelsey are taking care of the children. John Harrell, spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families , told the newspaper the agency is working with local authorities. \"We're very sensitive to what these children have been through,\" Harrell said. \"That's the main priority.\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 Information from: Daytona Beach (Fla.)

Trump said repeatedly during his campaign that he wanted to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and that Mexico would pay for it. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto has said the country would not do so. Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on \" Good Morning America \" today that Trump is working with Republicans in Congress to appropriate funding to build the wall and that the administration will find a way, \"whether it's through higher tariffs or a direct check,\" to get Mexico to reimburse the U.S. for the costs. Showdown at Trump Tower as President-Elect Set to Receive Intel Briefing Trump tweeted this morning that the media are dishonest for failing to report that Mexico will pay for wall at a later date. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 Kerry also commented on Trump's discussion of policy on Twitter, telling Raddatz that he doesn't think the social media platform is an appropriate forum for discussing U.S. foreign policy. \"I don't make announcements of foreign policy by tweet, Twitter. I don't think that, you know, 140 characters allows you to adequately deal with the complexity of many of the choices that we make,\" Kerry said. He said he doesn't want to engage in back-and-forth with Trump and his team on the issue but hopes that they decide to \"move to a different way of communicating.\" Trump tweets almost daily on topics as mundane as reality television and as serious and geopolitically sensitive as tensions between China and Taiwan. After Trump won the election, he rattled diplomats and broke with U.S. policy by accepting a phone call from the president of Taiwan \u2014 which led to a formal protest by the Chinese government . Beijing claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has tread carefully by recognizing China's policy while maintaining separate relations with Taiwan. Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 0 Shares ",

(Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune) Assistant State's Attorney Erin Antonietti recounts some of the events in an attack on a special needs teen that was broadcast on Facebook Live and resulted in hate crime charges being leveled against the attackers. (Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune) Steve Schmadeke , William Lee and Robert McCoppin Contact Reporters Chicago Tribune A Cook County judge ordered no bail Friday for four people accused of broadcasting a live Facebook video of their alleged attack on a mentally disabled teen. \"I'm looking at each of you and wondering where was the sense of decency that each of you should have had?\" Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil said. \"I don't see it.\" On hearing the no-bail ruling, a relative of the victim clapped and loudly said, \"Yes!\" A short time later, Priscilla Covington , a grandmother of two sisters charged in the attack, hustled past a throng of media outside the Leighton Criminal Court Building, telling reporters, \"I didn't raise them that way.\" The racially charged video shows the four -- who are all African-American \u2014 cutting the white victim's scalp with a knife, punching and kicking him and laughing as they repeatedly forced his head into a toilet. For the first time, authorities alleged that one of the four, Jordan Hill , who knew the victim from attending the same alternative school in Aurora, first beat the victim in the back of a van after he became angry that the victim's mother was contacting him by Facebook about her son's whereabouts. Prosecutors said Hill demanded $300 from the victim's mother if she wanted her son back. Read the story It wasn't until later that the live Facebook video captured the four slapping, beating, cutting and stabbing the victim as he was bound and gagged in an apartment on Chicago's West Side, authorities alleged. Charged in the attack were Hill, 18, of Carpentersville; Tesfaye Cooper , 18, of Chicago; and sisters Brittany Covington, 18, and Tanishia Covington , 24, who lived in the apartment in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street where the bulk of the assault allegedly took place. The four were each charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to police and prosecutors. Hill also was charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, while both Covingtons were charged with residential burglary, police said. Prosecutors revealed in court that the 18-year-old victim, who lives with his parents in suburban Streamwood, has schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Four people have been charged with a hate crime in an attack on a man\u00a0with mental disabilities. The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. Meanwhile, the victim's brother-in-law said Friday that the teen has been \"struggling\" to recover after his ordeal but is safe with his family. A man who runs a Reddit site called Uplifting News started a Go Fund ME page for the victim that had raised more than $42,000 Friday from in excess of 1,500 donors, according to the fundraising web site. Razor Sheldon, of San Francisco, said he does not know the family but wanted to focus on helping the victim rather than seeking vengeance against the perpetrators. On his fundraising web page, Sheldon called the crime \"horrific\" and wrote of the victim: \"Let's prove to him that there is far more good in this world than the evil he experienced.\" Boyd said he spoke with Sheldon and Go Fund Me to verify the legitimacy of the fund and said a family member had set up another Go Fund Me campaign. He said the family is grateful for the outpouring of support but added: \"We're not asking anyone for anything. We're a little overwhelmed. We don't want to take advantage of anybody.\" Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time.

The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos Prosecutors said the victim's mother dropped him off at a McDonald's in Streamwood on Dec. 31 to meet a friend. He later asked to spend the night at the friend's place both that night and the next. But by Monday, communication from the teen stopped. Later that same day, however, the victim's brother found out on Facebook that his brother was with Hill. The mother reached out to Hill on Facebook to say she wanted her son to return home, prosecutors said. Angered by the mother's Facebook contacts, Hill, who by then had stolen a van and bought and smoked marijuana with the teen, beat the victim in the back of the van, prosecutors said. Shortly after the two arrived at the sisters' third-floor West Side apartment, Hill started to harass the victim, slapping him, prosecutors said. Armed with a knife, Hill was joined by Cooper in ordering the teen to face the wall in a corner, screaming at him and forcing him to kiss the floor and say, \"I love black people,\" prosecutors said. By Tuesday, Brittany Covington began posting the abuse live on Facebook, prosecutors said. She smoked what appeaed to be a blunt \u2014 a cigar emptied and stuffed with marijuana \u2014 while narrating some of the action. ",

(Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, Pool/Sputnik/European Pressphoto Agency) WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 The Director of National Intelligence released a 25-page declassified version of its report into alleged Russian hacking during the election campaign, concluding that the intent of the operation was to help get Donald Trump elected president. \"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\" said the report, which was the work of the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency. \"Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" The intelligence community first concluded in October that Russia was behind the hacking of emails belonging to Clinton campaign aides and the Democratic National Committee, alleging that Russia was attempting to interfere with the Democratic process\u00a0\u2014 but stopping short of suggesting that Russia was seeking any particular outcome. President Obama requested the\u00a0fuller report last month after Democratic members of Congress alleged that Russia's interference was one-sided, and had the intent of getting Trump elected. Friday's report noted that Putin and other Kremlin officials often praised Trump, who they saw as more Russia-friendly on issues like Syria and Ukraine. The report also said Moscow also saw the election of Trump \"as a way to achieve an international counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\" The report did not assess what impact the hacking had on the outcome of the presidential election, but made clear that the agencies did not believe any vote-counting systems were breached. The declassified version offers little new public evidence, and the document argued that revealing the full extent of intelligence on the hacking could jeopardize sources and methods. Indeed, much of the report is based on public press reports.\u00a0A seven-page annex to the report highlights the role that a Russian-owned television network, RT America, had in spreading Russian propaganda during the campaign. \"RT America TV, a Kremlin-financed channel operated from within the United States, has substantially expanded its repertoire of programming that highlights criticism of alleged US shortcomings in democracy and civil liberties,\" the report said. \"RT's criticism of the US election was the latest facet of its broader and longer-standing anti-US messaging likely aimed at undermining viewers' trust in US democratic procedures and undercutting US criticism of Russia's political system.\" Obama received the report Thursday, and Trump was briefed on the classified version on Friday . In a statement, Trump conceded that Russia and China \"are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee.\" He said hackers also attempted to break into Republican National Committee systems but were unsuccessful. Trump also insisted that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\" That remains a point of contention. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's conclusion that the Russian hacking had no effect \"is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense.\" \"It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying \u2013 which is true \u2013 it is another\u00a0 thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,\" said Schiff, who was breifed on the report with members of Congress Friday morning.\u00a0\"These conclusions are well-supported by the evidence and the report should put to rest any uncertainty as to Russian responsibility for this unprecedented interference in our internal affairs.\" 469 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 76 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i1ImvX NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

(Photo: Shippy Realty) WINNER, S.D. \u2014 The century-old house has five bedrooms, four bathrooms, more than 5,000 square feet \u2014 and a $137,900 price tag . In an industry were location is everything, this property is here in south-central South Dakota, where the\u00a0population just shy of 3.000. And its owner wants it sold fast. \u201cIt\u2019s a really neat house. It\u2019s been around here a long time,\u201d said listing agent Rick Shippy, who owns Shippy Realty in Winner with his wife, Lin. Shippy grew up around the two-story corner house, dubbed the Read Mansion for former owner Mabel Read. Incredible Jersey Shore kitchens you'll want \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big, house,\u201d Shippy said. \u201cPretty rare.\u201d Residential real estate priced at more than $100,000 is rare enough in Winner. Shippy estimates that five homes list\u00a0for that much each year, \u201cbut nothing with this kind of square footage.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting comments from California, Florida, all over the country. I think there were hunters that had stayed in it hunting from different states.\u201d Rick Shippy, Shippy Realty It\u2019s not just the 5,575 square feet at a price of less than $25 per square foot but the unique look of the property that is capturing attention. The Read Mansion was built in 1914, and no one really knows the story of how or why it was built here, Shippy said. But local legend includes an account of multiple houses being moved to the area and joined together. It has newer-than-100-year-old stucco exterior, a 690-square-foot basement\u00a0\u2014 larger than many Manhattan studio apartments\u00a0\u2014 an addition built in 2002, and central heat and air conditioning. For much of the 20th century, the Read family owned it then sold it to a local business owner who made some updates and upgrades to the utilities. He moved and sold it to a surgeon who turned it into a hunting lodge. After the surgeon passed away, the estate rented the home to another\u00a0doctor in the area. But it\u2019s now time to sell, Shippy said. And he has no shortage of inquiries even in the middle of winter when the temperature has stayed below freezing all day. Since going on the market Jan. 3, Shippy Realty has taken dozens of calls and watched the listing spread almost virally online, sending 22,000 hits to the company's website the first day it was up. \u201cWe\u2019re getting comments from California, Florida, all over the country,\u201d Shippy said. \u201cI think there were hunters that had stayed in it hunting from different states. People are sharing it all over the country.\u201d The home still could function as a hunting lodge, but it also is set up as a single family house, albeit a uniquely designed one. Judge: S.D. 'Monster house' must be rebuilt or moved Former owner Read\u00a0was \u201can extremely eccentric lady\u201d who likely appreciated the home\u2019s multiple parlors, winding floor plan and Italian chandeliers, Shippy said. The other day, 14 people were inside looking it over, Shippy said he told his wife to make sure all of their cars were gone later. The fireplace in this Winner, S.D., home's parlor has details dating from the early 20th century. The home was built in 1914. \u00a0(Photo: Shippy Realty) \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019d hear if anyone was in the house,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get lost in there.\u201d The house appraised at $235,000 a few years ago, Shippy said. A new owner likely will want to make improvements, but it\u2019s not in bad shape. \u201cIt needs some work. It needs maybe some new windows. There are some little things, but the house is move-in ready,\u201d he said. And while it\u2019s more than priced to sell, Shippy reminds interested parties of two things: 1. Someone has to be able to afford to operate it. 2. It\u2019s in a small town in south central South Dakota. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018Why\u2019s it so cheap?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s Winner, S.D. It\u2019s what we call supply and demand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to find anybody that wants a 5,600-square-foot home. It\u2019s double the size of most big homes in town.\u201d Even so, \u201cI\u2019ll be shocked if we don\u2019t have an offer by 5 p.m. Friday,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be sold by next Friday at that price.\u201d Follow\u00a0Jodi Schwan on Twitter:\u00a0 @jodischwan 7644 CONNECT TWEET 58 LINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i1eIqT NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

    "text": "CBS News Jan 6, 2017 12:29 PM EST House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she and other members of leadership were briefed Friday on Russian hacking in the election and she called it a \u201cstunning disclosure.\u201d Speaking to reporters at her weekly press conference, the California Democrat said House and Senate Republican and Democratic leaders, as well as the leaders of the Intelligence Committees, received a \u201cvery interesting presentation\u201d Friday. \u201cIt was really quite a stunning disclosure,\u201d Pelosi said. The briefing appeared to be focused on the report prepared by the CIA, FBI and NSA on Russian hacking and interference that was presented to President Obama on Thursday. While Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday that an unclassified version would be released to the public early next week, Pelosi said some of the report will be released to the public on Friday. \u201cWhen you see this report, you will see with confidence how the intelligence community has identified what we have seen,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi\u2019s comments came just hours before President-elect Donald Trump was to be briefed by Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director James Brennan and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers on the report at Trump Tower in New York. In an interview with The New York Times Friday morning, however, Mr. Trump called the focus on cyber attacks from Russia during the election \u201ca political witch hunt.\u201d \u201cChina, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,\u201d he said about the breach at the Office of Personnel Management. \u201cHow come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt.\u201d \u201cWith all that being said, I don\u2019t want countries to be hacking our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve hacked the White House.

Wochit The funeral procession for Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds makes its way to their gravesite at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills Friday. (Photo: Frederick M. Brown, Getty Images) Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are together again, both in a\u00a0corporeal and spiritual sense. People and TMZ reported that the mother-daughter duo, who lived next door to each other in the Hollywood Hills, were buried side by side Friday afternoon at nearby Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Fisher, who died at 60 on Dec. 27, was cremated earlier this week but according to TMZ \u00a0and\u00a0 Entertainment Tonight ,\u00a0some of her ashes were separated and placed in a coffin next to that of her 84-year-old mother, who succumbed to an apparent stroke one day after her daughter's death. In a gesture that fit perfectly with the Star Wars actress' legacy of removing the stigma around mental illness, her brother Todd carried those ashes in an urn shaped like a green-and-white\u00a0 Prozac capsule . Family gathers to mourn Carrie and Debbie at private service Their burial came one day after Thursday's private memorial service at their homes, where photographers spotted Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jamie Lee Curtis, Candice Bergen, Ed Begley Jr., Penny Marshall and Richard Dreyfuss were seen entering, in addition to Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd,\u00a0brother Todd Fisher\u00a0and half-sisters Joely and \u00a0Tricia Fisher. (Joely and Tricia\u00a0are the children of Carrie and Todd's father Eddie and his third wife, Connie Stevens.) Later Friday, New York theaters were due to dim their marquees for one minute at 7:45 p.m. ET, in Broadway's customary salute to the passing of theater luminaries. And on Saturday, HBO is set to air their documentary\u00a0 Bright Lights: Starring\u00a0Carrie Fisher\u00a0and\u00a0Debbie Reynolds (8 ET/PT). Review: Deaths of Fisher Reynolds add poignancy to HBO's 'Bright Lights' Fisher and Reynolds both made their Broadway debuts\u00a0in 1973\u00a0in the musical comedy revival of\u00a0Irene,\u00a0which earned Reynolds a Tony Award nomination.\u00a0Reynolds also appeared on Broadway in\u00a0Woman of the Year\u00a0\u00a0and the musical revue\u00a0Debbie,\u00a0and toured with\u00a0Annie Get Your Gun\u00a0and\u00a0The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Fisher wrote and most recently appeared on Broadway in her solo show\u00a0Wishful Drinking,\u00a0and also appeared in\u00a0Agnes of God. Review: Deaths of Fisher Reynolds add poignancy to HBO's 'Bright Lights' The official cause of death for Fisher, who suffered a cardiac emergency while flying from London to Los Angeles on Dec. 23, has not been established. It's not clear when that information would\u00a0be disclosed because a temporary \"security hold\" has been placed on the autopsy results, according to Ed Winter, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's office. Winter wouldn't say who ordered the security hold or why but it's not uncommon in high-profile celebrity deaths. After\u00a0Whitney Houston\u00a0was found dead in a bathtub in a Beverly Hills hotel on Feb. 11, 2012,\u00a0the Beverly Hills police placed a\u00a0 security hold \u00a0on her autopsy results, which weren't made public until that April. Houston's death was determined to have been caused by accidental drowning and heart disease brought on by longterm cocaine use. It's possible that Fisher's heart may have been damaged during the period she used drugs such as cocaine to self-medicate before accepting her bipolar disorder diagnosis. ",

The carnage occurred in the baggage claim area at Terminal 2, which was evacuated. As the gunman opened fire, people turned and ran, witnesses said. Taimy Alvarez/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP Photo A shooting victim arrives at Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Jan. 6, 2017. Joe Raedle/Getty Images People take cover outside Terminal 2 of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport after a shooting took place near the baggage claim on January 6, 2017 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Based on identification found on the suspected shooter, police believe he is a man named Esteban Santiago, according to law enforcement officials, though officials said they were checking to see if the ID card was legitimate. Santiago was formerly a combat engineer with the Alaska Army National Guard and left in August, said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. When he was discharged, he was ranked E3, or a Private First Class. The alleged shooter flew from Anchorage, Alaska, to Minneapolis before landing in Fort Lauderdale, senior officials said. He boarded the Anchorage flight last night, the officials said. He checked his gun into his baggage, a source familiar with the investigation told ABC News. TSA regulations allow guns to be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that can not be easily accessed. The traveler is required to declare the firearm or ammunition to the airline at the ticket counter and should be the only person to retain the key or combination to the lock. NorthJersey.com A man identified as Esteban Santiago is seen in a photo from 2016. Santiago worked for a security company called Signal 88 in Anchorage, the source said. In November, he showed up to the FBI's field office in Anchorage, where he espoused conspiracy theories, including one claim the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos, the source said. When the FBI interviewed him, Santiago appeared incoherent at times, the source said. Investigators suspected that mental health issues may be at play, and they referred Santiago to local law enforcement for a mental health evaluation, the source said. A spokeswoman for the Anchorage Police Department referred all questions about Santiago to the FBI. Members of Santiago's family in New Jersey are being interviewed by the FBI, two law enforcement officials briefed on the probe told ABC News. The FBI confirmed that agents are on site in Union City, New Jersey, but would not provide details on the investigation. Sources told ABC News that Santiago had received mental health treatment after the encounter with the FBI. A person who answered the phone for Signal 88 said the company has no comment and is \"currently under the advisement of federal authorities.\" Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a press conference this afternoon that at this point it appears likely the suspected gunman acted alone. The sheriff also said that the investigation is ongoing and that the scene is considered \"fluid\" and \"active.\" He added that reports of a second incident at the airport were later dismissed. Authorities received a call around 12:55 p.m. about shots fired, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said on Twitter. ABC News/ Google A shooting incident at Ft.

Our entire hallway is an enormous map of the area,\u201d Runions told ABC News\u2019 \u201c20/20.\u201d \u201cYour loved one doesn\u2019t just disappear, never to be heard from again, by choice. She didn\u2019t choose to not be here at the holidays by choice.\u201d Jessica Runions, 21, went missing Sept. 8 after leaving a gathering at a friend\u2019s house in Kansas City, Missouri. Her family says friends told them Jessica was last seen giving her boyfriend\u2019s longtime friend Kylr Yust, 28, a ride home. The Runions Family Jessica Runions was last seen giving her boyfriend's longtime friend Kylr Yust, 28, a ride home. Her boyfriend and family grew concerned when she did not come home that night and they were unable to reach her. Runions said his daughter\u2019s cellphone kept going straight to voicemail when they tried calling her. Their concerns were heightened when she didn\u2019t show up for a doctor\u2019s appointment the next day. Her mother Jamie S. Runions said Jessica had recently had her appendix removed. She and Jessica were supposed to go together to the follow-up appointment, Jamie said. Jessica, who was working as a pastry chef in the restaurant at a senior living community, had recently been promoted to a manager position. Her mother said Jessica was hoping to go to college to pursue a journalism degree. The Runions said their daughter is a hardworking, loving and family-oriented woman who has always been close with her family, especially her two younger sisters, Megan, 14, and a 5-year-old the family didn\u2019t want to be named, and wouldn\u2019t just disappear. Her mother said the daughters would text and send pictures on their family group chat every day. \u201cJessica\u2019s not a runaway girl,\u201d John Michael Runions said. \u201cJessica would reach out to her family. She loved her job, she loved her friends, she loved her family ... and there\u2019s nothing from her.\u201d Her mother and boyfriend reported Jessica missing the night of Sept. 9. Hours later, Jessica\u2019s 2012 black Chevy Equinox was found burned in a desolate, wooded area around 2 a.m. Sept. 10, police said. But she was nowhere to be found. After police found Jessica\u2019s car, they arrested Yust who was found in a small town two hours outside of Kansas City. Yust is accused of setting Jessica\u2019s car on fire and has been charged with \u201cknowingly burning\u201d a vehicle. He has not been charged in her disappearance. Yust pleaded not guilty to the charge. He is behind bars on a $50,000 cash bond. He is scheduled to go to trial on the burning charge in the fall of 2017. His attorney did not return ABC News\u2019 repeated requests for comment. Kansas City police have continued to investigate the Runions case and teamed up with Missouri Search and Rescue to conduct field searches. They have also asked for landowners and hunters to look at their trail and game cameras near the location where Jessica\u2019s car was found. John Michael Runions said he goes out to look for his daughter every day. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when we have limited information,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have started over and gone back to square one and then [we have gone] back out again and then started back at square one.\u201d KCPD Sgt. Kari Thompson stressed the importance of the public\u2019s help and coming forward with any information. \u201cOur community is family and it\u2019s important to find her,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe need those individuals who know a little bit more to have the courage to step up and let us know where Jessica is.\u201d Jessica\u2019s friends and family have also taken to social media using Facebook as a tool to share photos of Jessica, plan fundraisers and coordinate search parties every Sunday. The community response has been overwhelming, the Runions said, adding they need more help, especially with the winter weather settling in. The Runions said they will not give up searching for their daughter and answers. \u201cThis is the worst thing that could ever happen. Somebody knows something\u201d Jamie S. Runions said, \u201cI will do anything in my power to find her.\u201d 0 Shares ",

AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption AFP/Getty Images The front of the prefecture of police in Bouake, Ivory Coast, on Friday, where witnesses reported heavy weapons fire. AFP/Getty Images Officials in the West African nation of Ivory Coast say soldiers have overrun police stations and seized the country's second-largest city, Bouake. It has been six years since the West African nation emerged from a civil war, during which Bouake was the headquarters of the rebellion. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton said there were also reports of gunfire in two other cities, Daloa and Korhogo, and that it wasn't clear whether the attacks were a mutiny by current or former troops. As Ofeibea reported for NPR's Newscast unit: \"Troops reportedly seized weapons from police stations and took up positions at the entrance to Bouake. One soldier says former fighters integrated into Ivory Coast's army were demanding bonuses of $8,000 apiece \u2014 plus a house. ... \"A statement from Ivorian Defense Minister Alain-Richard Donwahi has called on soldiers to remain calm and return to their barracks, to allow, he says, for lasting solutions to the latest crisis in Ivory Coast, which has recently been burnishing its democratic credentials.\" A member of the national assembly representing Bouake, Bema Fofana, told the BBC that \"the soldiers did not appear to have a leader or spokesman, making it difficult to negotiate with them,\" the broadcaster reported , and that \"most of the soldiers were former rebels who were integrated into the army after the civil war.\" Article continues after sponsorship The BBC also reported that a resident who asked not to be identified said soldiers armed with automatic rifles \"fired at the offices of the state broadcaster in the city.\" \"They are heavily armed and parading through the city of Daloa,\" a student named Karim Sanogo told The Associated Press . \"Security forces have abandoned their posts. Everyone has returned home to seek shelter.\" Ivory Coast Struggles To Keep Economy Afloat After Terror Attack Earlier this year, a terrorist attack in a tourist city on the country's coast threatened the fragile peace sought after the civil war. In March, militants from al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb killed more than a dozen people at beach hotels, as we reported . \"This country, once an oasis of peace, security, stability and prosperity, is emerging from a devastating decade of political violence and a civil war,\" Ofeibea reported at the time. \"The economy was on the rebound.\" ",

    "text": "<p>Secretary of State John Kerry</p> Close Mark Wilson, Getty Images Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that some possible foreign policy shifts by the Trump administration would be \u201cexplosive.\u201d In an interview with CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin, Kerry was asked what would happen if the incoming administration moves the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , as Donald Trump has said he would do \u201cfairly quickly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have an explosion, an absolute explosion in the region, not just in the West Bank, and perhaps even in Israel itself, but throughout the region,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cIf all of a sudden, Jerusalem is declared to be the location of our embassy, that has issues of sovereignty, issues of law that would deem to be affected by that move and by the United States acquiescing in that move and that would have profound impact on the readiness of Jordan and Egypt to be able to be supportive and engaged with Israel as they are today.\u201d This week, a trio of Republican senators introduced legislation that could ensure a move of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by withholding certain State Department funds for embassy construction and security. Kerry also weighed in on the two-state solution and explained what would happen if the U.S. backed away from supporting that vision for Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cI think that would be extraordinarily dangerous for Israel, our friend,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThe simple reality is you cannot be unitary -- one state -- with more non-Jews than Jews and remain a democracy or a Jewish state. It\u2019s impossible. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d During the interview, Kerry also warned against abandoning the One-China policy and adopting a two-China policy. \u201cAgain, that would be absolutely explosive,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any core interest, red-line that exists with China and in China, this is as serious a one as any that I know of. You have to be very thoughtful about any other nation\u2019s core interests.\u201d He explained that every president, Republicans and Democrats alike, have lived with the understanding of a One-China policy. Meanwhile, if Mr. Trump decides to reverse U.S. sanctions against Russia, Kerry said it could have consequences. \u201cIt would depend on whether there\u2019s a quid pro quo or not. It depends whether there\u2019s some agreement on what Russia would do and how verifiable that is and what the reach of those measures would be,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cIf it were just done unilaterally, I think it would be a very unfortunate move because it would send all the wrong messages.\u201d Kerry acknowledged that the Obama administration has had some difficult disagreements with Russia, but he said they\u2019ve made some progress such as negotiating the Iranian nuclear agreement and getting all chemical weapons out of Syria in the middle of its civil war. \u201cThe bottom line is that the most disturbing thing of all is Russia\u2019s interference in the American political system and our democracy with its cyber activities,\u201d Kerry added. Kerry said if the new administration \u201cmoves carefully and bilaterally\u201d and \u201cnot unilaterally,\u201d there could be a way \u201cfor a new path to be carved out.\u201d During the interview, he also confirmed reports that the Trump transition team has ordered all politically-appointed ambassadors to be out of their jobs by Inauguration day. He said while there\u2019s a value to have \u201csome continuity,\u201d it\u2019s not the Obama administration\u2019s prerogative to interfere with that decision. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The video, which has since been taken down, appears to show the torture and taunting of a white special needs man. USA TODAY NETWORK (COMBO) This combination of pictures created on January 5, 2017 shows the mugshots released by the Chicago Police Department on January 5, 2017, of assault suspects (L-R) Tanishia Covington, Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, and Brittany Covington.  Chicago prosecutors filed hate crime and other felony charges Thursday against Covington and three others, accused of holding captive and assaulting a man with special needs in a racially charged attack broadcast live on Facebook.  / AFP PHOTO / Chicago Police Department / HO / RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE - MANDATORY CREDIT \"AFP PHOTO / Chicago Police Department\" - NO MARKETING NO ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS - DISTRIBUTED AS A SERVICE TO CLIENTS HO/AFP/Getty Images ORIG FILE ID: AFP_JM6U5 (Photo: HO, AFP/Getty Images) CHICAGO - A Cook County judge denied bail Friday for four suspects charged with the torture and beating of an 18-year-old man with mental health challenges that was broadcast on Facebook Live. Assistant State's Attorney Erin Antonietti said that two of the suspects ordered the victim, who suffered from schizophrenia and was assaulted and humiliated for hours, to say \"I love black people\" and \"f--- Trump.\" The suspects also repeatedly beat the teen and two of the suspects shoved his head into a toilet and made him drink from it, prosecutors said \u201cWhere was your sense of decency?\u201d asked Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil before rejecting the suspects plea for a reasonable bail. The Cook County prosecutors office charged Jordan Hill, 18, of Chicago; Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Cicero, Ill.; and sisters Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24, of Chicago, with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and residential burglary in the alleged torture and kidnapping of the special-needs teen. Prosecutors cited both the victim's race - he is white - and disability as why\u00a0he was targeted by the suspects. Those factors allowed authorities to charge the suspects with a hate crime. Hill also was charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. Antonietti said that victim and Hill knew each other after attending the same alternative high school in suburban Chicago. The victim's mother dropped him off on Dec. 31 at a McDonald's in suburban Streamwood, so he could meet a friend who\u00a0turned out to be Hill. Chicago Facebook Live beating suspects charged with hate crimes After leaving McDonald's, Hill, the victim and a third unidentified person went to buy and smoke marijuana, authorities said. The teen contacted his mother on that day and again on New Year's Day to tell her he wanted to spend the night at his friend Jordan's\u00a0home. But the victim's family said they stopped hearing from the victim on Monday and were concerned, prosecutors said. The victim's brother was able to figure out by logging on the victim's\u00a0Facebook page that he was with Hill. The victim's mother reached out to Hill through Facebook and requested he put her in contact with her son, who investigators later learned had driven to the West Side of Chicago with Hill and a second unidentified individual in a stolen van. At some point, Hill had become angry that the victim's mother had contacted him, and beat the victim in the back of the van. He also took the victim's cell phone and SIM card and then took him to him to the apartment on the city's West Side, where Brittany and Tanishia Covington lived. \"Defendant Hill and the victim entered the third floor apartment where they were met by defendant Cooper, defendant Britannia Covington and defendant Tanishia Covington,\" Antonietti said. \"Hill and Cooper ordered the victim into a corner and to face the wall. Defendants Hill and Cooper yelled and screamed at the victim while Hill was armed with a knife. The victim was made to say 'I love black people,' and 'F--- Trump.'\" Facebook assault further tarnishes Chicago The two teens continued to mock and beat the teen, and would force him to drink toilet water. Brittany Covington began livestreaming the assault on Facebook, in which all four can be heard or seen taunting\u00a0and beating the victim. During the nearly 30 minute Facebook Live post, which went viral, Hill used a knife to cut a chunk of the victims hair, causing his head to bleed. Hill also stabbed the victim in his left forearm, prosecutors said. All four suspects allegedly beat the victim and used knives to cut his clothes.\u00a0The video also shows the victim with duct tape around his mouth and belts tied around his arms, while the assailants can be heard\u00a0speaking disparagingly of the president-elect and white people. During the course of the attack, \u00a0Hill also contacted the victim's mother and demanded $300 ransom in exchange for her son. Police said a downstairs neighbor threatened to report the suspects over the noise. The suspects were angered by the threat, and went downstairs to threaten the neighbors, giving the victim a chance to escape. \"Both the female defendants and Cooper chased the witnesses back down into their second floor apartment after Hill threatened he was going to come back with a gun,\" Antonietti said. \"Defendant Cooper kicked in the door of the second floor unit and he and and the two females entered the...apartment\u00a0while the witnesses ran out the back door and went to the first floor neighbors to call 911.\" The bloodied and battered victim was spotted by police Tuesday afternoon walking along a sidewalk in cold weather wearing only sandals, shorts and a tank top turned inside out and backward. The victim has since been reunited with his family. After the judge denied the four suspects bail, Priscilla Covington, the grandmother of the two sisters charged in the attack, expressed anguish as she left the courthouse. \"I didn't raise them that way,\" she told reporters.

The body of Savyon Zabar, 54, was discovered Wednesday morning by a roommate in an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, police said, classifying the death a homicide today. Investigators said there was no forced entry into the apartment and nothing appeared to have been taken. Detectives were seen entering the apartment today. Man Linked to Famed NYC Jeweler Suspected of Murder Zabar was the victim of another crime in April 2016, when two men robbed him as he entered his apartment, according to authorities. The men made off with Zabar\u2019s vehicle and more than $3,000 in cash. Known by his friends as Big Ben, he was an openly gay \u201cicon in NYC nightlife,\u201d according to a GoFundMe page set up in his memory. An autopsy showed hemorrhaging consistent with strangulation, police said. Editor\u2019s note: The original version of this story incorrectly stated that Savyon Zabar was the son of an executive at Zabar\u2019s, a gourmet grocery store on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. The general manager at Zabar\u2019s told ABC News he was not aware of a connection with the grocery store family. 0 Shares ",

The video shows the man with his mouth taped shut as a woman and other people cut off his shirt and hair with a knife, and someone pushes his head with his or her foot. This image from a video that was broadcast live on Facebook shows a frame in which a man, right, is assaulted in Chicago. The video shows the man with his mouth taped shut as a woman and other people cut off his shirt and hair with a knife, and someone pushes his head with his or her foot. (AP) Tribune news services Contact Reporter The horrific beating of a mentally disabled white man in Chicago by four black assailants broadcast on social media is highlighting anti-white hate crimes at a time of increased racial strife in the United States. But federal statistics and experts say anti-white incidents remain a smaller percentage of overall hate crimes. Anti-black hate crimes are still the largest number of cases. According to the 2015 FBI hate crime statistics, the latest available, there were 613 anti-white-related crimes out of 5,850 total cases. That's around 10.5 percent of all reported hate crimes, and within the yearly average, federal numbers show. By comparison, the FBI reports there were 1,745 anti-black hate crimes or about 30 percent of all reported incidents. Jews were the most targeted religious group that year and were victims of 11 percent of all hate crimes. (Steve Schmadeke, William Lee and Robert McCoppin) That data also suggested that blacks and Jews remain disproportionally targets of hate crimes compared to their population as opposed to whites. African-Americans are only 13 percent of the U.S. population, while non-Hispanic whites are 61 percent. The FBI defines a hate crime as a \"criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.\" Filing reports for the federal count is voluntary, but guidelines call for reports to be submitted even if they list zero hate crimes. Even then, experts say the FBI data on hate crimes isn't a full picture since anti-black cases are skewed lower by the lack of reporting participation by some southern law enforcement agencies. Some large Florida cities, like Miami, reported no hate crimes to the FBI in 2015, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University. \"I doubt that cities as diverse as those had no hate crimes,\" he said. Black Lives Matter movement. Shown... A depraved attack on a mentally disabled white teen broadcast live on Facebook allegedly by four black Chicago-area residents became a national rallying cry Thursday for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame for the attack \u2014 without evidence \u2014 on the Black Lives Matter movement. Shown... (Kim Janssen) In Chicago, two men and two women \u2014 all black \u2014 are facing hate crime charges in connection with the brutal beating of a mentally disabled white man that was streamed on Facebook Live. The video shows the victim is tied up and the suspects are making racial slurs and references to his mental capacity, Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said. The suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt. The 18-year-old victim, who is from a Chicago suburb, suffers from schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder, authorities said. The victim also was taunted with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. Eighteen-year-olds Brittany Covington , Tesfaye Cooper and Jordan Hill, and 24-year-old Tanishia Covington also face kidnapping and battery charges in connection with the attack. Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos The case heightened political tensions on social media and opened yet-to-be healed wounds from a nasty presidential election campaign. Some conservatives suggested the attack highlighted growing anti-white violence and was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, although police said there was no indication of any connection. The FBI does classify attacks based on disability as a hate crime. Federal numbers show 88 incidents related to attacks on disability in 2015. In addition to underreporting, Levin said strong federal data of the race and ethnicity of assailants is incomplete because of the lack of consistent reporting. The 2015 FBI data showed that of the 734 total reported offenses committed against whites \u2014 a single incident could have multiple offenses like assault or theft \u2014 46 percent of those were committed by blacks. In contrast, of the 2,125 reported offenses committed against blacks, 58 percent of those who committed by whites. Still, despite the data, Levin said the Chicago beating is resonating because it was shown via social media and racial relations are tense following the November election. Live streams and 140 Twitter characters inflame the fires. Levin described the situation as \"a logjam of motivations\" for conflict, saying it's like nothing he's ever seen. \"We are seeing the coarseness that exists in society generally, those embers, have crossed the fire lines to all parts of the racial, ethnic and ideological spectrum,\" Levin said.

The killer whale died early this morning \"surrounded by the trainers, care staff and veterinarians that provided him around-the-clock world-class care,\" SeaWorld said in a statement on its website. SeaWorld veterinarians had been treating the whale for \"a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection,\" but the cause of death will not be officially determined until a necropsy is performed, the theme park wrote. SeaWorld Controversy: Park Approved for Larger Tanks but Can't Breed Whales Tilikum was estimated to be about 36 years old when he died. He was \"near the high end of the average life expectancy for male killer whales , according to an independent scientific review,\" SeaWorld said. The orca arrived at the park 25 years ago and has been connected to the deaths of three people there. The most prominent of those was in 2010, when Tilikum \u2014 12,000 pounds and 22 feet long \u2014 pulled SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau into the water and killed her. The 2013 documentary \"Blackfish\" examined the tragedy and raised the question of whether orcas should be held in captivity. Seaworld acknowledged in its statement today that \"Tilikum's life will always be inextricably connected with the loss of our dear friend and colleague Dawn Brancheau.\" \"While we all experienced profound sadness about that loss, we continued to offer Tilikum the best care possible, each and every day, from the country's leading experts in marine mammals,\" the park said. SeaWorld President and CEO Joel Manby said, \"Tilikum had and will continue to have a special place in the hearts of the SeaWorld family, as well as the millions of people all over the world that he inspired.\" \"My heart goes out to our team who cared for him like family,\" he said.

    "text": "Palestinians, Jordan Warn Trump Over Proposed Move of Israel Embassy to Jerusalem By Ben Gittleson Jan 6, 2017, 1:33 PM ET 0 Shares WATCH President-Elect Donald Trump Sides With Israel After Harsh Diplomatic Words 0 Shares Email Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas today called on President-elect Donald Trump not to go forward with his plan to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \u201cIf he did this, then he would be putting the peace process in a critical situation that he will not get out of, not only in the Middle East but also all over the world,\" Abbas said in Bethlehem in the West Bank. \"We call on you not to implement your statement on the ground or in your agenda because we consider it as an aggressive statement.\" Jordan 's government also issued a warning to Trump over his plans. A spokesman for the Jordanian government told the Associated Press on Thursday that the change would lead to \"catastrophic\" repercussions. Jordan would consider moving the embassy a \"red line\" that would \"inflame the Islamic and Arab streets\" and prove to be a \"gift to extremists,\" Jordan's information minister, Mohammed Momani, said, according to the AP. The United States like most other countries with diplomatic representation in Israel has its embassy in Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital and where its national government is headquartered. Jews, Muslims and Christians all consider Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites among the most important to their respective religions, and Palestinians have called for the eastern part of the city to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. Like any issues around final borders and security arrangements between a Palestinian state and Israel, the status of Jerusalem has remain unresolved in the eyes of the international community. ",

Charles Sykes/AP hide caption toggle caption Om Puri at the New York premiere of The Hundred-Foot Journey on Aug. 4, 2014. Charles Sykes/AP Prolific Indian actor Om Puri, who for decades appeared in films all over the world, has died at age 66 in Mumbai. Reports say Puri suffered a heart attack at his home early on Friday. Puri had roles in more than 300 movies in his career, NPR's Rose Friedman reports for our Newscast unit. Rose says he began acting in Indian art house cinema in the 1970s and soon branched into British and American films, including Gandhi in 1982 and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007. He appeared in the 2013 film The Reluctant Fundamentalist, in which he played a father struggling to pass on a sense of empathy to his Wall Street-employed son. Most recently, he starred alongside Helen Mirren in The Hundred-Foot Journey, a 2015 film about a displaced Indian family that settles in a French village and opens a restaurant. Puri was a crossover star, as evidenced by the breadth of people mourning his death. The BBC reported that even media in Pakistan, with whom India's relationship is often tense, are celebrating his life and career. The BBC wrote, \"[Puri] had recently spoken out against the ban imposed by India on Pakistani actors working in Bollywood films, following tensions over Kashmir,\" telling an Indian TV channel, \"Pakistani artists are not terrorists.\" Article continues after sponsorship In 2004, Puri received an honorary Order of the British Empire, an award established by King George V and given to individuals who have made distinguished contributions in their field. In 1990, he was awarded the Padma Shri , one of India's highest civilian honors, the Guardian wrote. Puri's professional life was wildly successful, but his personal life had been turbulent in recent years. He separated from his wife, Nandita, after she wrote his biography in 2009, called Unlikely Hero: Om Puri . The book revealed explicit details about his sexual forays as a young man. Puri is survived by Nandita, whom he married in 1993, and their son. Less than a month before his death, Puri took to Twitter to reflect on his life and career: I have no regrets at all. I have done quite well for myself. I didn't have a conventional face, but I have done well, and I am proud of it. ",

    "text": "Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan tied to corruption inquiry of Israel's prime minister Arnon Milchan Evan Agostini / Invision Producer Arnon Milchan accepts the Film Tribute Award at the 26th Annual Gotham Independent Film Awards on Nov. 28. Producer Arnon Milchan accepts the Film Tribute Award at the 26th Annual Gotham Independent Film Awards on Nov. 28. (Evan Agostini / Invision) Joshua Mitnick Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, long connected to Israel\u2019s political elite, has emerged as\u00a0among the\u00a0wealthy individuals whose gift-giving to\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under review as part of a corruption investigation. The prime minister is under criminal investigation on suspicion of\u00a0improperly accepting gifts. Police are looking into\u00a0whether Milchan provided Netanyahu with a steady supply of expensive Cuban cigars going back several years, according to reports this week\u00a0in Haaretz newspaper and Israel\u2019s Channel 2 News Television.\u00a0 The cumulative value of Milchan\u2019s cigar gifts to Netanyahu was estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of Israeli shekels, according to the reports.\u00a0Milchan also reportedly provided bottles of Champagne for Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara. Israeli police have declined to discuss Milchan\u2019s involvement in the ongoing criminal investigation, the details of which have not been made public.\u00a0 Netanyahu was interrogated by Israeli police Thursday evening for several hours in regards to\u00a0two separate criminal cases. It was the second time in three days that the prime minister was questioned by police in the graft investigation. Details regarding the second case are unknown to the public. The prime minister\u2019s personal lawyer Friday did not\u00a0deny that Netanyahu had accepted cigars from Milchan, but said there was nothing criminal in doing so. \u201cAny reasonable person knows that there is nothing remotely criminal involved when a close friend gives his friend a gift of cigars,\u201d\u00a0Jacob Weinroth told reporters.\u00a0 Earlier in the week, the prime minister dismissed the police investigation. \u00a0\u201cThere won\u2019t be anything because there isn\u2019t anything,\u201d\u00a0he said. Still, the investigation has directed a spotlight on Milchan, 72, a Tel Aviv-born tycoon whose business interests at one point reportedly\u00a0included 30 companies in 17 countries. He has long wielded influence in politics in the country and abroad, and worked in industries including agribusiness, plastics and weapons. He is considered one of the movie business\u2019 most influential producers,\u00a0yet has remained an elusive figure in Hollywood, and though\u00a0he\u2019s a jet-setting entrepreneur known for his charm,\u00a0he rarely gives interviews to press outlets. Nonetheless, he has earned respect and admiration\u00a0from Hollywood A-listers and studio chiefs. Over his long career, he has made movies\u00a0with the likes of Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone.\u00a0 \u00a0Milchan\u2019s movie credits include \u201cPretty Woman\u201d and \u201cJFK,\u201d as well as recent Oscar winners \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cLook in the dictionary under Renaissance man,\u201d said then-20th Century Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos in a documentary for Israeli\u00a0Channel 2 TV. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a picture of Arnon \u2014\u00a0or you should.\u201d\u00a0 Milchan\u2019s ties to Israeli elite predate his Hollywood successes. As an Israeli businessmen in the 1960s, he befriended Shimon Peres, at the time an up-and-coming politician who played a central role in building Israel\u2019s military-industrial complex. Peres eventually served as prime minister and president of Israel. Milchan worked with\u00a0Israel\u2019s defense establishment to help in weapons procurement and assisted in building up the country\u2019s secret nuclear program.\u00a0In a 2013 interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 2 investigation show \u201cUvda,\u201d he spoke about his past career as a weapons dealer and a participant in covert operations for Israel.\u00a0During the program he described himself as a \u201cJames Bond\u201d for Israel.\u00a0 In addition to Netanyahu and Peres, Milchan counted former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert among his friends. The entertainment executive is listed in the Israeli phone directory as having a residence steps from the Mediterranean coast in the central Israel town of Beit Yanai. A spokesperson for Milchan\u2019s entertainment company, New Regency Productions, declined to comment on the reports of his gift giving. Milchan supplied cigars based on the specifications given by Netanyahu, according to a\u00a0report on Israel\u2019s Channel 2 news Thursday. The cigars cost up to $55 each, and the prime minister might smoke as much as $5,000 worth of cigars a month, according to the report. A statement this week from the office of Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, said a six-month corruption probe into the prime minister\u2019s dealings had been recently upgraded to a criminal investigation. During the course of the probe, Israeli investigators ruled out allegations about improprieties with election financing and funding of the prime minister\u2019s trips abroad. Though the investigation hasn\u2019t undermined his support within his Likud Party or within the coalition\u00a0government, opposition lawmaker Erel Margalit has said the shadow of the criminal investigation will taint the integrity of Netanyahu\u2019s decision-making as prime minister. \u00a0The police inquiry has prompted speculation by political analysts that an indictment could force Netanyahu to resign. Netanyahu is the second consecutive Israeli prime minister to face a criminal police investigation while in office. Olmert was forced to resign from the Israeli premiership in 2008 amid corruption charges, paving the way for the parliamentary elections that led to Netanyahu\u2019s return to power in 2009. Olmert in February began serving a 19-month\u00a0jail term after being convicted\u00a0in 2014\u00a0of\u00a0bribery and obstruction of justice. \u00a0 Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

In a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey last month, Obama described her surprise at being tagged during her husband's first White House campaign as an \"angry black woman.\" \"Wow, where did that come from?\" Obama told Winfrey. \"I thought, 'Let me live my life out loud so that people can then see and then judge for themselves.' \" After eight years in the White House, the first lady has won a favorable judgment from most Americans. She enjoys higher favorability ratings than her husband does. On Friday, she encouraged young people to be focused and determined, not afraid. \"When people see us for who we truly are, maybe, just maybe they, too, will be inspired to rise to their best possible selves,\" Obama said. With her voice breaking, Obama recalled how her own father worked hard at a city water plant, hoping that one day his children would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed of. \"That's the kind of hope that every single one of us \u2014 politicians, parents, preachers, all of us \u2014 need to be providing for our young people,\" Obama said. \"Because that is what moves this country forward every single day. Our hope for the future and the hard work that hope inspires.\" \"That's my final message to young people as first lady,\" she said as the audience in the White House East Room stood and applauded. \"Lead by example with hope, never fear. And know that I will be with you, rooting for you and working to support you for the rest of my life.\" ",

I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan,\u201d Mr. Trump said during an eight-minute telephone conversation. \u201cThey are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it\u2019s a witch hunt. They just focus on this.\u201d In fact, Mr. Trump won more counties than any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan, according to a PolitiFact analysis citing data from the Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections. The president-elect also noted the news this week, first reported by BuzzFeed News, that the D.N.C. had refused to give the F.B.I. access to its computer servers after it was hacked. Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cThe D.N.C. wouldn\u2019t let them see the servers,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHow can you be sure about hacking when you can\u2019t even get to the servers?\u201d The D.N.C. has previously said that the law enforcement agency had not asked to examine the computers. A senior law enforcement official said the F.B.I. had repeatedly emphasized to the D.N.C. the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data. The F.B.I. was rebuffed and had to rely upon a third party \u2014 a computer security firm brought in by the D.N.C. \u2014 for information. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Learn More Mr. Trump also said that the hacking of emails from the D.N.C. and top campaign officials for Mrs. Clinton had revealed that she received advance notice of debate questions and \u201cmany, many other things that were horrible.\u201d \u201cHow come nobody complains about that?\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to a tip that a CNN commentator and Clinton supporter, Donna Brazile, gave to Mr. Podesta ahead of a Democratic Party presidential debate in Flint, Mich. Mr. Trump said he was looking forward to his meeting Friday afternoon about the hacking with Mr. Clapper; James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and other intelligence officials. He said that Mr. Clapper \u201cwrote me a beautiful letter a few weeks ago wishing me the best.\u201d But he said that \u201ca lot of mistakes were made\u201d by the intelligence community in the past, noting in particular the attacks on the World Trade Center and saying that \u201cweapons of mass destruction was one of the great mistakes of all time.\u201d In a later post on Twitter, Mr. Trump also expressed his frustration that details about an intelligence report on the Russia hacking were reported by news organizations late Thursday afternoon. The Washington Post, NBC and other organizations quoted unnamed officials who said the report documented intercepts showing Russian officials celebrating Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory. I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. \u2014         Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 6, 2017 In the earlier interview, the president-elect said that he was eager to work with the intelligence community as president, and he praised the people he selected to lead the intelligence agencies, in particular Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, who is his pick to lead the C.I.A. He said that Mr. Pompeo was \u201cfirst in his class\u201d at West Point. \u201cWe have great people going into those slots,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cI expect to have a very, very good relationship with them.\u201d Adam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington.

The wallop is forecast to deliver heavy snow in some areas, while freezing rain will make for dangerous driving conditions in others. The brunt of the storm is expected to come Friday afternoon and night. Sometime after 2 p.m. ET Friday, snow will start falling in Charlotte, North Carolina, where 4 to 8 inches of snow is possible, and in Raleigh, North Carolina, where 6 to 8 inches of snow is forecast. In Atlanta, 2 to 4 inches of snow and sleet are expected beginning Friday afternoon, with the heaviest falling overnight into Saturday morning. Norfolk, Virginia, was expecting an even heavier dump of snow, with 6 to 12 inches of snow and sleet possible starting after 8 p.m. Friday. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for Friday into Saturday, from eastern Alabama through north Georgia, the Carolinas, and part of Virginia. \"The heaviest snow begins overnight tonight,\" TODAY meteorologist Al Roker said Friday. \"The snow will mix with sleet and rain. In fact, ice is going to be a problem.\" Remembering the 2014 ice storm that paralyzed Atlanta, Georgia and Alabama issued emergency declarations. The storm was already being blamed for a driving fatality in Kentucky on Thursday. Lucinda Anderson and her daughter Shaye Rabold walk through falling snow in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on Thursday, Jan. 5, 2017. Austin Anthony / Daily News via AP Georgia authorities advised residents in the northern half of the state to get enough food and water to last at least three days. \"We're looking at a significant event,\" said Sue Loeffler, director of the state Emergency Management Agency. \"Go to the grocery store now.\" High Impact winter storm coming together across southeast.

Some closed early Thursday, too. The storm comes after whiteout conditions buried parts of the Northeast under more than a foot of snow and created whiteout conditions. Light snow continued in parts of the Northeast Friday morning. After deluging the South, the storm will barrel toward the Northeast, clipping the Atlantic City area, the tip of Long Island, and Nantucket. Boston could get up to 5 inches and New York City could see 1 to 3 inches through Saturday evening, forecasters said. Nationwide, 32 states and 73 million people from coast to coast are under winter advisories, warnings and watches Friday. In the West, up to 5 feet of snow covered parts of the Sierra and Rocky Mountains this week, causing delays and cancellations at the Denver airport. And in drought-stricken southern California, much-needed rain fell \u2014 but it left one man stranded in the swollen Los Angeles River in Silver Lake Thursday, forcing a swift-water rescue, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. In the South, where big winter storms come once in a blue moon, officials warned people to prepare for the worst. \"This can potentially be a historic weather event,\" Michael Thurmond, chief executive of DeKalb County in metro Atlanta, said Thursday. Nervous residents heeded the warning. \"I have no idea why, but people are acting like complete jackasses when they hear that there is snow in the forecast,\" Sherrill Suitt Craig, who lives in Raleigh, told the AP after traveling a town over to go grocery shopping because her local market was too crowded. \"I was just doing my regular shopping.\" Elizabeth Chuck ",

Jeff Sessions to block his confirmation. The senator, who has a history of racist behavior, has been picked by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as U.S. attorney general. Facebook comments edited for clarity and grammar: The NAACP either needs a massive makeover\u2014from a name change to updated priorities\u2014or to simply cease operating.

A bunch of white guys who don't want to pay their grazing fees take over federal land and are labeled\u00a0patriot heroes!

Keep in mind the police are rarely there to protect you when you need them. When you need immediate help, the police are minutes away. An armed society is a polite society. Before all of the anti gunners go ballistic over my comments, remember that the most worrisome crimes are committed by people who should have been restricted or prohibited from owning or possessing firearms, such as drug dealers, criminal gang members\u00a0and convicted felons.\u00a0 Chicago still has some of the strictest restrictions on citizens legally owning and carrying firearms. This past year has proven the gangs and criminals have not been abiding any laws concerning firearms, but that is not surprising. The past year has proven gun restrictions, on law abiding citizens, does nothing to curb crime. What is needed is greater control over the criminals, not gun control over citizens. \u2014 Mitch Fortier If this video is\u00a0real,\u00a0then these people should not see the real world for a long time. \u2014 Tim Albin We have had worse race relations since President Obama has been in office.

A Florida Highway Patrol trooper found the bodies of Daniel Kelsey, 32, and his wife, Heather Kelsey, 30, about 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 31, said Sgt. Kime Montes. She said the trooper was patrolling the stretch of highway that morning and had not seen the SUV when he passed by some 30 minutes earlier. Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told The Daytona Beach News-Journal on Thursday that the autopsies found no signs of trauma or foul play. He added that Daniel Kelsey tested \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d for drugs and had a \u201cpresence of weed\u201d in his urine. The medical examiner\u2019s office hasn\u2019t issued a cause of death because toxicology reports are pending. Chitwood said those reports may show other substances the couple may have taken. Investigators said it\u2019s unclear how the Kelsey family wound up stopping on the right paved shoulder of eastbound I-4. The hazard lights on the maroon Ford Freestyle were blinking when the trooper found it. Inside, he found the boys - Aiden, 2, Nicholas, 1, and infant Joseph - watching a movie, Chitwood said. The Ormond Beach residents were traveling home from Quincy in the Florida Panhandle. Authorities said relatives of Daniel Kelsey are taking care of the children. John Harrell, spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, told the newspaper the agency is working with local authorities. \u201cWe\u2019re very sensitive to what these children have been through,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main priority.\u201d \u00a9 2017 The Associated Press.

Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson speaks during a news conference Thursday on the charges filed against the four individuals suspected in the kidnapping and beating of a disabled man that was captured in a Facebook video. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) John Kass Contact Reporter There's a lot to unpack from Chicago's latest racial outrage, the Facebook Torture Case, and it's ugly, so let's get to it. You know the news. Four African-Americans were charged Thursday with hate crimes in the alleged kidnapping and torture of a bound, white and mentally disabled young man. Police said they beat him, forced him to drink toilet water, jabbed at him with a knife and cut his scalp, shouting \"F---white people!\" and \"F--- [ Donald] Trump !\" and laughing while smoking blunts and streaming it all live on Facebook. I watched some, not all of that video, the way they brutalized that young man, the terror in his eyes, hearing their laughter. And I realized these were human beings, amusing themselves with the pain of a mentally disabled man. There are many words for this, but irredeemable is the one that comes to mind. Beating of disabled teen captured on Facebook Live Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) See more videos And when Chicago's top cop talked of it, he said something worth considering again. \"It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that,\" said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson . \"It still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't. I'm not going to say it shocked me, but it was sickening.\" Johnson's been a cop in Chicago for decades, so he's seen worse. We haven't, but he and other police have. With City Hall pushing body cameras for all police, I figure the rest of us should soon be able to see what cops see, at the crime scene, with all the brutality that we try to shield ourselves from. Because cops work in that world where people do such things to each other. Where criminals laugh and inflict pain, on babies, old people, anyone. Most of the rest of us haven't been to that place and we'd be psychologically damaged if we did. There are other elements of this heater case that should be acknowledged, like the politics of this thing. It's crawling with politics now. ",

Some Democratic House members attempted to object to some states Electoral College votes to protest the election results. But their objections went nowhere because they were unable to gain the support of a senator, per the rules. Despite protests, the final vote tally was: Donald Trump: 304 electoral votes Hillary Clinton: 227 Ohio Gov. John Kasich: 1 Former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas: 1 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: 1 Faith of Spotted Eagle: 1 Democrats objected 11 times, citing a variety of issues, including \"Russian interference,\" \"massive voter suppression\" and the \"violation of the Voting Rights Act.\" Vice President Joe Biden, who sat in the chair and presided over the 41 minute-long process in the House chamber, attempted to speed through the objections. After the third objection and the third time Biden asked if a senator had signed on, Biden said, \"it is over.\" But a handful of Democratic House members continued to object during specific states and tried to continue their speeches even after Biden gaveled them down and said debate is not allowed. After the states were counted, three citizens in the audience gallery stood up to demonstrate. At one point, Rep. Maxine Watters, D-Calif., stood and asked for a senator to join them. Only four Democratic senators attended the ceremony. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said it was \"embarrassing\" for House Democrats that they couldn't get a senator to join the protest. But he added that Republicans were prepared in case an objection succeeded. \"Senator McConnell made clear that people needed to delay their trip home in order to be here in case there was a need to vote,\" Cornyn said. \"That's why we were all in town.\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said she was not encouraging objections but that she would \"support\" them. \"I think people don't want the day to pass without registering concerns,\" she told reporters Friday. \"In some cases, members are concerned about voter suppression, in some cases they are concerned about Russian influence on our election. There are a number of concerns. But it's not going to have an impact at the end of the day.\" Every objection must be made in writing and signed by one member of the House and one senator. In 2001, when Democrats objected after the contested election between George Bush and Vice President Al Gore, no senator joined an objection then either. During that process, Gore, as vice-president, presided over the process. Leigh Ann Caldwell ",

A U.S. Border Patrol vehicle waits at a fence opening near the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. (John Moore / Getty Images) Noah Bierman , Brian Bennett and Noah Bierman Contact Reporters Republicans in Congress are beginning to grapple with how to\u00a0help President-elect Donald Trump fulfill one of his biggest campaign promises: to build a wall along the Mexican border to slow illegal immigration. Trump is expected to ask Congress to provide the initial funding for the massive project, estimated to cost between $12 billion and $38 billion. Once construction gets underway, Trump has said he will demand\u00a0reimbursement from the Mexican government, even though Mexican officials have said they will refuse to cooperate. Amid concerns\u00a0American taxpayers would shoulder the burden, Trump promised Friday that he would force the U.S. neighbor\u00a0to pony up the money. \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he tweeted. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox responded on Twitter,\u00a0\u201cTrump may ask whoever he wants, but still neither myself nor Mexico are going to pay for his racist monument. Another promise he can't keep.\u201d Meanwhile Republicans were\u00a0scrambling\u00a0Friday\u00a0to figure out how to provide initial support for the wall, despite\u00a0opposition from Democrats and resistance from budget conservatives in their own party. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone believed the government of Mexico was going to write a giant check to the federal registry, but there are other ways to ensure Mexico does pay for the border buildout,\u201d said Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. \u201cThere are broad conversations about fulfilling all of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises.\u201d An aide to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said no new talks are underway with the Trump transition team on the border issue.\u00a0But Trump\u2019s transition team acknowledged that they would seek help from lawmakers. \u201cObviously a centerpiece of Donald Trump\u2019s successful campaign was, \u2018I\u2019m going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it,\u2019\u201d said advisor Kellyanne Conway on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed, but Congress is examining ways to have the wall paid for through their auspices and Mr. Trump is making the point that he will have Mexico pay it back.\u201d During the campaign, Trump suggested that if Mexico did not agree to pay for the wall, the U.S. might impose a fee on financial remittances sent home by Mexicans working in the U.S. illegally. Such a move would surely provoke opposition from the financial services industry. Messer said another possibility would be raising some of the funds, about $4 billion, by cutting a child tax break for immigrants here illegally.\u00a0 The president-elect\u00a0has also suggested the U.S.\u00a0could try to pressure Mexico by\u00a0reducing or slowing down the process by which Mexicans get travel cards and visitors' visas.\u00a0 The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, parent for the Border Patrol, has already budgeted\u00a0$175 million for \"procurement, construction and improvements.\" But even if that money is diverted to the wall, it wouldn't be nearly enough. On Capitol Hill, Republicans noted that\u00a0President George W. Bush signed a 2006 law that authorizes construction of a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. It was\u00a0passed by a Republican-led Congress, with support from now Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and other Democrats. But it\u00a0did not provide the needed funding. Trump has estimated a wall would cost up to $12 billion to build. But it could be more than triple that, $38 billion, according to an analysis published by MIT Technology Review. That\u2019s equal to the entire annual budget for the Department of Homeland Security. The difference depends on the type of the fencing \u2014 \u00a0double versus single layer, for example \u2014 \u00a0and how much of the border the wall covers. Republicans said one scenario would be to link new border funds to a must-pass bill to keep the government running past April 28. Such a legislative maneuver would force Democrats, who mostly oppose border funding absent broader immigration law changes, to join the vote or run the risk of a springtime government shutdown. \u201cThey would have a hard time going home and explaining why they voted against it,\u201d said one Republican leadership aide, granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations. But the strategy could backfire if Republican deficit hawks raise concerns about adding to the debt load. It is unclear if Trump will propose\u00a0offsetting any wall construction costs with spending cuts elsewhere. A spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee said the Trump team has not submitted a funding request for the wall. \u201cThe chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \"The committee has not received any request from the Trump team or leadership on this issue. If and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it.\u201d This is not the first time Trump has indicated that U.S. taxpayers would front the costs. During an October speech in Gettysburg, Pa., in which he outlined promises for his first 100 days in office, Trump said he would ask Congress to approve legislation that fully funds a wall. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said at the time.\u00a0\"Remember, I said Mexico is paying for the wall, with the full understand[ing] that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, OK?\" Caption Kanye West at Trump Tower Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met\u00a0in the Trump Tower lobby on Tuesday morning.

Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., talks to reporters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Donald Trump is still two weeks from his presidential inauguration, but new Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer sounds ready to do battle with a Republican-controlled Senate, House and White House. \"We're going to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire,\" the New York Democrat told NPR's Audie Cornish on All Things Considered while sitting in front of the fireplace near his desk. \"Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable.\" We're going to hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire. Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Jan. 6, 2017 Schumer hasn't quite moved into his suite of Capitol offices. Boxes are heaped in corridors and naked hooks poke from the walls of Schumer's ornate chambers on the second floor. Just outside the windows is the inaugural podium being built and beyond it, the National Mall. Inside, amid the clutter, the new Senate minority leader is wasting no time defending Democratic policies and programs from the incoming administration and its congressional allies, even if he has less leverage than he had hoped to have. Schumer hinted at the Democrats' relatively weak position, as Republicans move quickly to repeal Obamacare. He repeatedly said Democrats would not cooperate with any Affordable Care Act replacement if the GOP pushes ahead with repeal, but then allowed that \"there might be a thing or two\" in competing Republican plans he finds appealing. He also brought negotiations into the open by putting public pressure on GOP senators from Maine and Alaska to vote against repeal. Article continues after sponsorship 'Dawn Of A New Unified Republican Government' Coming In 2017 \"Now they want to eliminate the funding of Planned Parenthood,\" he said, referring to a plan by House Speaker Paul Ryan to include such provisions in legislation undoing Obamacare, \"so people like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are having some qualms about this.\" FACT CHECK: Once Again, Lawmakers Are Stretching The Facts On Obamacare Schumer hinted at some of the legislative maneuvers Democrats may employ to stymie Obamacare repeal. \"We'll have an amendment on the floor of the Senate, as we debate ACA,\" he explained, \"that quotes Donald Trump and says we're opposed to cutting health care \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for that matter.\" I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015 Before his intelligence briefing today, the president-elect told the New York Times that the attention devoted to Russian attempts to influence the election is \"a political witch hunt.\" Schumer called that \"flip and glib.\" On Intelligence And Russian Hacking, Are Trump And His Team Missing The Point? \"Before you even get the briefing, you come to a conclusion \u2014 that's not the way to govern,\" he said. \"And I have said ... that we can't have a Twitter presidency. This is serious stuff, this governing, and to just be flip and glib and tweet ... you've got to do a lot more. And certainly any president \u2014 Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative \u2014 should keep an open mind until they get the briefing.\" Schumer also responded to Trump's calling him a \"clown.\" The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 \"I didn't tweet back a name \u2014 that's derogating the debate,\" Schumer said. \"I said I understand your anguish, Mr. President-elect, because you don't know what to replace the ACA with. But instead of calling names, roll up your sleeves and come up with a replacement. So I'm not going to descend to name-calling.\" ",

The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man. The Chicago Tribune edited this video to protect the victim's identity and for time. (Warning: Contains graphic content) It didn't take long for the emails to arrive, as I expected. \"Chicago hate crime today against Trump !\" said one. \"Let's see your column justify that one.\" He was writing about the big news of the day, the \"Facebook torture case,\" as some called it. The case involved the kidnapping and torture \u2014 streamed live on Facebook \u2014 of a white teenager with special needs, allegedly by two 18-year-old black men and two black sisters, 18 and 24. The four suspects were each charged Thursday with aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and a hate crime. One of the men also was charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, while the two sisters were charged with residential burglary, police said. Justify? Why would I want to \"justify\" such barbaric bullying? Why would I want to excuse the barbarism that compelled the young people in that video to laugh lustily as they drank alcohol, smoked blunts, cut out a piece of their victim's scalp and forced him to drink from a toilet bowl? I have no sympathy for the young idiots who can be heard spouting racial epithets and obscene remarks about President-elect Donald Trump and \"white people\" in general. They could not have produced a more effective video insult to hard-working, law-abiding black Americans if they tried. Four people have been charged with a hate crime in an attack on a man\u00a0with mental disabilities. The attack was recorded on Facebook Live. In that vein, I brace myself whenever a high-profile violent crime is committed by an African-American. I know I'm going to hear from a certain grouchy subset of trolls, energized in part by the notion that black people are getting away with too much or only getting ahead at the expense of white people. As my Southern-born mother used to say, bless their hearts. You can't lift yourself up, she would say, by keeping somebody else down. Yet, once race enters a crime story, especially a brutally vicious crime like this one that crosses racial lines, so does an ugly brand of racial politics. Shortly after the Facebook video spread on social media, for example, it was followed by social media comments \u2014 unsupported, it turned out \u2014 that the attackers belonged to the well-known anti-police-brutality movement known as Black Lives Matter . The problem with that allegation is that Chicago police said there was no evidence to back it up and DeRay Mckesson, a leading Black Lives Matter organizer, said such violent acts never have been the organization's intention. Yet the hashtag #BLMKidnapping continued to trend on Twitter, helped along by Glenn Beck , Twitter activists and some other voices for conventional conservatism and the \"alt-right,\" a snazzy new-wave label for old-school white supremacy. After all, the more attention they put on Black Lives Matter, deserved or not, the less attention goes to the police conduct issues that the protest movement is trying to raise \u2014 ostensibly not to bash police but to improve policing. Unfortunately, there are many ways to profit by feeding public anger, fears, resentments and suspicions. You can even win elections sometimes. You can see evidence of today's racial divide in polls like the one taken in late November by YouGov and the liberal Huffington Post. It found that a commanding 84 percent of Hillary Clinton voters thought black people face \"a lot of discrimination\" in the United States today, compared with 22 percent of Trump voters. With such stark differences in political attitudes, it is no wonder that a July Washington Post/ABC News poll found 63 percent of adults said race relations are in bad shape, up from 48 in a Pew Research survey last spring. Scene of Facebook Live attack Police say an apartment on Chicago's West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) Police say an apartment on Chicago's West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people. (Phil Velasquez/Chicago Tribune) See more videos We would be making a mistake if we try to blame all of that on Barack Obama, the outgoing president told Jay Levine from Chicago's CBS affiliate in a White House interview. It is not that racial tensions have gotten worse, he said, but smartphones and the internet bring the ugliest episodes of different communities to a wider audience than ever before. \"I think the overall trajectory of race relations in this country is actually very positive,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean that all racial problems have gone away. It means that we have the capacity to get better.\" Sure, he's protecting his legacy, but he's got a point. Unfortunately too many people don't seem to want us to get better. They'd rather complain.
